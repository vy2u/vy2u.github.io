you're new my name is Tasha
welcome sorry if my hair is a mess I was
way too lazy to do it and I just came
out of a midterm and was not even in the
mental state to do my hair so yeah
anyways going off of midterms this video
is going to have to do with college but
not necessarily the academic part of
college this is going to be in my
opinion the wardrobe essentials that you
need for college I know a few other
people have done similar videos to this
but I was getting so many video requests
to do it and I think everyone has their
own opinions of what you need and what
you need based on what school you go to
be flying into the video I want to give
you guys a little tip for shopping smart
and saving your money because I know as
a college student you seriously don't
have money so basically this video is
sponsored by a website called shop tiger
I'm gonna tell you guys a little bit
about it because I do use it and I think
it's super helpful if you're like me and
you like saving money okay so basically
what shop Tiger is is a website that
allows you to install a button so this
little button you see in the right hand
corner and then when you're shopping on
websites you can click the button it'll
save the items that you want and tell
you when they go on sale so I'm going to
show you a lot of the stores that shop
Tiger works with there's so many stores
and today I think I'm gonna pick a low
yoga just because it's one of my
favorite brands and it's a little bit
pricey so I like to shop those sales so
I'm just clicking on a low yoga and it's
just going to take me directly to their
website where I can browse like I'd
normally would
and I really really like the look of
this cropped hoodie here so I'm gonna
click on this I actually have those
leggings with it so it would be perfect
but it's a little bit pricey so I'm
gonna click this button right up here
the shop tiger button and then I'm gonna
select the hoodie I want in the size and
then I'm gonna say when I want shop
tiger to notify me so if I want it for
any price change or a specific
percentage and then if you have any
lists made on shop tiger you can add it
to a specific list so then once I've
saved the item I go back over to shop
tiger and I can see that it's saved in
my saved items over here if I want to
share my list my friends so they see
what I'm wanting I can totally do that
as well but I think shop tiger is super
awesome and you guys should totally
totally check it out yes if you guys
want to shop any of these essentials for
college totally check out shop tiger
it's honestly great if you guys want to
save money and if you guys want to get
to know me on a more personal basis feel
free to follow me on my Instagram
it's just Tasha dot varsity and then
I'll put my other handles like Twitter
and snapchat down below as well okay so
now I'm going to get into the wardrobe
essentials if you guys have any more
ideas
for what you consider essential totally
leave them in the comments down below
okay so my first college wardrobe
essential is a college crewneck for your
college so this is my favorite USC
crewneck this one is vintage I got it on
Poshmark
if you guys are into more vintage kind
of things totally check it out for your
school or whatnot this is what this one
looks like but I totally have some from
the book store as well just classic food
X I like hoon X better than hoodies I
don't know why I think they're more
comfortable but whatever floats your
boat it's just great seriously you're
gonna find yourself wearing these so
often when you're studying in the
library or you just want to be comfy and
it's always great to show your school
spirit and I always end up wearing these
to the airport because I always love
showing off that I'm a USC student so
yeah totally pick up some crewnecks for
your college they're the best okay the
next item is a solid pair of leggings I
know these are probably a must for
everyone not just for college but I had
to throw them in here so basically my
favorite pair of black leggings are
these ones from
let me in there kind of signing the pill
but basically I just love high-waisted
black leggings I think these are the
high x pant so they're like 7/8 lengths
I'm really short and I heat in my
leggings so I call bunchy at the bottom
so yeah these are like I said my
favorite you're gonna want a nice pair
because you're gonna wearing these all
the time especially with those College
4x so I think it's great to invest in a
nice pair of black leggings that you
know you're gonna wear every day
hopefully not every day maybe every day
that I'm gonna be sifu yeah so yeah okay
my next item is cute basic crop tops I
don't really have tangible examples
because I feel like this kind of depends
on your style what you think is cute but
like the one I'm wearing right now is a
cute basic crop top in my opinion the
reason that I think these are important
is because these are what I always wear
when I'm going out if I don't know what
to wear
I always just pick a crop top and wear
some sort of high-waisted bottom with it
so yeah these do not have to be
expensive at all forever 21 literally
has so many affordable options you can
get cute crop tops anywhere but
seriously have like a solid 3 or 4 or 5
because you will wear them all the time
I swear okay the next item that I think
is super necessary is a pair of going
out shoes or frat shoes basically any
pair of basic closed-toe shoes that you
don't care about getting dirty or
trashed I would show you mine right now
but one night like recently I was coming
home from going out and my shoes were so
disgusting that I just left them on the
front porch of the house that I'm living
in and the next day someone had stolen
them don't ask me why they're cheap and
gross and dirty but someone stole them
so I don't have fresh shoes right now
don't feel like you need to get you know
name-brand shoes like converse or adidas
or anything like that like you can
literally go to Walmart or Target and
get their generic brand white shoes or
whatever colored shoes you want no one
is looking at your feet when you're out
it like frat parties you
I mean so yeah just a pair of cheap
shoes you don't really care about
getting dirty and gross okay the next
thing that I would consider an essential
is a pair of slippers and there's a
variety of reasons for this so if you're
living in a dorm and you have to like
walk down the hallway to go to the
bathroom or anything you're gonna want
slippers I mean you could just get like
flip-flops or something easy to put on
but slippers are way more comfortable
and I think they're cute and I would
like an excuse to wear slippers also my
slippers have tread on the bottom so I
can wear these outside so whenever I go
to the library or anywhere to study I'm
like always wearing these slippers these
are slippers I'll try and link them down
below if I can find them but yeah
they're so comfortable and they're so
perfect for studying or if you just want
to be cozy or if you're walking around
your dorm or apartment or whatever I
totally would recommend a pair of
slippers and if you want to be a lazy
bum and wear them out get ones with
tread on the bottom okay my next
essential is a jacket or a sweater that
goes with everything because let me tell
you classrooms get so cold it could be
like 90 degrees out and I swear my
classroom is like the Arctic tundra so
just grab a jacket or a sweater and put
in your bag that matches most things if
you get cold in class or sometimes so I
am like blabbing sometimes if you have a
class that starts like midday or it ends
later at night it'll be like hot when
you go in and Colden you get out so
here's an example I love denim jackets
this one's cute Matthews most things
doesn't have to be a denim jacket just
example of something that I would bring
but you know any sort of sweater or
cardigan sweatshirt jacket works just
have a solid a staple one that you liked
away with a lot about bits okay the next
item is some sort of inexpensive
crossbody bag the reason for this is if
you're going out at night you want to
bring a bag with you but you don't want
to bring anything super valuable in case
you lose it or something gets spilled on
it or anything like that
so just get a crossbody bag that goes
with a lot that you don't mind wearing
but also isn't super expensive so if it
gets ruined you won't care I will link
any recommendations I have down below
but like I said just check out for every
one you want
target or anything like that because
it's the same with the shoes no one's
really gonna be looking at your bag when
you're at a party so I literally see
girls wearing their yxl bags to frat
parties and I just question humanity
okay the next thing is also kind of
generic but it's just a really good well
fitting pair of jeans I wear jeans
almost every day I think I wear jeans
maybe more than leggings I don't know I
just really really love jeans I wear
jeans to class I wear jeans going out I
wear jeans on the weekend it's just
really great to have a solid pair of
jeans in case you guys are wondering my
favorite style of genes are the Jaime
jeans from Topshop I'll link those down
below in case you're interested but
they're high-waisted and then ankle
length so yeah I just find those to be
the most flattering and like I said I
wear them at all times
okay the next thing I would recommend is
your favorite type of hat or some sort
of hat so this is because everyone's
gonna have those days where you probably
should have showered and washed your
hair but you fell asleep you were too
lazy you didn't think your hair would
look that crazy in the morning then you
wake up and surprise your hair looks
like someone dumped a bottle of oil on
it so hats say that Oller I don't know
let me know if this is just me but
sometimes if my hair is styled nicely
like fit straight and really nicely or
curl really nicely but it's just a
little bit greasy I'll just put a hat on
so you can still see my hair but you
can't tell it to you see I I don't know
if that's only me but in that
circumstance I love baseball caps I just
got this one so that's why I'm showing
you this one I think it's pretty cute
let me know what you guys think I got
this from Topshop but it's my favorite
color
I'm not gonna lie I'm not a baseball fan
so this is not really relevant to me
except that I'm from New York so yeah
but yeah my hair abruzzi right now you
would never know if you guys live in
cooler climates lucky you you guys get
to whip out the beanies I still without
beanies because I love them I think
they're so cute
this one is my
this is also from Topshop so go Topshop
with the hats but I love beanies so much
I think everyone looks really cute in
them so all even wear this when it's
like sixty degrees out which is probably
pretty weird but you know
yeah and colleges at least I don't think
most mine don't have hat rules and
classes we can wear hats whenever we
want so take advantage of that don't
wash your hair okay the next item is
some sort of simple black dress I
promise you you will need this try not
to make it too or to formal
because if it's somewhere in between you
can use it probably for both depending
on how you style it for example if you
get invited to like a fraternity formal
or something like that you'll have a
black dress if you get invited to a
theme party and you don't know what to
wear so you were a black dress and then
something else to go to the theme there
you go if you want to wear a black dress
to class put like a flannel or a jacket
over it good to go I feel like a black
dress staple once again I will link some
examples down below if you guys are
interested in seeing what I think is
cute but yeah I feel like once I get in
a black dress everyone needs it not just
in college but especially in college
you'll use it okay the next item is a
basic pair of heels these are the ones
that I have and the reason I recommend
these is kind of for the same reason
just something that goes with everything
that isn't too risque like I wouldn't
say have your basic pair of heels be
like 6 inches with a huge platform okay
no but something like this I feel like
it's pretty standard goes with a lot its
classy so you can wear this once again
to like invites or you could also wear
this to like sorority events or probably
got to class unless you really want to
look cute these are the Steve Maddens
Bessy I think it's what they are and
they're so cute but I'm gonna tell you
these are so uncomfortable hope so if
you're walking really far I don't
necessarily recommend these but just
something similar in style I think is
good and it's just what I think is cute
but definitely
playing a pair of heels I would say
black renew'd I have both but whichever
you prefer it's definitely a must-have
and you probably will use them okay and
then the very last item I have on the
list is themed clothes or costumes or
anything like that I don't know if this
is just USC probably isn't but majority
of the frat parties thrown or like
events and exchanges are themed so you
know there'll be like jungle themed
America themed I don't know there's
different themes so basically I need
clothing you have that could go with a
theme or that you've worn for Halloween
in the past or anything like that forget
to college because you'll be surprised
when you use it or when other people are
looking for things like that so anything
you have that's like animal print or
camo or I'm trying to think of popular
themes bring like bunny ears bring cat
yours
you know anything that's wild and crazy
and you would look at it and be like oh
I'm never gonna wear this bring it yeah
so I think that's everything on my list
once again if you guys want to add
anything to this list for your specific
school or anything you think I've left
out totally you feel free to do so in
the comments also be sure to check out
the shop tagger if you guys want to save
money and who doesn't want to save money
so check out shop tiger I love you guys
so much and thanks for watching
