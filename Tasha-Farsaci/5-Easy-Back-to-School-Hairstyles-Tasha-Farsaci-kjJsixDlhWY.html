hey guys
today I have a very exciting video for
you I know you guys absolutely love my
hairstyle tutorials video and stuff like
that so I decided that I would do one
for you guys as you can tell by the
title this is going to be a
back-to-school hairstyles but you can do
these hairstyles whenever I just know
that sense back-to-school time is
approaching it would be a video that a
lot of people would be looking for as
you can see I have very long hair and
it's straight for this video but you can
do most of these with any hair type or
texture or length unless you really
don't have like any hair at all but I
left my hair straight for this video
because I wanted it to be easiest for
you guys to see the styles and I feel
like straight hair makes it a lot easier
I know I'm gonna get a lot of questions
about my tapestry behind me it's from
eBay all you have to do is search
tapestry on eBay and a bunch to come up
and that's how I found mine so yeah for
these hairstyles all you need is a brush
some hair ties some mini hair ties and
some bobby pins I like the large bobby
pins I have these like big ones like
this but you can use any size I just
have a lot of hair as you can tell us so
I like using these big ones without
further ado I'm gonna get right into the
video
okay so basically I'm just French
braiding my hair all the way down into a
normal French braid if you don't really
know how to do this you can look up
another tutorial I don't really go over
it here but that is all I'm doing I'm
French braiding and once again all the
way down my hair and as far as I can go
and then I'm just going to be securing
it with an elastic okay once I get to
the bottom of my hair I'm just gonna
secure it with a little clear elastic
you can use a hair tie I just like these
because then they don't show and you're
not able to see them but you can use or
whatever you want
okay so once the French braid is done
I'm gonna be wrapping the braid around
itself into a low bun that's the base of
my neck and basically and my bun is
quite big because I have long hair if
you don't have as long of hair as mine
your bun probably won't be as big but
you can kind of work with what you have
and then I'm just pinning my bun into
place with bobby pins
this is what the front looks like so I
just like to kind of take down a few
pieces because I don't like booking so
like formal or whatever so I just kind
of pull a few pieces out from the front
and then loosen this just a little bit
yeah but that is it I think it's so cute
okay this next hairstyle is very simple
but it's one of my favorites and I don't
have to voice this out over because I'm
not having my back to you basically it's
just my simple top knot I do this at
least twice a week you guys have been
asking me how to do it so I figured I
would throw it in here because I've read
this to school like all the time the
first thing you want to do is just put
your hair like up in your hand so you're
gonna do a ponytail depending on where
you do this ponytail is where your top
knot is gonna be you can do it lower you
can do it as high as I'm doing it it
doesn't matter you know whatever you
want your bun position to be okay so
once you get to this point what I like
to do it is just kind of twist my
ponytail a little bit and then I will
twist it around itself like so and I
tend to not twist the end and just kind
of wrap it and then once I get it all
twisted I kind of take my hair tie and I
go around twice so you could leave it
like this but I like to kind of fix it
and mess with it a little bit to get out
how I like it and then I add some bobby
pins just for some added security so I'm
just gonna play with it a little bit and
then like I said take my bobby pins and
kind of just pin it to my head a little
more because my hair is really thick and
it will fall out of this bone otherwise
okay so once I do this I just kind of
play with the hair in the front I'll
pull it out a little bit cuz I don't
want anything tight to my head and then
like I did in the last hairstyle I'll
just pull out some pieces from the front
to frame my face and add a little bit of
a more
like Messi kind of I'm I honestly
bulbous hairstyle I think it suits
everyone it's really great if you want
to show off like the back of a dress or
something for this hairstyle you're
gonna start with your hair just down and
you're gonna go from the side that most
of your hair is on if you have a middle
part you can choose whatever the side
you want but most of my hair is on the
side of my head so I'm gonna start from
that side basically what I'm gonna do is
it got spray it and if you don't know
what a Dutch braid is it's basically a
French braid you're do for your braiding
and you're adding hair and as you go but
instead of crossing the pieces over one
another you're bringing them underneath
and you'll kind of see what I mean once
I start the hair tutorial I'm gonna
start off by taking this much hair from
the front section of my head and I'm
gonna start braiding but as you can see
instead of doing your normal braid and
bringing the strands over one another
I'm going to be bringing them under so
this one would normally go over we're
bringing it under the middle section and
then the same with the other one and
after this first little round I'm gonna
start adding hair in so I'm adding on to
the first bringing it under heading
bringing it under and you want to kind
of direct this braid back and behind
your ear so that's what I'm doing and
some
Thunder handsome Thunder okay so once I
found two here I'm gonna break down
normally as far as I can so once you
have on here you're gonna take the rest
of your hair from the other side now and
I'll bring you over to the sides of
braids on you're gonna bring the braid
back kind of to where you want it and
you're gonna bring the rest of the hair
into a little side pony now if you want
to leave the braid in the ponytail you
can that's why I said you don't really
have to go all the way down I am
actually probably not gonna leave the
braid in so I'm gonna take that elastic
back out and undo the braid son of what
I like to do once I'm at this point is
kind of pulled us braid apart and make
it look a lot bigger and more voluminous
so as you can see I'm just gonna kind of
pull the outside of each little like
braid section and it's just gonna make
it look a lot bigger and a lot cooler in
my opinion and then I'm like the other
hairstyles I'm just gonna pull out a
little bit of hair from the front of the
other side and then you are all done
with your style it's a really cool area
tons of compliments it's super pretty
and intricate and I love it
okay for this hairstyle we're gonna
start off by doing the same Dutch braid
behind that your thing that we did for
the hairstyle before so I'm just gonna
do that and then I'm gonna come back
okay so now that I've done in the Dutch
braid I haven't really pulled out the
pieces like I did before yet but I'm
just going to gather this all into a
half up so I'm gonna turn around and
show you that okay so I'm just taking up
reading a little bit more hair and I'm
just gathering it into a half up
ponytail so I'm just gonna be tying that
off into a ponytail on that I'm doing is
taking the braids out up until where I
just made the ponytail and braiding this
all the way down then I'm wrapping the
braid around itself into a bun and
securing it with bobby pins okay so once
you have your little bun in the back you
can come and fix your little Dutch bring
it if you want which I'm gonna do just a
little bit the little like half up bond
has been really popular lately and I
think this is a cool twist having the
Dutch braid with it so I like it a lot
okay you're gonna start off by taking
the top third of your hair and tying it
off into a little ponytail and then
you'll be making a hole at the top of
the ponytail and flipping the ponytail
up and through the hole you guys have
probably done this a million times then
I'm taking the second third of my hair
underneath that one and I'm gonna be
doing the same thing that I did making
the ponytail putting it to the hole and
then with the last third of my hair I'm
just doing the exact same thing it's
really simple and easy but it kind of
creates a cool look
okay for this last hairstyle we're gonna
set off by just putting my hair up into
a high ponytail on the top of our heads
and securing it with a hair tie okay so
once you've got your ponytail like this
basically what we're going to do is take
a section probably about this big from
the ponytail we're going to leave that
out and then take all the remaining hair
we're gonna twist it into a top knot
bond like I did previously you might
want to hold this smaller piece like in
your mouth or something if you'll have
someone to hold it for you
okay so once we have this little bun I
just pinned it with some bobby pins I'm
gonna braid this section all the way
down okay once I bring it down as far as
I can because some of the hairs are
different lengths I'm gonna tie it off
with another one of my clear elastics
and then what I'm gonna do is take this
braided section and just wrap it around
the face with the bun that I just made
and then I'm just gonna take some more
bobby pins and pin Matt into place okay
once I've done that I'm just going to
once again kind of loosen up the front
part of my hair kind of pull some pieces
out in the front and yep thank you guys
