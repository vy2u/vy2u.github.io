showing you five no heat in their Styles
lately I've been wearing my hair natural
but sometimes can get a little bit
boring just leaving it all straight down
so today I decided I would be showing
you once again five hairstyles that you
can do with your natural hand a lot of
these include braids just because I love
braids and I feel like braids are
something that can easily spice up kind
of a boring hair look so that's why
there's lots of braids in this so if you
want to learn how I did this hairstyle
as well as for more keep watching ok
first thing I'm doing is just pulling my
hair and then you don't have to do this
I just prefer it with the one of this
hairstyle you can do whatever part you
want and then I'm just taking a piece of
hair from the right side of my head and
I'm just going to braid it pretty much
all the way down you can really go to
wherever you want and this can be any
random place you just kind of want it to
look natural with your hair
I'm going to about here and then I'm
just tying it off a little elastic and
you can see how it just kind of falls
nicely I'm gonna do that same thing to
the other side it doesn't have to be in
the same place I really wasn't trying to
make it in the same place and you can
also do as many of these braids as you
like I just prefer to do two and then
I'm tying it off in a round same place
next I'm taking a bigger section from
the front of my head and I'm also
reading that all the way down
that's a henna tattoo run my hand by the
way if you're wondering it's actually
like a temporary one that I like to
stuck on anyways now I'm tying that off
and I'm gonna do the same exact thing on
the other side once I've done that I'm
just going to bring them to the back of
my head and then secure them with
another elastic you want to make sure
you've done them far down enough so that
you'll have braids all the way to the
back of your head and I'm just gonna
take the elastics out from the first
braids
and that's it
okay for this hairstyle also starting
off in the middle part and it's close to
the first one except I'm going to be
separating this into two sections and
I'm kind of doing a twist except the
bottom section of the twist I'm always
adding more hair into as you can see
there and then I'm just going to bring
it over the top of the other piece I've
done actually a few tutorials on this so
you might recognize it if you're a
longtime viewer but as you can see I'm
just kind of adding hair into the twist
and I'm not going to go back very far
while I'm doing this as you can see I'm
pretty sure I just start twisting
normally here
and then I just go all the way down with
this twist
okay then I'm going to secure it and I'm
actually going to put it in my mouth
because these ones tend to unravel and
then I'm just gonna do the same thing on
the other side once again adding hair
into the bottom piece and then bringing
it over of a top piece
and then once again just twisting all
the way down
and then securing it with my elastic
like the first hairstyle I'm gonna join
them in the back it's pretty much the
same except with twists and then I'm
taking out the first elastics
that's it
okay for this third hairstyle I'm
returning to my side part just for the
sake of this look what I'm going to do
is bring all of my hair to one side
because this is going to be a side brain
I'm going to take a little section from
underneath and guess what I'm going to
do I'm going to braid it what a surprise
I'm pretty sure I'm obsessive braids
anyone else
I'm going to go try and go down who do
you fire on this one
and then tie it off now I'm bringing the
hair back over and all I'm gonna do is
my regular side braid and I'm going to
try and keep my mini braid on top of one
of the sections so you'll be able to see
it in the braid this one looks really
cool and I really like it I haven't done
it before it's my first time trying it
and I think it's pretty cool so as you
can see I'm trying to keep the mini
braid on top of the section that it's in
so you can see it
I'm bringing all the way to the bottom
as far as I can
and then tiger
here I'm loosening up a little bit of
the sections just to make it look a
little bit Messier because that's what I
like my rigs and now I'm done
this hairstyle starts out with the
ponytails I'm gonna put mine up pretty
high because that's where I want my bun
I'm going to take a little section of
the ponytail and put this aside I'm
actually going to hold it in my mouth
just because that's easiest but I'm
going to twist the other section and
that's bigger into a bun you can do this
however you like but that's how I like
to make my buns I'm going to cure that
bun with some bobby pins
like so okay now who can guess what
we're going to do with this write it
correct after we finish braiding it
we're tying it off and then I'm just
going to kind of loosen the braid so it
looks a little bit bigger and then I'm
just going to wrap it around the base of
my bond and secure it with bobby pins I
really like how this looks I think it's
a cute top knot and it's really great
okay so I'm going to take a section of
my hair from underneath about this big
and I'm just going to braid it all the
way down if you don't know how to fish
tail braid I have an old tutorial I look
really gross in it but I will put it in
the downbar okay so once I've gotten to
the bottom of that fishtail braid I'm
just going to tie it off with another
one of my little elastics and now I'm
going to bring it behind my ear and all
the way over my head
like so and then I'm just going to kind
of tuck it behind my ear and then I'm
just going to secure it with a bobby pin
after that you're all done
so those were my five noogie hair styles
