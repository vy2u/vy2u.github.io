a video on top knots and if you guys
don't know how to top nowadays it's
basically one of these a wicked high bun
and I love these for a few reasons first
of all they take ten seconds
second of all they are extremely easy
and they actually look cute
third of all your hair can be extremely
frizzy you could go through the wind
tunnel and do a top knot and no one will
know I did a video on how to do the top
knot that I do a while back and some
people were saying it didn't quite work
for them so in this video I'm going to
be showing you five ways to ur top knot
and hopefully one of these will work for
you obviously not gonna look the same on
you as I want me unless you have the
same exact hair as me my hair is really
long but you know depending on your hair
type or texture or length they might
look a little bit different I tried to
give you enough different options in
here that you will probably find one
that you will like and they're all super
super easy all you're gonna need for
these little buns is some bobby pins I
use these giant ones because I have a
lot of hair but if you have shorter hair
than me you can definitely use little
ones and you're gonna need a hair tie
just to put your hair up in a ponytail
because I put my hope in a ponytail
before I do all of these just to ensure
that it's gonna stay all day because I
hate when my buns are floppy and I feel
like I have to like walk super straight
and not move my head or else I'm gonna
fall out so definitely put your hair in
a ponytail before you do any of these
the last thing you'll need for these
buns is just a little tiny little Weber
hair tie you're only gonna need this for
two of them I believe but um this is
just gonna once again ensure stability
and those two bonds don't don't bring me
that don't they don't bring me that
don't this first top knot is the one
that I do all the time so just going to
start off with a ponytail and twist it
lightly just towards the first half and
then start wrapping it around itself
pretty loosely you don't want this one
to be super tight and as you see the end
parts are not twisted and then I'm just
going to secure it off with my bobby
pins and then that's it you're done the
second top knot is the same as the first
one only around two coil the entire
ponytail this gives it a more kind of
polished look I don't prefer it but some
people like this to look like that so
once again who's going to twist it all
the way down and then wrap it around
itself pretty tightly it gets kind of
over your shape sometimes when you do
this as you can see that big kind of
like the one people cooking thing online
so I kind of just twist it around until
I get it how I like it and then once
again you're securing it and you are
done
for this third topknot you're going to
braid your ponytail all the way down you
don't want it super tight you don't want
it super Lutz just kind of your mom will
braid and then you're going to be
securing the end with your little
elastic and then what you're going to do
is wrap the braid around itself you're
pretty much doing this for all the top
knots and it gives a really pretty kind
of intricate look I guess and then once
again
surprise highs you're going to secure
with bobby pins I find that bobby pins
hold it secure you can use another hair
tie if you like but sometimes that can
get a little bit ugly because and you
can see the hair tie and I don't know I
just prefer bobby pins you can kind of
see them in mind but it kind of matches
my hair at the moment so that's a plus
and that is it I really like this one
you're going to see it for a while
because I don't know
okay for this bond you're going to do
the same thing except you're just
twisting all the way down if you cannot
do that you just use two pieces and
twist them and then you're going to do
the same thing with this one wrap it
around itself athlete tie the end as you
can see there and this one you kind of
to play with so you don't get like a
triangle head to see how I cut that in
there yeah little bit and you do the
same thing and secure it and it kind of
take the braided one only a little bit
looser I guess as you will see here
okay the last tough nut isn't actual not
guys so what you're going to do is
actually tie your hair in a knot this
will probably only work if you have long
hair but it's kind of cool and this is
what I had in the intro so you just tie
your hair in a knot and kind of pull it
down to the bottom and then if you have
extra hair I kind of take mine and wrap
it around the base of the bun and you're
going to want to play with this one as
well get it to kind of how you like it
and once again secure with bobby pins
and that is that one I think it's kind
of cute I guess so that's the video I
hope you guys like it
hi so that's it I hope this helped you
guys out once again like I said in the
beginning if you try this out be sure to
tweet me a picture at fields Natasha or
tag me in one after you see Tasha on
Instagram just remember if you're
private I won't be able to see it so
yeah I love you guys so much once again
hope you like this and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
