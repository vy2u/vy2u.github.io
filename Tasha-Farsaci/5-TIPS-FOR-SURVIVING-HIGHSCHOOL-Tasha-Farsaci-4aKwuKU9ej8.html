type of video it's not really like a
fashion or hair or makeup or beauty
video so you guys probably know that I
was senior in high school and if you
don't know that then Oh surprise it was
senior high school so technically I'm
not done with high school but its
fourth-quarter senior year I'm already
committed to college so I'm technically
considering myself done with all the
high school experiences other than
graduation but I don't really think many
people are nervous about that I just
wanted to put together five my like top
five tips for high school because even
though this isn't like the right time of
year for it I feel like its expression
my mind right now and I just wanted to
like put them all out there this is a
going to be a super in-depth video or
anything I just wanted to like make it
quick and simple but definitely helpful
for those of you that watch me that are
going into high school are already in
high school because I know that's most
of you like most of you guys are younger
than me so either you are in high school
or going into high school or if you're
watching this in your ID out of high
school I mean maybe it'll help you in
college too
my best tip is use your resources and I
know what people say that it normally
sounds like eating but I'm not condoning
cheating at all basically what I'm
trying to say is we live in a century
where technology is readily available in
the Internet is there and has lots of
resources on it so you should use it not
my high school career I have found lots
of websites that helped me a lot with
school and I'm not saying cheating I'm
saying with homework and all that kind
of stuff they're very helpful so I'm
gonna like tell you guys about or
whatever and I'm gonna let you guys know
about the websites that I love and that
have helped me out in high school as far
as the math side of things back Wacom
has helped me a lot this year I met AP
Calculus this year and I'd hate it like
I really don't like math I'm not bad at
math I just don't like it also doing
math homework and all that stuff is such
a pain for me so someone should be math
Wacom and its really awesome like I
don't know about the other subjects but
for calculus it's awesome so basically
there's like algebra precalc treg if I
can talk like calculus all these like
little sections and at least for calc I
know you can put in like an equation and
I don't like do the derivative for you
so I mean like obviously I'm not gonna
use it on tests and stuff because that's
cheating but if I'm doing my homework
and I just really don't feel like doing
all the chocolate all by myself my head
like at leas math way I don't know how
like the trig and like other parts work
but i'm pretty sure if like algebra it
just solves 4x4 you so it's just a
really helpful website and it gives you
like all the steps that you need so it's
really helpful for that i'm going to try
and link like all these websites down
below because they're helpful ok the
next website that i have to tell you is
a bad for reading i know a lot of people
struggle with reading or they're just
too slow and a lot of the times due
dates for books in school I like soon
and use some enough time to read
yourself so audible com is awesome for
that their audio books and you can
listen to the books I know a lot of
people that did this for English books
and stuff because they're pretty slow
readers or just don't
like actually meeting but they still
want to learn the material so audible is
awesome for that audible is not just for
school though I mean there's tons of
interesting folks like I really want to
listen to diverge in because I love the
movie and I haven't read the book yet
but it's on audible and I'm honestly
considering it because when I'm driving
stuff I could like listen drug at the
same time I actually have like a little
link where you guys can get a free trial
and listen to a book totally for free of
your choice and they have so many
awesome books on there like i said i
really want was 65 virgin but there are
so many different types and genres or
you could like use of school book so my
link is audible com / Tasha I'm gonna
put it up here as well as down the
boulevard so I definitely recommend
audible it's an awesome website he let's
swap second to talk about you guys are
probably heard about its spark notes
five notes is also for like books but
they also i think they have like all
their subjects and stuff but basically
if you get a really hard book sparknotes
like gives you the synopsis of like each
chapter and like all the characters and
it's awesome I'm not saying to do that
instead of reading the books i'm not
encouraging that at all but i know this
for me like I'm an AP English this year
and we really really difficult books and
a lot of the times I don't understand
what I read so I'll go back on
sparknotes after I read the book and
I'll read into it and it'll really clear
things up for me and it's really helpful
because it's in really easy English so
it just really helps I think there's a
website like sparknotes it's called
shmoop and it's also like the same thing
so if you want like another point of
view other than sparknotes shmoop com
has like a bunch of books too i'm going
to like once again put these all down
okay my second tip is to not worry about
losing friends or drifting from friends
so i found that in high school i have
changed my group of friends or just like
the people i hang out with the most so
many times and i used to get really
upset about it i would get really upset
if i was dripping from a friend or I
wasn't as good of friends with people or
like my best friends were hanging out
with new friends and I would get really
upset or I would like cry about it
sometimes but you have to realize that
high school as when people are really
like fighting themselves and discovering
themselves and everyone's changing so
obviously you're gonna drift from
serving people and meet new people and
you're just changing a lot so your
friends are going to change your mom and
I just want you guys to know that you
shouldn't like think you have to have
the same friends as you've had in middle
school obviously some of those people
may still be your best friends I'm so
I'd really good friends with a lot of
people that I was friends with in middle
school but I do have a lot of new
friends as well and there's also people
but I don't even talk to that I was
friends with in middle school so you
can't worry about them my third tip is
to organize your time I know this is
really hard about like procrastination I
mean I really AM procrastination this
year when I was in like my fresh meal
from what freshman sophomore in like
Bozo a junior year I was really on top
of everything but like this year seniors
has kicked in I always use my agenda I
put like my homework in it and stuff so
I can check it off and I don't like Miss
assignments and forget to do that I know
it sucks and you really don't want to do
homework because homework sucks but it's
really helpful just get it off your
plate and I really hoping that like in
college i'll pick back up on that again
because right now senior year I'm like
wow
alright my fourth tip is don't get
involved in drama high school drama is
honestly the pettiest thing ever I've
never been someone that like gets in on
drama or like starts drummer even starts
anything with anyone or like by two
people I'm just not that type of person
but I've seen other people get involved
in like high school drama and it's just
so stupid and unnecessary honestly high
school is very important for school
because basically your high school
grades are setting up your whole entire
College and the rest of your life so you
really don't want to be focused on a
drama of high school because honestly
like you're gonna leave those people at
a few years and yet what's really going
to matter is the grades you've got to
get you on to college if that's what you
want to do with your life which a lot of
people do now I don't know honestly to
Alma's not gonna get you anywhere but
distracted and that's not what you want
to be in my school especially once
you're getting to like to new year
because it's really important and you
want to keep on top of your stories okay
my last tip is to join clubs but not too
many it's really important to have extra
four killers when you're applying for
college there are a lot of clubs you can
join and I don't want to say like don't
join as many as you can but like really
you shouldn't be trying to join every
single plug just to put it on your
college like application find a few
clubs that you actually like and can
actually speak about because colleges
want to hear about your experiences in
the clubs and how they like changed you
as an individual rather than like oh
yeah I went to like one of each of these
and like just SAT there and like did a
few things but you didn't actually
invest your time in it for example one
of the clothes I was in was key club and
I mean a lot of my friends did it so it
was really fun and basically key club is
like a volunteering organization so we
had volunteered a lot of different
places together and that was really
funny because I was with my friends but
I was also helping the community so
basically used want to join clubs that
you're actually going to wake immerse
yourself
India would talk about rather than just
joining like a bunch of them some of the
tips that I have for today I know I
probably what kind of break even though
this video is not very quick but I kind
of just skimmed over them I'm planning
on doing a more like in-depth like
applying to college video maybe more
just like high school questions video so
if you guys are interested in either of
those leave them down below if you guys
aren't already following me on instagram
or twitter they're both fiercelytasha
and at least on instagram i'm probably
going to be posting things about college
soon as i'm going into college or
graduating high school and all that so
if you want to see that stuff be sure to
follow me I just want to give a thank
you to audible making this video happen
and definitely check them out once again
because may have so many awesome books I
love you guys so much and thanks for
watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
