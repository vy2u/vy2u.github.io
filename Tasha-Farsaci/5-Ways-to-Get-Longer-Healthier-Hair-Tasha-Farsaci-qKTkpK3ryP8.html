video and so long and I apologize and I
say the reason in every video because I
suck lately but hum school and work are
taking up so much of my time and I know
that's really no excuse but school comes
before everything else and then work
obviously I'm working so I really don't
have a lot of time to make videos and I
know people get upset when all I have is
out for the weeks but really that's like
oh I have time for because I do in the
morning but I have time today so I am
going to do a video so if you're a
really long time viewer you might
remember a tips on getting healthier
longer hair video I did and that
actually got a lot of views but it is so
old it's like 2 or 3 years old and a lot
of people were asking for me to do like
an updated version or like a haircare
routine or tips on how to get healthier
longer hair or something so I'm going to
kind of update it today it might be kind
of similar to that old one if you've
seen it but obviously like I'm different
now and I probably have some different
tips my hair doesn't exactly look great
right now but it's still pretty long
I'll show you in a minute this is my
natural hair so it's kind of wavy when
it's strained it's longer but it goes
time to like here you know it's pretty
long and it's pretty healthy I'm gonna
get your card a few days actually so you
know it'll be healthier better but yeah
obviously all these things I'm going to
work immediately you're gonna have to
have some time and depending on the
state of your hair and whatnot you know
these things might take time
okay my first tip is to cut down on the
heat use now I know this is really hard
because everyone wants their hair to
look perfectly straight or perfectly
curled I'm with you obviously I did not
use heat today I try and cut my heat
usage down to like one time a week and I
don't have to wash my hair for like two
or three days which some people might
think is gross but whatever my hair just
doesn't get greasy that fast but I try
and just straightener comb my hair once
a week and then it let go for a few days
and then you know go back to natural a
lot of people forget that using a
hairdryer is heat and that's actually a
lot of heat and I have never used a
hairdryer
personally because I it makes my hair
like a pool and I'm just like out to
here but if you do try to let it air dry
once in a while I know it's tough if you
shower before you go to school and you
don't want your hair just soaking wet
when you go into school but you could
try and like shower at night or you know
just like shake your hair around I don't
really know but definitely try and not
use a hairdryer because that adds so
much heat and it's just not good for
your hair
okay my second tip is to get your
haircut this may seem weird to some
people because a lot of people think in
order to grow their hair out they can't
cut it but it's not gonna look good or
healthy if you have like this much of
dead hair on the bottom like I know
people that will have long hair but like
this much is just dead and it looks so
bad and honestly I know you want long
hair but you have to get it cut off or
else it's never gonna look good and once
you cut off the bad part
you know it'll go in faster because your
hair will always make split ends they
won't be splitting all the way up your
hair and breaking and all that nasty
stuff so just get a haircut you don't
have to get it like every six weeks or
whatever they say I get my haircut like
every three months cuz that's when I go
in to get it highlighted but you know it
doesn't really matter
honestly I read like six months to four
one time I went a year that was a bad
time but as long as you get it cut like
two or three times a year I you know
don't get obviously like four inches cut
off you want to grow out your hair
unless that's how much is that because
then it's gonna be really hard to grow
out
okay my number three is to use good
products when I say good products I
don't mean like really expensive super
high on products because I not use that
I hate spending lots of money on hair
products and makeup and that kind of
stuff so I just stick to drugstore so
honestly products can really help your
natural hair and I'm just gonna show you
a few of the ones that I use these are
all by Aussie I really love obvious
super affordable and smells amazing and
you can get it and like any drugstore or
Target or Walmart or whatever so this is
the Aussie hair insurance and this is
like this is the split end protector so
I put this in and my ends sometimes
after I get out of the shower and this
will kind of just help your split ends I
guess I don't really know I kind of put
this throughout my hair as well and this
kind of just you know seals your ends I
don't know how it does it but I really
like it and it smells like this is the
mousse I use every day at when I am
wearing my hair natural it works so
amazing this is all I put in my hair
when I do it and it gets rid of all the
frizz it's really great it's the Aussie
scrunch and it's just the mousse and it
smells amazing it does not make your
hair punchy at all it is fabulous and
it's like three dollars so definitely
get this it's also leaving conditioners
that makes your hair really soft and it
just makes it look healthier and feel
healthier so I love the last ozzie
product I don't even know if they saw
any more because I ran out of this and I
try to get another one and I couldn't
find it
this is also under the hair insurance
line but it's a spray and it says the
leave-in conditioner so that's why I
have those two things that was kind of
trying to find this again but I can only
find it they probably still make it
they're probably just sold out in my
place but this stuff is really great and
I sprayed this like all throughout my
hair after I've showered and it works
wonders
okay my fourth tip is to try not to wash
your hair every single day and I know
that's super hard people because their
hair gets greasy and that's embarrassing
but washing your hair everyday can dry
it out and you know the more you wash it
especially if you don't like your
natural hair the more you're gonna want
to like use heat so I try to go like two
or three days and tips go that is like
the first two days my hair is not greasy
but on the last day I'll either use baby
powder or dry shampoo and I will
normally put my hair up so in a ponytail
or a bun and then you can add like a
headband or something like one of the
thick ones like right here and then you
can't even tell your hair is greasy
my last tip doesn't really I don't
really do this obviously because I said
I highly my hair but it's to try not to
split your hair colors too often or
bleach your hair so I'm kind of
contradicting myself because my hair was
brown I don't know but what I'm really
trying to say is people that will buy
like the box dyes it's just something
wrong with that but if they will have
like dark dark hair and then they'll
bleach it completely and then they won't
like it so I like bleach it more than
the little dip dye and then logo back
dark and like switch all the time and
that's like not good for your hair
especially if your hair's already
damaged like my hair is pretty not not
really damaged so it's okay for me to
get the highlights I think but some
people will do it and they're just
damaging their hair even more and more
so just kind of limit the times you dye
your hair um you don't really need it
like every few weeks like I go three
months and I'm due for a hair
appointment and it's not really bad at
all I mean you know ombre is in this so
if you have dark hair you know just just
let it let it flow you know so those are
just five of my tips I hope this was
helpful for you guys definitely try it
