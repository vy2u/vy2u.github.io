different ponytails and by different
ponytails I mean different ways to make
your ponytails looked here because I
know a lot of the times when I go to
school I just want to put my hair in a
ponytail but I still want it to look
cute and just a little bit more done up
than a regular ponytail it's also great
for like sports and stuff if you want to
here to look kind of cute you know so I
just have a few ponytails here today
that I think look really cute and I
great for school and sports so I hope
this helps you out and keep watching
okay for this first hairstyle you're
gonna start off with just a regular
ponytail and you're gonna take a little
section from the ponytail it doesn't
have to be too big but you know just a
good size and you're gonna wrap it
around the ponytail holder I really like
this because it's really simple but it
just gives more polished effect
once I get the end of my hair wrapped
around I just bobby pin it and then I'm
done
okay so this hairstyle is a lot like the
first one you're going to start off with
a normal ponytail and take a section of
the hair out but instead we're just
going to braid it all the way down you
want to go down as far as you can
because you don't want any hair that is
not braided in this I do have a little
bit but that's okay
once I get all the way down I'm going to
tie it off with a hair elastic and then
I'm just gonna wrap it around my
ponytail holder and secure it with a
bobby pin just like I dated with the
first hairstyle
okay for this next hairstyle all I did
was French braid the top of my hair
about the nape of my neck and this
didn't turn out too great because it's
kind of hard for me to French braid my
own hair like this but if you good at it
it'll probably look great on you if you
don't know how to French braid you can
just look up a tutorial but I French
braid until there and then I tie it off
with an elastic and I think it's really
cute
okay so for this next hairstyle you're
gonna want to start off by just taking a
chunk of hair from underneath in the
kind of back of your head just about
like this thick maybe a little bit
thicker because we're gonna be making a
braid with it so depending on how thick
you want your braid to be take that much
that much hair but I'm just gonna get
this much and then you're just going to
bring the rest of your hair up into a
normal ponytail now we're just gonna
braid this hair all the way down
okay so once you braid it down as far as
you can you're just gonna take the braid
and lift it over your head
all the way to the other side and then
just security and then you just have
really pretty braids kind of headband
thing going over your head to the other
side if your hair doesn't reach all the
way to the other side you can do that
step again on the other side and pull it
towards the other side so you have more
of a double braid effect okay this next
braid I like to call the Dutch braid
into a ponytail ponytail I actually have
a number very separate video on this so
if you don't really understand this
after I do it you can go to click this
little annotation right here and it'll
take you to that video but this will not
take you away from this video and I'll
just bring you to that one so you know
if you don't get this after I show it
just come back here and click this link
okay so to begin this hairstyle I'm
gonna start Dutch braiding my hair about
20 my ear goes and then I'm just gonna
braid a regular leave if you guys don't
know how to Dutch braid it's also called
an inverse braid because it's an inverse
French braid instead of bringing pieces
over one another are you bringing them
under if you don't really know how to do
this and you can't see what I'm doing in
this video I have another video to it
and you guys saw me point to that in the
beginning of this clip
then I'm just gonna tie it off so now
I'm just gonna bring all my hair back in
my head and also bring my Dutch braid
and kind of add it into the ponytail
Here I am taking out the braid that was
left in the ponytail you can leave it
there if you want but I prefer taking it
out here I'm just kind of pulling at the
Dutch braid to make it look a little
looser which I really like
okay for this next taste I don't want to
start by putting your hair down the
middle so that's what I did
sorry for no it's kind of greasy uh I
kind of have to wash it but you know I
still wanted to do this hairstyle so
you're just gonna punch your hair down
the middle and then what you're gonna do
is take like two inch maybe one and a
half inch sections from the top one part
of your hair like this and bring them
all the way down and you're going to do
this on both sides so I'm gonna do that
and once I'm done I will come back
okay so now I have my two braids I
didn't do all the way down just because
I normally have to you really just have
two braids it's far enough down so I
will reach the back of your head so now
what I'm gonna do is bring just the rest
of my hair that is not braided back into
a regular ponytail for this style I
personally like a lower ponytail but you
can really do whatever how you put it
till you want but I just like to put it
kind of low okay then what you're going
to do is take your braids and kind of
just break them along the side of your
head and add them to your ponytail and
then you're going to secure them into
Posen
you don't have to do a middle part with
this I just prefer it with the middle
part but yeah that's what this one looks
like and I really like it so I hope this
video helped you guys out if you try any
of these hairstyles be sure the tweet me
a picture or put a picture on Instagram
and tag me in it or do something because
I would love to see them and yeah so
once again I hope this helped you and
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
