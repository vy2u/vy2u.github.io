more college videos ever since I started
doing them so today I want to do another
college video that I thought could be
helpful for everyone and not just people
that are in college or going to college
so I'm sure everyone if not everyone
most everyone has heard of the broke
college student stereotype and I think
the reason for that is because it's true
I was lucky enough to have YouTube as a
job throughout my freshman year so I
wasn't completely broke ever but if I
did not have YouTube I would have been
so broke so I just wanted to put
together a little list of ways to kind
of save money or make money in college
because I know it's really hard to have
a job your freshman year or even any
other year after that because you want
to focus on your studies or you want my
jobs to college and sometimes you don't
have a car before I get into the video
if you're not subscribed to my channel
please subscribe to me it just takes one
little click on that button down there
and it would mean the world to me and
also if you're not following my
Instagram and you want to keep up with
my personal life more it is fiercely
Tasha I'll put a little screenshot here
if you always see if you guys could go
follow me okay so the first way to save
money that I'm going to talk about is
the app Poshmark and I've talked about
Poshmark so many times in my channel
because it's seriously one of my
favorite apps if you don't know what
Poshmark is it's basically an app that
lets you buy and sell clothing
accessories and makeup right from your
phone so not only can you buy other
people's items on Poshmark but you can
sell your own so I don't know if this
goes for everyone but when I was in
college I realized that there was so
many clothing items that I had that I do
not wear not only items that I brought
to college that I wasn't wearing but I
was thinking of all the clothes that I
left at home that I want so I thought I
was not missing so I used Poshmark so
much to sell a lot of my clothes and you
can do it right from you know your dorm
room as long as you have a printer you
can print out the shipping label and
sell stuff and it's a great way to make
money not only as Poshmark help me make
money but also helps me save money
because
there's something I want to buy that's a
little bit on the pricey side I always
check Poshmark first to see if anyone's
selling it at a discounted price because
you know homegirl likes her discount so
Poshmark
is free to download which is awesome and
when you make a sale they only take 20%
so you're still making 80% of your sale
so if you don't have Poshmark already
and if you sign up and make your first
purchase on the same day shipping is
only 99 cents which is great and once
again if you are new to Poshmark
and you want to sign up with my invite
code you get a free $5 - Poshmark
which is great because who doesn't want
a free $5 so I'm gonna put my code here
and I'll also put all the information in
the description box yeah so I'm trying
to clean out my closet I'm trying to
make money so I'm not a broke college
student so I have a ton of my clothes
listed on Poshmark and I know you guys
like my style or at least some of you
guys do so yeah I have a ton of items
listed on Poshmark so if you guys want
to go check out my Poshmark my username
is Tasha massage and that would be
fabulous ok just a small disclaimer this
video is sponsored by Poshmark but I've
talked about posh more in so many videos
before and they just saw that I've been
talking about them and asked if I want
to collab with them so honestly all this
is so genuine because you guys know I
talk about Poshmark all the time I've
used it for like years now so honestly
yes it's sponsored but I would be
putting them in this video anyway yeah
so thank you to posh mark for sponsoring
this video okay so my next way to save
money in college is to rent your
textbooks textbooks are so ridiculously
expensive and guys I'm not gonna lie to
you last semester I didn't use one of
mine yeah I know that's not very
admirable but I just didn't need them or
there were professors that didn't even
have us use them and it's just so
annoying I'm not gonna not buy the books
because you never know if you're gonna
need them
but I don't want to fork out $200 plus
for a book that I might not even use so
I know at my school's book store I went
to Loyola Marymount University but now
bring to us see if you haven't seen my
transferring video I'm going to put that
down below in the description anyways
last year at LMU I know my bookstore had
a renting option and things were a lot
cheaper but there's also a bunch of
websites that you can use this is not
I'm not sponsored by these websites but
I use slug books it's basically a
website where you can put in the ISBN
number of your book and it brings up all
the different websites that are either
selling that book or renting that book
and it is so much cheaper I use this
every single time and I save hundreds of
dollars it's serious and the best thing
ever so yeah um just totally like Google
you know try to find your books online
because you can get them for so much
cheaper and save so much money okay this
next tip is kind of an obvious one I
guess but I know it did it so I'm going
to start doing it this year I guess just
never think of it so it's just save your
change and I don't know about you guys
but I hate change whenever I get changed
if I pay with cash I usually just put it
in a tip jar or I'll just like throw in
the bottom of my wallet and never look
at it again but I think a great way to
kind of start saving your money is to
put your change in like a cute jar in
your room or something like that or a
piggy bank every time you get it and
before you know it it's literally gonna
build and build and build and you're
gonna have a good amount of money in
there I remember one of my friends to
this in high school and she would have
like fifty dollars saved up and change
it you never would know you even add
okay the next way to save money and
college is something I always forget
about when it's student discounts so if
you're a Shopaholic like me you're
probably still gonna shop in college but
so many stores have student discounts
and I always forget about them but I
really need to remember because it's so
helpful even if they're just saving like
10% honestly every bit counts when
you're a broke college student and I
know stores like Topshop and for between
one and j.crew and honestly probably a
bunch more out of student discounts so
you can just Google
search stores with student discounts and
I'm sure they'll all come up I think you
just need to have your student ID when
you pay to just prove that you're a
student but honestly that's such a life
hack
okay the next way to save money in
college is to make you own coffee or
even food and I know the food part can
be kind of difficult if you're living in
a dorm room but especially with coffee
if coffee is not on your meal plan like
for me coffee was on my meal plan so
this wasn't really a huge issue there
was a bunch of coffee shops on my campus
that were included in my meal plan money
but if this not the case for you and
you're going and buying you know a $5
coffee every single day that really adds
up so honestly just investing in a
Keurig or a coffee maker or anything to
make your own coffee you know at least a
few times a week is really gonna help
you out especially if you drink as much
coffee is me in terms of making your own
food it depends on what you're making
but you know it's probably easy to save
money if you're getting like you know a
box of pasta and some softs because that
can make a lot of meals and it's just a
lot cheaper and so I'm like going out to
eat for every meal so I would definitely
recommend you know just trying to make
some meals at home or even breakfast
that's super easy just getting like a
box of cereal and some milk instead of
paying like you know seven dollars for a
bagel and cream cheese or whatever I
know I'm not a chef but I'm going to be
living in an apartment next to you with
no meal plans so I'm gonna have to start
making my home food okay my final tip
for this video my apply to everyone but
it is on-campus jobs so I know I said in
the beginning the video a lot of people
don't have time to get a job but a lot
of the times the problem really is they
don't have the means of the getting to
their job so more often than not they do
have time to fit a job into their
schedule but I just don't have a car or
transportation to get where they're
working so honestly something that is
great is on-campus jobs I know there
were so many opportunities for on-campus
jobs at LMU and I'm sure it's the same
for any college or university not only
is it a great way to meet people on your
campus but you're going to pay
eight and you don't have to worry about
commuting to your job so honestly it's
just a great thing to keep in mind if
you do all the time and you are ready
for a job on campus one that I would
really recommend is a campus kind of
coffee shop if you do have that because
students come in all the time and I know
at LMU we had one of those and the
baristas were all good friends and they
look so like they're having fun all the
time and the students would come in and
they interact with the students so I
think that's just a great one to have
but you know honestly any on-campus job
is great and it's going to help you make
and save money in college okay so those
are my tips on how to save slash make
money in college if you guys have any

that I came up with but I know there's
