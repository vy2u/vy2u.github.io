thing's tag I'm in my closet right now
we just redid my closet so I don't have
those like ugly bookcases back there
anyone so if you guys like it in here
let me know also it's like six like p.m.
right now so it's really dark and the
only light is like this really dorky
like planets light i have up there don't
judge I like picked it out and I was
like fire um so I don't know how well
it's like lighting me up or anything but
I still want to do a video because I
feel really bad that I haven't done a
video um really since like Oh for the
weeks and stuff but the reason for that
is I do track i get home at like 530 and
it's dark and then i have to shower and
I'm just disgusting it's still of
homework and so i'm having like a hard
time doing videos um but yeah so i'm
doing this now it's sunday night and yes
so this is actually my favorite egg
video watch I don't know why and I've
never done it so i decided i would do it
and my laptop decided to not have Wi-Fi
okay my laptop is retarded i have a
macbook like i'll be sitting there and
my wife i will like just just go away
like out of nowhere so it does it all
the time and i don't really know what
order i'm going to do these in because i
don't have the order i'm still gonna i
still like know all them and I have
always stop in front of me so yeah I
kind of want to do a tag video because I
feel like you guys don't really know
what personality because I'm usually
doing like alpha weeks and haired corals
and my off of the week's I'm like diving
it like six in the morning like I'm
doing like that creepy smile I always do
because I need to show some sort of like
motion or something and then my hair
tutorials I'm just like hi like whipping
through everything so I kind of wanted
you guys to like get my personality more
so i decided i do a tag okay first
question is lipstick or lipgloss most
one and I don't like lipstick and
lipgloss like
like them but when I wear them I cannot
stand the feeling of them on my lips and
then they go away and like like five
minutes i stole like the feeling of them
and I feel like nothing flatters me like
color-wise on my lips I don't know so
I'm just gonna do chapstick and
basically I'm not very fancy I just like
using the comics my lips are constantly
champs like I cannot tell you they are
constantly tapped so this book is like
the best stuff I've tried and it's just
like a little pot and i will put someone
now and it's just like I don't know it's
kind of like birds bees and like a pop
one by the stock works really well and I
don't know it says it's for cold sores
but I use it for chapstick so this is my
most worn lip product next is your
anxiety I don't really know odom going
in but this is easy I just wear my
pearls like every single bear and my dad
got these from either real criminals um
and yeah I only know how much they were
anything but they're pretty small and I
wear these every day they go with like
everything and I think they really cute
and classic and I love them so um yeah
next I'm gonna do handbag okay um I know
some people have like 20 crisis I have
one um I mean I really want like a nice
service but I don't have like hundreds
of dollars to just drop it up coast so I
just have this one from H&amp;amp;M and i don't
like it i mean it's not like the best
quality or anything but i like it it's
brown leather and a house like zippers
and buckles and hastily things and it's
really big um I don't really use purses
a lot I kind of just like I don't know I
mean I never leaves my first it's weird
but when I do this is the one I use
like over the summer I don't know if any
story still have it i believe it was
like forty dollars which isn't bad it's
pretty big and i like it so this is my
most worn handbag next I'm going to do
the most worn shirt okay this thing is
like my hero this is like my my love
okay this is the magic a me uh-huh I
have a funny story about this so
basically my most worn off I don't feel
like a regular top there were all the
time but I always wore this nude cami ok
so I went to the mall of my friends over
the summer and I was wearing this like
teal romper I boy in one of my alpha
weeks like of two ago and it has like
cutouts on the front and I didn't have a
new cami and I just wore nude bra which
like I know I should not have done that
because you could see the bra through
but it only need you like staring and I
don't have boobs to like I don't know
what people would be staring but anyways
it was really embarrassing my friends
are like Tasha you can see a bra I'm
like I'm sorry I'm sorry so he went into
forever 21 and they had this new candy
and I was like okay I'm buying it's just
so i can wear right now so I'm not
embarrassed okay I wear this thing like
literally every day like the people my
gym class how I think I'm disgusting
because I wear this thing like every day
and um it's just magical like okay if
you're sure this year and you wear under
it it is like oh my gosh because its
skin color and yeah this thing is just
great and this was only like 250 so um I
definitely recommend this this is this
is like the bomb um yeah so get one of
these okay now I'm gonna do nail
polishes um I really when my nail polish
is equally I don't really ever wear one
more than the other but I guess I kind
of have a few that I wear a lot I'm
gonna go by summer first because is it a
summer color this is cajun shrimp by OPI
this is like the second you'll polish i
ever got and i don't i humanly come by
when I'm wearing this color because like
it's bright red and I don't I really
like it it's just like a coaling red
color and i really like it like I
not pull off red nails but it's just
like a bread looks horrible on me I
cannot tell you it's not a good thing
and that's my school color like red and
Phil but anyways this is like a
quarterly run so I really like this one
I definitely recommend this to you if
you can pull off red um yeah cajun
shrimp I love this and it's perfect on
my toes too so looks like an all-around
great color and then for a fall um this
is me yellow strawberry I OPI and this
was from the Hong Kong flexion but they
still have it like I just saw your time
and it's just like a pro Polly Browne
shimmery color it's really cool because
in some light looks really critical and
then other White's looks like brownie
topi so I love this one I definitely
recommend it it's really cool so yeah
that's me on the star fair ok now I'm
going to do a hair products um I mean I
don't really use a hair product every
single guy and I'm not very good I'm
heat acting like i'll use of the first
time I straighten my hair but then if i
do like touch-ups afterwards like i
won't even use it um but basically
whenever i'm showering and i'm going to
straighten my hair i always use the same
minute miracle by Ozzy and this is just
like a deep conditioner but it makes my
hair smell amazing that's why I use it
like I don't even know if it does much
but my hair smells like a tropical
breeze when I use this it's like coconut
like pineapple it smells like a pinochle
pina colada pina colada I don't know
that's what it smells like um and this
stuff makes my hair pretty soft i guess
um i don't know i love this and it's
only like three bucks so this is good
and then for what I'm going my hair
natural which is like on the weekend
when I have no life and I'm just like
sitting at home with my hair nasty I'll
use this it's the Aussie hair insurance
leave in conditioner I mean I don't only
know if this works but it smells like
the only one so i use it says it protect
protects not so healthy hair I don't
really know but it smells like
smells like awesomeness and this is only
like 250 so I mean if you want to hear
it smell good I recommend this okay next
is most one perfume and basically I
don't think we're for you I wouldn't
wear perfume like in the mornings I
honestly like I'm lucky that I get
dressed because I am so out of it um so
I always forget to crown cook you and I
don't even have that many because I just
always forget about it I mind always
like way off and stuff but I guess my
most won't be my hollister Malaya Malaya
I don't even know it's just in the only
one in this battle so yeah this smells
like hollister like if you've ever been
in hollister um i was in this face
probably like two years ago a year ago
how it was the only thing I wore I mean
I'm pretty sure we all went through this
pain like I was obsessed with
holistically okay you guys are lucky i
have not have a candle like two years
ago all right it would be like all right
hair up in a ponytail like big high side
thing with a clear apple juice like a
headband thing if you guys know what I'm
talking about and then I really I really
tight hollister shirt and I had West
boobs and I have a house that is just
like Oh God and so then I'd really like
sports pants okay like everyone in my
school went through this phase so it
wasn't as bad but looking back I don't
know what I was thinking and hollister
was just like the coolest thing but I
couldn't fit into their pants so you
know I wouldn't like sports pants um but
yeah basically i got this around then
and i barely used any of it but it
smells amazing so I just went on on
awkward branch thing and the last thing
is most one shoes and basically during
the summer but most women she was just
old navy flip flops because during the
summer I have no fashion sense like
honestly every day I will be like cutoff
jean shorts and a tank top in old navy
flip flops because I don't know why
whenever I like outside riding my bike
to my friends house and stuff i don't
really know your shoes or anything so
leave you flip flops you like they're my
most point shoot this summer for the
winter it's probably these i mean i just
got these like two weeks ago but I born
going every single
and then my black combat boots um yeah
like buckles in the back they lace up
the front they've got a nice zipper I
got these from ectasia in New York City
and okay my camera decide to cut off but
my father smacks tassa in New York City
and you can get these in lots of places
I mean a similar one stone yeah but I
always liked all the time and yes I love
these things and yeah so that was my tag
vo I'm I really want to do a questions
and answers video because I want you
guys to know me more but I kind of want
to do that when i have more subscribers
