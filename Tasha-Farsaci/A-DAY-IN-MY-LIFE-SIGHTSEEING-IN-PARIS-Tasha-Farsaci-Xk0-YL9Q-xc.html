decided to vlog today because I think
today should be a fun day and no I want
to do another vlog one here so I just
bundled up I'm about to go out to a
coffee shop that we passed the other day
I think I'm gonna go alone I don't know
it's a kind of interesting for me always
going up like whenever I would go on
family trips and stuff my mom would
always make sure we got a big super
early and pack as much stuff into the
day as possible so that's always like
what I've been used to doing like
Gretchen and her family they kind of
like to like sleep in and then go into
everything but I just feel like since
I'm only here for a short period of time
I want to do as much as possible so
they're not ready yet but I think I'm
just gonna go on my own and walk around
a bit but I just got this scarf
yesterday I really wanted to get a huge
plaid like neutral colored blanket scarf
while I'm here and I think this one's so
cute I have some green in it and I also
got this little black hat yesterday so
I'm stylin I won this sweater like so
many times already but yeah I saw this
like really cute coffee shop the other
day when we were driving by you even
want to try to pronounce it I just can't
pronounce friends I feel French I feel
so like ignorant but it's called the
republic of coffee and it looked really
cute so I want to try and go there and
then I think after that we're meeting up
with Janine a Mikola
and then getting like brunch and stuff
but yeah that's what I'm gonna try to do
now that actually feels so warm right
now for once
it's so pretty out so nice I might
finally bundle up and I'm excited for
the coffee place
look how cute
okay guys so I got an iced latte and
we've been getting hot drinks to hold
him I'm here because I've been so cold
and I really just wanted a nice drink
but the place is more like a sit-down
sort of place an order
I wish Gretchen would have come because
they had acai bowls the stuff but
that's just what I needed I took a
picture of it they're really cute sign
in there so insert it here but yeah I
think I'm gonna head back to Airbnb now
because I think I'm gonna meet Janine in
like 20 minutes or so
so guys I'm not sure what store this is
but look how amazing this jacket is I
know it's kind of hard to tell because
the glare but all our stuff is so cool
minds me of all saints

don't know it's so cool

has these little like sleazy sleeves and
then it looks like it's gonna be like a
little crop top yeah this is so fun so
anyways yeah today was really really fun
and basically I know I mentioned in my
last vlog that I thought I was going to
go to London which I really really
wanted to do a because I'm considering
going there for this summer and I've
never been so I want to make sure I
liked it and B not gonna lie there was
like a guy there that I really want to
hang out with but I'm probably going to
go in May instead because basically I
was just going to do a day trip because
I leave Paris on Thursday and it's
already Monday so I was gonna go
tomorrow spend the night and then leave
the day after which is like pretty
rushed and at first the train tickets
were three hundred and fifty dollars
which was a lot round-trip but I was
willing to do it just because I really
wanted to go but then all of a sudden
they went up to 500 round-trip and I
just thought to myself like I literally
cannot do that like $500 plus money for
an air B&amp;amp;B for one day is personally
like I just couldn't do it as much as I
wanted to go especially because I think
I can get a flight from LA to London for
that much or like a flights so I'm
thinking like when I not graduate when I
finish school in May I might try to go
for like a week or two and travel around
more because for this trip I just feel
like I should spend as much time as I
can here in Paris and for London I just
wanted to be somewhere that I could
spend more time in and travel more in
general so yeah I'm not gonna do that I
think that was a good decision on my
part just needs this fight when it
always was so much it's probably cuz
it's like the holidays are now - but
yeah we just got back we're all like so
so tired
I've been being so exhausted here I
haven't been sleeping very well either
it's been kind of weird I've been
getting like a really sweaty like
there's a heater right next to me but
I'm not like hot like I feel cold but
I'm sweating and it's the worst feeling
I could always sweet sleep in
sweatshirts and it's the worst feeling
when like the inside of a sweatshirt
gets like sweaty but you're cold
oh that's been me so I haven't been
sleeping too well but yeah I'd only know
what else I want to say here
I guess I'll update you if anything else
happened tonight hey guys I'm good so I
don't have a double chin now so can I
have a double chin crotch enema I are
literally just laying in bed editing I'm
editing this current vlog right now and
I realize I didn't have an ending clip
but we're wearing the pajamas okay these
are Gretchen's Gretchen bought these
from that store that I've logged about
today and I didn't end up buying the
Grau fit because I have a lot of grey
sweats and I didn't feel like I needed
them I feel like if the graph it was in
a different color maybe a black maybe a
even olive green and I would have gone
for it I would have taken the plunge but
the gray was just you know I have too
much so but I'm wearing Gretchen's PJ's
cuz I've literally worn the same pair
every night I've been here and I've been
sweating in them so much sorry Gretchen
I promise I won't sweaty but yeah
remembering a little editing such and
then we're going to bed cuz well you're
exhausted oh yeah thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
