I apologize first of all my voice sounds
weird throughout this video I'm getting
over a sickness but today I'm doing a
day in the life of my school day at USC
I'm a USC student in case you guys are
new to my channel yes so I'm a junior at
USC I did one of these videos
last year I'll link it down below and
you guys really seemed to like it so I
figured I would do one this year as well
I'll maybe do some throughout the school
year or whatever basically today I just
got up I don't have my first class until
12:30 so I got up at 1:10 and I got
ready but I have three classes today
I shouldn't be done until like around
5:00 so yeah I talked about this in my
last day in the life video I don't
really know how much actual vlogging I'm
gonna do on campus just because I'm not
I'm not really fully comfortable yet of
like whipping up my vlog camera and
vlogging on campus in my last video a
comment or kind of compared it to like
Hannah Montana like at school I'm my
like school self who happens to have a
YouTube channel and then you know out of
school I'm like a blogger but yeah I
will try to film some on-campus shots
though because I know some of you guys
are probably super interested in that
but yeah the three classes that I have
today are earthquakes which is my least
favorite class it's not ideal and then I
have a navigating and news and media in
a digital age I believe and then I also
have a lab for that class which is just
like using the Adobe cloud products so
we've used Photoshop and illustrator and
I think we're gonna start premiere or
something like that so those are my
three classes for today in case you guys
are wondering what I'm wearing I'm just
wearing this white little romper today
it's literally going to be 105 degrees
out today which is not normal for her LA
this time of year yeah here's my romper
I don't know what she wasn't wearing yet
okay so normally I go to my sorority
house for lunch I'm an alpha fee so we
have a chef there so a lot of times I'll
go there for lunch and dinner but
actually today I am
eating my hellofresh meal so this video
is being sponsored by hellofresh but
guys I'm so excited
I have almost bought hello fresh so many
times for myself and then they reached
out to me and wanted to like collab on a
video and I was so excited so basically
if you guys don't know what hello fresh
is there a meal kit delivery service
hello fresh comes out with new recipes
every single week so you can kind of
switch up what you get or what you want
to get so basically you can pick if you
want the normal box with a vegetarian
box and then I think you can either pick
to get three recipes or five so I got
three and they came you know yesterday I
already made this one last night it's
just the classic beef chili one and then
the back has all of the instructions and
basically they send you all of the
ingredients and like the perfect amount
because I think the worst part of
cooking is having to like measure
everything out and make sure you have
the right amount but this is just like
pre measured for you sorry my hand is
like getting tired yeah so it's pre
measured for you and you have all the
instructions and it's super pretty and
you see what to do because I don't know
I was really like cooking and especially
being a college student it's nice to
have like home-cooked meals even though
like I do like eating at the sorority
this is just super super easy so yeah I
made the chili yesterday and then I had
some leftover because it was like
supposed to serve to people you know
tonight so you guys can see and I'm just
really excited to make it it is the
balsamic fake chicken with sweet
potatoes and mixed greens so I'm gonna
make that one waiter tonight but yeah
for now I'm eating my chili but if you
guys want $30 off your first week of
deliveries from the hello fresh I have a
coat for you just use the code Tasha 30
and it is smooth sailing guys I think
it's so fun I don't know I really like
cooking and I feel good about myself
when I do for some reason oh yeah and
they're affordable every meal is less
than ten dollars so yeah if you guys
want to start cooking more but aren't
totally sure if you're like a pro this
is totally great so yeah I'm gonna
finish eating the chili and then I'm
gonna pop on over to campus and probably
melt because it's like a trillion
degrees out okay so let's heat it up the
chili and this is what it looks like I'm
pretty excited it's super good so
yeah I'm gonna eat this and then head to
campus so I just put on these shoes and
then I'm adding these sunglasses because
I always have to wear sunglasses when
I'm walking campus that's like my thing
so I think I'm gonna grab a coffee or
something from Starbucks and yeah it's
so I don't want to go these people so
she asked me to do it being a good
friend so this is lunch I have a 10:00
a.m. lab so I wake up at like 9:00 print
out the free lab kind of came through it
so I know what to do for the quiz
originally Tasha was in this ten a.m.
lab with me but she switched out because
she's a terrible friend
they also emailed about switching out
gotten the response of any sort so yeah
now we're at lunch oh and then we have
earthquakes the best pop
my bloggers yeah
show them Campus Center Oh
this is Campus Center
that's Tasha this is the Student Center
which apparently you can get tickets at
I didn't know yeah I've done it I don't
know what tickets are like for football
games okay
and there's seeds where I just ate a
sandwich up there is lemonade where you
get lemonade food and those boys he just
kind of quakes we got up nice and early
yeah it was pretty rough that's the only
reason she has time to vlog usually she
Sprint's out of earthquakes and runs
away from me yeah my next class is in
this building it's the old Annenberg
brick building so it's not exciting yeah
but you know we're just but we are right
by the film school Elia is in the film
school if you didn't know for anyone
that's interested I like a lot of you
guys probably are it's right yeah like I
don't know if I'm I can't point I can't
do dad that way yeah so on my way here
you guys I was wearing those platform
shoes my feet got really really sweaty
and my butt like slipped off of them and
I fully like almost fell on the ground
like I was a foot from the ground I
would have loved to and I know people
saw I was just trying to so I just got
back from my day of classes I changed my
clothes I just put on like a sorority
shirt and some leggings just to be more
comfortable but basically I'm so tired
just hi I'm laying down right now but
I'm also really hungry so I'm about to
make my second hellofresh meal gym
excited about but I'm kind of nervous I
don't want to mess it up yeah I have to
finish writing a paper and I don't like
going to the library I feel like it's
just I don't know doesn't have good
vibes for me so I'll probably go back I
like going to the communication school
and doing homework in there so we go
back there later and finish up my paper
that's what I said I was gonna do last
night and I ended up just watching
Vampire Diaries I just started watching
it and I can't tell if it's a good show
or if I'm just like so attracted to all
the guys in it
that it makes me think it's a good show
but I think Stefan is so hot please
don't write any spoilers I'm only on
season 2 or 1 or whatever but um yeah so
that's what I'm currently watching yeah
so every meal comes in its own little
bag and then the meat is separate and
then it has all the stuff inside
pre-measured which is just so nice and
handy for just throwing in the fridge ok
so I wasn't super great at cubing the
sweet potatoes but I kind of just did
whatever I could and I ended up using
both just because I didn't know if want
to be a lot so it's kind of a lot but
we'll see and I just put some salt and
pepper on like it's sudden I'm gonna pop
them in the oven okay so now I'm cooking
the chicken there was actually only one
chicken breast because it was pretty
large so yeah I guess I'll eat what I
can guys I just realized I'm dumb
there's two chicken breasts they were
just stuck together I'm so stupid
okay guys so I kind of burnt the potato
they still taste good they're just like
a little bit more burnt than ideal but
that's my fault and then this is the
chicken so yeah I didn't put the salad
in here I think I'm gonna save that for
another time but yeah I'm excited to eat
this okay so now I am back in bed again
now I'm just gonna like chill in my bed
probably like 20 to 25 minutes and then
I'm gonna go on campus to write my paper
I guess I could have ready here but I
find that when I try to work in my room
I get a lot more distracted and I'm more
likely to like just be like oh I'm gonna
watch an episode of Vampire Diaries and
then I'll finish whereas if I'm like on
campus in a building I'm more likely to
actually get it done so yeah I'm just
gonna lay here a bit and then I will go
okay guys so I left the building that I
was doing work in because a group of
people came there being so loud and I
couldn't concentrate so now I'm about to
watch my sorority house because I really
want chocolate milk and a nobody have it
there I'm gonna get chocolate milk and a
bagel and then go home and do the rest
of my wolf the biggest rule about a
bagel with cream cheese is to never be
stingy on the cringe okay so now that
I'm back from doing work I don't know if
you guys could hear me earlier I was
kind of like talking quickly but
basically where I was doing work it's
not a library it's just one of the
buildings so technically you don't have
to be quiet I mean in my opinion you
should if you know people are doing work
there it's like courteous to be quiet
but basically a group of people came in
and they're being super loud so I
decided to leave I pretty much finished
my paper anyway I have like a hundred
words left but anyways then I went to my
Rory house all 15 because they always
have like drinks and snacks and stuff
there and I really want to chocolate
milk so I got that a bagel but something
that I thought was so nice and I wanted
to point out as I went there and I had
to had a delivery from my bigs like best
guy friend and he sent me this little
shirt I guess they have it's either a
philanthropy or just like a party this
weekend and it's like a shirt for it so
yeah I don't know I thought that was
cute that was so sweet of him so yeah
yeah so tonight I'm probably just going
to finish up any last homework I have
probably watch The Vampire Diaries and
drool over Stefan and then I go to bed
so I hope you guys enjoyed this little
day in my life video at USC if you guys
want me to do more videos like this or
combine weeks let me know and I will do
that I love you guys so so much and
thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
