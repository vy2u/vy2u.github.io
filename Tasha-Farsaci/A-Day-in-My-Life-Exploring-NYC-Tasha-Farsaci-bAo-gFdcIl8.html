like day in my life kind of video
because I'm going to New York City with
me
yeah with Mel and you guys are saying
you missed my vlogs so I figured this
would be like a fun follow me around
flog I don't go to New York City a time
because I live in Syracuse which is five
hours in the city so it makes it kind of
hard to try and just go in one day which
is why it's 1:00 a.m. right now and
we're gonna leave in like a half hour
because we're taking a train tour no
we're taking a bus there it leaves it to
15 so we're supposed to get to the city
at 7 a.m. so we thought we would get
like breakfast and just make a whole day
of it so we haven't slept at all and
hopefully we can sleep on the bus I
don't really know hopefully it's not too
cold I have like a bad stomach ache
right now so hopefully that goes away
yeah I don't know I guess I'll update
you guys probably once we're there or on
the bus we'll see
hey guys so we just got back that was
around who's boss right I'll tell you
about it later
I got 0 hours of sleep so that's
interesting we're currently going to a
bagel place because I want a bagel and
then we're gonna coffee and it's so
really it's like 7:00 a.m. so hey guys
I'm so excited to eat this I got a bacon
egg and cheese
I got everything with butter the walls
are really cute you
okay guys we've done some shopping I bet
some damage and now we were at sticky
finger joint because we loved the
chicken tenders so much and it's
literally a place dedicated to two
contenders as you can see the giant
chicken tender on their wall we brought
the spicy chicken sandwich oh my gosh
I'm so excited to eat mmm
it looks like a giant krabby patty yeah
so I guess I'll show you probably what I
got later but Oh guys I maxed out my
credit card when you're ratchet a F what
are you doing there slow zoom
melzack literally doing her eyebrows in
the chicken restaurant
I only already accepted that I look
pretty crusty at this point after you
probably eat oh yeah I might have
powdered my face just now I come
prepared
you know sometimes but you can't sleep
24 hours you're right my mouth show them
the shoes you found so we found this
other warehouse sale if you guys watched
my New Jersey blog from the summer we've
had this insane warehouse sale and then
they found another sample sale and Mel
got he's bragging bones
$33 although shoot for $33 I got a pair
of like really nice shoes - yeah insane
crazy I need to like I can't buy
anything else today I probably will but
I can't so so Mel wanted to go to this
place called birch coffee she said it's
like really good coffee so to get there
we have to walk through Washington
Square Park that's what it is right yeah
so I thought I'd show you guys it's like
where NYU is if you guys aren't familiar
with it I called it the arch but I feel
like there's definitely a name for it
your eyes can see it there's some people
around I'm sure would be a lot more busy
it's good to hear yeah I'm by no means
an expert on New York City Landmarks but
honest with you I think this you haven't
been here
hey guys so it's a while later I've
fallen asleep in ubers multiple times
today almost fell asleep at a coffee
shop basically us coming at like 2:00
a.m. wasn't the best idea considering we
didn't get any sleep
what have we done since I think the last
week's we've just gone different places
just to sit down and charter plane yeah
I'm not a subscriber so thank you for
coming up to the Alps with the photo
that we took together here it was so
nice meeting you
now we're literally sitting at over
until I kill time before we walked in
the hall so this was kind of weird okay
you guys ever get like bumps on the tip
of your tongue because I would bump when
I kept my tongue it's really bothering
me I keep going like this
the one of my thumb is like yeah yeah
like three of them I've been off anyways
so I think we're gonna walk to dinner
now but it's like a mile it's gonna be
really cold so maybe that'll wake us up
I'm going a little italy knew going to
the same restaurant that we went to last
year because it was really good and
cheap and clearly since I bought so much
stuff that's the ideal for me
yeah that's gonna happen yeah
you excited more than you know
fettuccine alfredo focus and I'll grab
penne vodka I was gonna get my vodka but
this was calling my name
hey guys so it's quite a while later now
I'm actually back in my apartment at La
basically what happened is that the day
after I went to New York I filmed and
showed you all the stuff I got but I
must have gotten like corrupted or
something on my camera because when I
tried to put it on my computer it wasn't
there so I'm gonna show you what I got
in the city right now I'm missing one
thing because I didn't have room to pack
it and it's at home right now but I'll
show you the rest of the stuff that I
got in the city so my first big purchase
was Sarah Peter Chester whining in the
background my roommates just left and he
said so the first thing I got is the All
Saints jacket I've wanted an All Saints
jacket for a really long time and in the
store it was clearanced and then it was
an additional twenty percent off
clearance so I got this for like three
hundred and forty dollars which is a
really good deal because it's originally
around $600 I know some people are gonna
be like oh my gosh I would never pay
that much but I know I'm gonna be
wearing this all the time this is the
Atkinson biker jacket and I got a size
zero for reference so it looks like this
I just think it's so beautiful it's like
amazing quality and it's just gonna be
like a timeless piece that I can wear
all the time so I got this next I got
this jacket from Lululemon I really did
not need to get this but it was on mice
what in my size and on sale and the only
one on sale and this is my favorite
style of jacket by them it's the define
jacket it looks like this it's just
super flattering it kind of like hugs
your curves a little bit and the back
looks like this it's just like a really
cool black-and-white pattern and I
thought this would match like any solid
color bottoms so yeah this is on sale
for it wasn't cheap it's on sale for 79
originally 118 and they raised the
prices of their stock which is super
annoying these used to be like 100 but
yeah I know I'm aware there's a ton okay
like I said I got
whatever from necessary clothing but I
left that at home so the last thing I
have to show you are these shoes I got
you guys thought really that Mel got a
pair of bragging bone boots from that
sample warehouse sale we went to and I
got these though by the brand ancient
Greek sandals and they just have some
like cheetah print fur mm I thought
these were really cool and these were
$33 originally 151 or 171 or something
like that so yeah I knew I had to get
these I think they'd be so cute with
like that leather jacket and some black
jeans and stuff so yes that's what I got
I hope you guys enjoyed this little
follow me around video let me know if
you guys want to see more videos like
this and I will do them I love you guys
all so much and thank you for watching
