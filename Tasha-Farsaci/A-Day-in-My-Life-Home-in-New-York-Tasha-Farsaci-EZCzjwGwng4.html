you guys can see the background you can
probably or maybe not tell that I am NOT
in my la apartment basically I am home
for two weeks you guys probably know
that my class ended so I wanted to come
home just for a little bit to see my
parents and catch up with friends and
stuff and then I am going back to LA
well yeah basically if you guys are new
to my channel or you haven't seen a lot
of my videos I am from Syracuse New York
area originally so that's why I am it's
a lot different from LA that is for sure
basically I just wanted to do a little
blog today I'm seeing some friends I
think I'm like cooking with my best
friend Mel later so yeah I thought I had
flogged currently I just woke up so I
have no makeup on you know my skin is
like not doing too hot yeah so I just
wanted to do a little intro for you guys
it's kind of cold out today it's so
weird yesterday it was like 90 degrees
here and today it's not even 60 degrees
so the weather here is so bipolar so
anyways yeah I'm getting lunches and
friends in the area so I'm going to get
ready and then I will come back to you
okay guys so I just did most of my
makeup except my mascara don't mind the
background yeah I actually kind of hate
my room from high school weird right
anyways I enjoy my mascara yet because a
company just send me deep mascaras from
Amazon and I wanted to do visit I can't
speak I wanted to do my first impression
live on this vlog so basically these are
3d lashes mascaras and it says on their
website or Amazon page that they are
supposed to mimic the look of fake
eyelashes or eyelash extensions and it's
basically one of those mascaras where
you have the normal mascara and then you
have the one of the little fibers that
you brush on and then you put this back
on and it's supposed to make your
eyelashes pop a lot so I'm going to try
this right now
and I will have a link to this down
below in the description as well as a
coupon code for you guys in case you
want it so first
going to take it be step one and three
and I'm just going to put this all over
my eyelashes
okay so well step one is still wet
you're supposed to put on the fibers so
I'm taking a little fiber one and my
thigh with a black which is good and I'm
going to brush this over my lashes weird
it's cool but so we're looking okay so I
think I've applied some fibers so I'm
going to take steps one and two again
and now I'm just going to coat my lashes
and we will see how this turned out if
you look at something that takes some
practice so I'll definitely have to
practice a little bit more okay so this
is how my lashes look I'm not sure if
you can see them I think this works
I definitely the practice would like
strategically placing the fibers next
time and making sure I have them you
know where I want them to but yeah I
think the concept is pretty cool and
it's something new to try out if you
like trying mascaras and stuff so I will
definitely be linking that down below
okay I don't even know if you can see
this well you really can't do this um
but this is my outfit I'm wearing a
flannel oh my gosh you can see this
flannel with a denim jacket and then my
black jeans and then this black crop top
underneath and I think I'm gonna wear my
checkered vans with it so yeah hi guys
so I'm back I talked and I didn't vlog
at all at lunch weird and then I wanted
my dad to go test drive cars because I'm
planning on leasing a car this summer
once I get back to LA so I was just kind
of test driving them with him and then
we would hear my favorite goodwill if
you guys I don't know if I really talked
about it a lot but I love drifting not
only for things for myself like I always
fit flannels when everyone wearing a
flannel it's always drifted just cuz I
like how they fit more anyways yeah and
then I also like finding things to
resell I think it's - wait wait a great
way to like make money yeah I don't know
I feel like a lot of people do that but
yes so I went to my favorite thrift
store around here and I guess will show
you guys what I got okay I don't play
you can see me for the first
the flannel and I don't know if I'm
going to keep this or sell it because I
do have one with these colors already
but this was half off so I had to get it
it's just like with classic black and
red checkered slam old shirt which is
great and it's nice an oversized super
soft I have to wall shelby's obviously I
watched him before i resell anything and
then i also picked up a few Syracuse
University things because first of all I
don't have any I am from here so it's
nice to have some for I might retell
them so I found this really cool vintage
looking t-shirt and it's all nice and
embroidered on here and then I really
liked how it was like one of the ringer
tees with like the contrasting like
collar and sleeves so yeah I got this I
thought it was really cute and then I
found this really cozy crewneck
sweatshirt it's kind of a little bit
pili but I think that just adds to the
look so it's just this gray Coon egg
it's a Syracuse and then it's just super
long and comfy and then it says cues on
the sleeve so I think once I wash this
and it's like smells good it's gonna be
all cozy and then I got one more thing I
don't know if this even fits my head I'm
not going to put it on until I wash it
but it's this camo New York Yankees hat
and I probably would have back in the
day thought this was so ugly but came
out with like trendy right now and I
love hats so yeah it's just like a camel
Yankees hat and I thought this would be
it could be really cute even with like
what I'm wearing maybe not the flannel
but yeah I'm going to wash this see if
it fits my head we will see but yeah
that's what I picked up from the v store
I'm currently making some guac and then
my friend Mel is going to come over and
we're going to make egg rolls
she found like avocado bacon egg rolls
like always Pinterest egg roll recipes I
guess like you like hit the camera now
yeah so we have to go pick up some stuff
in the store and then we're going to
make those and I just thought it was
lonely for you guys
because look how dark the sky is I
honestly think it has to down down down
for soon what do you think obviously
there's a good chance it doesn't even
look at dark on camera whatever thumbs
up if you guys know what wag mins is you
can't you can see the sides hell yeah Oh
smell what did you just finish the
filling for crab rangoon a girl yeah I
don't really like crab or seafood so
this one probably won't be mine but we
got the egg roll wrappers you have no
idea how to do this but yeah we have
that there's my guac that's turning
brown now I think next is going to be
the bacon avocado one we have the bacon
going I like my bacon crispy like this
video if you like your bacon crispy I
like my bacon crispy listen yeah it's
like when we were stirring the mac and
cheese or the other vlogs oh my god you
think this is enough yeah for sure
that's yeah trying to make it more
horizontal I don't know probably not I
feel like that's good so we had some
leftover chicken from the other night so
I'm going to try and make like a buffalo
chicken one I think I'm just going to
put in some hot sauce with this chicken
and then I'm going to try sour cream
because I don't have cream cheese and
then some cheese and I feel like if we
dip it in ranch that would be good so
far we have these to use the crab
rangoon ones
okay Mel's I roll compared to mine I
look so bad hopefully they taste good
with you fry them though so I didn't
really feel like dumping them with
dunking them completely into oil
sometime just letting them sit there in
the bacon grease and I hope it works out
it'll horrible
so see I look so ugly right now well
they they don't completely horrible I
just created some ranch in here and the
bacon bowl your ratchet ass Ã¤j--
yeah they don't know really hot I know
they are so hot
so we'll update you once we try them
alright here goes a nice dip in the
ranch I'm going to be like flag did this
won't happen to me oh these are buffalo
chicken ones by the way oh these are
condoms really mm-hmm
