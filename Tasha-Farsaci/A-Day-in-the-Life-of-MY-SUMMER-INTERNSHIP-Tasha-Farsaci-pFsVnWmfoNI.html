bit of a tour so

money consumes like the top of like a
crab my skimmer that they're trying to

really cool meeting Katherine there was

excited about correct yes must stop

room and we just have a bunch of cool
stuff on the floor you can buy on dope
so yeah yeah cool books some shoes we
all took off but yeah it works
really windy and we left though Gretchen
got a spray tan stick so basically I'm
still logging an internship today
because we're going in a day in the life
of my internship because we are going to
the Rebecca Minkoff events and I told
you guys about this morning with Lee a
co-worker so I wanted to kind of log
that so waiting for our uber to go there
hi guys so it's actually the next day
now I apologize for not filming I
Rebecca Minkoff basically we got there
with Lee and instead of it being like a
woman in tech slash Rebecca Minkoff
event it was basically just like a
Rebecca Minkoff sale and so yeah we
didn't really film in there if I'm
editing this and it seems like it's too
short I will probably add in some clips
from today but I just kind of wanted to
end this blog with a little like a
little bloom of thought so obviously our
internship is different every day I know
you guys are probably watching this and
thinking like oh my gosh they get to
take pictures and just try on clothes
and film videos if they don't do
anything but yeah honestly our
internship of course is in like your
standard internship it is a start-up so
it's different every day and we are like
influencers so it's different for what
we do for them but we are so lucky and I
just feel so grateful to be able to have
gotten such an awesome internship this
summer that allows you to travel and
work with questions and yeah I just love
everyone it goes so if they're watching
this thank you guys so so much yeah what
like I said obviously it's not the same
thing every day we basically switch up
what we do every day and I didn't always
film everything that we were doing we do
post a lot on social channels and I know
I told myself physically making the dope
pics and stuff but I just thought this
video would be kind of fun and different
for my channel so I hope you guys found
it entertaining and maybe helpful or
inspiring for you guys because
internships are so awesome they teach
you kind of what you want to do and they
kind of help you think it's that kind of
stuff out so yes thank you guys so much
for watching it's customized last day
here in a sympathic Cairo my hair is
we're trying to pack up the hotel room
but
yeah I love you guys so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
