a mess I'm aware I'm just filming this
little intro segment and it's finals
week and I'm stressed out my rooms are
disastrous mess but like I said I just
wanted to do a quick little introduction
to this video basically all year I was
getting requests to do a day in my life
at campus and I was seeing a bunch of
people other youtubers that were in
college like Margo Ali and my friend and
Marie's do like week in my life college
type of blog videos so I decided I would
test that out for a week and honestly I
didn't pick the best week I literally
picked the last week of classes so it
wasn't really my typical week proof say
I don't know personally I don't think I
did a very good job with it for me I'm
not really comfortable yet with vlogging
on campus like completely ripping out my
camera as much as I am so proud of being
a youtuber and I love it
I also do like to separate it from you
know being a student so I'm not really
the type of person to be like oh hey I'm
in this class with all these people like
vlogging you know like I do try to be
more like low-key and like you know be
my own personal self as a student that
also happens to be a youtuber I don't
know if that makes sense but anyways I
definitely still Matan on campus I did
film little clips of campus but not a
lot of me actually vlogging on campus so
I apologize for that if I do do vlogs of
campus next year I'll try and work on
that I kind of slack them it was just it
was difficult it's not the best but I
still hope you guys like it I think
that's all I want to say in this intro
so let's get onto the vlog hello guys
it's currently 7-eleven 712 a.m. on
Monday I clearly look really really good
so Monday are the hardest for me one
because we Mondays but - I have a
discussion at 8 a.m. if you guys go to
bigger schools you probably you probably
have discussions as well basically we
have lecture and discussion at USC
lecture obviously has like a lot of
students in it so because of that once a
week you have discussion where it's only
like 20 students in the class
and you have a TA and you kind of like
go over what you went over in a lecture
or just like any questions people may
have and this discussion is at 8:00 a.m.
and then I don't have class again until
2:00 p.m. so it's literally so hard to
get motivation to go and what I normally
do for this class is I get up like ten
minutes before I have to leave throw on
some sort of like comfortable clothing
item don't put any makeup on clearly or
do my hair go to the 50-minute
discussion and come back and I'm sleep
for like two more hours and then get
ready actually like wear cute clothes or
whatever so I'm so tired and I look like
a man that's really chill okay so the
previous weekend was actually like the
USC book fair festival thing so that's
why I was a bunch of tents on campus
still they were taking them down this
week but this is me just walking to
class this is like the main part of
campus it's so pretty it's honestly
probably my favorite part of campus I
just want to show you that a little bit
but I walked past this area to get to
class and yeah so I'm basically just
showing you guys my route to class and
this is the building my classes in it is
mudhal it's so so beautiful as you will
see by the architecture honestly UFC's
buildings are so impressive to me so
yeah I really like this one and wanted
to show you that
okay well I'm back I was literally the
most pointless class my life we got out
at 8:30 it started at 8:00 because we
had nothing to do like discussion
sometimes can be the most pointless
thing ever
so yeah I'm gonna go back to bed now
hopefully I can fall back asleep and
then wake up in like hour - and look
like a human okay so I took a very nice
long nap
and got ready and now I'm going to class
I'm wearing this red dress that I think
is some like the wrong way or example or
one of the places I think it's an apple
but I know it's like a free people
coffee
yes Chester is here but I will talk to
you later I'll probably film a little
bit on campus so yeah honey hello guys
don't mind my messy room but it's
Chester and no bad what are you doing hi
hello I got to go to class literally 12
years later I have my drink I got a Java
chip Frappuccino with an extra shot I
haven't gotten a cappuccino in so long
but it's good so I'll talk to you guys
when I'm back in my apartment okay so I
just got back from class I mean will
some of my job a trip Java just whoa
Java chip I think I need to try to
organize this do you guys see this bed
this is my other bed if you guys have
seen my room tour and stuff you know I
have too but this is all I clean laundry
stuff from like haul videos and I just
did laundry so that's a disaster and I
think I have friends coming to stay with
me this weekend so I really need to
clean up my room at some point in time
vegan people don't today
hello guys happy Tuesday once again
ignore the background fan I think it's
broken it's literally like dripping
water but probably Paul maintenances
haven't gotten to that anyways today
normally my long day of classes I
normally have class from 9:30 to 9:30
with only like our breaks in between but
one of my classes actually got canceled
and it's the longest one it's the four
hour class so that one's like you're in
the middle of the day and got cancelled
so I'm going to have a nice long break
anyways I'm wearing this romper I'm
going to show it in an upcoming haul
video it's some kinds of poly and then
this necklace is by a rock the moon that
jewelry I will try and link them down
below this clip is just of me looking
like I'm walking through a wind tunnel
on campus because it's so windy
like literally please look at this guy's
like what the heck is that
this is Annenberg this is the
communication school which I am in this
is the newer building there's an older
one as well but here on the left and was
walking to class and here's me in class
like the first one in there because yeah
I just like to be early yeah so this is
me walking to my next class this is kind
of like the cinema film area of campus
if you guys know USC you know they're
very big for cinematic arts so yeah this
was me just walking to my my cinema
class actually this is honestly one of
the most beautiful parts of campus as
well I just think it's all beautiful but
this cinema school or the cinematic art
school is super super pretty so this is
me just walking in kids ear and then
this is the view from the outside of my
class so I'm just waiting for class and
this is what you can see from outside
the window and those chairs I sit in
while I wait to class
I know super exciting okay so I just got
back from class it is now
211 I ate like a sandwich in my leftover
pizza from last night but I got a box
from the mail around the 2020s
like
wanted to do like a little mini haul in
this video I actually made an entire
collection with the 20/20 apps I'm going
to link my collection down below so if
you guys want to see my favorite items
on their site right now as well as these
few things that I picked out they will
be on the link down below they have
really cute stuff and everything is so
so affordable we actually very
affordable I have a coupon code for the
collection it is seriously Tasha x-15
for 15% off so I'm going to put that on
the screen as well as in the description
box totally take advantage of that and
then I will also be doing a $100
giveaway with 2020 apps so I'm going to
put all the information with that as
well in the description there's only
check out the description of the video
and you'll be able to see all the stuff
that has to do in my collection in the
giveaway and these products okay so the
first thing is an accessory it's just
this suede belt this is like super cute
for festival season not that I went to
Coachella but I think it would have been
so cute and I think it'll just be nice
to add to any outfit it looks like this
I'm not really sure how I'm gonna wear
this yet but it has these really cool
ties so this was super cool I got this a
really nice linen made dress this is
such a cool material and I picked it out
in this olive green color it has like
this tie up detail and then it goes down
MIDI links and it has these little slits
on the bottom this is so comfortable and
like loose and great for the summer
because you're not going to get too
sweaty in it next thing I got is this
black bra mat which I really wanted
because it looks just like a Free People
one that I have in a green color so it
looks like this it's black and then it's
high-neck and it has this really cool
kind of cut out thing going on
okay I got this crochet top which is
really similar to one that I just showed
in my haul my previous haul video but
this one you throw that one that I
showed the sleeves were like really long
on me and this one it has like a lace up
detail instead it's a little bit
different and I was hoping the sleeves
wouldn't be as long on this one so it's
this really pretty crochet top like I
said it has some lace up and then it
goes down like this the sleeves are more
like a bell sleeve okay and the last
thing that I got from 2020 AB is this
white bodysuit this one's really cool
it's super deep cut which i think is
really flattering and then
like this is like a song kind of medley
song booth Chiqui I don't want like
bodysuits or full coverage like it like
underwear line yes the best of stuff i
designed the mail from a 20/20 app once
again if you're interested in my
collection the giveaway or any of the
things I showed totally check out the
description box and go check them out
hello guys so I just got back in class
and I was you can tell from that little
clip I got Chipotle because the class is
so long that I just start thinking about
food and I didn't eat before class
sewing all I was thinking about the
whole time with Chipotle burrito so I
got that I'm about to eat it but I want
to say when I get in Chipotle also don't
mind my little room because if you're
either a new viewer admires haven't
watched like vlogs of mine before I
cannot stand cilantro it's not like I
don't like cilantro if I physically
cannot eat it it tastes like I can't eat
it like I will if I smell it like I
can't with cilantro and basically
everything at Chipotle has cilantro in
it but life hack you can get their
rights without the cilantro so I do that
and I just could have burrito with rice
and then black and pinto beans are
YouTube chicken but I don't anymore
because they're chicken look weirds me
out like I'm kind of picky about chicken
and I feel like their chickens always
like chewy and it's just like weird
business so I don't get chicken anymore
I just get both beans and then I get
lettuce cheese and sour cream and I feel
like this not a lot but I really like it
I don't know if that's what I get let me
know what you guys get or what if you
don't like cilantro either I know like a
lot of people don't what do you get
Chipotle let me know cuz i know like all
our salsals have it and their guac habit
like I would get salsa and walk but both
have cilantro like it's so annoying
anyways yeah I'm going to eat that
burrito I really want to go to gym
snakes I haven't worked out and so so
long but I'm always so tired after this
class and now
I'm going to eat a giant burrito that
probably won't be the best idea so good
morning guys so I just showered and then
I'm going to class soon I'm kind of
annoyed because I think my this thing is
broken because it's dripping on the
floor and it's been dripping for few
days and I thought maybe it would stop
but it's not so I probably to call
maintenance I'm calling it my room still
disaster I don't want them to come in
here when it's like super gross so clean
my room
but anyways I'm excited to go to my
discussion today because our TA emailed
us and have doughnuts for us on the last
day she's literally the nicest Tia ever
I'm going to insert a photo of the
doughnut she sent to us so I'm excited
Joey Jonah there's the track throw raft
when I ran track honestly can't believe
I did that and then here is the better
look at the communication school it's
super super cool it's fairly new and I
love it ok so everyone's a USC has a
farmers market kind of thing I tried to
film it the best I could there's like
jewelry as well as you know actual
farmers market stuff like food and
fruits and super cool I felt really
awkward here like it looks so obvious
out of so many people but here's a
better look it actually gets pretty busy
and it's just a really cool thing on
Wednesdays and here I am waiting for my
next class with my pink drink and I'm
back in like the Cinematic Arts kind of
side of campus good morning guys happy
Thursday so fun fact I slept in this
makeup I realized this morning that I
was out of makeup wipes and I just I
just ordered some on Amazon so like I
have some coming just like one of those
things I hate buying like my parents
used to buy them for me and now like in
college it's like oh god I have to
bother with myself so they're actually
like pretty expensive so anyways uh yeah
this is the same makeup from last night
I was like I can either like go to a lot
of effort and wash it off with like soap
and water or I can just sleep in it and
wear the class because I only have one
class Thursday mornings I have it from
9:30 to 10:15 and I'm done so this class
is also hard for me to a go to and be
look
good for so I normally just dress really
casual I guess I'll show you what I'm
wearing I clean my room by the way guys
I'm so proud of myself it's not like
fully clean but I have friends coming
tomorrow so I knew I had to get it done
okay so I'm just wearing this black
Lululemon tank top with these Lululemon
leggings and then I'm wearing flip-flops
right now but I'm probably going to put
on my all-black Roches I don't know
where they are
okay and like so many of you guys have
been asking me how I store my clothes
this is my closet in case you're
wondering I do have drawers and stuff
under my bed bed as well but yeah I have
a problem I'm going to donate some
clothes as well as the ones that I sell
on Poshmark and stuff like that so can't
believe my last class is over so sad my
campus I'm waiting for the shuttle now
so now wow that's so weird
tell me how I get pan or in myself pan
and I don't I just go to lay by the pool
for like an hour so like whenever I can
so I've asked where I'm headed now yeah
so I'm going to lay out for like an hour
only one here this never happened
hi guys oh I'm kind of a failure I don't
even know when the last time I have
loved was but basically it's a lot later
now it's honestly the next week a lot of
things just came up I had friends that
were coming to visit and a lot of things
were going on so I didn't vlog the rest
of the week but I think you guys kind of
got the gist of it I think I have enough
footage so I wanted to yeah I apologize
if this video is a complete complete
fail but I did the best I could
nevertheless I hope you guys like this
video I hope it wasn't too horribly
boring please leave a comment down below
I love video comments honestly so fun
entertaining for me to get your feedback
and yeah so I love you read it so so
much
