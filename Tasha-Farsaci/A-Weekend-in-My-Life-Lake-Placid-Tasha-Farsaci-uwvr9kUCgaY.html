because my peers and I are headed to
Lake Placid for the day and then we're
staying a night and then we're going to
give in this why do I never speak right
in my videos u.s. probably think I
really cannot talk saying tonight
tonight and then a little bit of
tomorrow you guys you guys have probably
heard of Lake Placid because I know the
Winter Olympics have been held there
I don't know when don't put it on the
screen but yeah so basically I just
really like hiking a lot lately and the
Adirondacks which I like the mountains
by Lake Placid are the only places that
are like legit hiking spots around where
I live I think it's like four hours
three hours four hours away so it's not
like right where I live but it's so cool
I think the only time I've ever been
there I was like 1 or 2 so yeah I'm
really excited to go so I'm between this
new hat I got ok one of you guys tagged
me and I'm Poshmark actually I don't
know what the subscriber of this
assuming it is because why else did you
know I'd want it but it's a baby pink us
see how it says UFC so you guys you're
watching this river canyon is on
Poshmark like hell yeah thank you and if
you guys ever see anything on Pascha
more that you think i'd like totally tag
me in it yeah I'm wearing that I'm going
this pink sports bra that I'm wearing at
the back like really cool and strappy
it's some forever 21 actually um I
didn't bring like any cute boys it's
almost just like at my house so yeah and
then I'm wearing this just this
sweatshirt from brandy melville it's so
soft and then I'm just wearing some
leggings from Lululemon
so yeah it's pretty early right now it's
like 8 a.m. so I guess I will update you
guys later update I swore I brought my
cue loulou bra and I was right I just
found it so I'm actually going to change
into this one we made it kind of
you're going to high hike Mount Joe so
we will see we saw you and their rocker
probably not so rocky so muddy so we
have to walk like all the way up here
instead of the actual path slightly
annoying oh great
lovely we made it yay yay down we go
five you this tree looks like something
you'd see in a Harry Potter am i right
it literally looks like you could come
alive any second okay so we're back from
a hike we made it back to our hotel room
and I just changed my clothes because I
think we're going to walk around town a
little bit so I'll try to show you my
outfit in this little mirror over here
okay so this is what I'm wearing I'm
wearing a black tube top and then some
gray jeans and Topshop this black and
red small checkered flag and then of
this black ripped up denim jacket which
will be in a haul video soon so yeah I
really like it I think it goes with the
vibes here and it's a little bit chilly
guys so it actually the next day
now I am wearing the same outfit because
I only wore this for like not that long
at all and I think it's cute and I'm
really bring a lot of clothes but
basically I don't remember the last
thing I bought last night we didn't do
much everything on the Main Street like
closed really early at like 6:00 so
we're going back there today I think
we're going to walk around a like a
little bit and then we're going to head
back to the poster rain oh yeah I
thought I'd take you with me my hair is
a disaster I don't even care I barely
slept because my dad snoring it does
foghorn so but yeah I guess I'll bring
you along we left for dress today not
sure if you can see this but that big
slide ramp thing is the Olympic skiing
jump so crazy that's literally so scary
got my McDonald's medium caramel iced
coffee aka the best iced coffee Ezra and
we're about to walk on some nature trail
so hopefully we don't end up in the
middle of nowhere
no it's okay
I want to go with tubing in there
I think booming we can't you enjoy what
you're doing
you can it but it feels like a rat Queen
jump down and attack your face fine
that was anticlimactic a prepper this is
just a Main Street and we're going to
walk around a little bit look at this
little moose guy guys I want to see a
moose so badly I got chicken sausage
gumbo and we are here
so I'm excited oh yeah she went healthy
hey guys so we just got back from Lake
Placid and I would be finishing a blog
but as you can tell from little footage
I got before this we stopped at a thrift
shop because like I said in my last vlog
I loved drifting and I actually found
really really good stuff so I want to do
a little mini through top for you guys
so the first thing I got is this plaid
mini skirt really really cute and it has
like little slits on the sides so I got
this it fit me perfectly next I got a
shirt so I think I'm going to resell
this is a champion shirt innocent men's
champion shirt except it's a large so it
fit a girl's like a t-shirt dress and
it's really cute and red super cute it's
just like really trendy right now so I
thought I'd pick it up I think it would
be like a little big on me but if you
want it check out my Poshmark
cuz I'll probably be listing this once
I'm back at school next we got this
pepsi shirt I don't know I might be
selling this as well I just thought it
was like cute and something you'd see
like Urban Outfitters it's just like
faded it says Pepsi and then it has like
this little bringer collar and it's
super super soft so I got that then I
think my best find I was so excited I
found a pair of Levi's hi-rise mom jeans
these fit me perfectly on the way a
stitch is so hard to find normally when
I find them they're way too big and I'll
tell I'll clip with me trying them on
here but I just like pop them as a
bottom and they have like the Levi's
patch and they're super super great
condition so I was really excited to
find these and then last I found in
denim jacket and I wear denim jackets
all the time but most of mine I like
white light wash or they're ripped so I
found this oversized dark wash jacket so
I grabbed this and yeah that's what I
got thrifting it was pretty successful I
was excited
so yeah I think I'm going to end the
vlog here I'm through that I've enjoyed
it if you did be sure to leave a comment

love you guys so so much and thank you
