Nickelback go from being like because it
all just wanna be big oh when did they
go from that to literally being the most
hated people on earth
hashtag a Bolivian business Oh also she
let me know that Avril Lavigne then
married the lead singer of Nickelback
and my question is how did Avril Lavigne
go from Brody Jenner to the lead singer
of Nickelback my club girlfriend
though that was a good song that was a
good one for her alright well anyways
let me know why you guys think
Nickelback became a meme or the worst
band ever created apparently in the
comment section down below because I'm
curious when that happened let me know

number three in this vlog I think this
who are making that onesie bathing suit
number three this one is from LJ swim

the bike
down to the pier so I can take a picture
in this closed for them and then you
want to go to like coffee shop today
yeah yeah yeah there's this coffee shop
here if you guys are coming San Diego
you're probably like consciously I was
talking about but it's called like buzz
coffee and their slogan is life is
better buzz we want to know that's
illegal no but you're underage but
anyways I think right over there so
we're gonna do that and I want to take
Maya to La Jolla Cove because it's
really pretty
also romantic yeah in case you're
wondering the Wi-Fi password to this
Airbnb is romantic because this is like
