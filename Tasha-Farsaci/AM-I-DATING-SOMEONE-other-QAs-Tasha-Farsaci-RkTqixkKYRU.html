nother QA I recently posted one and then
I still had a lot of questions knocked
over that I didn't get to answer so I
figured I would just do another one for
you I apologize if I look kind of
disheveled in this video I'm basically
studying from finals and packing to go
home you guys would know if you've been
keeping up with my blog myths so he's
kind of disregard my appearance before
you know the questions if you guys are
not following me on instagram you
totally should because that's normally
where I post when I'm doing Q&amp;amp;A so you
guys can ask your questions ask your
questions on there I can't speak bye
anyways yeah when I'm gonna do Q&amp;amp;A I
normally post on Instagram and have you
guys comment your questions so if you
guys want to participate in the future
you guys should totally follow me on
there okay so one question that I always
get it's kind of along the lines of how
do I forward to buy new clothes all the
time or how do I make the money to buy
the clothes or basically just as a
college student how can I buy things
that I do so my first answer to that is
that YouTube is my job I do have an
income but for those of you that don't
have a job cannot have a job or do have
a job and are still looking for ways to
save money I have a great website slash
app for you guys
wait so the website is called thredUP
and it's so awesome it's basically a
website where you can buy really nice
secondhand items or even items that are
brand new with tags just from like
really really nice brands and retailers
for up to 90% off the website is super
easy to navigate you can filter by color
by style by size buy whatever you're
looking for and just like super fun like
trying to see what you can find so not
only are you guys saving money on the
things that you're buying but you can
also sell your own items all you have to
do is order a thread up clean-out bag
you fill it with the items that you want
to sell and then you send it out to
thread up and they do the work for you
so I recently got a few things from sped
up that I wanted to show you because
everything is so cute and it was so
affordable so I'm gonna put like the
original price and then the price that I
got the items for on the screen so you
guys can kind of just like get a little
idea okay so this is the box that
everything came in it's so big did fit
on the screen but it's such cute
packaging I took some photos of the
packaging as soon as I open it so I'm
gonna put those on the screen now to
show you everything is seriously so cute
the package in here
polka-dot it I love it okay the first
time I got some setup are these black
gladiator sandals these are from j.crew
they were brand-new and never worn
they're real leather they are so cute I
needed a nice new pair of black sandals
and I love these so much
literally pristine condition and so so
much cheaper than I would have gotten
them otherwise so I love these I got
this really cute dress by the brand name
of band Band of Gypsys I believe it's
just a black and gray and white kind of
print and it flows down you'll see that
everything I got looks really cute
together as an outfit so I thought that
was cool and then the back of this dress
is really cute kind of has some strap
details going on and of course they have
a cute little thread up tag but yeah I
just thought this was so cute okay and
my personal favorite fine I'm fed up is
this Marc by Marc Jacobs bag
it's so cute I've been wanting this tag
for so long but I didn't like spending
the money so it was so much cheaper and
thread up and the condition is amazing
it looks like this so pretty I've
already worn it I love it so much
yeah so honestly I love thread up it's a
great way to get designer or name-brand
items for a lot cheaper I actually have
a code for you if you guys want 40% off
your entire purchase
it's just Tasha 40 I'll put all the
information in the description box as
well so this video is sponsored by
thread up but honestly it's not
influencing my opinion at all everything
I said is so so honest and I really love
it I think it's such a great way to save
money it's a great way to shop and it's
a great way to also sell your own
clothes okay so the next question I want
to answer it's about my piercing if you
guys have been keeping up with vlogmas
you know I just got my triple forward
helix pierced and I'm having a lot of
questions about that or how I take care
of my favorite things and stuff like
that if you guys want an entire video on
that let me know and I could probably do
that anyways this is what the piercing
looks like it's triple forward here like
some of you guys were asking what the
name of it was a lot of you guys were
also wondering what the pain level of
this piercing was I really do
it was that bad I do have a high pain
tolerance but if you've had any of your
cartilage pierced it feels pretty much
like that honestly if you're okay with
pain I think it's very very doable it
hurt way less than my dog piercing so
yeah really not that bad pain wise in
terms of cleaning it I always just buy
the solution the cleaning solution from
the piercing salon the one that I get is
just like a spray one so you can spray
it on or you can spray it I'm going a
cotton swab and then clean it out and I
try to clean it at least like once or
twice a day so that's what I do you guys
can always google all the ways to clean
new piercings but for me that's what
I've always done okay the next question
is have I ever experienced anything
paranormal and personally I don't really
believe in ghosts I'm not really one
that believes in paranormal activity but
I do have a really funny story so this
was over the summer I was home alone in
my room and upstairs we have four
bedrooms at home so I was alone in my
bedroom and all of a sudden I started
hearing this music playing like I forgot
the name of the song I don't know it was
like this children's song and it just
started playing and I would hear it and
I was getting so freaked out I was home
alone it was nighttime it was dark and I
just heard this children's music playing
it was coming from the back guest room
so I went back there I it took like all
the courage in me to walk back there but
I remember I went back there and I heard
it and it was like stop so I go back to
my room when he would start again
anyways I finally not so freaked out
like I just went in there I'm just
looking around and I'm not being this
picture frame then we had it was like
this musical picture frame and it just
started like playing itself so weird so
basically I like took the batteries out
of it and like put it downstairs and
after that like my mom was making so
much fun I mean like she would just like
start playing it like every random times
to freaking out but like yeah it wasn't
so funny at the time I was like oh my
god like what is happening but yeah
comment down below if you guys had any
like paranormal experiences I think it's
so interesting to hear about because you
know I don't really believe in it but
then some stories like kind of sway me
so totally coming up
if I gotta have one superpower in the
world what would I have I don't know I
think it would be to read minds but only
at times I want to because like I
wouldn't want to just like have other
people's thoughts like always coming in
and out but like I don't want to be able
to choose like when I could read their
minds you know what I mean I just think
that'd be super interesting I guess
sometimes I probably hear things I
didn't want to hear but I think I would
choose that whenever I think of that I
think of like Edward Cullen throwback to
McFly light-days but yeah also I want to
hear your guys opinions and all these
questions so if you guys want to answer
them as well totally comment down below
a lot of you guys are asking what camera
I use actually right now I'm filming on
my vlog camera because my other one was
acting up like I kept playing the memory
card in and there was space but it would
just stop recording so I don't know what
what's going on with that but this is a
Karen g7x that I'm filming on right now
it's in my regular camera my DSLR if the
Canon Rebel t5i okay this is the most
famous person I've ever seen out and
about in LA so I don't know if it
answered this in a video before but I've
definitely talked about it I saw Ellen
DeGeneres I was at alfred's
coffee in like West Hollywood area and I
saw her I was extending outside studying
and she walked by yes I saw Ellen and
then also at the same exact coffee shop
I saw Joe Jonas I saw him there once and
then my roommate also saw him there once
so if you like Joe Jonas hangout at
alfred's because apparently he's always
there okay the Sun is going down so I
think I'm gonna again sir one last
question and that is a question that I
get all the time it's am i dating anyone
and the answer that doesn't know if I
ever am dating someone I will tell you
guys I'm not the type of person to like
put someone dating like all of my
channel but yeah if I'm ever have like a
boyfriend I would tell you guys I
wouldn't like hide it you know what I
mean right now like I'm literally about
to start at a new school basically
there's gonna be so many people so I'm
not only looking for a relationship but
you know if something does come along I
will let you guys know anyways thank you
