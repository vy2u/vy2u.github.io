welcome back to my channel so today I
have another cat little try on haul this
one this one's not gonna be that giant I
promise you eyes it's not that giant
it's smallish everything in this video
it's going to be from boohoo calm if you
guys have not heard of boohoo it's great

online store I love it everything on

items on their website that I promise

seriously guys take advantage of that
that's an amazing deal and boo boo is
also currently running a contest where

website so I will put a link to enter
down below as well okay so I'm going to

will be linked down below if you guys
want to get it in turn aviso totally
check down there and also one more thing
before I get on to showing you the
clothes if you guys are not following me
on social media I will put them in the
description I'll have my Instagram on
the screen if you guys just want to keep
up with me on a more personal basis
totally follow me on those okay so I'm
gonna start off with my favorites from
the news so the first thing I've
actually worn so many times already it's
just this little um smart cropped
bandeau thing it's not super cropped
so only when I see these they're really
really cropped like bra cut almost this
one's a little bit longer so I think
it's really cute the material is super
thick so you don't need to wear a bra
with this which I really really like it
looks super tiny but it stretches a ton
so it's perfect and like I said I've
been wearing this so often so I love
this okay the next thing is a pair of
overalls and I was really excited to get
these I actually wore these the other
day with that black little window thing
yeah I was really excited to get these
because they were petite I mean who has
a petite line I'm 5 foot 1 and I'm
pretty small so a lot of the times
things with pants are way too long on me
and these are perfect there like ankle
length on me which i think is so cute so
they're just these like medium wash
overalls and I just have some like
distressing
legs sorry up there little wrinkly cuz
yes I wore them well yeah they're ankle
length they're kind of like a girlfriend
fit they're not tight but they're not
like super super loose so yeah I really
really like these and I originally got
these in my size and they were too small
so I want to size up so if you guys want
to wear these keep that in mind I
believe I got this in the u.s. too and
I'm normally a zero the next thing I got
is a white denim jacket I've wanted one
of these ever since I saw one of my
co-workers at do't wearing one and yeah
I saw one on boo-boo it's really cute
it's just white oversized denim jacket
actually I don't know if it's supposed
to be oversized but I got it in a larger
size so it would be and I just has some
like distressing on it which I really
really like so yeah I love jackets I
literally have like a whole rack of
jackets because I think they're so cute
ok the next thing from boohoo I think is
so pretty it's such a pretty color I
don't really know when I'm gonna wear
this honestly I might just work to class
I love dressing up for class but it's a
two-piece set so the topic comes when it
looks like this it's just a little
little tube top thing it's flowy though
it's just really pretty powdery blue
color and then it also came with these
like culottes style pants let's see they
look like this and they're just like
super flowy like kind of cropped pants I
don't know I thought this was so cute I
just yeah I don't know where I'm gonna
wear this and the next thing is so funny
because it's literally the pattern I'm
wearing I love gingham so much and I've
been loving red and yellow but like red
as well so red gingham is my favor right
now so I saw this dress it's kind of a
weird material okay it's the same
material as that last two-piece and I
like it it's just not what I expected so
keep that in mind it's kind of like a
thick textured material but it's this
little mini dress I think it's so
adorable and yeah I love gingham dresses
I have like three of them and I cannot
get enough okay I got this pair of shoes
from boo boo I thought they were really
fun basically they're just these like
terracotta or orange colored sandals
they might know faux suede and I really
like them because they have a little
espadrille on the bottom and a girl if I
see something with a spur drill
I don't want it so yeah I just thought
these were like a really unique color I
think they'd be good to have like a pop
of color with an outfit and then the
espadrille is just so adorable so got
these before I forget I got another pair
of shoes with boo-boo I'm actually
wearing them right now they're kind of
dusty but they're basically these like
slide on black faux suede sandals I've
been loving slides lately they're so
comfortable and these ones are just like
really cute so they're not as like
slippery so yeah I don't know if you can
tell but they're really great they go
with everything and they're so
comfortable okay I got this pair of
jeans from boohoo and these are kind of
daring for me I've been loving striped
pants but normally the starred pants
have been wearing have been like flowy
or loose and these are like full-on
striped skinny jeans I don't know okay I
tried these on and I just don't know how
I feel so let me know what you guys
think of them I really really like them
I just don't know how to style them
either so let me know what you guys
think I think they could be really
really dope but I don't know if they
look good on me so let me know okay
going along with the whole striped pant
thing I got these pants because they
reminded me of a pair at brandy Melville
but they're a little bit long on me and
I just don't know if the fit is exactly
what I wanted so once again let me know
what you think they're just these black
and white stripe thing almost like
trouser pants but yeah I really had to
cuff them because I wanted them to be
like ankle length and I'm a midget okay
I picked up this giant cocoon sweater
they have this and a bunch of different
colors I just got this tan color it's
gonna be really hard to show but it's
basically just like a giant short sleeve
sweater which is really great for like
la winter cuz it's like fake winter but
this is just so good for layering I love
pieces like this you'll be able to see
it more in a try on than you just
showing it right here but yeah this is
super cute okay these last two things
are kind of similar and I was kind of
thrown off by the material I don't only
know if I love the material but I think
they're really cute so they're both two
piece sets and they're both polka-dotted
this one is a black and white polka dot
top it's just more like a cotton
material I thought it would be more like
a chiffon
fine but that's okay I think it still
looks really cute so this is the top and
then the skirt for this one is really
adorable it looks like this okay and
then the last thing from boohoo this one
I really really liked but I think the
shorts fit me like super weird so it's
really similar to that last two-piece
except this one is red the top looks
like this I think it's so cute this is
so Minnie Mouse Wow and then it just
came with these little flowy shorts but
the thing is when I put them on I feel
like they look like they're uneven on my
legs and I don't know if that's just
like my body I do have scoliosis so
maybe that's like causing it but yeah I
don't know I can't really tell yes so I
think this is everything I got from
booboo calm once again if you want a
twin with me and get any of it I will
have it all links down below as always I
love you guys so much thank you for
watching my videos and thank you for
sticking with me and stay tuned for my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
