you are new I am Tasha with my channel
seriously Tasha and welcome please
subscribe if you haven't already okay so
you guys may or may not have seen my
recent upload which was an affordable
swimsuit haul from sample calm and a lot
of you guys were asking me to do more
with different companies and different
brands and some of you even requested me
to be one from cup chicom so cup she
actually reached out to me and asked and
I wanted to try some of their sim suits
and stuff and because you guys have
requested it I said yes so yeah I did do
this for you I have so many swimsuits
United America I know that Mommy I am
obsessed with swimsuits
if you guys don't follow me on Instagram
and your interest swimsuits and stuff
you totally should so I always post like
beach photos and stuff like that what
you guys I just want to follow me it's
like a super personal outlet for me that
would be so amazing
anyways yes I am going to show you these
ones in some cup ChiCom today and I want
to do this video because these are very
affordable and I know a lot of swimsuits
I have are more expensive so I wanted to
show you guys an option of really
affordable swimsuits and being totally
honest these are really great qualities
I think the quality of these is better
than a one two examples but they didn't
like fit me that great some of them
didn't really fit me as you will see but
one thing about cup see that I do want
to say before I get into showing you the
suit is that the photos are kind of
weird that they don't have the best
quality photos on their site a lot of
them are kind of blurry it was kind of
hard to see what the actual suit looks
like so just keep that in mind obviously
you'll be seeing these students like in
real life so if you want to go back to
the links down below you can compare
them and you'll kind of see what I mean
so it is kind of tricky when you're
picking them out on the side but these
are all very good qualities so I can't
complain on that okay so I'm going to
start with my favorite swimsuit I saw
this one and immediately knew I had to
have it all so I did take the pads out a
lot of these so I'd only like padding in
my firm suits so this one that looks
like this is a striped bikini I thought
this looked cool because it has a
vertical and horizontal sharks
I just love spice lately that's like my
obsession right now like my print
obsession so I thought this was really
cute and it just kind of like goes down
in the back are all these in a size
small
way and as you have like no boobs I'm
like a 32a or 34a and then bottom is I'm
like a size zero or 24 so yeah I got
these on a size small and then the
bottom for this one look like this they
are more of a high cut bottom as you can
see and I really like these this is just
a smidge big on me I can definitely make
it work but if they did have say like an
extra small and definitely what I've
chosen that okay sticking it would be
striped kind of trend I got this one
piece because I just thought it looks
really cool it's this one be bathing
suit and I like this cheeky you guys
marry me not know that I love cheeky
bottom a lot of cup cheese swimsuits are
not cheeky so that's my one complaint
but I do know a lot of people don't like
to you bottoms so yeah there's that
anyway so this one is just a cool cheeky
one piece and the cool part is that the
whole side is open so you get like sighs
ooh I mean like I don't guess I do
because I have no boobs but if you did
have boobs size boobs once again it
could be a little bit smaller but I can
definitely make it work okay so this
next - I believe it's supposed to be
inspired by a Meiji or Maji I don't know
how to pronounce that brand swimsuit I
mean I like this it's definitely not you
know the same it's like the Meiji one
but it's still pretty cute this one is
just a halter neck top as you can see it
having a fun pattern and then the back
is crossing and then the bottoms are
nice as well they look like this they
are very cheeky I mean I guess it would
be cheeky for some people like they're
not like super like full coverage but
from either for each full coverage but
nevertheless I think these are cute
okay this next one we confirm them is
such good quality it's so soft and it's
reversible this one definitely looks a
lot more expensive than it is I would
say so it's just it's like brightly
pattern halter top it's another one of
those like high neck tops and it just
has like this tropical print and then
also have with this tie tied right on
the side so once you reverse it as you
can see it's like that tie-dye print so
that's like wool this is super soft and
then the bottom
you look like they'll call you a too
late on me not sure we'll see but
they're so soft you know the same like
tropical pattern and then like I said
they're all reversible so when you flip
it around it's this kind of print so
you're getting like two babies using one
with this one once again this one looks
kind of big and it's what they're small
size so with your my side
we'll see how it fits but it looks like
it might be a little big okay these last
few suits one cup see I wrote one pieces
and they're both too big on me
this is so strange because normally with
these like Asian websites
everything runs small but these are all
very large on these so we will see I
still think they're awesome so I'm going
to show you so the first one I think
this is inspired by a monster one piece
it's going to be kind of hard to show
and it doesn't really look good on you
so I'm sure I'll insert like a photo or
something so you can see what's supposed
to look like but it's just really
awesome red strappy one-piece I've been
really into walk yeah rad lately
especially like red bathing suit I think
they're so fun and then I have some
straps that go down and then the straps
like this on the bottom so it just won't
fit me it would have been awesome I'm
just like a little bit too short and
like too small I think for this one but
this one is awesome quality and if you
were like a little taller and just a
little bit bigger than me I think this
would be amazing and look so great okay
I just laughed bathing suit it's like
the same situation as the red one so one
piece the quality is so so great on this
it's one of those like seamless bathing
to Egypt I talked about my last one as
being like in my opinion the really
really nice quality it looks more
expensive so it looks like this is going
to be so hard to show but it is olive
green color and then I have like this
little tie in the middle and then it
just goes down well this is backwards
okay here we go
so it looks like this and then it just
goes down into your one piece bottom and
then the fast tide like so like I said
this is so cute and really really nice
quality but it's way too big on me this
is a small once again too big so if you
are my size you know be beware you up
sizing okay so those are all the bathing
suits but I also want to try out a few
of their clothing pieces if you show you
in case you were interested in those as
well so the first thing was kind of a
Miss for me but the second thing is a
hit so I so show you the Miss first you
guys have seen those like True Grit
jackets they're like the zip books that
are really fuzzy or like Sherpa zip ups
and I don't think summertime now this
doesn't make sense but I saw my website
and it looked a lot like both True Grit
ones or like Patagonia or anything like
that and I want to try it out and I'm
just I'm disappointed because okay from
first glance it looks like if you really
like fuzzy and like the inside would be
fuzzy but the inside is actually like
like like this material let's take a
windbreaker material so it's not really
fuzzy like the outside and the outsides
not only fuzzy like it looks like it
would be but it's not that soft I don't
know I would definitely like this if the
whole thing was this material I got this
in a large because I wanted it to be
oversized but I will probably be like
selling this on my Poshmark or something
I like my Poshmark down below I do sell
a lot of some system stuff on there as
well because you guys know I have time
but yeah this is not horrible it's just
like not what I wanted exactly out of it
but it's still cute and if you just want
the look of what that kind of True Grit
jacket you should try try this one out
again okay and then the last thing I got
from coffee is this really really cute
dress I like this a lot I feel like it's
probably inspired by or free people
dressed but it looks like this
especially off the shoulder kind of
denim looking dress and it has these
really pretty floral embroideries down
the sleeves and down the front this
please look like this and then it just
goes down it's like a little little
shift dress this is just super cute and
it's really great for the summer off the
shoulder like super trendy right now and
you know this isn't like the most
amazing quality there's some loose dress
but you know for the price I think it's
really cute and it looks like the
pictures so so those are all the items I
got from CAPTCHA comm hopefully this
helps you out if you want to order from
them I think bottom line is that all the
quality on at least for swimsuits is
really really great it's probably one of
the best quality out of the Asian
wholesale brand of bathing suits I have
tried except from me it's kind of hard
ones that fit because it seems that they
run kind of large so I wish they had
kind of like an extra small or something
like that but otherwise I think they're
awesome the pictures online are kind of
hard to tell what you're going to get
but everything I got looks pretty much
like the picture I hope this video helps
you out or I hope you found it
entertaining thank you guys so much for
watching and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
