o'clock in the morning and I'm about to
go to an orthodontist to get my braces
off I'm so excited you have no idea like
I'm so insecure with braces and without
them I used to have a huge gap and I
don't know I'm just really excited to
have nice teeth and yeah I decided I
would do kind of braces experience video
for you I know there's a lot of these
videos but obviously everyone's
experiences are gonna be different and
yeah so I just kind of wanted to show
you guys
maybe forward braces yum right yeah
before I came on with no braces so yeah
I am so excited and stay tuned
yay hey guys so I'm back and I don't
know faces and I'm so happy you guys
have no idea I just feel so much more
confident and I love it and I'm so
excited and yeah so basically now I'm
going to kind of go through my braces
experience and I'm mostly gonna focus on
getting them on and then getting them
off because in between it's just kind of
nothing really happens uh yeah and then
at the end I'm going to go on Twitter
because a little bit ago
I'm tweeted it asking you guys like ask
me any of your braces questions and then
I'll answer so this again and if you
guys notice that I'm wearing a different
shirt you will find out why doing this
video kind of embarrassing experience of
mine that um yeah it'll be interesting
to hear about so let's go okay so I got
my braces on I believe March first two
years ago so what would that be 2011 and
I got them off to a April 2nd so
basically two years that's what they
told me when I got them on so you know
they basically knew what they were
saying and that's the average I feel
like most people have them on for two
years obviously if your teeth are really
bad it's gonna be longer like my dad has
braces because his teeth we're really
getting to the point where they were
gonna fall out they were so bad and he
has to have them on for like three two
like three and a half years so it really
just depends on like the severity of
your teeth I had a pretty big gap if you
guys watched my videos from two years
ago before I had braces and uh yeah
they're pretty straight now I'm so happy
guys yay um yeah I got a pretty big gap
and then a lot of like crowding and
stuff I mean they weren't like
completely terrible but you know to you
is he's like the standard so getting him
on it was a long time ago but I remember
it was kind of it wasn't it didn't
really hurt it was just kind of
uncomfortable I remember I had to like
put this thing in my mouth it like
spread my mouth apart and they just kind
of like glued the stuff on I had to wear
these stupid glasses I was
really funny and they just like glue
this stuff on you know whatever and I
mean that wasn't that bad it was
basically just after getting them on
that felt really bad um you know it just
felt wrong in my mouth like obviously
it's gonna feel weird but it felt really
weird for me and it hurts so bad
um I mean that's like scary you guys if
you guys are just getting braces but
when you first get them on it's gonna
hurt pretty bad unless your teeth really
perfect which I don't know why you'd be
getting braces then but it's gonna hurt
pretty bad you're not gonna want to be
eating anything like that you're gonna
have to bite into
so like pudding and yogurt and like
applesauce and stuff that's gonna be
like your best friend
it just mostly felt weird if I like that
stuff like did not belong there I wanted
to like rip them off but I'm glad they
didn't I didn't know obviously and it
just it really wasn't painful to get
them on more uncomfortable you know you
had to like keep your mouth open and
like you really they're like saliva and
like space like coating it it's really
embarrassing because they had like suck
it up and stuff I remember that but the
pain lasted for like a week or two
afterwards and obviously it got like
better as the days went on so it's like
it's tolerable it hurts pretty bad your
mouths gonna get like ripped up a little
bit but they will give you wax for that
I'm gonna try and grab that really quick
okay I kept my wax for this I've only
ever used it once and it wasn't even
like on my braces on but basically it
looks like this don't want my nails so
now painted and you take like a little
piece of this and followed up and like
put it on the part where the braces are
rubbing and honestly it didn't really
work very well for me it kind of like
fell off and stuff but it thinks it
makes it feel better like if you're
having a hole in your mouth after that
it doesn't really hurt I mean once in a
while when you get them tight in it'll
hurt a little bit but nothing in
comparison to when you just got them on
like my gap one time it hurt really bad
because they put on like special rubber
bands to pull my gap together and her
gap closed in like five hours and that
was pretty painful but really it's not
gonna hurt anything in comparison to
when you first get them on so after you
get them on it's kind of just like
smooth sailing
until you get them off okay now getting
them off I was not really worried I
thought it was gonna be like fine of me
because I really high tolerance of pain
like I can I can like deal with it I
don't like him so um I went in to get
them off today so I'm gonna keep
touching my hair because it's bothering
me I went in to get them off and
basically the first thing he did was
just to grip them rip the wires right
off and that didn't really hurt to read
it kind of just like it didn't feel good
but it didn't hurt you know too bad
he literally just ripped them off so
then obviously my teeth were still
covered in like the cement and stuff so
then the orthodontist like grinds me off
or something and that is where I started
to hurt um I don't know if I really
sensitive teeth but it kind of felt like
when you bite into something really cold
and it hurts so bad that's what it felt
like for me and not necessarily I'm like
my back teeth but on like my front teeth
in the center
oh I honestly thought I was gonna die it
smelled like something was burning in my
mouth and now for the embarrassing part
okay this is so embarrassing I don't
know if this is normal all right well
this is why I changed my shirt something
that showed I was wearing was new and I
was like all excited wearing or whatever
so okay I think is normal for your gums
to bleed when you get your braces off
cuz people have told me that because
like the grindy thing like it's really
deep into your gums but mine was
bleeding a lot and I was just sitting
there like I had Lipa chills because it
hurts so bad and he was taking him off
and all of a sudden like I felt
something wet on the back of my neck
I just didn't we think of it I thought
maybe I was imagining it cuz like I was
just like in pain but then I kept
feeling it and then he was like saying
stuff I wasn't really understanding what
he was saying to me my were that honest
and he told me to go brush my teeth so I
get up and there's like a bloody trail
of like spit and drool like going down
it's a pool on my back it stained my
shirt let's just talk about that like my
blind rule okay and then I go to like
rush my teeth and it's all blood like
everywhere it was so disgusting so I'm
like okay I need to control myself now
like that
gross I'm really embarrassed so I went
back and I was like I'm so sorry this is
so embarrassing and he's like oh it's
okay
I could tell he was getting kind of like
grossed out whatever and then like I did
it again and out on Misty and like I
couldn't control myself I'd I would just
be sitting there like oh my god this
hurts so bad and I just feel like
they're all like coming out it's so
embarrassing
whatever I'm glad that experience is
over I think it was just an extreme case
for me I've never heard that happened to
anyone else um
they stopped bleeding after like five
minutes it wasn't anything like crazy
except when I was drawing um yeah so
that was nice experience with getting
them off honestly they don't hurt at all
I have to get them off it's just like
the time would have grind into cement
off your teeth I think I was just an
extreme case but you never know if
that's happened to any of you you know
let me know by the way I didn't get the
stain out of my shirt my mom like washed
it but so embarrassing why if I had to
compare getting them on getting them off
which one hurt more um getting them on
her it more a long time it hurts like a
week or two after but getting them off
and hurt like more intensely just I
don't know I'd say hey I don't even know
I guess it's personal preference cuz it
doesn't hurt at all now my gums are
pretty swollen but it feels pretty good
in comparison to having metal in your
mouth so now I'm gonna go onto Twitter
by the way my phone case is from wealth
iPhone cases because I missed a your
typical Gullu
hashtag guru probs alright let's see
some of these questions how long did I
have it and once again like two years in
one month mmm did anybody stains in your
Tina that how long does it take to get
them off okay I'm lucky I gonna be
stains on my teeth I know people that
got him off could have like white spots
I was so scared that was gonna happen to
me I really don't know how you would
prevent that I know they give you like
you can buy like fluoride treatment like
swish around your mouth at night and
that's supposed to prevent white spots
as long as you like brush your teeth and
stuff I guess that's all I can say
because you don't want white spots
you're gonna like
endure the braces you want to have nice
teeth you know when you get them off and
yeah do I think it's completely worth it
yes obviously I'm so much more confident
like I just get made fun of from my gap
in my teeth all the time and I was so
insecure about it and then having my
braces on I was like what are the last
people of my friends like only one more
good my best friend still hot braces I
wasn't the last one I just felt so
stupid I don't know just me cuz like
everyone else has them off at my age
like in my school so I think it's
definitely worth it at least for me if
that's like important to you I would
definitely get it they're expensive but
I mean I'm really I'm really thankful
that my parents got them for me and yeah
when they were polishing your teeth
didn't feel super cold yes that was a
good it's like like I said when you're
biting into something cool just like
that pain like the nerves in your teeth
like that's what it feels like oh I
don't want to think about it you are so
pretty oh thanks um and dinner here to
get them off yeah oh well yeah I pretty
much answered all the rest of them so
that's my braces video I don't know if
this was helpful maybe just funny
because that drooling experience yeah
well if you guys have any more questions
leave them down in the comments I will
try to answer them or other people if
you had braces and you know how to
answer them feel free yeah and yeah
that's all I have to say I'm so happy
now I need to get whitening strips cuz
my teeth are kind yellow if you guys
have any recommendations for teeth
whitening let me know because I'm very
interested so yeah I love you guys so
much and I'll see you guys at IMATS if
you go in this weekend holla bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
