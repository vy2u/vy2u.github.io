will hopefully be helpful for a lot of
you so I've been making videos for a
while now and being in YouTube who you
get a lot of questions from your
subscribers by far the number one
question or just the number one topic
that I get asked about is my hair it
makes sense I have really long hair and
it's pretty thick and it's healthy so I
definitely understand why I get a lot of
questions on it so I just decided that a
good a video would just kind of be
answering all your questions about my
hair so if you're not familiar with me
or my videos this is my hair um I did
get it quiet a little bit ago so it was
longer than this but as of now it looks
like this and it's fairly thick I mean I
have like a good amount of hair so yeah
I asked you guys to ask me some
questions on Twitter with the hashtag
Tasha's hair so I'm just going to go on
my Twitter and read those ones
okay so I always get this question and
it's not really like my hair has been
long forever it's been long like a good
amount of time but I did have it like
fairly short like to here in like sixth
grade so it hasn't like it's not like
I've had my hair long forever and I just
don't cut it I do get my haircut every
three months because that's fine I get I
light it so I get it caught you know
about an inch off left and I got like
three or four inches off so it just
varies you know depending on how much my
hair is gone in the meantime my mom used
to have really long hair so it's
basically in my genetics that my hair
grows really fast so I can really help
you there it's basically just me but
personally I would not say to just not
cut your hair because then it gets
really gross I would say just do it like
I do it go like every three months every
six months or so and just get like an
inch or two off because that's just
gonna help your hair a lot in the long
run you do need to have a lot of
patience though because if you don't
think your hair is growing and you're
like okay whatever I'm gonna cut it all
off
screw this then obviously your hair is
never gonna get to the length that you
want it because you're just chopping it
all off
I normally switch out my shampoo and
conditioner I don't always stick to the
same exact one but as of now I am using
the Herbal Essences
hello hydration these smell amazing
that's probably one of the reasons I use
them and they make my hair smell the
same afterwards which I know like some
shampoos like your hair doesn't smell
like it afterwards but this one does and
it's still so good it smells like
coconut Kyoto so that's a one reason
that I love it but it makes my hair
really soft and it's really affordable
you can get it like anywhere so this is
great and it makes my hair soft and
everything so I definitely recommend it
I don't use heat on my hair every single
day I did today just for the sake of the
video but I with my hair natural a lot
I've kind of grown to like my natural
hair but obviously I do like my hair
better when I saw it style it with heat
so I try it and just use heat on my hair
like two to three times a week and I
don't wash my hair everyday so and
actually the style phase for a little
longer than a day
I really just like leaving my hair down
I feel like it's just super pretty and
natural that way but I like my best or I
like my hair best when it's lightly
curled it just takes the longest so I
don't normally do that if I want to sell
my hair I'm one way straighten it just
because it's quickest but I did you like
my hair best when it's in loose curls so
like I said I haven't really been
growing out my hair it's just kind of
gradually gotten longer um in like the
sixth and seventh grade it was just like
here and now it's the way longer than
that so I mean since then me getting it
like cut all the time it's really been
since then I guess but it hasn't taken
that long for it to get this long
because you guys have watched my videos
you know it's been this long for a while
so really I'm not totally sure you I
haven't been like trying to grow my hair
it just kind of happened
okay so there were a lot of products
that I have tried and used before just
kind of make my hair look nicer and I
just have a few to show you I don't use
these all the time but I use them once
in a while this is the Aussie hair
insurance split and protector and
basically you can just put this in your
hair after you get out of the shower and
it's mostly just kind of like help your
split ends and dry ends or whatever I
kind of forget to use this a lot but the
times that I have used it I like it it
smells amazing like all Aussie products
do and you guys probably know by now
that I love Aussie products I don't have
it with me right now but the Aussie 3
minute miracle is also amazing it's a
leave-in conditioner for your hair that
you can put it in the shower and I'm
literally obsessed with it and I'm
pretty sure mine is gone so I'm probably
gonna get a new one I also have the
organics Moroccan oil any kind of
Moroccan oil is great for your hair this
is just the one that is pre popular and
it's at basically all drugstores and my
target and stuff like that and this one
smells pretty good you can just put this
in your hair when it's wet and when it's
drying or I think even when it's dry but
it's a little bit greasy so I will
definitely only use this in my hair
while it was wet but it makes my hair
really soft and it also smells
this question kind of confused me
because I thought it was pretty
self-explanatory what my hair color is a
hum it's blond I don't know if you man
like the exact color but I don't dye my
own hair like I don't use a box dyes so
I don't have the exact color but
basically my natural hair color is a
dark dirty blond so if you just start
out with that and then just get lighter
blonde highlights I'm pretty sure you
would end up you know where I am
my number-one hair tip would you just be
be patient because bone hair is not
gonna sprout overnight I would say if
you just use some nice products and you
don't like you see every single day on
your hair and you're patient with the
growth process then your hair should get
long just don't be impatient and chop
your hair all off unless you really want
to I mean I would love to have shown you
but I'm too scared so I'm probably not
gonna do that your hair will go i pinky
promise you guys and that's like intense
because and you can't break a pinky
promise I hope this video answered some
of your questions about my hair and if
you have any more be sure to leave them
down below because I will try and apply
to as many of them as I can so be sure
to follow me on my Twitter because I
feed out a lot and I don't have a ton of
following so I never will get that many
responses definitely follow me if you
want to be included in these videos in
the future and also following in
Instagram it would mean the world to me
I love Instagram I'm literally obsessed
I post on there all the time and I would
love to have more of your eyes following
me and I love you guys so much I hope
this was helpful and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
