sit-down video and forever I'm so sorry
about all the after the weeks it's just
really hard for me to balance school and
YouTube and then come up with new ideas
I know everyone says that but it really
is hard some people don't understand
that but I have tried to film videos
they just didn't turn out well like I
tried this no heat overnight thing with
my hair I think it turned out awful so I
couldn't use that anyways today I am
doing a video on my ear piercings which
I know might not be like the most
interesting video in the world but I
feel like it could be really helpful for
a lot of people because I know a lot of
people are interested in getting ear
piercings and certain ear piercings and
places in your ear have been like really
popular lately with like Tumblr and
stuff like pictures and I have six ear
piercings so I don't know I mean some of
them might like the same spots but I
figured there in like most all places of
your ear that are like pretty common to
get pierced so I decided I would do a
video on them I recently posted a
picture of the two newest ear piercings
I got on Instagram when I was getting a
lot of questions on that picture so I
decided I would address them in this
video okay I made a list of things that
I wanted to go over on my phone here
okay
so first I'm just going to show you that
your piercings that I have I'm actually
wearing some pretty obnoxious earrings
today but you can still see you know
what piercings I have I'm going for my
hair up for this so you can see them
easier okay so on my left ear I have
these really crazy earrings in right now
but I just have my regular you know
normal your piercing I have my second
hole and I just recently got my middle
cartilage which it still hurts I
seriously just got it two days ago but
it's right there it hurts to touch but
yeah that's my left ear and then on my
right year I have obviously these two
the same my regular and my second hole
and then I have my top cartilage I'm
going to really quickly just put in
regular earrings not these so you can
kind of see what might use look like on
a normal basis okay so these are the
earrings I normally wear they're just
little pearls I normally always wear
these with these little diamond studs so
that's what this ear looks like normally
and then that's what this one looks like
okay so you guys are probably wondering
when I got these done the first few
things that I got were my first just
normal hole and I think I got those the
summer going into second grade so I was
probably like six or seven I'm thinking
the excuse thing I got was my regular
second hole and I got those in July of
2012 so pretty recently but they're
completely healed now
so then two days ago on Saturday I got
my two cartilages and the reason that I
got two was because I had to buy two
earrings and I didn't want to like waste
my money and just use one so I got both
sides and I really don't recommend doing
that because it's impossible to sleep
because cartilage piercings her a lot
more than a regular ear piercings so you
guys might know that I actually got this
one done a long time ago already if you
are an old viewer of mine you guys
probably know that if you do just tell
me because that's amazing but I actually
got this one before and it didn't close
up it kind of got infected when I had
mine done the earring backing wasn't
completely next to my ear there was some
of the post exposed so my hair wrapped
around it and it was just gross so it
closed and that's why I wanted to get
this wee one Rihanna for a while and
then I also have been wanting my middle
cartilage so that's why I got those
I got mine done with the gun all of my
few things have been done at piercing
Kagoda by the gun actually now my first
pulls weren't Claire's but all the rest
of them were piercing pagoda and I know
there's gonna be those people out there
that are like oh my gosh you should
never get to use done with a gun
especially curtilage it shatters your
cartilage but guys minor find my
cartilage is not shattered hum I once
again remember I had had this one done
before and there was like no remains of
it once it's already been closed so
maybe I just got lucky and nothing
happened but I'm just telling you that I
have gotten them done with the gun and
I'm fine um maybe the healing time is
faster with the needle or something I
wouldn't know but I'm just saying the
gun is fine with me and yeah
basically what the gun feels like that
sounds so funny okay well pretty much
picture having long fingernails okay if
you have long fingernails you can test
this out although I don't recommend it
but just think of how it would feel if
you pinch your skin really really hard
with your nails that's what it feels
like um definitely more intense for your
cartilage but that's pretty much what it
feels like it's really quick once you
get your ears pierced seriously it's
like one second they hit it and then you
don't even really feel it after that
until like ten minutes later it starts
to burn a little bit
okay the healing process now the healing
process is a lot quicker for earrings in
your ear imbolg area so I think that's
more like six weeks ish foot to heal but
your cartilage I know is 10 to 12 so
that takes longer and it hurts a lot
more lobe piercings they obviously hurt
but cartilage it hurts a lot more it
just pretty much feels sore and right
now mine kinda feels itchy because it's
healing if you touch it it feels really
store and tender and then it just kind
of stings when you're not touching it I
personally think it's worth it though it
doesn't hurt for that long probably like
a week and then it feels better but I'm
still in the hurting in time but I do
know because I got it done before one
and these two sides pretty much work the
same because the most cartilage so yeah
okay now for cost if you go to piercing
pagoda in the mall I mean I'm
recommending it
once again personal preference I don't
mind the gun if you go to piercing
pagoda and you get one of these little
diamond studs that I have flick all of
these a set of two is $50 and you want
gold ones especially for your cartilage
real gold and you want like the clasps
on the back that look like that look
like that see how it's like cover it in
the back and not want a little butterfly
one you want those so those come out to
about $50 and that's why I got both
sides done for my cartilage because I
didn't want to spend a waste like $25
you know because you have to use the
earrings that day
okay take care of them what you want to
do is either get your solution from the
plates that you get appears from so if
you go to like Kasem to go to eclairs
they have your solution there or alcohol
but I hear that's really too drying for
when you're first getting your piercing
so I definitely recommend that your
solution and I just take a little q-tip
and kind of clean around and squeeze the
juice into the hole oh my god that
sounded so perverted anyways just
squeeze it make sure it's all throughout
the piercing and then you want to twist
your earrings around and you want to do
this one or two times a day they said to
but I'm kind of bad and I do it once but
I'm gonna try to start doing it twice so
if you do that every day and make sure
your hair does not get caught in it I
like to kind of run my fingers behind my
ear so that I know there's no hair
caught in it because that really sucks
that's why having me last time then you
should be good so I think that's all I
really wanted to go over once again kind
of a short maybe boring video but I
thought it could be helpful
I personally love your piercings my
mom's not letting me get any more until
I'm 18 which sucks because I really want
my tragus pierced which is right here
and I really did want my triple forward
helix which is the three right here but
my mommy said no so that's why I decided
to this video now because these are all
the ones that I'm going to be having for
a while so I hope this video was helpful
if you have any more questions leave
them down below so maybe I can answer
them or somewhere else in the comments
if you feel like you can answer them you
know feel free to answer them yeah once
again this is my personal experience I'm
not by any means like some professional
person so you know don't think I'm like
a doctor or a professional pew sir or
anything but once again just hoping it
would help you out also leave requests
for new videos down in the downbar
because Vanessa down by the comments
because I'm really looking forward to
doing new videos soon so yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
