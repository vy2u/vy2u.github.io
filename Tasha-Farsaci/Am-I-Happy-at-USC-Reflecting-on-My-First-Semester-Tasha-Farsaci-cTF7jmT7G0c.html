and if you are new here I am Tasha
welcome so I know I said this in every
video but today I'm filming a super
requested video basically this video is
going to be my reflection on my year
slash semester at USC the university of
southern california i just finished all
my finals I'm officially done with this
semester and I can finally like reflect
to you guys upon the whole semester
rather than media students in the middle
so I thought this would be the perfect
time for me to do it
Pete's my little USP shirt right here
okay so I'm not going to go into the
details of my college process just
because I have a bunch of videos on that
already I will be linking them down
below but basically if you guys are new
to my channel I just transferred to USC
as a spring and MIT transfer as a
sophomore so I originally went to Loyola
Marymount University as my freshman or
firfer method I went to Loyola Marymount
University for my freshman year knew I
wanted to go to USC
transfer begat spring transfer so I
couldn't start until the spring semester
at USC so I just finished up spring
semester and Here I am I get questions
all the time about my grades and soft in
order to transfer and they are in one of
my videos I'd already posted so yeah I
am going to be linking those down below
please do not come out with video asking
about my grades because they are
disclosed in the video link okay so the
first question I want to answer is am I
happy at USC is it everything that I
hope you would be and the answer is yes
a lot of you guys asked me you know does
it live up to your expectations because
you guys may or may not know USP was my
ultimate dream school I wanted it for so
long so a lot of times and you hide
things up in your head or you just feel
like something's really experiencing it
you may be disappointed or letdown and
let me tell you that is not the case
USC is literally everything that I
wanted everything that I thought it was
and more I I feel so lucky and blessed
to be you know so happy with my
school um yeah everything I thought it
would be everything I wanted and I
finally have that feeling that I wanted
to LMU that I know I'm in the right
place
that I know this is the tool for me and
I have no desire to be anywhere else so
yeah I'm really excited and happy to be
able to say that you guys okay so that
being said I am going to talk a lot
about the transition obviously because
it's hard about being a transfer student
and it's a whole nother animal to be a
spring admit on top of it you know it
definitely isn't something I would
recommend to someone who is not some
sets with USC as I am like if it wasn't
my dream school it would probably not
have been worth it just because it is
difficult to adjust the first things I
wanted to go over is you know adjusting
to the academics so don't get me wrong
LMU is a competitive school but it's not
nearly as competitive as USC if you guys
want to fight with me on that go ahead
but you can literally look at the
statistics of the admitted students and
the grades yeah USC I think their
acceptance rate was like 15% this year
and LMU's is like 50% so you know you
can say what you want but the academic
caliber of students here is higher so
naturally you know you would assume that
that would drive up the difficulty of
the classes okay so honestly I got most
of the classes that would be hard for me
out of the way either at LMU or at
Community College because I did attend
Community College the fall semester I
will put a video about that down below
as well at ldu I did a history course
which history is probably my least
favorite subject I was not into it but I
did that there that was really hard and
then at Community College I took my math
and my life science course so I didn't
have to take those at USC I got those
out of the way one of the things that I
definitely noticed is that the
professor's here are for the most part
more qualified or informed than the
professors I experienced at loyola
marymount honestly I had some really
shitty professors at LMU I'm not going
to lie but I also have some great
professors so on
so you know I feel I get to intermix at
any school but I definitely have noticed
that the professor's here know a lot
more and have a lot more experience I
guess that comes with being like a
favorite school a bigger name school
baby I could be wrong but I have this
you know some of the professor's know a
lot more about the material in terms of
the classes themselves honestly I really
haven't struggled that much most of my
grades are like a minuses B pluses I'm
still waiting for some final grades back
I think the main thing is that papers
are graded more harshly things are great
and a lot more harshly probably because
you know the caliber of the other
submissions and students are higher so
obviously you know you get compared to
other paper in and other answers so yeah
normally you know I'm used to getting
A's on papers I'll get these on papers
so you know I have seen that but
honestly like in terms of classes
there's nothing that's like wow this is
so much harder if I had just come from
Community College just comparing to
Community College yes it didn't say any
different but comparative LMU it's
really not very different which does
make sense for both private four-year
universities but yeah it's not being
really too crazy I will say that the one
thing that obviously was an adjustment
was having big classes in lectures
rather than small classes so what a mere
amount is a smaller school so all my
classes would have like less than 25
kids in them where that's not the case
of USC especially not with general
education classes will be like 150 kids
in my class and then you'll have a
breakdown discussion once a week with
like 20 kids see how that's different is
honestly I like it more I really don't
like being singled out in class I like
to keep to myself
I don't really participate like raise my
hand that much so I like being in like a
bigger group and then when I'm in a
discussion you know I feel more
comfortable because there's not that
many people and like it's not the
professor it's a TA so I don't feel as
good I've just been working hard as long
as you work hard you know I'm not like a
straight-a student right now I think I
probably won't like to be or something
so that is different but it's nothing
like dresses okay so the next thing that
I want to talk about I got so many
questions on it's basically how I've
adjusted socially and this is so
hard it's still a work in progress
honestly I would say that I make friends
pretty easily I used to be really shy
and high school but college is kind of
like fourth you need to come out of my
shell and even where I'm going yeah I so
weird because in high school I would say
I was definitely like more introverted
but in college I've become more
extroverted like I love meeting new
people I love going out I look like
revenge so I got a super weird how that
was kind of a flip-flop the one thing I
do have to say is that Greek life is
huge here and I was really excited to
rush but because I was a spring and a I
was not able to rush because Russia's in
the fall didn't have a few informal rush
kind of things but only for a few houses
and I really just wanted the full
experience of you know formal rush so
I'm going to try that out in the fall we
will see how it goes being here without
being able to be in it I could
definitely see that you do feel kind of
left out if you're not in it if you are
one of the people that would want to be
in it if that makes sense yeah I'm not
going talked too much about it but if
you wanted person that would be like
interested in Greek life or hang out
with you know the people involved in
Greek life if you're not in it you will
notice that you know it's not like
you're left out but there's kind of just
like a disconnect but in terms of many
people that love you guys asked how I
did meet people without being able to
rush and stuff and the first thing I did
was I joined the Facebook pages for the
spring and myths and transfers and
whatnot
honestly though the main way that I met
people was through classes I told not a
lot of people make friends in their
classes I think I need only one that
does this but yeah I made some great
friends in it classes and I also just
tried to go to as many events as I could
I went to Vegas with a fraternity so I
met alot of people there that was fun
yeah just like honestly if you guys are
transferring just try to do as many
things as you can if someone asks you to
do something go and do it because you'll
probably need new people you never know
even if they're going to go as planned
you're as meeting new people and that's
the most important thing because if
you're not able to put yourself out
there and genuinely try as a transfer or
as a spring admit it's going to be
really difficult okay I think one
question that I get a lot is is USC
worth the money and I wanted to address
this because I've never really talked
about it before
and it is a huge thing USC is extremely
extremely expensive and I'm going to
make completely completely honest with
you guys I am so fortunate that my
parents are paying for my education they
always told me as I was growing up we
will pay for your college and then after
that you're done you're cut off and that
is so amazing for me because I am an
only child they allow them to choose any
school I want it and if I got in it
would pay for it so yeah that's so
amazing
I know some people are gonna be like I'm
gonna ask a coiled rat like I'm sorry
but my parents are offering to pay for
it I'm not going to be like oh no let me
handle those thousands of hundreds of
thousands of dollars like but I am very
aware of the cost the cost of USC is
extreme and no I did not receive
financial aid I did not receive academic
scholarships which I had academic
scholarship at LMU I do not have it here
I'm in the bottom line in terms of
people asking me is it worth the money
if USC is your dream school if it's all
you've ever wanted then I would say yes
it's worth the money but if you have
other colleges that you're interested in
so they're giving you money that are
less expensive if you feel you could be
happy at then honestly I'm going to say
no it's not worth the money because you
guys can look up tuition it's insane
last thing before I end this video I
think a lot of you guys are probably
wondering what I'm doing this summer so
I am staying in Los Angeles I think a
lot of you thought I was going home to
New York but no not down for that is the
last year it was so boring
I actually am going over two weeks oh so
I'm actually I'm leaving Monday which is
four days from now which is crazy
my mom supplies me with that one but I'm
leaving Monday I'm going to be home for
the month of May and then I'm coming
back here in June I don't applied to a
few internships I haven't clearly heard
anything solid yet so I'm trying to find
a part-time internship currently in Los
Angeles for the summer you guys know of
anything let me know but yeah I will be
here there's just so much an opportunity
and I like it so much more here so that
is currently the plan for the summer I'm
going to try
so a lot of YouTube videos so if you
guys have requests totally leave them in
the comment section anyways I hope you
guys found this video helpful I hope I
can inspire you guys who may not have
gone into your dream school on your
first try I love getting comments saying
how I motivated you or inspired you to
try in your Jane school and getting
messengers telling me that you were
successful in that is honestly knurled
heartwarming amazing thing ever so if I
