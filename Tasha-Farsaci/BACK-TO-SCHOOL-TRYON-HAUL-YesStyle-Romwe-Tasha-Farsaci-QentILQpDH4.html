video and I apologize if there's been a
lot of haul videos up for me lately but
the reason for that is honestly I've
been getting a lot of stuff in the mail
and with me going to college in like a
few days now
I wanted a pre film as many videos as I
could because I know I'm gonna be really
busy adjusting meeting new people moving
into a new place so I really just wanted
to film as many videos as I could and
with the things coming in the mail hauls
were just really easy there easy to film
they're fun to film they're fairly easy
to edit and I know a lot of you guys do
like them so I figured I just fill a
bunch of hauls and it's many other
videos as I could before I leave and
kind of try and spread them out when I
upload I don't know how that's gonna
work out but I apologize if you don't
like hauls
I know a lot of you guys do those so
that shouldn't be a problem but I just
kinda wanted to address why there's so
many hauls
um yeah I did get a haircut I don't know
if you guys can telex it's still long
but I did get like four four and a half
inches off and I got some like shorter
layers in the front as well as my like
usual highlights um people do ask me
about my hair it's north like a dark
blonde normally like a dirty blonde and
I just been getting highlights for a
long time so it's very light now and I
love it
um it's definitely shorter but you don't
really notice my hair it's always been
long but yeah I thought I'd address that
okay the first place I'm going to show
you these stuff I got from is yes style
calm yes I um actually reached out to me
and they were like hey like do you want
a gift card to show some things about
haul video and I've never heard of them
before I checked out their website it
looks pretty cool it's like something
you guys might be interested in so I was
like okay sure
yes I'll calm is another one of those
like Asian websites but it's different
because a lot of things on there or like
different brands like Korean brands like
their their friend like brands all over
the site whereas like wrong way which is
like what I'm gonna show you after this
it's like they don't have like specific
brands it's just kind of like on the
site this stuff is brands and that they
have like a lot of like a ton of shoes
and then like housewares stuff or like
stationery so it's a lot of different
stuff it's more like a huge like online
like Asian Target or something like that
so yeah I picked up some things
the thing with yeah style is that it's
not really discounted when you want like
romwe the stuff is really
I'm saying on yes style it's more like
if you're just shopping at the mall if
stuff is pretty like standard the price
yeah so I just want to put that out
there before I show you this stuff but
I'm actually really impressed with
everything the first thing I got is a
purse and the reason for this is because
lately I've actually splurge and I
bought like two nice handbags I've never
really been into designer bags but I
wanted like some nice ones because I've
never had nice bags so I got like a new
one with black one yeah it's bad but I
was like okay I need a bag that's not
you know really expensive but if I just
want to go out somewhere and not have to
worry about my bag so I saw this bag I
thought it was really cute it's like a
gray a faux leather bag I don't have a
gray bag so this is also good um it
looks kind of like suede but not really
it's definitely like an interesting
material
here's just a better look at it I really
do like the material a lot it's kind of
what drew me to the bags it looked
really distressed but it just has some
like zippers it one about here some on
the sides and then another zipper on the
back and then it just has like little
straps like this as well as like two
like long shoulder straps
the next thing I'm have from
yesstyle.com is a pair of shoes and I'm
actually really excited about these I
like them a lot
I wanted like lace-up nude sandals so I
saw these and I got really excited it
just looked like this they're barely a
shoe honestly as you can see it's just
like the sole of the shoe there's a
little like thing you put your toe
through here and then it's just all like
the lace top straps and it's just really
pretty natural nude color which I like
because it matches everything clearly
there's two but I really like these I
think they're gonna match so many
outfits and I'm really happy I got these
the first clothing piece I got I really
really like but it's a little bit big
because they held me had one size it was
like one size fits most or whatever and
it actually came as a medium so I guess
they're saying that medium should fit
most but I'm really small so it's a
little bit big pretty much it's this
romper I love the pattern on it it's
just a really really pretty to me it's
like a mixed kind of pattern it has a
drawstring at the waist and then it goes
to shorts and at the back it's actually
open with some like little ties that you
like tie the backward and then it just
goes down into a normal romper next
clothing piece I got I actually don't
have with me because I loved it so much
I wanted to get it like tailored a
little bit it was just a little bit long
on me it was a dress that kind of hit me
like right above the knee and I one day
a little shorter than that because it
was a shift dress so it's actually the
Taylors now but I'm gonna insert it clip
of me trying it on right here as you can
see it's just this really pretty paisley
print shift dress with a high neck kind
of halter neckline I absolutely love it
it's gonna look so cute with some like
natural colored like heels or wedges I
really really love it once again that's
why I'm getting it tailored but it was
just like a little bit too long on me so
if you're taller than me you should be
fine if you want it the last night I got
from Gaston calm was actually like
stickers because I had a few dollars
left on the gift card and I couldn't
find anything that I could get would
think of card money except for like
stickers so I've got these like puffy
stickers and they're kind of creepy I'm
not gonna lie so they look like this
they're like little like Asian animal
things next I have some things from
romwe calm once again another
asian-inspired website but pretty
different than yes tile
I guess stuff from there pretty
frequently so your ads are probably
familiar with them everything out is
this really cute romper it looks like
this it just has this kind of like
tribal pattern on it and then it just
goes down into shorts but the really
cool part is the back because it kind of
crosses a few times and then ties if you
can see that I really like the back it's
mostly open so you can't really wear a
bra this but if you get like sticky
boobs or something you'll be a-okay and
I really really like the pattern this is
really cute the next I have a runway I
don't actually like very much I don't
know if it's weird I'm not a huge fan of
the material but basically I got a
two-piece set this was really popular
I've seen it on a bunch of different
websites so my top looks like this it's
just a crop top navy with some flowers
the back supposed to like cross and
whatnot and then the shorts looked like
this the top doesn't fit me great but
shorts are a little bit big so it just
doesn't fit me I think it looks cute on
other people I've seen other people
wearing it but I'm not a fan the next
two things I'm going to show you I
really can't tell you
the sizing is because I wrap and
tailored I brought these to the tailings
before I did this video because I wanted
them to fit me so I could be in the
college so yeah they didn't like fit me
right when I first got them so don't go
off of me for sizing for that but they
are really nice pieces the first thing
is this dress I thought it was really
pretty so it's kind of just like a
halter neck floral print and then it
goes out into a skater dress I haven't
this a lot because it was awkwardly long
on me and the back is really pretty
because it's all I opened so the next
thing I have tailored I am absolutely in
love with like I was so impressed by
this because you know Broadway it's like
hidden miss you only expect really great
quality so when I got this piece I was
blown away it's pretty much this romper
it's a black and white printed romper
this looks like something you'd get a
Topshop for sure it's gonna be hard to
show I'm like struggling already has a
little peep hole and then it goes in his
shorts and in the back is like open like
with a slit honestly I was really
impressed with the material bits it's
very very thick very nice honestly if I
saw it's a Topshop I wouldn't be
surprised the next thing I have from
runway
I actually got because College and
sleeping and I want a kind of cute
pajamas I'm not saying like really super
cute but like just cuter t-shirts to
sleep in so I found this one on runway
and you guys know I love coffee so this
one is so cute it says I love you a
latte and it's just black with white I
got this in a medium because I wanted a
little beggin you as you can see it's
like a short shirt so I'm glad I did
that and I'm definitely gonna be
sleeping in this next thing if I'm wrong
weight is not the best material but it's
still really cute it's another romper
this one is definitely for going out I
could never like get away with wearing
this during the day because it dips so
low in the front but it's a romper as
you can see it's a really low V I can
get away with this once again because I
don't have boobs I think if you had
moves like flaunt them girl but like I'd
be a little uncomfortable just because
of how low-cut it is and then it just
goes into a romper the next thing from
romwe once again I'm not totally in love
with just cuz I don't know it's around
birth and of course cuz I'm obsessed
with rompers
it's read cute the front is like very
like openly least so you can't really
wear a bra um long sleeve shorts it's
cute
has like some ties with tassels on the
end I think I'm a little bit confused
about because I thought it was supposed
to be a top and I got it and it's
definitely a kimono and maybe I just
don't remember what the picture looked
like so I did order these things quite a
while ago but I don't know I'm
definitely not top because it's
completely open it looks like this um
and then the sleeves are here just I'm
nice like paisley print as you can see
it's literally no way this is top
because it opens there's like a string
here but I think that's just to like
keep it on your shoulders let me know
what you think okay so that is it for
