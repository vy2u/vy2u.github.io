whining in the back its Chester I've
said that before he like freaks out when
my roommates leave me just left but
anyways today I just went to class I did
my presentation with my little eyeball
cookies and I think it went pretty well
then I have my last econ class ever
before my final which is crazy and now I
think I want to go to tender greens just
to get lunch I wanted my roommates to
come with me but they have finals and
everyone's busy so I think there's going
to go alone get some lunch come back I
think I'm gonna film a Q&amp;amp;A video I'm
gonna try and clean up my room I feel
like I say that every single day I'm
like I'm gonna try and clean my room and
then I never do um but I need to do that
I need to pack this weekend to go home I
go home in a few days that's crazy to me
uh yeah so I only know what how good
today's vlog is gonna be oh my god my
hair is crazy I just do it up in a spot
yeah I don't know how exciting today's
vlog is gonna be but we will see okay
it's like really dark in here so I don't
know if you'll be able to see my outfit
very well but I'm wearing this cropped
sweater from zepho I believe and then
just this little necklace I always wear
and then these jeans are also from
saffle but up there like definitely a
Topshop too because I know they sell you
the Topshop there's just these dark-wash
boyfriend jeans with some floral
embroidery now I didn't know what shoes
to wear with this I couldn't find
anything that looks good I think these
look okay they're just Brown sandals
from Steve Madden
I wonder where booties because my
toenails are like not painted they're
like kind of painted but they're really
gross Chester's stop yeah so this is my
outfit today I'm hoping gonna bring my
tory burch bag bitch right there but
yeah my over driver is taking 10 million
years this is downtown LA if you're not
with it I don't want to cancel on him
because he looked kind of attractive so
yeah we'll see okay so I just got back
from tender greens I was so wrong my boo
boo driver was straight-up sexy like not
even just hot you know how there's like
a distinction like there's hot and there
was like sexy like he was sexy like he
had some stubble his hair was so nice he
was like muscly and tan yeah it's like
really nice to watch but he was so
foreign like I really don't think he
spoke English like his accent was so
thick and like I just like it was broken
English but yeah super attractive my
Lily screenshotted my like uber screen
so I could show you his little icon but
it's probably gonna be so blurry like
zoomed but anyways I just got a package
in the mail from Bath and Body Works
because I ordered some candles during
the Cyber Monday sale it's like I still
show you which ones I got just go now
have any candles here because they're so
heavy to like bring across the country
on a plane I have one that I burn all
the time I'll actually show you guys
what's my favorite scent it is endless
weekend it kind of smells like people
ahjussi which is my favorite perfume and
I think this is like a summer scent I
don't know if they still sell I don't
know if they sell a lot or like every
summer or what but I love it and it's
almost gone anyway so I want to get
something like Christmasy wintery fall
scents okay so all the candles I got are
sense that I've smelled before because I
wanted to make sure that I liked them
you know I don't like ordering scented
things online because you never really
know so I got warm vanilla sugar I've
never had this in a candle but I've
smelled like every other type of thing
they have it's warm vanilla sugar and I
love it so I got that one and then I
hope the top is off this one is that
normal whoo why is this one all fancy
maybe there's no top okay I guess these
ones don't have the lids what is this oh
mahogany teak wood this is if you want
your room to smell like a sexy
Abercrombie model man yeah burn this
then invite a guy over and he'll get
really jealous cuz he'll think that you
have a bunch of guys over all the time
haha okay and then literally just like
digging around in here oh wait here's
like the top thing I think
okay this one is a fall candle but it's
my favorite candle ever and I had mine
at home so I wanted to get a new one you
guys can probably guess what it is from
the cap its leaves I love this one so
much it's great so I had to get that one
yes those are the candles I have now my
room's been more of a disaster what's
new comment down below and tell me what
your favorite candle is from Bath about
a works because I want to try new ones I
love them so much so yeah totally
comment down below okay so I'm about to
film a Q&amp;amp;A and whenever my hair looks
really bad like it does today I like to
make my face with a little better so I
just got some desi Oh colored contacts
in the mail they're supposed to be like
the best of the best colored contacts so
yeah I guess I'm gonna try those out and
see if they'll make my face like pop a
little more something for the video so
I'm gonna try and put them in normally I
don't put them in with my RT of makeup
on because they make my eyes water and
then it like spews I wear but yeah we'll
see how that goes okay ignore the noise
with a fan in the background that like
turns on once in a while but I just put
them in and I love them I think that
looks super super natural oh my gosh
like I wish my eyes would miss caller
comment down below and tell me what you
think
I'm just gonna like Reaper my hair up or
something but yeah I love colored
contacts I think they're like so fun and
now I want to get more Desio ones
because they're so cool okay hello guys
so I'm currently laying in bed but I
have to leave my bio class in like 15
minutes or so I can't believe this is my
last class Wow it's my last bio class
and it's my last class before any finals

by so fast but I'm little you're so
excited for all the new changes and
things that are gonna be happening next

so I got back from class and I just made
who would I made like pasta with this
egg Italian sausage I had I only like
the Italian sausage you know like
different brands taste different if you
eat sausage and I had the Trader Joe's
version and just think it didn't taste
good so I threw out the pasta I made
which is like so wasteful

buttery popcorn too so yeah I guess I'm
not being healthy at all
