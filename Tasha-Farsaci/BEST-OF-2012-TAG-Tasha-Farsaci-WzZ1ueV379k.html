the best of 2012 tag and this is the one
that macro vo7 created I know there was
a ton going around right now but I liked
her as the best because it had beauty
and fashion but I'd also had random
things like all their stuff that I
obviously like because a lot of times
you'll get to see that part of youtubers
you normally just seem like beauty
fashion but I think this is a fun tag
because it also includes some random
stuff okay the first category is beauty
okay the first one is my favorite face
product and you guys may or may not know
that I don't want a foundation or powder
or any of that stuff I just feel like I
don't need it and if I don't need it why
would I use it so yeah but I do use a
concealer I started using it this year
because I get like really bad on your
icicles and this is just the Physicians
Formula concealer twins duo thing and it
has a green end and then the regular
concealer and and I use this phone to my
eyes I sometimes use a green end if I
have like as if it's really red because
that's gross and it looks really well
because a green he also saw red so if
you have like redness or anything you
could just put this on it and it gets
rid of that and then this concealer is
really great for covering up under eyes
I have it on today and I just think it's
really nice next is my favorite cheek
product and I really don't use blush
either I'm so weird um but I did get
this little go topic oral kit from
Sephora and it has some cheek products
in it and it has coralista by benefit
which if you don't know what that looks
like it looks like that and it's just a
really pretty coral color that I
actually really like and I mean I do use
it once in a while I don't tend to use
blush all the time but if I'm gonna use
blush I do use this if any of you guys
know of like a blush or bronzer or
something I really want a blush or
highlighter or whatever that's kind of
golden and like bronze II like a bronzer
that's really shimmery because I kind of
want that but I don't really know what
to go for it so if any of you guys know
one of those let me know okay number
three is my favorite eye product and
that's pretty much where I put most of
my makeup I really only use makeup on my
eyes but I didn't know if I really
wanted me to choose mascara eyeshadow or
whatever but I just figured I would
choose like my favorite
I found a Holy Grail product this year
edits the knick slide on glide on stay
on definitely a turn-on
like me waterproof extreme shine
eyeliner and I discovered using eyeliner
on my top lash line this year because I
went through weird eyeliner stages like
I remember like six or seventh grade I
went kind of crazy I would have eyeliner
on the top and the bottom black like I
don't like going back to that time I
mean I like would get the worst eyeliner
it would smudge and it was just really
really bad I don't even know what I was
thinking
and then I went to just wearing it on
the top I think maybe and then I went to
for a long time just wearing it on the
bottom and then I rediscovered putting
it on the top and I liked it a lot and
that's what I do now
and this is the eyeliner I use I use a
brown because I feel like it just kind
of goes better with my coloring and it
looks like this these are exactly like
the Urban Decay 24/7 ones I've used both
and these are exactly the same and
they're like half the price so I
definitely recommend these and you can
get nyx at Ulta and you can also get it
online okay next is my favorite lip
product and once again I don't really
wear lip products I have this weird
thing where I my lips all the time I
talked about that in a Q&amp;amp;A video I did a
while back but I bite them and I'm
always like looking them and stuff so if
I were a lip gloss of lipstick like
there's no point um it's gonna be gone
so I love chapstick I use chapstick all
the time and I like the EOS my lips are
always chapped and I've never been able
to find a chapstick that really
completely unchecks my lips so I don't
really buy chapstick for that I just
kind of buy it if I it's cute um so this
is the u.s. one and I'm pretty sure this
is in like strawberry or something and
it's like this little light pink one and
it's so cute and it smells amazing this
is my favorite out of all of them that
I've had so yeah I really like this one
okay next is my favorite skincare
product and I'm kind of bad I really
don't take care of my skin I'm lucky to
have good skin I don't really have acne
I don't really get tips that often but
you know I do use this every morning
it's the Biore blemish fighting ice
cleanse
and the reason why I use this is because
it wakes me up I am so tired in the
morning I can't get up really early
because I'm just slow when I get ready
and I like to eat breakfast and all that
stuff so I need to be awake and this
stuff really cools your face and like
you feel so clean after you wash your
face with this and yeah this is what it
looks like I definitely recommend this
because it wakes me up so much it's
amazing so I love this and I feel like
it just really cleans my face really
well and it smells fresh and yeah I
really like this ok now is my favorite
nail polish which is really hard I have
a nail polish problem I have so much
nail polish like so much I'm just
looking at my crack over there so I
really don't stick to one nail polish I
kind of just go on and off and like wear
different ones all the time but if I had
to choose my favorite nail polish that I
got this year mayera definitely the SC's
dive bar I love this color so much it's
just so unique I really like wearing
dark colors on my nails I just feel like
they stand out more I like crazy colors
on my nails I feel like it's not crazy
then like no one really notices and I
love weird crazy out their colors so
this is dire bar I've shown it in a
video before but it's just as awesome
turquoise with like purple kind of
glitter in it and like it's like
blackened and I really love it I just
think it's gorgeous
and once again it is dive bar oops
that's upside-down awkward yeah okay
number seven is my favorite hair product
and that was pretty hard I mean I have
lots of hair products by the way my hair
I curled it last night for New Year's
Eve and I slept on it and it still did
not fall out like I wanted to fall out
so I did it like tight I guess I don't
really know and it didn't fall out at
all so it's like really curly right now
but anyways umm my favorite hair product
I have talked about this before as well
it's the edenal or Moroccan oil or argan
oil it's so different I really don't
know guys whose hair on this that's
disgusting but basically this stuff
cancels out all frizz I have a whole
video on this so I'll put a little
right here and if you're on an ipod /
iphone / Apple product you're not going
to be able to see this I don't know why
it doesn't work what it doesn't so you
don't see this that's why but I'll put
the video right there but anyways this
stuff is great it gets rid of all my
friends it just makes my hair feel
healthier and I love this so if you have
really frizzy or hard to deal with hair
when you get out of the shower I
definitely recommend this and this is
what it looks like I'm pretty sure you
can get this online you can get at
eating the lure calm or I've heard some
people say you can get it at Amazon so
you know whatever floats your boat
okay the last Beauty topics thingy is
your favorite body products lanta
perfume yeah I don't really get perfume
that often because my mom is like she
can't take like smells like she gets
home nauseous with like perfumes and
stuff and it's so weird because I love
perfume ins and my candles and all that
stuff and this one is actually her least
favorite she absolutely hates it but
it's probably my favorite so yeah I do
still use it and then she yells at me
every time I use it but it is Britney
Spears fantasy and I don't know why I
love this so much it might just be
because it stays on forever like I can
shower in this I will still smell like
this I don't know why it's so strong
it kind of it just smells like a mature
vanilla it's like a musky kind of
vanilla it's like a sexy sexy kind of
scent like that makes no sense like it
just I'm I don't know it smells really
good it's like a sexy vanilla sex even
though that sounds like a strippers name
okay next is the fashion category and
number 9 favorite clothing piece like
that is so hard I am a clothes whore I
have way too many pieces of clothing you
guys should see my closet right now I
tried to clean it out so I just like
threw everything on the ground and I
can't even walk in there it's so
embarrassing
yes soap anyways it was really hard for
me to choose my favorite clothing piece
so I kind of chose a trend that I really
enjoyed and then I have a few examples
so the trend that I chose was kind of
interesting pants I just think it's
really funny because a lot of the times
outfits can be really boring
and I like to be kind of like
there with my outfits I really don't
care if they're crazy so I really love
this trend and I'm gonna show you a few
pairs so these are kind of not really
crazy but they're these urban outfitters
ones that make tribal down the side I
like these a lot you might have seen
them in and out for the week and then
these are my favorite ones these were a
splurge but they're amazing um they are
these snake print ones and I love them
so much they're my Hudson so once again
kind of a splurge but these are amazing
and they fit me like a glove I love
these and then finally these four ones
from ASOS but they're too big so anyway
I haven't been able to wear them because
they're massive and I don't want I can't
remember the Tigers already so I don't
know maybe look at them like size do
whatever but I love pattern cats I think
they're really fun and they just just
make the whole outfit okay number 10 is
my favorite accessory and that was
pretty easy it's this scarf I'm pretty
sure I wear this scarf once a week and
if I go out on the weekends like to the
store or the mall I will probably be
wearing this scarf it's just it's it
matches everything I swear okay it has
black and brown so it's gonna match
anything black and brown and then it has
green so if you're wearing green like
like an olive green it matches that and
it has pinks and purples and I don't
know it just matches everything and it's
really big and it's from H&amp;amp;M because
their scarves are awesome and they
always make them really big so it just
looked really cute with every outfit
okay and last in the fashion category is
my favorite pair of shoes for 24 and
that would have to be my black Steve
Madden Koopa combat boots I'm pretty
sure everyone and their mother has
trooper combat boots right now it was
like a Christmas shenanigan like
everyone got them but I've had mine for
quite a while I love them so much for
the perfect combat boots they're just
not too tall or stiff or crazy they're
just perfect and they look like this
they're real leather they're nice and
soft and they're just amazing I I don't
have any complaints about these I mean I
guess they're kind of expensive they're
like a hundred box but I don't know the
great thing about combat boots is you
can get them beat up
stop and they just look even better like
I love these so much I would recommend
everyone to get that if you can if you
can afford them like definitely get them
because you will not regret it and you
will wear them all the time and I love
these I would kiss them if they weren't
so dirty but yeah okay now onto the
random category number twelve is
favorite TV show slash movie and I don't
know if that means TV show and movie or
just movie or TV show I'm gonna do both
cuz you know what else my favorite TV
show of 2012 has definitely been Gossip
Girl it is ended and I'm not gonna be a
spoiler tell you what happened in case
you didn't watch it because I hadn't
watched it in some girl posted who
Gossip Girl was on Twitter and I was
honestly gonna like slit her wrists like
I was so mad but anyways it's just
amazing
I love New York City so I feel like that
kind name is why I like it as well but
it's just really great and it's a great
show a lot of it's on Netflix who view
the Netflix definitely watch it it's
over now and I'm so sad but it's a great
show and I love it and then my favorite
movie of 2012 is definitely Perks of
Being a Wallflower it's probably my
favorite movie it's not for everyone
it's just really touching I having like
the book i which is brewed for me I
normally read the books before the movie
but I saw the movie and honestly it's
really relatable I feel like just to the
teenage generation there's a lot of
stuff in there that a lot of people
could probably relate to and it's kind
of a sad movie it's kind of out there
obviously not everyone's gonna like it
but it just really touched me and like I
could see it so many times act like I
would never get bored of it and now I'm
really getting all teary I don't know
why but it's just like it's a great
movie I love it so much and if you
haven't seen it definitely see it
because it's probably relatable to a lot
of people I don't want to like give too
much away in case you want to see it but
it's really a great movie and yeah okay
13 is my favorite book and I think I
like reading I really do I just can't
think of the books that I read this year
I really don't have a lot of time to
read now because I
always reading books for school so yeah
that kind of sucks right now I'm reading
A Tale of Two Cities if any of you guys
have read that let me know but I'm
probably gonna say The Hunger Games kind
of thingy I guess I don't really know
what else I've read I don't really
remember that's just kind of sticks out
to me because it was so popular it was
really good the first one was obviously
the best I'm pretty sure I thought the
third one sucked and the second one was
just kind of like in the middle and this
went downhill from the first one but
yeah those who are obviously really good
and the movie was really good as well 14
is my favorite food over here yeah guys
I love food food is my boyfriend if I
could marry food I would not lying I
don't even know how to choose my
favorite food I guess I would have to
say fettuccine alfredo because I love it
or Panera mac and cheese pending or mac
and cheese possibly my favorite food
I took the large and I know but no shame
maybe the beverage I honestly have no
idea maybe like whereas not raspberry
cranberry use man I don't know oh I
really love this is only in the summer
though Sonic we know Starbucks obviously
frappuccinos I love the coconut mocha
one that's in the summer but that's not
beauty so Starbucks in general maybe
okay and the last question is my
favorite song of the year which is hard
because normally I'm like that type of
person that hears a song and you listen
to it all the time and you get sick of
it and then you just find a new one but
I'd have to say my favorite song of the
year I haven't been listening to it all
year but oh well
it's naive by the Kochs and I love that
song so much it just doesn't get old to
me I don't know why I really like it if
you guys haven't heard it definitely
definitely goes into it um yeah I'll try
and put it down below in the description
hopefully I don't forget if I do you can
yell at me in the comments but yeah I
really love that song I like the kook's
what kind of genre is that is that like
indie or something
I really don't know cuz I don't know
what genre of music I like I like that
kind of music so whatever that is let me
know so that was my best of 2012 tag I
hope you guys enjoyed this if you want
to do this leave it as a video response
down below because I tagged all of you
because you don't want to feel like
loneliness like me and not get tagged
cuz that's that's my life I'm also
follow me on Instagram it is piously
Tasha just like my username I post all
the time there and stuff and also
Twitter but I really don't go on Twitter

always run out of ideas but yeah I love
