today I am doing a video that I probably
should have done like a week or two ago
basically this is going to be my Black
Friday / Cyber Monday haul and the
reason this video is so late is because
I did a lot of my Black Friday and
obviously cyber monday shopping online
and the stuff honestly took so long to
come in like I'm still waiting for
something but I didn't want to wait any
longer so I decided I'm just in the
video now if I look red it's because
there's a red car parked right outside
the window I'm filming in front of so
that's super annoying but I can't really
do anything about that
so yeah I'm sorry if you guys aren't
following me on Instagram and you guys
want to keep up with my life more
personally or see my outfit styled
totally follow me on there because I'm
always posting pictures of my life and
my outfits okay and you guys will be
happy to hear that everything in this
haul except for one thing I think was
bought with my own money and a lot of
the times you guys complained because I
do a lot of calls with gifted items and
the reason for that it's just because I
am a college student I'm trying to save
my money as much as I can I need to buy
food and rent and you know do college
student things and you guys always
request haul videos so if I want to be
doing lots of haul videos and companies
are offering me to be able to pick out
products that I would want to buy
anyways for a haul I say yes but you
guys have been requesting a haul with
everything that I bought so I did buy
everything in this haul except for you
out one thing I will be linking
everything or at least everything that I
can find it down below so if you guys
want to see how any of this looks on or
you want to buy it for yourself
totally check out the links
unfortunately I am NOT going to trying
to stuff on just because I want this
video to go up as soon as possible and
honestly a lot of this stuff is like
shoes and accessories kind of so I think
that's okay but if you guys do want to
see it on be sure to look at the links
down below okay the first thing I got is
actually the shirt I am wearing this is
from Levi's as you can see it's just
like a plain ringer tee yeah I really
like this shirt because it's not super
tight but it's also not really loose so
I think it's a perfect fit and I really
like it okay the next thing is this pair
of booties from Steve Madden and I'm
really excited about these I really
wanted a new pair
black heeled booties because the ones I
have I've had for like two or three
years now I'm obsessed with them I love
them but they're getting kind of old and
they're also not very comfortable
because there's no platform but with
these there's such a thick heel and
there's also a thick platform and the
tread is really nice so they're really
comfortable to walk in and I wanted to
get a pair of cute black heel booties
for Paris because I am going to Paris
and like are we gonna have which is
crazy because I want my of it to look
cute but I also obviously want to be
comfy when I'm walking around so these
are really really comfortable and I got
these on sale obviously for Black Friday
so yeah these are really really cool ok
next I got a new pair of bands so you
guys know me I love Chuck advanced I
wear mine all the time I also have like
a USC colored pair that I love so when I
saw that they had them in this like new
dish pink and white checkered color I
thought they were so cute so I had to
pick them up
hopefully this color is coming off treat
of color on the screen but yeah I just
think they're really unique I haven't
seen anyone with these so yeah and I
just think they're so fun and hopefully
I'll wear these a lot I got one thing
from express it's just this little
conductor hat I showed this in a vlog or
a few vlogs I've actually worn it a few
times but I think these are really cute
I used to hate them but I really like
this one from Express so I picked this
up and Express was doing half off on
Black Friday so I got this to only like
15 bucks ok this was the like splurge
item I guess of this haul I got a
sweater from All Saints which is one of
my favorite favorite stores but they're
so expensive I mean the quality is
amazing I have a few jackets from them
but yeah they're really pricey so I got
this sweater because they were doing
like 30 percent off or up to 40 percent
off or something so this sweater was
very discounted and I just think it's
amazing I know I'm gonna wear it for
years to come so it's just this really
dark gray almost black turtleneck
sweater but what I really like is
there's like a zipper in the front
just like a little bit of detail but I
think it's really cute and you can leave
it down or zip it up yeah you guys know
what I mean
by god this is just like really nice and
thick I'm gonna be wearing this in Paris
and when I go home for Christmas I know
I'll be wearing this a lot because it's
super warm okay so I actually got the
same sweater in two colors but I got
them from two different stores which is
kind of random so the first one I got
from Lord and Taylor do you guys have
Lord and Taylor because I have it back
home but they don't really have it here
in LA anyways this is like my new one of
my new favorite sweaters it's just like
this light grey cowl-neck sweater it's
super soft and I know I can just wear
this with a ton I thought this color was
just like very very neutral you can wear
it with like anything so yeah I got it
in this gray color from Lord and Taylor
and they had also had it in this
burgundy color but I told myself I
didn't need another one and then I went
into Saks office and they also had the
same sweater and then I got like a gift
card when I walked in so I figured I
might as well get it just because I love
it so much in Burgundy is my favorite
color
this is like the perfect burgundy color
I think in my opinion this is amazing so
yeah it's just the same sweater I think
you could probably wear this off the
shoulder as well but I was wearing a
cowl-neck but yeah this is by the brand
French Connection and then also from
Saks I grabbed these cheetah print like
furry kind of mules
I just thought these were really really
unique I have a pair of snake print
mules kind of like these and I really
love how they look with outfits so yeah
I tried these on I just thought they are
really really cool and yeah they weren't
really on sale but next up I got this
sweater from forever 21
it's that chenille material that is
making a real comeback this season and I
really I'm happy about that because it's
so soft so it's just this cropped
chenille sweater I love the color as you
can see matches my pillow
I love wearing this color too I think
it's really flattering on everyone so
yeah I grabbed this and it was pretty
affordable okay one of my favorite Black
Friday slash Cyber Monday purchases is
this sweater I've actually talked about
this in a vlog and I've already posted
an Instagram in it and I bet some people
are gonna be so confused as to why I'm
so obsessed with this but I don't know
why I am either I just am so basically
like a year ago I bought this sweater
from Joyrich actually it's hanging right
here I'll grab it
okay so throwback a year ago I bought
this sweater from this store on Melrose
called Joyrich which is like this I
don't even know how to explain it it's
definitely the street-style brand and
it's really expensive and I don't only
like anything in the store except this
sweater I was obsessed with it and I
actually wore it a lot so I was always
wishing that I could get it in another
color and I would be looking online I'd
be looking on Poshmark eBay everything
and I could never find it so just for
the fun of it I decided to go on their
website and I saw that they had new
colors and one of my favorite colors
that they came out with was like half
off so I was really excited I paid a lot
free shipping and ended up still not
being cheap because of how expensive the
shipping was but if you guys know me I'm
obsessed with yellow and they had it in
black with the yellow roses this sweater
is so thick it's such nice quality I've
already warned I posted an Instagram in
it so yeah I'm excited about this okay
and the last thing in this video was the
item that was gifted to me but I think
it's really cute so I wanted to show you
it is a bathing suit which I know you
guys probably think is so weird but I do
live in LA so it's still kind of hot I
can go to the beach sometimes and I'm
already planning ahead for my spring
break trip to Mexico so I went into the
mock sea
I really don't know how to pronounce
this I feel bad because they're one of
my favorite bathing suit brands and I
just can't pronounce it so let me know
if you know how to pronounce it but I
went into their store and for most of
the each and they let me pick out a suit
and I've been wanting this so I'm super
so long so I was really excited it's
this adorable like floral
print triangle top and it ties in the
top of the suit which i think is just
like one of the cutest details and then
the bottoms are really cheeky which I
like a lot but yeah these are the
bottoms I know they're really small but
that's how I like them and they're great
pertaining as well the back is like
ruched so thank you mom C Mon say I
really like it actually the last thing I
ordered on Cyber Monday that hasn't come
yet is another bathing suit from
Frankie's bikinis so if it comes I will
insert like a clip of it here but it's
honestly like my favorite swimsuit that
I own I own it I already own it in two
colors but the deal was like over 60%
off and I've wanted this pattern for so
long so I justified it but yeah if it
doesn't come in time we'll put a picture
up or whatever but yeah I can't wait for
it to come and I'm gonna wear it for
spring break and you can also wear it
with like shorts and stuff it's really
cute so yeah anyways I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I know it was super
late but hopefully some of you still
watched it I love you guys so much like
I said I will try to link everything
that I can down below in the description
