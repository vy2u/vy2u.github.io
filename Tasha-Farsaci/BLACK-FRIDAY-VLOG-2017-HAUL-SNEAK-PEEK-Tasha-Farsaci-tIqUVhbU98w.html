you could tell from the title of this
video this is going to be a Black Friday
vlog for 2017 because Black Friday is
one of the craziest most fun shopping
days of the year in my opinion at least
if you live in the US and it's always
super fun just to kind of go experience
it like I really don't need to buy
anything but I kind of just want to go
to be like in the thick of it yeah I
know some of you guys are probably gonna
be like Tasha why are you going Black
Friday shopping you already have so much
stuff and that is so true but I actually
am always selling my stuff on Poshmark
in case you guys don't know what
Poshmark is it is a app and website
where you can buy and sell used or new
clothes accessories honestly so many
things Poshmark has so many brands like
Nike Adidas they have luxury brands like
Louis Vuitton honestly everything that
you could want is on Poshmark
I'm always on there yeah you guys are
always asking me what I do with all my
clothes and obviously I try to wear
things as much as I can but some things
are trendy and I just don't wear them
that much so I am always adding stuff to
my Poshmark account and I also buy stuff
on there all the time because you can
find amazing deals it's seriously the
best I literally am home right now in
Syracuse New York and I listed a bunch
of stuff today
so maybe I'll show you some of the
things that I listed I listed a bunch of
stuff today but this is just something
that I think a lot of you guys will like
it's this really cute
herringbone vest and I just don't wear
it enough but I think it's super cute so
yeah I listed this and a bunch of other
really cute stuff today I'm pretty sure
my username is just Tasha for saucy but
I will be linking my account down below
in case you guys are interested and I
will also have a link down below if you
guys want to download Poshmark
I seriously recommend it to everyone
because it's a great way to clear out
your closet but it's also a great a
great way to shop more affordably but
yes like I said the app is free and if
you guys want to download it the link
will be in the description so anyways
yeah normally when I'm vlogging I'm
holding the camera but my arm would be
really tired by now but basically I know
I'm not gonna get a lot tonight
hopefully I don't get a lot tonight
because I ordered some stuff online
already because these sales were
starting so early they were starting
like two days ago and currently right
now it's it's Thanksgiving it's Thursday
not even Friday and the sales start at
like 8:00 tonight like the mall opens at
8:00 p.m. which is in like a half hour
so that's super crazy but I've already
ordered some stuff online to my place
back in LA and I also was at the mall
like two days ago and I got something so
I know I probably won't get that much
but I thought it would still be fun to
bring you along and I'm going with my
best friend Melanie and then I think her
mom her boyfriend might come and then
another one of her friends Tyler I think
is coming so you guys could see what
they find and everything but I thought
this would be fun
I love Black Friday shopping but I know
some people don't and they would rather
watch other people do it from the
comfort of their own homes so today what
are we doing March we're going Black
Friday shopping whoo oh yeah we are
oh yeah yeah we're outfit take the show
outside noise all right what's your give
