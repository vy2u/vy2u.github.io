I just filmed my back-to-school outfits
video which is really exciting because
it was really requested and I think I
have like six outfits and this these are
my personal style if you don't like them
sorry um
baby doll still kind of help you out but
these outfits are appropriate from my
school I know some schools are really
strict on their dress code
mine are pretty lenient on the rules I
didn't include too many pairs of shorts
in this video because I know shorts are
really like touchy subject for schools
my school allows shorts but ones I show
to appropriate for my school but if they
aren't appropriate for your school you
know you can always opt for jeans or
something but yeah I also am allowed to
wear tank tops in my school as long as
they're like two fingers thick so if I
show tank tops in this video that's why
but anyways you know you can kind of
just add sweaters and stuff if that
doesn't work for your school but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and it was
really fun to film I like filming these
and stuff so let me know down below what
your favorite outfit was after you watch
this and yes so keep watching
okay so for this outfit I decided to
pull out my favorite pair of floral
jeans I'm just wearing them with this
really really cute light wash denim
shirt and I love this shirt because it's
a bath you'll see in a minute but I got
this in a size bigger and cut the
sleeves just to get like the boyfriend
kind of look and as you can see it has
lace in the top back which is the reason
why I got it I absolutely love that and
I feel like it goes really well with the
pants and yeah I don't know I just want
like this outfit and I feel like denim
shirt or sometimes hard to style and
they go great with floral pants let me
swing my Jesus sandals because that's
what everyone calls them yeah and yeah
okay so I know there's that rule that
you must opposed to wearing white pants
after Labor Day but some of you guys
might high school before that and so I
put these in there I absolutely love
them with this top it take this Navy
lace shoot with buttons down the front
and I really really like it it's so
pretty and I really like how it looks
with the white pants I just added a
brown braided belt to them just to match
like mine Brown accessories I'm wearing
a ton of bracelets here I can't really
tell you what all foam but a lot of them
are from brandy melville so you should
check them out and yeah I guess we love
this outfit and I'm wearing the same
sandals that I was in the first one
so I know a lot of people don't like
wearing dresses to school but I
personally love it this one is one of my
favorites I just love all the pretty
colors on it and I just think it's great
so it has a pretty sweetheart neckline
and then it has like two straps that go
and end up crossing in the back they
think is really pretty I added that same
brown belt just to kind of cinch the
waist and hide the awkward waistband and
I just think this is really pretty
I'm wearing some brown wedges with this
outfit because I love one wedges to
school and I'm also adding a football
cardigan because I know in a lot of
schools this dress wouldn't be
appropriate because of the straps
okay this outfit has got to be my
favorite I know this one might not be
appropriate for all schools even opt for
black teens instead of the shorts so I'm
just wearing my new favorite combat
boots with some I wasted black shorts
and there's really pretty peacock shows
that I'll show you in a minute so I just
really love the toys on this and I tied
the side you can wear like how that
looks and the shirt is really big and I
wanted to kind of show off the
high-waisted shorts and anything kind of
see my skin you can kind of adjust the
amount of skin show with your not if you
want to tie one as well
okay this next outfit is really simple
but I really like it I'm just wearing
this kind of pink striped shirt it has
dug pink and light pink stripes and
they're different sizes and it's kind of
class which I really like the length of
it I just put it with a floral scarf
because you guys might know floral and
stripes are one of my favorite things to
pair together I absolutely love it and I
don't know I'm just wearing some of my
favorite dark wash skinny jeans with
this that I kind of cut at the bottom
because I like how that looks and yeah
I'm wearing a new cloak clip-clop so I
got with this outfit these are rainbow a
brand foot flops and I absolutely love
them so I definitely recommend those
okay so this last alpha I don't really
know if I like that much I kind of just
threw it in here because I wanted
another outfit but I just think it's
pretty cute it just kind of reminds me
of fourth of July but anyways I added a
nice denim shirt because I know these
are really trendy and once again kind of
her good style with just these floral
shorts that I really like they're really
cute and I think they're nice this cool
because they're not too tight or shorts
I'm just wearing a brown braided
bracelet with this to match sandals that
I wore and like all these outfits but
yeah
