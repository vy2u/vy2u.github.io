back-to-school clothing haul video and I
know a lot of you guys are probably
already gone back to school but I don't
go back till September 5th that's
because I get out but I got out of
school of June 20th which I know was a
lot later than most people but yeah I'm
also going to a new school this year I'm
gonna be a sophomore in high school but
my school district is so big that the
high school they had to take ninth grade
out of it so it's only 10th 11th and
12th and you guys have to know I am like
the worst person in the world of
directions seriously I'm awful so I'm
gonna get so lost so if you guys want
like a first day of school vlog video
when that comes around let me know
because I'd be interested in doing that
but yeah I really don't have that much
clothing here you guys probably know I
did in New York City Hall a little bit
back and knows where most of my
back-to-school clothes but I really
realized that I didn't have many like
shorts and tank tops and t-shirts in
that I really got more fall items like
sweaters and stuff so I did get a few
things in this haul video and I decided
I would show you because I was getting
tons of requests I'm doing one of these
so I'm gonna do that now okay before I
get into the clothes I bought I finally
got an iPhone I've been telling you guys
I'm gonna get one for a while now and I
finally broke down and got one because
my old piece-of-crap phone broke so I
got the iPhone 4s the white one and I
love my case this is from Etsy by the
way and I'm obsessed with it
Oh phone call sorry about that but now
I'm gonna get into the hall so the first
thing I got was actually a pair of Steve
Madden wedges but when I ordered them
they came in and the heel is like wood
and it had a big knot in the wood which
was driving me crazy because I'm like
OCD about that stuff so I send them back
and they're sending you a new pair I
haven't gotten them yet
but I'm gonna put a picture in so you
can see what those look like they were
originally close to like $100 and I
ended up getting them for like 38 on
website that I really can't think of the
name so I'll put that down here once I
figure it out Bob now I'm gonna put in
the picture
so yeah I got those and I love wedges to
school because I'm like a midget and I
think their candle enough they're not
like heels or anything so I really like
those okay the next thing I got is a
pair of jeans
a lot of you guys ask me my favorite
places to get jeans and all that stuff
Abercrombie kids is my favorite you guys
might know that I am really really small
I'm like five foot one and I was born
like 3 months early so I've always been
really small so am becoming kids jeans
fit me if they don't think you trying
Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch because they have
like the same jeans obviously but I like
getting the super skinny kind and
dark-wash is my favorite so I just got
this pair as you can see I like pop the
bottoms because I'm a midget but these
were on sale and all ever come be ever
coming in 15 0 and sale right now so I
definitely recommend going out and
getting a pair I like I recall me kids
too because they're cheaper but
obviously if they don't fit you that so
I I become me and Fitch but once again
super skinny are my favorites and I love
okay so I've been wanting like a plum
colored pair of pants and I was actually
in Walmart looking for like makeup or
whatever and I came across this pair now
later on in this haul video you're gonna
see another pair of pants that I got
they're really similar colors so I want
you guys to tell me if you think I
should keep both but basically they're
just like these plummy color with skinny
jeans and these were only like 12
dollars which is amazing but yeah they
look like this
and I really really like them they're
really soft but once again you're gonna
see the other ones I got and tell me if
you think they're too similar but I got
these and I really really like them I
love dark purple I love like plum that's
one of my favorite colors so I'm
definitely gonna get a lot of wear out
of these for the fall if I keep them cuz
the other ones are kind of similar but
you'll see those in a minute okay so
then I went to American Eagle and my mom
actually bought me the stuff of American
Eagle which was so nice of her I always
buy all my clothes you guys don't really
believe me but I do and my mom got me
this stuff from American Eagle which was
so nice of her I just wanna let you guys
know that but these are the pants that
are similar to the other ones only these
ones are maroon they're not only showing
but I will show you the difference see
how these ones are purple and these in
maroon yeah I found these ones after and
I like them a lot more they're just
better quality and stuff but I still
really like the color of those as well
so tell me think think they're too
similar but these are just like maroon
jeggings and once again I had to cut the
bottoms but yeah I love these maroon and
dark purples are like my favorite colors
ever and I'm really glad they're in for
the fall time so yeah these were on sale
as well everything I got from American
Eagle was on sale so definitely check
out this store because they have some
really cute stuff right now oh yeah I
got these and I believe these were like
$30 okay this next sure I got is really
really casual but I love it I love these
types of shirts I'm about to call them I
feel like Henry's or something but
they're just like the shirts that have
the couple buttons up the front and it's
just this like heather gray kind of off
the shoulder loose top kind of thing
it's called their feather light thing I
don't really know you guys can see that
but I think it's really really cute and
it's so soft and comfortable and this
was on sale for $15 so I thought it was
a really great deal and I just love
wearing shirts like this so I love this
okay the next year I'm actually gonna
wear today so that's why I decided to
film this haul video really quick it's
this really cute crop show now I know
cropped shirts aren't good for school
obviously but I have a pair of
high-waisted shorts in here that I plan
on wearing with this so you can't see my
skin but anyways it looks like this and
I know Kaylee Mackenzie has this that's
what made me think of getting it because
I absolutely love it on her and it's
just like this ivory crop top it has
like this really pretty embroidery with
like a tie and it's just really really
cute now I recommend getting this in a
size bigger because I actually tried
this on in my size before and I just
didn't like how it looked and then they
had it on sale in a size bigger so I got
it in that size and like it looks so
much better on me so I definitely
recommend getting a size bigger in this
but I love this and I think it's really
cute and it was on sale for 20 bucks
okay last year I got from American Eagle
I think I'm gonna wear on the first day
of school and it's just this really
really like you topi colored shirt and
you guys might know I'm obsessed with
the color taupe
it's just a tank top and then it has
these really pretty ruffles and buttons
at the front and it's like lacy and then
it just inches and like flares out in
like a really cute baby doll style
and it also has like this kind of messy
lace material like that kind of
surrounds the straps if that makes any
sense but I love this and I think I'm
gonna wear this on the first day of
school with some dark wash jeans and
then a pair of earrings that I got that
she'll see in a minute but this was also
on sale for 20 bucks which i think is a
great deal and I love this okay the next
door that I have stopped five MS forever
21
and I'm gonna start off with something
that I got a while ago but everything
that I've bought after New York City I'm
just putting in s cuz whatever and I got
this awhile ago I've worn it in my
bathroom lookbook video
but pretty much what it is it's just a
down denim shirt because those are super
in right now and I really like it and
it's just like light wash but on the
back it has lace like a nice little lace
section which i think is adorable and I
really really like this it's really cute
and casual it's perfect for school I got
this in a size bigger so that would be
kind of like loose and comfy and I just
really like this sorry son but I mean
you can't really see it but I love this
and I think this was around 20 dollars
ok these next three things from forever
21 I actually got the other day so these
are the earrings I think I'm gonna wear
with that coaster on the first day of
school I'm just gonna show you one they
look like this they're really pretty and
obnoxious like I'm obsessed with
obnoxious earrings like long weird
dangly ones I love them but they look
like this and then they have some
turquoise jewels and stuff the only
thing about these is they're really
really heavy which was really annoying
because they really weigh down my ears
and I didn't know that until I got home
but you know whatever I'm still gonna
wear them because they're really really
cute and I love them I love like pops of
turquoise and stuff so I got these and I
think these were like for 80 next thing
I got was a pair of high-waisted shorts
the ones that I plan on wearing with
that white crop top and they're maroon
because you guys know I love maroon and
they're maroon quarter which i think is
super super cool and no high waisted and
they go like right when my bellybutton
is and that's where that show cuts off
so I see like no skin it's perfect by
school but yeah I'm really like these
they're nice and comfy and they're great
and they were only 1690 which is a great
deal and they have these in a ton of
really pretty colors they had this
really pretty dark teal color that I
almost got but I decided I would go with
the maroon so yeah the last thing I got
is a dress and I'm in love with it I
love it so much
so it's strapless but I'm gonna wear it
with a cardigan and it's kind of crazy
I'm not gonna lie but I love it it has
like this Chevron and navy and white
striped pattern it's strapless it's kind
of sweetheart not really I don't know
but it's a really nice thick material
it's so well made sorry gotta untie this
and then it goes down it has like a
ribbon that you tie in a bow along that
way but I kind of had it untied to show
you and then it flares out in just
regular stripes this is such a thick
material it's so nice like seriously
this is amazing quality and it has like
stickiness in the side so you don't have
to wear a bra because it's already
padded and sticky and it won't fall down
and then it has like a zipper down the
back and the little ribbon that you tie
and I'm obsessed with this it's so nice
and I love it and I can't wait to wear
this to school because I love wearing
dresses to school and this was only 20
to 80 which i think is a great deal for
such a great quality dress so I love
this okay in the last place that I have
things from is Urban Outfitters and I
ordered this stuff just because I wanted
to get a cardigan to wear with that
dress like I wear to school so first
thing I got was just a navy blue
cardigan from their
Urban Outfitters has my favorite
cardigans and they're on sale right now
for $29 which isn't that awful I mean
sterben Outfitters so it's got a new
kind of expensive but I just got a navy
blue one I have one black and I
definitely recommend getting a size
bigger because either 100% kind and they
shrink in the wash so yeah I just got a
navy cardigan to wear that dress because
I'm obsessed with it and obviously I
can't wear it strapless to school so
yeah I also ordered something for my
friend Casa I don't know why I'm showing
this but whatever if you guys are
Touring's
definitely check out Rubin Outfitters
right now because my friend Tessa
where's toe rings and I saw a really
cute o-ring like I don't wear them or
anything but I saw a really cute one I
was like oh my god Tessa I saw this so I
got it for her and I guess I'll show you
guys so it's really really cute I guess
you could wear it on your pinky or
something but it's just gold and it has
like a blue gem in the middle I don't
know if this is focusing
there we go and it's really pretty and
it was only five dollars which is really
great so yeah I got this I don't know
why I showed you that it wasn't even
mine but whatever and then the last
thing I got I'm obsessed with you guys
might know that I love floral and
stripes together I've said that in a few
videos but I love it I don't know why
I'm just obsessed with it so when I saw
this shirt I had to get it so it's just
this Navy and white striped shirt and
it's kind of weird fitting I don't know
the sleeves are really really tight but
then it's kind of baggy and cropped but
I really like how it looks personally
and then the pocket oh my god guys
seriously like look at that pocket it is
floral it's adorable
I know a lot of people I'm gonna like
this but I'm obsessed with it I just
love how it fits and stuff the arms are
really really tight so I don't know if
this is on sale so they might not even
have it on their website anymore but
this was on sale for 20 bucks which I
think may be really great and I love
this I was eyeing this on the website
before it was on sale so yeah I love
this I love the pocket but I think it's
adorable so that one my back to school
haul I hope you guys liked it I know it
wasn't that much stuff but really I
didn't need much I had a ton of stuff
from New York and I do have a lot of
clothes I'm like a clothes whore but
anyways yeah I'm let me know if you want
that first day at school long because
it's gonna be bad I am gonna be so lost
you guys have no idea like seriously
last year I had been in that school I'm
ready for a year it was the junior high
