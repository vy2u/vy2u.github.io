the long-awaited back-to-school clothing
haul before we start this video these
were not all purchased in one day this
has been pretty collective and I also
recently went to Boston so a lot of
these things I got in Boston these might
not fit everyone's dress code but I
don't have much of a dress code at my
school so I can kind of get away with
things but obviously if you can't wear
these items in your school you can
always tweak them or just kind of you
know put a cardigan on or whatnot but
you don't have to buy the same things as
me I just figured I'd be showing you
what I am going to be wearing to school
this year first things are from what we
wholesale you might have seen my last
haul with them and I got a lot of good
stuff this time as well so I'm going to
show you first thing I got is this
really pretty statement necklace I've
been wanting a statement necklace for a
while now so I was really excited to see
this one on the website am I really like
it I like how it's gold so it's not a
color that you feel like fine stuff to
match it with it'll match to mostly
everything and I just think it's really
pretty and it's gonna go to LA next
thing I got is actually a bathing suit I
know this is not back to school at all
but I figured I would show you anyways
so like the last videos that I got from
all the wholesale they're really
inspired by the korea siva bathing suits
so i think this was a Victoria Secret
bathing suit kind of like replicas so
the top looks like this it's navy blue
and then it has some like neon ruffling
around it I guess and then in the middle
it has like a really pretty kind of
jewel detail I really love the bottom so
this bathing suit they're like ruched
and like roughly and neon and then the
back has like a butt kind of ruching
which makes your butt look amazing so I
love these bottoms and they're gonna go
over with like a ton of colors tops
because there's so many colors in these
next thing I have lovely Bowl so
unfortunately does not fit but I got a
pair of boyfriend jeans and these winds
small medium large so I figured small
115 but they're way too big in the waist
so that's unfortunate but they look like
this
they're just here you know your
boyfriend Jean they are ripped and
they're really cute and I really like
them except you know they don't fit so
I'm actually going to be giving these
away in this video if you're interested
in getting these they're probably about
a size six so if you wear a size six
these will probably fit you so if you're
interested in winning these you just
need to comment down below anything that
you would normally comment on a video
like a comment will get you entered and
you also need to follow me on Instagram
and Twitter both at Pearson Tasha so a
week from the upload date when I upload
this I will put everything in the
downbar but away from the upload date I
will be picking a winner and messaging
you I'll just ask for your like address
and stuff so I can send you these pants
okay next thing I got is this really
pretty kind of pink chiffon shirt it has
a v-neck in the front and kind of like
open shoulders or like arms as you can
see and then it like whooshes at the
bottoms and then the cool thing about
this top is the back it has like a lace
kind of cut out thing yeah I got this
white off the shoulder top I think this
can go with so many pieces it's just
kind of white chiffon it's flowy and
then as you can see here the sleeves if
your shoulders keep out so it's just
really cute and this is gonna go with so
many like colored bottoms I always love
wearing colored pants and stuff so this
is going to be awesome with that the
last two items on Optima be wholesale
are shorts the first pair are these
super adorable black shorts they have
like a kind of crocheted lace bottom you
can see it better like right here and I
think they're so cute because you're
like life keeps out a little bit and I
just love these and the last item I got
Flowbee wholesale is probably my
favorite they're just these cute little
crocheted shorts and I wish I got these
in black too now because they're so cute
and they fit it's like so nicely they're
just adorable and I'm obsessed and
they're so comfy and make me look tan
and I'm gonna be wearing these so so
much okay next moving on to TJ Max TJ
Max has had amazing stuff lately I think
it's just me because I'm really into
bohemian kind of prints and they had a
ton of time and I was there okay first
thing I got is this plain white tank top
but it's really cute and it's gonna go
with so much it's just like layered I
have a black one like this except the
straps are thinner so I saw with this
one with straps for a little bit thicker
and I can wear straps to school and as
long as they're like two fingers which
this one is so this one was great and I
know I can wear it to school and then
the back just kind of has like a - look
is that what it's called I don't know it
kind of goes up in the back and it's
just a really cute pretty tank top that
would go a lot like that side t.j.maxx
had a ton of bohemian printed things
which I love so I just got this long
kind of tunic I guess you would call it
I don't really know but it's so pretty I
love the print I love the colors I love
maroon it's like my favorite color ever
so I'm really excited to wear this and
it just has normal sleeves and it's pre
high-low so yeah I'm really excited to
wear this one okay the last thing I got
from TJ Maxx is really really ugly like
I tweeted asking you guys if it was
Hades because it is it's so ugly but I
love it I am obsessed with it and it's
just it's so cute so it's a romper it
looks like this and yeah it's really
ugly the print is hideous but I'm
actually obsessed with so it's a
long-sleeve romper as you can see here
and it just goes down into little choice
tell me if you think this is cute
because I think it's cute I just don't
know if anyone else will well I was in
Boston I went to brandy Melville so
there's a certain print that I'm
obsessed with from brandy and I went in
there just to find this print and
everything that I found in the print was
the last one so naturally I had to get
all of them okay this is the print and
I'm obsessed of it so I got a backpack
in it and it's not gonna fit my school
stuff but it's just nice to kind of like
carry around like to the beach or I
don't know I went to Moses vineyard when
I was in Cape Cod and Boston and stuff
and I just wore this and it's really
cute it holds more than a purse but it's
just as cute so yeah I really like it I
guess I'll show you everything in that
print wanted so I got the shorts and I
love flowy shorts they're my favorite
things that were
Benten seriously they're so cute so I
got the Schwartz and then I also got the
classic brand me dress that's just kind
of roughly that has like the line thingy
in the back
I got a plain white flowy kind of crop
sure because I will want to wear this
with the flowy shorts when I go to
school and this is school appropriate
the last two things I got from Brandi
are the same they're just different
colors so I've been wanting a striped
t-shirt dress because I have a black
leather jacket and I really love it I
just never know what to wear it with and
I was picturing an outfit with a striped
black and something colored just teacher
dress with my leather jacket so when I
saw Brandi had them and they were the
soft branding material I died so I just
got this black and white striped dress
t-shirt dress thing I'm pretty short so
this is a dress but I don't know if this
is just meant to be a long t-shirt I
guess if you're really tall this would
not be a dress but I'm me it's it's
definitely a dress like it's only a few
inches above my knees so yeah definitely
dress but um it would be great as a
shirt as well it's so soft and I was so
obsessed with that shirt that I had to
get it in taupe and black stripes so
yeah there's a better look at that but
seriously this is the lovely jacket and
little loving booties I'm so excited to
wear it like I'm dying to wear it last I
went to was forever 21 one thing I got
was just this plain loose kind of maroon
burgundy shirt like I said this is my
favorite color not only in general but
also to wear like I feel like it looks
good on me
maybe's but it's really cute it's just
like a loose kind of long shirt and the
sleeves are cocked already and this was
only 980 so I figured I kind of have to
get it along with the bohemian prints
once again I got this really pretty
three-quarter length shirt and it has
some crochet detailing at the top which
I'm obsessed with and it's so pretty I
love the pattern I love the colors and I
can't wait to wear this as well then I
got this tank top another kind of floral
bohemian print but it's really
has some like lace in the front and it
has like a little layer so it's like
wings or something but yeah this is
adorable and I've already wound this and
it's really cute and I love it
I've been seeing a lot of sweaters with
like a lace popping off the bottom and I
like them a lot but I haven't seen one
that I really wanted so I saw this one
in forever 21 and mind you I got a large
because I like them to be really
oversized but it's just this oatmeal
colored sweater and at the bottom it
just has some lace as you can see you
there so that's everything that I have
for this haul video I know it was pretty
long so if you got through it with me
thank you once again if you want to win
