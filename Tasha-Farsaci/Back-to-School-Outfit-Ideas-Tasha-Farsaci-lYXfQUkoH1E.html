back-to-school outfits video I know this
is actually really late but I've been so
busy I got a new job as you guys may or
may not know I work at a grocery store
and I had two weeks straight of training
and I still have to work pretty often so
I have been really really busy and I'm
going back to school
pretty soon I'm going back September 4th
I think so I know some of you might not
have gone back to school yet but if you
have hopefully this isn't too late and
you can still take some inspiration
every time I do look books or outfit
videos people always comment on like if
my outfits are inappropriate or not but
you guys need to know that I really
don't have a dress code in my school so
I like to wear what I like to wear if
these outfits don't fit in your dress
code you can obviously tweak a few
things to kind of help them to fit your
dress code like maybe it's changed
shorts for jeans or wear some tights but
I really would appreciate it if you
don't comment like this is so bad I get
kicked out of school if I wore this
because I don't and I like wearing it
and I would appreciate it if you
wouldn't you know be rude about it so
yeah I think that's about it I have like
five outfits I think and I hope you guys
enjoy it
so keep watching
Oh n-nothing you're dead to the devil
the soul it flows feather away amazing
how the song it's all almost a feeling
almost some here
to not cause tears not summon rain keep
us warm without a chill do not dive deep
to not force way keep it light keep it
light all right
water come on
how about a little
the sting is the fall in line
heart is filled with dedication despite
the naysayers despite the critics almost
a feeling almost how about a little
harmless
you
so that's it I hope you guys enjoyed
this video be sure to comment anything
you want down below or just comment your
favorite outfit or what you're gonna be
wearing on the first day of school I
would appreciate it if you'd follow me
on Twitter and Instagram both at
fiercely Tasha and I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
