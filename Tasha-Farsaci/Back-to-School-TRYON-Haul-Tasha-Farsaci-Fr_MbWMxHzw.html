a nother hall and like I say most of my
halls if you don't like hollows you
don't have to watch them I know I do a
lot of them but I like shopping I like
halls UI is a seemed like halls at least
most of you so I do them a lot you know
it's whatever but if you don't like them
you don't have to watch I apologize for
my hair I know it looks like a mop but
it's like 90 degrees outside and really
humid it was just down pouring so it's
just you know doing it frizzy thing yeah
also my nails are done normally I try to
have them done in my videos but they
were just gel and I picked all the gel
off and they're like gross and crusty
now so yeah sorry today's haul video is
going to be another back to school kind
of haul segment from my last video but
all this stuff is from boohoo.com i'm
pretty sure i've talked about boo boo
before in a few haul videos because i
have ordered things from them two or
three times with all my own money I
think I really like boohoo is because
everything is very affordable everything
is under a hundred dollars and I'm
pretty sure most things are in like the
five dollar forty dollar range so very
affordable which I love and they also
have free shipping on orders over 50 so
it's a really great deal i hate paying
shipping so like i said i've ordered
from boohoo myself numerous times and
they actually contacted me and asked if
i want to do a haul video for them and
obviously i said yes because like i said
i've bought things my own money from
them before so i really like their
company their website their clothes so
yeah they did send me these items for
this video but honestly that doesn't
influence my opinion at all because like
i said i love them so i just wanted to
be completely honest with you like I
always am but yeah they did send me
these but still I picked them all out
and I'm gonna be honest okay the first
things I got from boohoo are two pairs
of shoes and these first ones are these
black ankle booties I love ankle booties
and I have a thing for ankle booties
with little heels because I'm very short
and five to one I mentioned this in a
lot of videos but I saw these
I absolutely love that they're like the
chelsea boot style and i have a pair of
like chelsea boots in like a taupe color
that i love i wear them all the time so
when I saw these on the website are not
really excited and they're kind of funky
because they have like a pointed toe
going on which is different for me I
don't really have any shoes pointed toes
but these are really cute I'd say
they're like a one and a half inch heels
so it just adds a little bit of height
like I mean I'm still really short but
yeah I really like these the next pair
of shoes I was really excited about but
they don't really fit me um basically
they're tall gladiator sandals i'll show
you my friend melanie has a pair like
this that she wears all the time and I
really love them so I wanted to get them
but i forgot that i have really skinny
calves and legs so these fit fine like
right here but once you get to like the
calf part they're a little bit loose so
i don't know i might give these to a
friend or something there's still really
really cute shoes i really like them
it's just they're loose on my leg and
that's not really the look I was going
for but still really cute shoes if you
don't have like super super were like
stick-like legs like hide you these
would probably be perfectly fine for you
since this is a back to school haul of
course I'm gonna get some jeans so boo
who has a section for like petite sizing
which is great for me because like I
said I'm short I'm small sometimes pants
don't fit their like baggy and awkward
and I know some people are gonna be like
oh I wish I got that problem but it's
annoying like if I want jeans to be
tight on me it's hard to find them
sometimes but these jeans fit really
well the first pair I got our black
ripped jeans and I got a pair of black
ripped jeans recently but they just have
like slashes in them whereas these ones
are really completely like shredded
which i like i like the ones that i
slashed with sarah Napa's and i want
them shredded with other offers so yeah
as you can see just misread black jeans
the next pair of jeans i got is pretty
simple it's just like a medium wash pair
with some grips as you can see here and
these ones actually pick me really
really well i love how these fit there a
little bit long but just long enough
where I can pop them and it looks like a
natural cough not like the cough is like
this big because they log on me you know
what I mean it looks really good i like
helping
jeans anyways and I just really like how
these fit I have a pair like this from
american eagle but i never wear them
because they just fit weird so I'm
really glad that I got these ones
because I really love the fit next show
I got is a craft basic kind of top boo
who has the best basics like I'm not
kidding they have really cute trendy
basics for super affordable and like a
bajillion colors so this one I really
really liked it's basically an army
green color that's like my favorite one
of my favorite colors to wear and it's
just an across in the front little like
crop top but it's not too cropped it
doesn't go down too low but I just think
it's it's like more interesting than
just a plain like solid color cropped
like T SCHIP you know what I mean and
it's really really soft I really love
this I got a pair of jean shorts because
even though it's full i am going to
school in california so it's going to be
pretty warm stone these are just some
high waisted jean shorts um i don't know
how i feel about the lighter like parts
i don't know i always think that kind of
looks like cheap um but I things like if
i watch these up and they look a little
bit more worn I think it could work
because right now it's just looking a
little bit too like fresh and new and
like I don't I'll wash these and then
let you know but they fit me really well
next just like i love i was actually
gonna order this like right before boom
contacted me so woohoo um it's this kind
of like trap easy shift dress just for
this like really nice pattern on it and
this is a really really really comfy
material it's like I don't even know how
to explain it it's really like stretchy
but like smooth I don't know I really
like the mystery although this dress is
really comfortable and I love the print
it's just going to be great I'm the
colors are nice so you can transition
this into the fall it's not like a super
bright summery dress so I like it for
that okay next I got this shirt and I
think it's really cute it looks really
nice with those black jeans i showed you
so it's just like a black-and-white
print
and then it goes a little bit like off
the shoulder as you can tell and then
the sleeves like flare out like this and
then it's just a nice long loose flowy
shirt I love like flowy long shirts with
really tight pants that's kind of my
thing um I don't know that's like my
favorite to a thing to wear I love like
flowy tops and dresses but then my pants
are always really tight so yeah this is
a really cute top I love this this top
is so pretty and will go really really
nicely with those and ripped um medium
wash jeans it's really girly it's just
like a white top with crochet and then a
little like cut out pup for your
shoulder and then the sleeves like flow
out so like as you can see it's kind of
like I don't know like chiffon the leg
stripey I don't know the correct wording
but yeah back to how awesome boobs
basics are I got this black like halter
top because it's basically the same
exact style as the olive green brandy
one I was wearing a few videos back so
it's just like a halter that you don't
have to tie it just goes around on your
neck on its own that is be cropped and I
love these I do have to say i think the
brandy want is a little bit thicker this
one um that really see too but like if i
were to wear a hot pink bra under this
you could like see through um I still
like it I love the style of halters I
feel like they're really flattering for
some reason um yeah so boo who has very
comparable ones to the brandy ones if
you've been looking for one of those I
got this more for probably going out at
night um it would look cute with that
blacktop actually so it's one of those
like rap looking skirt scored things I
haven't had it easy for it but it's a
black and white floral print and then in
the back it's shorts so it's great when
this looks like a skirt from the front
but you know your butt is concealed with
the shorts okay I'm to my last item I
feel like this went by quickly but it's
probably going to end up being super
long because my halls always are this
dress looked
so cute on the website and it still is
cute but it's so big on me like it
literally makes me look like I'm on
Little House of the Prairie uh I'm
probably gonna give it to my friend
because she's a lot taller than me and
this would look good on her and she has
boobs but on me it looks like it's
wobbling me so it's really really cute
Brad like floral paisley bohemian dress
is so adorable like I love it the back
is like crossing Oh what am i doing
Crossy you can kind of see I absolutely
love dress except it goes super long as
like a big it'll look awesome on my
friend still a really cute dress it's
just large so that is the hall I just
