tutorial and I filmed this rust this
whole video on my camera and basically
like the colors will not a vibrant and
this is my webcam and the colors are a
lot more vibrant so I'm just going to
show you them on here as you can see
it's like pink and glitter in the center
with blue in the crease and then lots of
eyeliner and mascara and then just a hot
pink lips so yeah here we go
today I have a makeup tutorial for you
and it's a halloween tutorial it is
Barbie and I don't know how well this
even showed up because my camera doesn't
really show colors very well but
basically it's a pink sparkly with blue
I am a thick liner big lashes lots of
white eyeliner tons of glitter and then
a bright pink lip so yeah and basically
as long as your hair is blond this will
work if not you can get a wig because
blonde hair is kind of necessary to meet
Barbie my hair is not super blonde but
it's you know dark blonde so it works
for clothing I did have a hot pink dress
but I don't know where it is so I'm just
wearing this like navy blue tunic with
pink hearts on it so anything pink hot
pink will work for you know dressing up
his Barbie but I don't know if you can
even see how intense and glittery this
is I really wish you could but yeah so
stay tuned for the tutorial sorry if
it's not that great I not very rated
filming tutorials but yeah so stay tuned
okay so i'm pointing to the I that's
done and this I i'm just going to prime
my Urban Decay primer potion I'm just
going to blend that in this will keep my
shadows on all day and make them very
vibrant and then I'm just going to put
some concealer under my eyes because
Barbie has perfect skin I will be
applying foundation but I don't really
wear foundation so I'm just using
concealer and that is race pace by
benefit now i'm taking this NYX alter
pearl pigment and it's in a light pink
color it's not only showing up but I'm
just putting this all over my lid it's
really shimmery and it's perfect for
Barbie now i'm taking Urban Decay
palette and taking this blue color and
put it in the crease this is just going
to add some color and definition to the
eye and make it a little more fun
now i'm taking a chapstick putting it on
my finger and putting it on my lid this
might take off a little bit of the pink
but that's fine because we're just
putting some glitter on over it that'll
make the glitter stick put it on the
finger that use for the chapstick on and
then plop it on your eye I'm putting a
lot on this is a purple glitter so it
goes with the Barbie colors and a little
bits going to fall under my eye but
that's fine now i'm taking a shimmery
white and putting it under my brow bone
as a highlight and now i'm taking a
glittery pink and putting this in my
inner corner just to kind of brighten up
the tear duct area now I'm lining my
upper lash line with a liquid liner I'm
doing a pretty thick line and it's kind
of hard for me to get this on camera so
I'm going to come back in a minute with
it done okay now i'm taking a white
eyeliner and lining my waterline this is
going to make your eyes look a lot
bigger and just Barbie like and just
putting this a little bit on my lower
lash line as well and then I'm going to
set it with a very shimmery white color
the same one that I highlighted my brow
bone with and I'm just going to put this
on my waterline and lower lash line just
to kind of set it and make it more
vibrant and shimmery and then i'm
applying mascara normally you would use
false lashes for my halloween look but
just for the safety tutorial i'm not now
i'm applying a pink blush to my apples
of my cheeks
and putting on a chapstick that's kind
of frosty just to kind of prime my lips
for the lipstick and now I'm putting on
a hot pink lipstick any hot pink will do
I look so weird right now yeah I'm going
to take my hair down and that's it so I
hope you guys like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
