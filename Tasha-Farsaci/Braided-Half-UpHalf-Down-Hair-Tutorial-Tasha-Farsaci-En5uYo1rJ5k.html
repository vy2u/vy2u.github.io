hair tutorial for you I tried this out
this morning for the first time for went
to school and I actually really liked it
and I got a bunch of compliments on it
it's super easy so I decided I would do
a tutorial on it for you guys and
basically it looks like this in the
front it just kind of looks like you
have your hair half up half down but do
you really don't because it's Dutch
braided along the side on both sides and
then they connect in the back so I'll
show you that now and then they connect
like this in the back so I really love
this hairstyle and it works for pretty
much most hair lengths your hair has to
be long enough so the braids can reach
the back of your head but other than
that I mean your hair probably only have
to be in like here so I have long hair
obviously all you're gonna know how to
have to do for this hairstyle is a Dutch
braid and I explained it in the video
it's not super in-depth so if you don't
understand it you can just search a
video on how to do a Dutch braid up in
the info bar or they also call it um an
inverse braid and it's basically a
French braid except instead of pulling
the pieces over each other you pull them
under which is pretty easy so if you
don't know how to do that and you want
more explanation other than my tutorial
you can just search one I don't have one
but there's tons on YouTube you're also
going to need three little hair ties I
mean they don't have to be little but I
prefer mine to be little so they're not
as noticeable you can get like packs of
hundreds for like a dollar at the dollar
store so I really like these and yeah
that's basically it so if you want to
learn how to do this keep watching okay
so the first thing that you're going to
want to do is just part your hair
wherever you normally code it I pop my
on the side it really doesn't matter
where you put your hair I mean if you do
a middle part that might actually look a
little bit better so then the both
braids will be equal and even but still
I do a sigh poet and I really like how
it looks so you can just part your hair
wherever you want
okay now I'm nice good closer so you can
kind of see the actual braid if my hair
looks greasy or anything it's really not
it was just pouring and I have to walk
from the top of my street all the way
down to my house after I get dropped off
from the bus so it's just kind of like
damp and wet and that's why but it's not
Gracie I promise okay so we're going to
start off at the top you head and you're
just going to take a little section from
the top it doesn't have to be bigger or
anything just like about this much of
your hair and you're going to split it
into three equal sections so once you
have your three sections you're going to
want to start braiding in this whole
time you're going to want to keep your
braids up and back because that's where
it's going to end up going after when
you're done and you want to make sure
you're pulling it tight so you don't get
any annoying bumps or loops so if you
don't know how to do a Dutch braid
basically it's a French braid except
you're pulling students under instead of
over how you would with a normal braid
so I'm just going to start off with one
section of just a normal underneath
braid not really Dutch braid yet so as
you can see normally and a regular braid
this would go over the middle section
but instead it's going under and then
the same with this side it's going under
the middle section and once again we
want to pull this tight and kind of
bring it upwards so now I'm going to
start the Dutch braid section and what
I'm going to do is grab a piece of hair
from over here on this side of my head
before I pull on I'm going to add it to
the section and then I will pull it on
there after that I'm going to move on to
this section grab a piece of hair from
around that area add it to that section
and then pull it under the middle
section your section grab a piece under
the middle section so I'm just going to
keep doing that and I'm going to go to
about right above my ear
okay so once I get to a bow right here
I'm just going to braid normally but
it's really not going to be completely
normal and you're going to still bring
the strands underneath like you were
doing this braid so as you can see I'm
bringing them underneath the middle
section and then once again I'm kind of
pulling the Strand back as i braid since
I it's going to go that way against my
head so as you can see I'm just braiding
underneath the middle section instead of
pulling the strands over and you want to
go down pretty far this isn't going to
like hang here but you want to go down
pretty far just so you can ensure that
it'll wrap to the back of your head and
then you're just going to secure it with
an elastic for now okay so I'm going to
end it here because I know this will
reach the back of my head and I'm just
going to use a little elastic to kind of
tie it off this isn't permanent so it
doesn't have to look perfect and then
I'm going to do the same to the other
side and now I look kind of funny with
these but what we're going to do is
bring them both back and connect them in
the back with another hair tie so I'm
going to turn around now and hope that
you can see this okay so I'm just going
to comb out my hair in the back so that
I know there's no bumps
once I'm putting pulling the pieces back
okay so then what I'm going to do is
take my two braids and pull them nice
and tightly around my head connect them
in the back and then tie them together
make sure it's in the middle of the back
of your head so it doesn't look funny
and then kind of pull them to tighten it
and you're going to see that you have
the braids here this is why I um wanted
to make sure that I braided as much
because I wanted it to be braiding all
the way back to my head I'm just going
to take out these braids and then just
tighten it one more time so I hope you
