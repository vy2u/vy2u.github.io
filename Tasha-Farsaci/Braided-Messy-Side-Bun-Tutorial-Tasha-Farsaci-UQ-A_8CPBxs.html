tutorial on this look it's kind of like
a messy Brigade side bun I do this all
the time i used to do these in my offer
the weeks left when I was going to
school and a lot of you guys asked for
tutorials so my good one and this is
what it looks like it's basically just
like a messy side bun elm and its really
simple this takes less than five minutes
it's perfect for any hair texture and i
love it so i hope you guys also like
this and i'm uploading this on
thanksgiving day so if you're watching
this on Thanksgiving happy Thanksgiving
and if you're not then yeah just keep
watching ok so the great thing about
this hairstyle is that you can use any
hair texture this is my natural hair if
you guys have watched my videos for a
while you know that used to be girly but
now it's just kind of awkward um I slept
on this so it's a little straighter than
it normally would be but yeah so just
going to start off with your natural
hair and you're gonna put it on one side
of your head I always put my hair on my
right side so there's more on this side
but you guys want to do it the other way
that's totally fine tuned and then I'm
just gonna gather at all and bring it to
the side that had more hair on it so I'm
bringing it to my left side and use
going to kind of bring it over you know
brush it out there's no bumps on the top
and then you're going to kind of bring
it back into a nice little pony tail on
that side and you want it to be kind of
tight ok so then you're just going to
kind of tighten it over here and you
have like this nice low ponytail like
you like this then there's a yourself
but I personally don't want this and now
I'm just going to kind of break this
hair all the way down I'm sure you guys
all know how to pray
um so yeah I'm going to do that okay so
your brains to look something like this
if you guys not as long as mine is not
going to be as long but that's still
okay and then what you're going to do
with the braid is kind of wrap it around
itself like where the first ponytail
blue ones just kind of into a coil and
then you're going to pin it into place
with some bobby pins okay so once you're
done it's gonna look something like this
I found that looks different every time
I do it so that's kind of cool and then
you can just pull down loosen some
pieces if you want to do that and I like
to kind of pull down this piece in the
front of my head just to kind of make it
look a little more effortless and if you
have bumps you can bobby pin them down
all I had with me right now is big bobby
pin but I would normally use one that's
not as big um but yeah it's kind of like
a loose-knit I kind of like it to look
messy and I'm gone but ideally like this
I with us all the time so I hope you
guys like it too
and yes so but I've</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
