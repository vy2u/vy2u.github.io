going to be a really really busy day for
me yeah so I don't know how to yeah I
don't know how much vlogging I'm gonna
get done basically I have to cook some
cookie things for project I have to
finish my research paper I have to print
out a bunch of stuff I have to edit
vlogmas from today and I have a meeting
with a counselor at USC at 1:30
I think I'm like out of focus what the
heck there we go anyways yeah so I do a
meeting with a counselor at USC and
basically what happened is the other day
of orientation I was just scheduling my
classes with a regular advisor just for
like undeclared students because if you
guys don't know I applied to be a
communication major and then they didn't
let me in I got in his undeclared so
anyways that happened so I was talking
to her and I was saying how oh I want to
be an ana Berg and she told me that if I
just make an appointment with an advisor
Annenberg which is the name of the
communication school here that they
might just switch my major before the
spring semester starts so I was like
okay oh my god I'm so out of focus it's
focusing on the doors that's super weird
maybe if I like yeah so she was like
they might just put your major like
without you having to apply into the
school or anything so obviously I wanted
to try that out so yeah I have a point
an appointment with an advisor for the
communication school at 1:30 so my kind
of nervous hopefully it goes well I mean
if she doesn't switch my major like
whatever but it's worth a shot
so yeah okay I told you guys at Chester
has separation anxiety and staff just
left to go print something and he's so
sad like he was literally whining so
much and now he like is sitting so close
to me and he needs someone to be
touching him at all times I'm also
trying to edit my video so he can help
me hey Chester right say hi
say hi to the vlog see look at him he I
have to be holding him at all times ago
hold my arm great you're so cute Chester
guys look at his neck flab oh look at
this you look like a little ostrich
Chester so I just got to the building
when my appointment is and I'm really
early but I'd rather be really the heat
so I'm just sitting here I guess I'll
show you what it looks like around me so
this is the old communication building
they have a new one now and then there's
the trackway over there and then just a
building yeah Campus is still pretty
dead because people are still studying
for finals and stuff guys every time I
come in the bookstore I almost buy
everything I really want this sweatshirt
everything's so expensive but look how
cute it all is these are the tube tops I
worked the game a lot of you guys ask
where I get the skirts from game day and
they literally just sell them at the
bookstore as well as the socks so yeah
there's the answer for that story
literally as a free people section
that's when you know you came to the
right school like a literally would
okay guys I'm so excited I think I'm
basically in Annenberg now my advisor
told me that I was all caught up and it
should work out and she just sent me a
form to fill out and then after I fill
it out and submit it I have to see if
they let me in but she said bill like
there's like a almost 100% chance that
I'm letting and I'm so happy basically I
just went to the bookstore because I was
supposed to get my roommate Emily to
blue books which are basically like test
booklets and of course whenever I go to
the bookstore I buy so much stuff
because I'm obsessed with college of
hero see I'll show you what I got later
I think I'm gonna be chick-fil-a okay so
I just left campus and I'm currently
walking the chick-fil-a there should
play like basically on campus it's like
right off of campus
guys I love took place so much this is
my way of celebrating also I bought
those clothes myself but yes guys come
to chick-fil-a and get the spicy chicken
sandwich with chick-fil-a stuff and I
promise you will love me and literally
sitting here alone right now I hope I
don't see anyone I know
okay so I'm about to go study more but I
thought I would show you what I got from
the bookstores I'm about to like put it
on so first I just got these little
shorts I just think they're cute and I'm
a lot of like comfy shorts why am I so
out of focus
okay yeah so I just thought that these
are really cute and then I've been
winding the sweat suit for a while but
they never had my size and they must
have just restocked so I just got this
big gray sweatshirt I think it's really
cute it's kind of like that um spirit
jersey style but it's more of a happy
material looks like that and then the
back just says Trojans and yeah I'm
probably gonna put these on right now so
I can be comfortable and do my work like
almost done I have about a page and a
half more to write so yeah Chester is my
bed I don't even think you can see him
hey hey little nugget can you say hi to
vlog Miss Honey blah miss oh hi guys so
I basically finished my research paper
finally I just have to do the work cited
page for it but that's like super quick
and we're about to make some cookies for
my class I'm gonna put a photo here of
what they should look like kind of when
I'm done basically they're supposed to
be eyeballs because I'm gonna be talking
about Oedipus and if you guys are
familiar with that Greek myth he ends up
gouging his eyes not at the end so I
thought that would be an interesting
pairing I am currently watching the Food
Network oh it's not even on right now
but I'm currently watching the Food
Network to get myself into the serum
with Santa obviously yeah so I guess all
filmy drinks will this stuff it's not
really cooking because with my luck I'd
burn something or poison someone so
basically all you do is kind of split
the Oreo in half so it still has all the
cream on it and that's like the white of
your eyeball and then I have these two
little gel decorator things the blue for
the iris of the eye and then I have red
for like the little eye veins and then I
have taco chips to be the pupil so it
really shouldn't be too hard I want to
make sure I chose something that I
couldn't really mess up so we'll see how
that goes okay maybe I'm really stupid
but I can't figure out how open this
like it definitely has a coating over
the top and I'm really confused how
it's supposed to open jordan to like cut
it or something okay so I just googled
it and it says to just cut off the tip
so I guess that's what I'm gonna do
you guys are gonna comment down below if
you like Tasha what the heck you're so
stupid this is hard why is this like I
think this isn't right okay so I figured
it out I just cut the top off and I
realize I accidentally got jumbo
chocolate chips so hopefully that looks
okay I'm just gonna add some red like
squiggly veins this is what they look
like
hopefully they look like eyeballs hi
guys so my nose is red once again I
think I've decided it's when I get warm
because I'm like really warming better
right now so yeah that's a thing um
basically I just finished my research
paper finally um I did like I made like
a PowerPoint and yeah I'm like so so
tired I need to go to bed but I just
want to like get all my stuff organized
I just want to draw something like
really quickly because I've been reading
comments all day from my blog from
yesterday and literally like so many
people are telling me how rude I'm being
and like judgmental and like snobby
about Community College and I literally
like these things like they just
comments don't really bother me if
they're good comments but it's when I
clearly like state something in a video
and people like ignore what I say and
just pick out little things you and I
mean I clearly said I'm not bashing
Community College I think Community
College is great like I will be saved so
much money this semester and I'm getting
the same credits I think it's great it's
a great option what I was saying is the
specific community college if I go to
probably wasn't the best option for me
just because I don't feel like it's the
most rigorous one I don't think it's in
the best location I should have gone you
know where most other USC spring units
go it's just not the one for me and
that's all I was trying to say is that
the one I go to I don't really feel
challenged I don't feel like the
coursework is as hard because I was at a
four-year school come any but in
comparison I just don't feel like I'm
getting as much out of it it's not all I
was trying to say so I don't really like
the Community College that I'm attending
personally I wasn't trying to bash
Community College
and when the goes to it because I'm
going to it like what the heck like why
would I bash something I'm doing if I
didn't like Community College I thought
it was like shitty I wouldn't have
chosen to go to it at all you know what
I mean so yeah I was just getting so
many comments about that and like I was
I don't know whatever that's what I was
trying to say I don't want to talk about
it anymore
but anyways yeah I'm going to like print
all my stuff out get it together and
then it go to bed so I hope you guys
enjoyed this episode of vlog um yeah ok
