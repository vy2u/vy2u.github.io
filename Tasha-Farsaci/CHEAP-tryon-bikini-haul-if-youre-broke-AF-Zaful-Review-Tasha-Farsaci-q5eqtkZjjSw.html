you're new I am Tasha welcome so today I
have another affordable swimsuit bikini
bathing suit haul video I love doing
these videos a lot of you guys like
doing them I love watching them so here
I am before I get on the video if you
guys aren't following me on social media
and you want to totally feel free I will
put them on the screen as well as in the
description box okay so a little
disclaimer before the video these suits
are from example.com I have thrown
numerous hauls example before and every
time some people get bought her and they
say that you know as Apple is not a good
company and they send different products
to youtubers they may do some you know
an average person and I just want to say
that this is my experience and I do know
people that are not youtubers who have
ordered from is Apple and receive the
same quality products so I don't know
what other people have experienced but
this is my knowledge from what I have
gotten compared to people that I know
that I've also gotten things that are of
the same quality and I do have something
in this haul it is not good quality also
I think I can say that you know why
would I send that to a youtuber you know
if they had better things so that's what
I want to say on that
please don't leave comments about that
if you guys don't like the Apple just
don't watch this video or don't leave a
comment like something else I want to
say is make sure if you guys are
ordering from them you order the items
that say like priority shipping or ships
in one to three days or something like
that because I think the reason a lot of
people have problems with shipping from
them is you choose the items that say
processing times 7 to 15 days those are
the things that don't ship fat because I
only choose the items that are like 1 to
3 day shipping and I always get them
within one or two weeks oh and for
reference
I am super fatigued I have like a thirty
to thirty for a boob size and then I
wear a size 0 or size 24 on the bottom
and I'm 5 foot 1 so yeah I'm really
really small and I got everything in
this haul video in a size small if you
guys are interested in Putin's Apple
though I
love almost all of these suits so this
is the video to watch so I'm going to
start off with possibly my favorite I'd
only know it is this amazing quality
bikini the color is beautiful it's this
wine kind of color it looks like this
it's just your plain triangle top I
found this is really flattering for
smaller boobs okay so the bottoms on
these are a high cut bottom I'm not
riding on yet but I think they will
probably sit and just go higher up on
your hips and then when I wasted and
these are really really really really
really really great quality they are
seamless this is my favorite okay moving
on to probably my second favorite or
another one of my favorites is this
orange e bikini which is normally a
color I would not go for but I really
like this this is a dupe for a chaos
bikini if they used to have I don't
think they sell it anymore but basically
looks like this triangle cut and then it
has these cute little shells in the
bottom and then the bottom these
actually fit me so well but if they look
like this and then they have the same
shell from the bottoms bottoms are
cheeky you guys if you guys know me you
know I like cheeky bottoms so we will
leave it at that but this is really good
quality once again it's seamless which I
love
okay next I got two of the same bikini
in different colors because I really
like the style and for these ones I love
the tops at the bottom I'm not obsessive
this one I feel like they're a little
bit small on me and they throw on super
flattering but the quality is still
really great so first one is this blue
one you rather probably seen this style
before it's pretty popular basically it
is dis pulusu and then it just has mesh
and then two little little strips that
cover your nipples so yeah it's a little
it's candy but I absolutely loose so it
works and it's just like really really
cool and flattering the bottoms are
super cool but they are yeah like I said
a little bit tight on me and you will
see why that's an issue it's because
they're really strappy and then they
have a span that goes around the top so
how many two bands and having it be
tight it kind of squishes my skin and it
kind of looks like love handles I'm not
super into that
so yeah it's not moral I do really like
the style the bottoms are super cool but
I think I just need them to be a little
bit bigger okay and then I also got that
suit in a very different color for me
and normally I stay away from hot pink
but I like this for some reason I
thought it was really cool in the style
so it's this neon hot pink same suit I
don't know I was into it for some reason
let me know what you think and then the
bottoms are yeah the bottoms are the
same really twisted but you res get the
point
oh my gosh every suit that I see I'm
like alright this is my favorite this
one is so flattering guys it makes me
look like I assume and I do not have
boobs at all so this is something this
is like a mac and cheese color that's
how I would describe this this is
literally kraft mac and cheese I like
the spirals comment down below which
ones you guys like the best
I think the spirals taste better than
all of them even the spongebob ones so
it looks like this is mac and cheese
color and then it has a double strap
this gives me boobs somehow into the
bottoms the bottom are almost too small
they look like this cheeky string
bottoms really good for canning but
these just cut my side just the
slightest I think I can make them more
surprised I stretch the mouse will be
fine but yeah this too looks bomb and
they have a few colors so if you aren't
into the mac and cheese
there are other colors okay this next
two also gives me boobs somehow and it's
also a color it's kind of different for
me a lot of different colors in this
video but basically the top of success
is more with sports bra style top which
is really really supportive so this
would be great if you're doing like
water sports or anything like that
swimming this is really good looks like
this and have some padding in it oh wait
actually I live oh it's backward okay
there you go looks like this and then
the bottoms are SuperDuper cheeky but
I'm into that they look like this to be
honest not sure which is the front or
the back so I'm showing you those but
yeah I really really like this suit as
well it's really really nice quality and
I would recommend
okay this suit I was so excited for but
if you guys
Instagram at all you probably know about
the viral bathing-suit giveaway that was
a thing or like it was like share this
photo and you'll get this spoon for free
only pay shipping and look exactly like
this this is not the suit so on that
giveaway which i think was like spam
anyways I don't think it was legit if
you guys got the food from that let me
know I wanted this before that whole
thing happened because I really wanted
like a Baywatch kind of bathing suit
like this and I love this suit but now I
feel like if I wear it everyone's going
to be like oh you got that pre suit I
don't know I'm still gonna wear it I
think it's so cute
okay this next to probably looks the
most expensive of all them and onset of
so senses it looks like this it's all
nice and employer it's just like it's
like a halter this fading through is
better for people who you know my guys
bigger boobs because this is like pretty
supportive and the bottoms have more
coverage so if you're into that there's
a big test for you I would say but it's
just really really nice there's so much
like cool and grey on this and then the
bottoms are super nice as well and
embroidered really really good quality I
guess they're kind of cheeky they're
just not cheap compared to one on
YouTube okay there's nothing wrong with
this mech suit I just probably like it
um I don't know I don't know what I
don't like about it it's fine the
quality's good basically it's this white
one piece and it's super cool I think
this is a duplicate of a blue life one
piece I know I find is a black blue eyes
one it looks just like this but have
some lace up in the front and then it
lays up on the side I think the reason I
don't like this is because it's not
cheeky enough so you guys don't like
your entire butt out like I do I'm good
for you alright this too soft I hate
this one so much luckily all the other
ones were amazing you guys this one is
shit I'll show you why and I've seen
other people haul this suit and it's
fine so I just I like a shitty one so
now with the show that you know all
youtubers don't get good suit so at
first glance this probably looks fine
it's just like a cool pink like roughly
one okay so this is
at the middle of the zoo and as you can
see here this like little piece of it is
like rock uh and it's just like sticking
up think if you see from this side it's
like super messy right here I don't know
that just doesn't look good to me I mean
I'm sure I could like sew it down and
like figure this out but honestly that
just looks like gross and really really
cheap to me the real problem I had it
came from the bottom okay like look at
this little ruffle do you see this like
gross rip like that looks so gross and
then the threads are like coming out I
don't even know how well you guys can
see this but I don't know the bottoms
are just not good quality okay the you
rest of the items I have from zapallar
clothing slash accessory item I always
do this because a lot of people always
focus on the bathing suits but if you
have a lot of really cute clothes as
well so I'm going to go into those the
first thing I guess is accommodating to
kind of bodysuit I don't know I feel
about this I tried on once and I haven't
least thought of it since then so we'll
see it's like this black crocheted body
- I don't know I feel like the
proportion numbers it's really weird it
looks like you'd be way way too long on
me but I tried on and it kind of worked
so we'll see how it looks in the trial
and we can decide if we like it from
there and it's all this would be cool
with like a bathing suit under it was
some like diamond shorts so yeah we'll
see the next year I was actually wearing
yesterday I love this I think it's so
cute and versatile it's this little off
the shoulder crop top and then I have
this course is called it was it's called
like cabbage or something not cabbage
alright let us let us know I don't know
what's the nail it at times I could be
so wrong why am i relating to food I
don't really know but yeah it has that
people have and this is so cute okay I
got two maxi dresses this one really
really wrinkly yeah I tried the condom
one so I didn't get a good idea of how I
felt about it so we'll have to figure it
out from the try on whether or not we
like it but the top looks like this it's
like a stretchy smock material it has
these cute little strings and the back
is all open with these little these
little strings and then it goes down
into a maxi dress would like these
roughly
on the bottom you see okay the last
clothing piece is really really really
good quality I think this was kind of
pricey on their website
to the audits but the quality is really
great so if you guys do love it then I
would definitely check it out
so it's this beaded embroidered top maxi
dress this is so heavy because it has so
many be dollar like oh my gosh it's so
pretty
and then it goes down like this and it's
a maxi and the material is so soft and
so nice on this and the strap looks like
this in the bath yeah this is really
really pretty okay last but certainly
not least I have a pair of sunglasses a
baffle and I have one these Instagram
pictures and I've got so many questions
about that because they look so
expensive and they're these babies they
are foods Apple I'm not lying they're so
cool I think I have like a crooked nose
because I'm not so they're always like
crooked on me but anyways I think these
are so cool they look really expensive
and I love them I have to go ask and
it's done glass like if they're really
excessive and they're not there comes
Apple and the quality feels really good
on that and they feel really dirty so we
have obsesses 'yes yes so that is my
example try on haul review I will have
everything linked down below totally

favorite thing was on me that I got or
