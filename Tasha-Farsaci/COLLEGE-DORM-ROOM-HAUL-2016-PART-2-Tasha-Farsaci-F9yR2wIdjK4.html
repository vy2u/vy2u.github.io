part two of my dorm room haul so it's
basically just going to be another dorm
room hall I did one like a week or so
ago so not too long ago but I just got a
whole box of drawing stuff in the mail
so I want to show you guys because I
know you like doing videos and college
videos and you like seeing what gets my
dorm so before I start I just want you
guys to know that this video is not
sponsored but all these items were sent
to me by Duomo Phi M dorm Phi is super
awesome and I just wanted to show you
guys these in a video but like I said
they're not paying me it's it's not
sponsor they didn't tell me to say
anything so I'm literally just giving
you my 100% honest opinion so just give
you a little bit of background on Norma
Phi it's a website that sells a lot of
super cute dorm decor and something
awesome about Gamma Phi is that they
have collections so if you're someone
like me who isn't really good at dorm or
just like interior design kind of things
I feel like I'm really bad at putting
things together and making them look
good in the space so basically what the
collections are is a bunch of different
items like a comforter in pillows and
rugs and stuff they go together and they
have a collection for like anyone's
taste a bunch of different collections
and you can kind of pick and choose what
you want for each collection the things
that I got from a dorm fire are not a
collection because the collections come
with a comforter and I already had a
comforter that I'm going to use for next
year so I didn't get a collection but I
picked out a lot of different stuff that
is pretty neutral so I feel like it
would go with most collections but I
just kind of wanted to give you guys an
idea of what you can do on dorm up by so
if you're really bad like matching stuff
like me you can literally go look at
their collections and then it has a
stuff that goes together all picked out
right for you so you know it's gonna
look good so I just kind of want to show
you you don't need to get a collection
either you can get whatever you want the
website but I want to show you what I
got
also before I get into this if you are
not subscribed to my channel please
subscribe it takes um one click and it
would mean the world to me so anyways I
probably won't be bringing all of us to
college
I might use some for my room at home
because some of its heavy I don't know
I'm gonna get it all the way from New
York to California but it's still cute
nevertheless okay the first thing I got
is in the box I'm gonna insert a picture
of it so you can kind of see what it
looks like better but basically it's a
wall display for like photos and I love
hanging photos in my dorm I have a
Polaroid camera so I last year I strung
some um some Polaroids on a string if
you want to see my dorm room tour from
freshman year or part one of my dorm
room hall and then leave them both down
below anyways this is gonna be a lot
hand here it has like two white things
on the side and basically it comes with
like the string and the clothes pins
that hang your photos on and this just
looks like a lot more organized so I
think this is gonna be really helpful
for when I'm hanging photos I really
love the look of white fluffy shag rugs
or just faux fur things in rooms and
they had a bunch of this stuff on dorm
of five so the first thing I got is this
fluffy little area rug and it's pretty
small but it's definitely a good size if
you want to put this in your dorm room
because you know sometimes drawing rooms
floors are really cold or just gross and
you want to be able to step on something
nice so this is super pretty going along
with that rug is this fluffy pillow and
I have all these in my house what I
happen to use in my room here at home
it's a little bit different but I love
it so I think this just adds some luxury
to your room I don't know I think these
are so fun and fluffy so I'm definitely
going to be using this one okay the next
thing that I got from dorm of I is so
exciting it's another pillow it's a body
pillow this thing is huge this is like
what I'm probably cannot bring to school
even though I want to because like what
excuse me and this is happy this is a
nice pillow um see you may be thinking
that it's just white oh you guys better
bet that I got a furry faux fur cover
for it so it's gonna match both of those
other
so well and it's going to be so cute and
I can cuddle with it and I'm so excited
I've wanted a nice body pillow for so
long and my mom won't let me get one for
my dorm room last year so now I'm like
hah now I have a body below the second
to last thing I got is going to be
really helpful it's a little jewelry
organizer so it looks like this and it's
why I happen liking a lot of white kind
of accessories for rooms so it's white
and have like this little thing for
bracelets I have so many bracelets so
that's why I really wanted this and then
on the side it has like holes for your
earrings which is really helpful and
then obviously right here you can put
bracelets rings whatever you want to put
there so this is really helpful things
like this are great because they don't
take up too much space and put they help
organize and make things look cute you
know instead of like throwing all your
jewelry in like a box this keeps things
organized the last thing I got from
Norma Phi it's not really dorm take home
at all if you watch my first dorm wall I
got a coffee mug and I got another
coffee mug this was so cute I don't know
I just love coffee mugs
I might not bring this to college but I
really wanted this and this would be
cute for college because look how cute
it is it says but first coffee and I've
seen Eagle with this exact travel mug
before and I wanted it so when I saw it
I was like yes umm if you watched my
what not to bring to college video I
said don't bring a lot of cups um but if
you are going to bring one it should be
a travel one like this so you can bring
it to class and you could like take the
top off and it can just get regular mugs
so I do recommend bringing one and I
recommend bringing this one because it's
really cute and you can travel with it
and why would you not want this so that
is everything that I got from the dormer
bye thank you so much to them for
sending me all these awesome goodies I'm
so excited to make my dorm room look
amazing next year and also I do have a
discount code for you guys I think it's
20% off I don't know it right now but
I'm gonna put it in description box down
below so definitely go check it out you
guys should seriously look on dorm Phi
and get some stuff because everything
so cute and also just really quickly
before I'm done with this video I'm
gonna ask you guys to give me a little
favor
I'm currently in a competition to be jet
sets magazine what Jet Set magazines
next cover model they kept emailing me
and asking me to sign up so I was like
okay why not and now actually I'm
getting pretty far so if you guys could
vote for me it literally takes one click
you sign it with Facebook and you just
click a vote it doesn't share it or
anything like no one's gonna see it but
if you guys would go for me that'd be so
awesome I think it's like by state and
then once they get the top person in
each state then it's like more voting so
if you guys could vote me I'm gonna link
that down below that'd be awesome okay
so that's it I convinced all I want to
say in this video I'm also gonna link a
bunch of my college videos down below

series going and I know if you're
