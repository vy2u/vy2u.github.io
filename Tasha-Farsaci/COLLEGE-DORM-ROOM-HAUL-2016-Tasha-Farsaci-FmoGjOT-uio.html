haul and I know this is really early
it's literally the beginning of June but
I did one of these last year you guys
really liked it and the way I see things
with like dwoing videos and dorm hauls
is the sooner the better because things
are going to sell out at the end of
summer would have one else's shopping so
I like doing my duong shopping in the
beginning of the summer and all
throughout the summer so that I get the
best stuff so everything in this video
is going to be from society6 which is
one of my new favorite websites if you
don't know what it is basically artists
can submit their art or their designs
and then you can get that design on
pretty much everything and they recently
added a lot of like home decor options
and dorm options so that's the stuff
that I focus on getting and I really
like society6 because everything is very
unique and you're probably not going to
have the same thing as anyone else
whereas if you go and get your dorm
stuff from like Target or Bed Bath and
Beyond you're probably going to have
something similar when it's same as
someone else so I really like society6
because it's very unique and
customizable to what you like so I'm
going to link my dorm haul from last
year down below because I'm using a lot
of the same items from that next year I
don't exactly know my living situation
yet it's a long story I'll probably talk
more about this in a future vlog to come
but I know I'm probably going to be
living in a dorm style situation so I'm
keeping my same comforter from last year
and a lot of like storage kind of things
so pretty much this stuff in this haul
is just like decor and little
accessories but everything's really cute
and I kind of stuff to like a beachy
vibe because I do go to school in Los
Angeles and I love the beach I love like
little boho beachy kind of things so
that's why the style of most of this is
like that also I did get some random
things that aren't necessarily dorm is
sure but I'm going to show you those too
because they're really cool and you
could get that design in dorm things if
you wanted to and before I forget I have
a coupon code for society6 if you want
anything it's Tasha dorm I'm going to
put this all in the description but if
you use that you get 10% off and free
shipping on
thing from society6 I'll try and link
the designs that I got down below in
case you guys are interested because I
got a lot of really cute stuff and it
really matches so if you guys want to
copy me and get like the same stuff
that'd be awesome so the first thing I
got is this canvas and I really liked it
it's just a canvas with two palm trees
on it it kind of looks like a sunset
with like a little line of water I
thought this would be really cute to
hang on the wall I found it with dorms
it really makes a difference to add
pieces to the wall it makes it a lot
more homey and cute I'm gonna link my
dorm tour down below as well if you
haven't seen my dorm room tour from
freshman year you can see I had a lot of
stuff in my walls and I really liked how
that looked so I thought this would be a
good addition going along with stuff to
put on your wall I got this clock which
I think is so cool and it's probably
reflecting a little bit of the window so
I'll come a little bit closer so
hopefully you can see it's a white clock
and it has some tropical leaves and I
think this print is so pretty this clock
is so so pretty and I love it
the next thing I got is it necessarily
dorm room decor but it does go along
with like school and stuff so I got this
laptop holder which is so handy it has a
zip and it's padded on the inside and
this is perfect because sometimes I feel
kind of bad so I my laptop in my back
when I go to class because you know
those things are expensive so I thought
this was so cute it matches my dorm so I
could just like lay it on my desk it
looks really cute and it's going to be
perfect my laptop they have this in
different sizes and then something that
I thought was super nice is that they
threw in an extra one that just says
society6 so I'm sure I can use this one
as well the next thing I got is a pillow
and I've also match my bedspread pretty
well if you guys watched my dorm haul
slash dorm room tour from last year you
know that my bedspread is kind of little
raspberry color and unlike this dark
teal so I thought this would match and
it's really cute I love having throw
pillows at my bed at school that's
another thing that really makes your
dorm room look homey and comfortable is
about two pillows so I love this one one
of my favorite things ever is fuzzy
blankets and society6 has throw blanket
and I'm not kidding you when I say this
is the softest blanket I've ever felt
and it's kind of big I got the smallest
size and
pretty big so I'll show you so it's
pretty much this ingredient like hombre
throw blanket with like teal colors and
it's fairly big but I did get the
smallest size they have to put sizes and
a lot of their things and then you can
see the other side is so fuzzy either
both willy fuzzy but the underside is
even more fuzzy than like this side but
I thought this would be really cute to
throw on my bed I got a tapestry from
society6 and I did get another one from
them a few months ago and I had it in my
dorm and I was going to use it but I got
the large size and it is huge way too
big for my dorm so I don't recommend
getting the large size for dorm it'll be
fine in my room at home that's why I
think I'm gonna hang it but in terms of
dorms since they're fairly small I
recommend getting a smaller medium so I
got this one in the medium it's kind of
similar to the one I got before but it's
totally big so I think I'll insert like
a photo of it you can kind of see it
better but uh ah ok so basically it's
white on the top and then it goes down
and to just like ocean like there's like
a blue line solid line and then it's
like ocean yeah I actually already - see
I'm gonna go ahead and put like a photo
in but I think this is really nice it's
simple one-off where I think it looks
fine with all the patterns going on in
my room will be the rest of this up I
have to show you it's kind of random and
doesn't really go along with the whole
dorm room thing but I still want to show
you first thing I got is a phone case
and it's really cute and pretty I think
I say cute too much everyone always
comments telling me I thank you too much
here's the phone case how pretty is that
it's just tropical really cool and I
just love thinking that someone designed
these and I'm hoping at the designers
I got a beach towel from them which kind
of is a doing haul because I go to the
beach a lot at school it's really close
to school and we do have a pool on
campus that you can lay out in Tana so
I've been eating a good beach towel I
literally had a crappy one from CVS the
entire year
so this one is so nice this is the
nicest quality beach towel I've ever had
in my life it's so nice and large
I hate when those small details and that
either your head or if you have to be in
the sand still like I'm not about that
life
so this one is perfect and I thought the
pattern was so cool it's pomegranates
you'll see what I mean it looks like
this there's giant pomegranates on it
it's so large guys I'm probably gonna
put a photo of the design somewhere
around here as well because it's really
hard for me to show you as you can tell
but I think it's so cool and this is
gonna be great for the beach it's really
thick and heavy and nice and I'm so
excited to use this okay the next thing
I got is actually a gift for a friend so
Alice if you're watching this please
skip like a minute because it is this
little mug I saw it and I thought of her
immediately
it just says coffee keeps me going until
it's time for wine and her birthday is
coming up so I had to get this and we
drink so much coffee at school it's
seriously a necessity for college so if
you don't like coffee get on the
bandwagon guys but yeah this is so cute
I saw it on society6 and I love that you
can get designs on mugs because mom's
are some of my favorite things I can
never have enough mugs so yeah this is
so cute
this item is so weird but it's so me I
got a t-shirt because I saw this design
and I had to I couldn't not get this
design on a t-shirt if you guys know me
or have been watching my videos for a
while you know I'm obsessed with pugs
hands-down obsessed if any of you guys
have pugs please tweet their photo I'm
gonna put all my social media down below
please feed me a photo of your Pug like
I love pugs so I saw this design and I
also like flamingos guys I love those
flamingos pool floaties like coolest
thing ever
guys
you may be thinking okay I see flamingo
like what's that other thing
guys it's literally a pug lying on the
back of a flamingo like excuse me what I
saw this design and I knew I had to get
it in something but I couldn't decide
what and then I was like what's better
than a t-shirt so I picked like the
woman's fit and they have a bunch of
different colors so I got this like
heathered light blue color and the
shirts probably the best thing I own at
all ever
I'm obsessed it's so weird and odd but I
I love it whoever designed this you are
my hero
and then society6 is awesome once again
they threw in a little society6 t-shirt
and then a society6 tote bag so that's
all the stuff from society6 for this
video I know I'm going to making
probably more dorm halls as the summer
goes on because I'm going to be
accumulating more things and I think I'm
gonna do a dorm room must-haves video
