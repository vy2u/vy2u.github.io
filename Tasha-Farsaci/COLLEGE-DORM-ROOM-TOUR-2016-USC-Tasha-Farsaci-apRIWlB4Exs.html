video for you before I get to the video
yes my hair is slightly wet slashed damp
I didn't want to lose all the natural
lighting waiting for it to dry so I'm
sorry if it looks really bad but today I
have my dorm room tour for the 2016-2017
school year I actually did one of these
videos last year so if you haven't seen
that I'm going to link it down below you
guys should totally watch it but there's
just a few things that I need to go over
before I get into the video or else you
guys would probably have lots of
questions so this year I am attending
USC the University of Southern
California but last year when I was a
freshman I went to Loyola Marymount
University so yes I did transfer here
and I am a spring admit which means that
I can't actually take classes at USC
until the spring semester so for the
fall semester I am taking classes at
Community College I have videos about
both of these topics so I'm gonna link
those down below as well so because I
was so excited to finally be a USC
student I wanted to live by USC and just
kind of like live where I was going to
live with a spring semester so I am
living in an apartment complex that's
really close to USC campus it's not
on-campus housing but it is still
advertised as student housing not going
to say which apartment complex I'm
living in but if you guys are familiar
with the area you'll probably be able to
guess so yes I am living in an apartment
but I'm still calling this a dorm room
tour because my room still kind of looks
like a dorm because like I said it's
student housing so basically I have my
room and then there's a kitchen slash
living area and then there's another
bedroom and then right back there is my
bathroom so most of these rooms are
doubles like your normal dorm room but
I'm actually paying from both the spots
in my rooms so I could have it as a
single I'm saving a lot of money at
Community College this semester so I was
able to do that so yeah basically I have
a double but I'm living in it as a
single so it has like two of everything
I do have two suite mates that live in
each other room and they have a super
cute dog but his hair gets everywhere
and it's like might be on my floor
this video so if you see dog here that's
why I think that's everything I want to
touch on hopefully that clears some
things up so if you're not subscribed to
my channel please subscribe I post comes
up like Collin videos and like fashion
video there's like all types of videos
so please subscribe if you haven't
already and also if you guys want to
keep up with my personal life more
totally follow me on my social media
accounts because I'm really active on
those I'll put them here and I'll also
link them down below okay I'm sure you
guys are sick of hearing me blab so I'm
going to get right on to the video now
okay so when you first walk in this is
what it looks like
I guess this can just be like a small
little overview but I'm just going to
kind of go around the room and show you
like piece by piece okay so starting
over here this is my bed you will see
that there are two beds in here but like
I said I am living as a single I just
chose to keep both beds so that if I
have guests they can sleep there so this
is my bed and this comforter is from
Urban Outfitters I got it like last year
I think but I really love it and then I
just have this little throw blanket that
I got from Macy's I believe and then I
like to have a lot of pillows I feel
like it adds a lot to the room so this
white one is from JCPenney the blue one
I think is from Bed Bath and Beyond the
fuzzy ones I think one's from dorm Fi
and ones from Target and then I just
have like a back pillow there from I
think Target and then just my normal
sleeping pillow so that's this bed you
can see I kind of just have some cords
here for where I plug in my phone in my
laptop and not the cutest thing ever but
it's like the only thing that works I
have like a little sign up there this
has beach' holic if you saw my dorm room
tour from last year it's kind of similar
to what it looked like last year and if
you haven't seen that I will link it
down below but that's my bed so next my
bed I just had this explore lamp that I
got from Marshalls and it's really nice
it has like a ton of light so that's
really handy to have okay so this makes
it a little bit easier to see I just
have some turquoise turquoise I can't
speak uh-hum string lights above these
two windows and then up there I have
this floral tee that I made once again
both
things were in my dorm room last year in
between my windows I have a dreamcatcher
and then I also have my little youtube
plaque for 100,000 subscribers I always
like to have that in my room but I just
think it looks nice and centered like
this
I guess I'll move on to my desk right
now my laptop's just on it as well as my
phone but I have this little jewelry
holder organizer thing I think this is
from Norma Phi as well and I just have a
bunch of my bracelets on it actually all
those are from rope the moon jewelry
it's like my favorite and it's kind of
like threw some change in there and then
probably my favorite part of my room is
this little guy I got this a little
cactus at the Melrose trading post it's
like a flea market here in LA and I
loved it and it came with that little
pot and I just think it's so cute so
hopefully I don't kill this one moving
on I just keep my makeup and my makeup
brushes here next to a little cactus guy
I don't know exactly where I got that
kind of clear storage thing I want to
say it's from Marshalls or TJ Maxx and
the same with that little cup do you
know probably home goods or something
also it got loud I'm sorry this air
conditioning fan thing just turned on so
hopefully you can still hear me anyways
yeah this is my desk for makeup and
getting ready so because of that I do
have this mirror on it I think it's from
Costco it's perfect it lights up and
it's like the best thing ever for doing
my makeup okay so this is my other bed
and I just think it's really cute I kind
of made it to look like a couch so that
it didn't look just like a double like I
had two beds but this comforter I got
from Anthropologie and it's actually a
size Queen and I just kind of folded it
in half and it fits perfectly and then I
have a few pillows on here in the back
that large fluffy body pillow is from
Norma Phi and then these two kind of
turquoise pillows I got from Crate and
Barrel and then this little raspberry
pillow guy I got from Pier one
underneath the beds on both beds there
are these little storage kind of drawer
things all those Brown things are
storage and I just keep some clothes and
underwear and bathing suits and stuff in
them so those are really handy for
storage okay so I was going to put a
tapestry above this but I forgot to
bring it with me so I put this above it
instead and I actually really like it
it's a metal print from society6 and
just has the ocean on it I think it's
really really pretty and it kind of just
ties in with the turquoise teal colors
that I have in the room okay so moving
on next to my couch bed thing I have
this little table and I got this from
Marshalls it's super cute and it matches
the brown drawers on the bed and on this
I just needed some extra space to kind
of put some things so I have a candle I
have some hand sanitizer and then I have
this jewelry organizer that I actually
really do not like it all but I brought
it with me and I needed somewhere to put
some jewelry so I just kind of have it
here for the time being and then
underneath I found this awesome a little
laundry hamper that matches the teal
stuff in my room perfectly I think it's
so cute
I found it at Burlington Burlington Coat
Factory so yeah I just like how this
looks next to my bed and I kind of just
like throw stuff on here like my keys
and things like that when I get back
from class okay so I had another desk in
this room because it was you know for
the other bed so I'm literally living in
like a double and I have all the
furniture for a double so I decided to
make this like my kind of study table
it's just at the end of my bed and above
it I put this really cool photo hanging
thing that I got from Gamma Phi and just
put some photos on it and then above I
have my son child sign from brandy
melville and then here on this desk I
just kind of have some like
miscellaneous things I have some
elephant thingies on you guys can tell I
think elephants are really cute this one
just has some pens and pencils in it
this is a little candle holder from
Crate and Barrel and then I have another
little mini bath and Bodyworks candle in
there and then this lamp I really like
it I got it from Target underneath here
I just have my printer and my textbooks
nothing do you exciting oh and I almost
forgot under the other desk
I just have a few mugs and then my trash
can I know it doesn't look cute with the
plastic bag in it like it's necessary so
yeah that's just kind of what I keep
under my makeup desk this is the back of
my door I have in over the door hanger
guys I totally recommend these and I
just have my backpack on it some
baseball caps one of my purses in my
camera bag when you first walk in my
room you kind of see this clock I have
here from society6
it's so cute but it's so loud like I can
hear it ticket you guys might be able to
hear it I don't know this is my closet
it's actually so messy right now so I'm
not going to show you a lot of it um but
it's a really nice size it's a walk-in
and it's made for two people like I said
like most of the room so yeah I'm not
showing you the floor because I threw so
much stuff on the floor but yeah that's
my closet that's where I keep a lot of
my dresses and just things that I like
to hang okay so this is my bathroom
hi you can see me um I try to get it as
clean as I could it's been really hard
to keep it clean because like I said my
roommates have a dog so it's kind of
like dog hair all over the floor it kind
of like tracks into my room but I tried
my best so this is my bathroom it's
perfect it's so nice and like large for
just one person okay so I have a tissue
box I have a little elephant random
holder thing I think from home goods
with a candle on top from Walmart I have
this toothbrush holder that I got at I
think JCPenney this soap dispenser is
from home goods this little jar thing I
keep some hair ties and stuff in also
from home goods and then I just have
some lotions some deodorant and some
micellar cleansing water not sponsored
and then I just have like a little cup
that I drink water out of at night so
that's what that looks like and then I
have a bath man that's impossible to
keep clean I thought it was so cute but
I realized that getting a white bath mat
is not the best idea it's from Target
this is my shower not not at um to see
here over here is my toilet I have a
trash can from Target oh my gosh I
didn't put the toilet paper on the roll
I hate myself I'm sorry guys a little
baby lavender vanilla candle from Bath
and Body Works and then I have those
cute little canvas from society6 that I
just really liked above the toilet
though some cabinets and then on the
back of my door I have another one of
these little behind the door hangers and
I just have some robes and I wash cloth
and then over here on this towel rack I
just have my
bathtime yeah so that was my room I hope

watch and it give you some inspiration
