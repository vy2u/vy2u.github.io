am here with Gretchen and it will be
more a vegetable beauty on youtube today
we were doing an East Coast versus West
Coast College video and I came up with
this idea because I get so many
questions from people that are from East
Coast like me that one and over West
Coast for college and they're like how
different is it or vice versa or just
people that want to know the differences
before they choose when they go to
college and I thought filming the
question it would be perfect because you
want to tell them about you if they
don't know me she high reunion
hot emoji it's me IG lb give you I'm
Gretchen and yet let me send out a
Christmassy and I go to Boston
University and Tasha goes to USC and I
go to be we thought it'd be perfect to
tell us together because obviously when
the East Coast entry to the west coast
so we have like lots of advice to give
you guys on just with legs different
featuring like being in college on the
East Coast versus West Coast oh yeah I
like similarities and obviously this is
just going to be for like LA and Boston
obviously we don't know everything about
like all the tools on the coast but yeah
this is primarily going to be ally in
Boston but if you guys have anything
else to add about eCos West Coast
differences or whatever we're talking
about to leave them in the comments yeah
come with that down below I want to see
like what else are missing with you
really forgot it isn't so different to
that's so interesting
yeah okay I have them listed on my phone
so the first topic you wanted to cover
with weather differences or the impact
of weather I know I move in Sarah here's
New York which was Emily the snowiest
city in the US for so long and the
weather was so different or be so hot
even in the summer and then freezing and
snowing in the winter that's what I was
used to but then going to school in LA
and especially since mostly California
in general it's just like smooth sailing
all year like so it barely rained always
funny and so it's pretty warm so yeah I
think LA I mean not all the west coast
obviously but like
holid some other so you don't really
worry about it yeah I feel you might
don't have with the extremes because you
don't have at the four seasons really
like obviously we're both from upstate
New York feel like having really really
cold winters and really warm summers
it's like the same in Boston because
it's not that far and I would just say
like Tosh man we're talking about this
earlier like if you don't have one of
those masses with puffy parkas that goes
like your ankles with you will freeze
your butt off so just like realizing
that that's like a reality of living in
New England versus like LA I like it's
obviously so different so just like be
prepared we ask us for advice um like
what questions you have tapas and stuff
that's for a lot of your pants on so the
next one is are people on the west coast
morning Selvam Sabella hope is awards
slash materialistic specially LA I mean
what coast in general maybes in LA but
USC like not everyone is from LA you
know what I mean like yeah there are a
lot of people that are found in Southern
California and they have a lot of like
nice things do they have like a lot of
money or whatever but like that's only a
small section of us being so I don't
feel like like anywhere you are just
going to depends obviously actually look
the people you're but and like obviously
some people more like a self-absorbed
another is like different groups and all
I have seeds I'm gonna have notice and
maybe this is just like being in social
media and stuff but plastic surgery is
way more common in LA and like me some
people I've seen like I know so many
people that have gotten positive news
which like I'm not against plastic
surgery not at all but like from where I
grew up in New York nothing no one has
it's like taboo like people think it's
weird yeah and then in LA it's like so
common like so - yeah what do people do
through size okay yeah so I feel like
this is really different obviously coast
to coast just based on like weather and
like in Boston I love that there's like
so much to do and I actually really like
they go the extremes and mother and
that's a different climate because like
in the winter obviously you can like go
skiing you can go I feel if there's so
much more you can do and then like
for fun in the summer
the macaque on the Charles like Galileo
IMAX penomet whatever would you always
have that in LA but I don't know I'd
like there's so much to be able if
there's always so much to do in LA like
just being like in cities like you said
yeah I mean even like Southern
California obviously it's warm all the
time people go to the beach and stuff
but I have driven up to Mammoth Mountain
and my friend is gone skiing like yeah
so it's not impossible
I don't really ski so I have family mm
fun but I love going to the beach I go
shopping exploring I love going on about
some subjects do you can do anywhere I
pay about yeah so they'd leave you for
fun or pretty similar the only thing
that's like a limiting is like weather
options yeah yeah public transit oh yeah
they don't have that NL I do that we
have okay we have the metro it's pretty
new which is kind of like a train and
it's not bad I just think a lot of
people don't really know about it it's
so buddy's new it is very just built
really in the last year but so I use
that sometimes to go to Santa Monica
because it's quick and it's cheap but
it's not like so does it still take a
long line yeah because it's like on it's
like on the road with the car so you're
selling something trapping himself and
the also like Buffett but I've never
taken those honestly like from what I've
heard some people increased after you
like really
I've never taken them if you guys have
like let me know but that's subscribers
so yeah that's like so many people in LA
have cars in LA have cars
that's why I like Ida super most places
super and more like the traffic is
always so bad but yeah okay that makes
sense then because like in Boston
obviously there's like so much public
transportation like it's such a thing
and it just like normal life after every
take like literally from class I can
walk I could run I could take a bike I
could take the tea I could take the bus
like there's so many options I can do
bar there's literally so many options
you like if you can't take other ways of
transportation to find another one
because there's so many and like I would
say taking the team taking the bus uber
and walk into class is all like all four
looks equally common yeah uses all of
them so yeah I mean you are see we don't
feel like a bug but if we're talking
like the city in general we don't really
have like yeah
ports which are popular oh yeah it's
been fun it's so different
wait what is in LA I forget well not
really LA but I mean like that my USB in
particular like football thing obviously
football technologies comes to yeah but
the sport that I definitely know about
these come us and maybe that's just like
my town like where I lived in but water
polo it wasn't big and I know that you
have a rear Ivy League school but water
boils very so huge
that's so crazy yeah I wanted to little
Marymount University which is inelia
College in watercolor which is a big as
well so I think that's a great pool make
sure you go to college you know like
which proteins are because you'll be
surprised like but school's own yuma
cross the cross is not big on their left
foot at all yeah that's a that's what
we're talking yeah that all are the
crostini the good old McCroskey which is
b1 and they're really good but like
yours are all club oh yeah okay yeah I
was doing across from me so she goes now
I don't you know but arms really been
it's really big at BU and like
surrounding colleges you Boston see like
in the biggest one fiber are obviously
talking so like it's not be so no
honkies not a big thing either so weird
it was opposite like we don't well we
just don't have the ball as we did in
obviously beading but on coffee is
obviously the biggest a like all of the
money from athletic just gonna offer
about that no we don't have caught me
like Club hockey can we tell me we also
had called hockey but none of them were
very good yeah okay a lot of you guys
are asking about the application process
I apply to school them that you code the
MLS coast and they were insane I mean I
applied to like schools in the common
apps so obviously those are things and I
don't really think the application
process would be very different
yeah I feel like spot a lot of questions
on that in terms of being like how does
it apply different like really it
shouldn't be unless you want to crease
supplements for every specific college
among you but like I would say 99% of
colleges and
members like all they're going to be
juniors but pretty much all members on
the common act so they got an
application is just the same everywhere
I know I applied two ideas different
topology reminder and a pool but I
applied to movie you see the shirt in
California state schools and that was
kind of different especially because I
wasn't a California resident so that
application process was a little
different but it was amazing crazy it
was still the same question yeah
hardest part about going to school on
either coast I don't think it's hard
going to school but it's hard being far
from home
because I don't like it homesick but for
me it's just like if I want to go home
for some reason I can't just like he
hopped on a plane and go like that's
like a whole group six hours of my mind
so I think that's hard and like storing
on their clothes
um if I'm living moving though so hard
yeah like I was I go home like twice
mapping three times a year so that's so
crazy
yeah and like were so different because
she knew that she wanted to go to LA and
was like just so ready for that she's so
independent and I'm like on the other
spectrum I mean not like quite like I'm
not like at home but it's only like two
nine hours from home because I knew I
wanted to be closed and so yeah I think
the hardest part for me like for me I
still feel far even though like
obviously you know when you're enjoying
your life far enough but if you like a
drive yeah what's your obviously going
to miss home a little bit if you're not
living at home and in the cars part of
just being a college there if you like
be like the weather and the winter was
really good yeah I didn't go to view for
revenue seems like only applied to you I
would probably be you like floral is
Miami
can I feel like yeah just know the
weather of the school you're going to do
it are you going into it button top
clothing item / friends oh yeah we were
saying up boys because requests those
ideas of the most different so then like
the way the way anywhere there's like
the clothes that they wear are so
different
yeah I like boys are doing a little
skater rolling bands and they all wear
like shorts that are like up other needs
that's so weird I decided that here
there's a nobody is normal for Lego like
for Boston and you guys enough you guys
know the New England like northeast boy
this is like the difficult what like
this salmon shorts with the polo oh no
we don't have a collared everyone wears
spareribs a typical like preppy guys
like there's a big year and it Wayfarer
sunglasses like they're all the things
and with people in Illinois start
without David Mann done and they like
Heather like surf shoes I drag okay
actually all of the frat boys my school
like the thing at USC they all wear
sorority t-shirt that is so like they
get t-shirts unlike any charity event
they go to like Alvin be off with you
otherwise would also see invite or
something they will like the girl give
them a shirt developes so all the guys
widows all the time with some sort of
like short some short short but like
they wear during the day yeah they all
be always like or a shirt just a tisha
where they were on all about I swear and
then you know some sort of like converse
sort of style she were like bands
Atlantic but they don't only wear the
mid cap stocks and I would really get
home it was like Nike mid cap yeah yeah
obviously I don't dress is good at me
for us with the main thing like
generally should go what about girls for
you guys um well we can't girls dress to
me too I should say I'm going overly
pedagogue Anna
anyway were kind of being boost like
yeah I don't wear ceases but everyone
got happy now you have these that
isolate every girl I do XE has a
Victoria merch sandals
um oh no I'm trying to think of other
things you will have yeah okay having a
majors slash job this one I definitely
thought out because being in California
or LA specifically a lot of people want
to go into film one of my really good
friends is like an asterisk I wanted to
super into acting and performing and
then even our cinematic arts school is
huge like that we want to be like a
producer a director
everyone's super into cinema but I feel
like isn't really as know yet that's
actually so different like I've heard
the stories elect people being like in
LA and like a viewing entertainment oh
so basic that's also cool and we haven't
even ever take entertainment or like you
have to babysit students cool everyone
does without Medellin but then like in
New England in like for being Boston
like I came to Boston and especially at
the Eli was like no one's going to know
about you here we can be really chill
milky like I like that YouTube girl on
campus members like wait you're that
girl is does YouTube like it's like such
a big deal since it's not like the norm
there but I second l a-- analyst days
there was like Oh YouTube channels
around I would allow you to brief it at
your s being yeah so it's like more than
wall but then we get bu is like so not
normal that it's more of like a rare
thing that it was it little about and
like there's like film is like whale
anything like we still like a really
cool film school and like a lot of
people in it but I would say way more
people are interested in like business
or like like what's it called in
medicine like they're like going to med
school enough not seriously look at it
yeah we have entire but it's just like a
lot of people want to go into
entertainment like make sense yes yes I
think that's everything we kind of want
to figure over and like the main topics
as I've asked about you guys any more
questions about this comes up even down
below and either a real answer or other
people in the comment section and will
answer yeah so thank you guys so much
for watching and as always stay tuned
for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
