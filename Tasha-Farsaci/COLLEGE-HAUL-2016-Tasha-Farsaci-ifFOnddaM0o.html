feel like your face is just not working
and it looks uglier than normal because
I'm having one and I call them my ugly
face days when no amount of makeup can
make my face better
like today my face is just not working
for me
hello guys so today I have the last
installation of my college dorm room
haul college haul video a type of thing
I've done to dorm room halls this summer
if you have not seen them I'm going to
link them in the description box this
video is going to be more of a college
haul not so much a dorm haul because I
have some random stuff that's not
necessarily for a dorm but it's still
kind of for college so that's kind of
how I'm going to title this video before
I get into the stuff that I want to show
you though I am going to go over what
I'm wearing because I always get so many
comments and questions about what I'm
wearing so first of all this necklace
here is from robe the moon jewelry I'm
going to link it down below I'm a brand
ambassador and I love this so much this
dress I'm wearing I got from Irene's
story back when I was at school so I
don't know if they still sell it now and
then my bra let I get questions about my
bra ads on every single video all of
them are from Free People I only get
relics from Free People
pretty much so whenever I'm wearing a
halter bra lap that looks like this
Free People yes so I'm going to link
these items down below if I can't find
the exact item I'll link something
similar anyways if you guys didn't watch
my first dorm room haul this summer
everything was from a website called
society6 and I got some more stuff from
them just because I love them so much so
if you did not see that video and you're
unfamiliar with society6 basically it's
a website that has artists that create
design and you can put their designs on
tons of different things so you can get
them not only on art prints but you can
get them on t-shirts and towels and rugs
and duvet covers and seriously
everything so I'm obsessed with them I
think it's super awesome because all
their designs are so unique so not only
can you customize them to exactly what
you want but no one else
is going to have the same thing most
likely and you're supporting you know
artists so I really like size six and
totally recommend you guys you know
checking them out and I will link
everything that I get down below oh and
before I forget I do have a discount
code for you so if you use the code
fierce deal at checkout you get 10% off
and free shipping at society6 so that's
a great deal and yeah I totally
recommend you guys use it okay so the
first thing I got is for my bathroom I
didn't really update you guys on what
I'm doing for college since I am a
transfer spring admin but I'm living in
an apartment so if you guys want kind of
an update Q&amp;amp;A style video on what I'm
doing let me know in the comments and
also leave like questions you have for
me basically I'm living in an apartment
I have my own bedroom and bathroom so I
had to get some stuff for those spaces
and I really like beachy themed things
if you watched my other dorm room holes
you can kind of see that so I got this
metal print from society6 they have
these new style of prints and they're
literally on metal and I think they're
the coolest things ever so I got this
one that I'm thinking about putting in
my bathroom and it's just like this
really nice ocean scene I just thought
it was super pretty and like calming and
I just love it and like look how cool
this is it's like super reflective and
yeah I just love these they have like a
little back thingymajig so yeah I think
I'm gonna hang this in my bathroom maybe
my bedroom but no okay next home
society6 I got a shower curtain because
I have a shower I need that and it's
still like kind of folded up I'm not
gonna unfold it but I will post a photo
of what it looks like right here I'm
just packing all my stuff right now
because I move out in like a week so I
don't really want to unfold this but
once again it goes along with that kind
of beachy feel it just has some like
palm leaves and cool stuff on it if you
watch my other video with side e64 the
doorman stuff I got a beach towel that
was this super cool pomegranate print
and I love the print so much that I got
a F bone
case I just love this prison so much
it's just you know white with some break
pomegranates I think it's really fun and
unique and I love it
okay I don't know how I got so lucky but
the apartment building that I'm going to
be living in has four pools so I'm gonna
be laying by the pool and swimming all
the time so I got another beach towel
from society6 because like I said I love
the pomegranate one it's the best
quality beach towel I've ever owned and
they're so big I hate when you're laying
on a beach towel and either your head is
off or your feet are off no guys your
entire body is on the beach towels I got
this one with this print I've been
loving and once again it's going to be
kind of large and hard to show a so I'll
post a photo of it but it's like you
know that that world print or the world
is all like cool colorful like flowers
and stuff that's what it looks like on
the beach towel but it's like really
large okay the next thing I got is
actually a gift for my mom she loves
whales and I saw this print and I
thought it was so pretty and just so
cute it has all these like watercolor
whales on it and it's one of their
travel mugs
I love these from society6 these are
perfect for back-to-school because you
know if you're going to class and want
to bring your coffee or tea or hot
chocolate on a go this keeps it hot and
it's also just really cute and I love
these and my mom loves this one so yeah
these are great gifts obviously you can
get so many different prints on them and
I love this one okay I've been needing a
new kind of pencil case pencil pouch
because last year I just threw all of my
pens and pencils in like a pocket in my
backpack and they got lost and who knows
where so side Asics has these new like
carry-all pouches in different sizes and
I love this print so much it's this
really beautiful blue it almost looks
like Kyle I don't know I love it this is
the I think the medium size and it's
perfect for pens and pencils and like a
calculator because homegirls taking math
this year um but yeah I love this I
think it's so cute and it's gonna be
perfect just to throw on my backpack
okay guys if you didn't watch that first
dorm video you saw that I got a shirt
with a plug in a Flemming
go on it I love pugs so much and when I
saw that design I almost died because
it's so weird and I just related to it
on a spiritual level no but seriously I
really did love that print I think it's
so funny so I had to get it in the
large-sized carry-all bag because I
thought it would be perfect for a makeup
bag because this is like fairly large so
you could fit some pallets in here and
even brushes and stuff and it has my
favorite print on it yeah in case you
guys missed that first video it's
literally a pug which is looking like a
loaf of bread laying on top of a
flamingo so yeah it's probably the best
thing I've ever seen umm yeah okay and
last but not least this is not really a
college item but it almost is because
I'll probably wear it when I'm lounging
around doing homework and stuff cuz I
really I'm so odd okay society6 has
sweatshirts and I really like the look
of their zip up hoodies because they
looked really really comfy so yeah I got
a navy blue hoodie what do you guys
think I got on it I mean yeah I did that
I did it guys like I'm like kind of
embarrassed but I'm not because look at
this this just brings me so much joy you
guys have no idea yeah so I got the
hoodie in a men's small and it fits me
perfectly oversized how I wanted it and
it's so cozy it's not fleece lined which
I like because I probably overheat but
it's just like a terry kind of line and
I love this so much guys oh oh okay so
that's all the stuff from society6 once
again I'm going to link it all down
below and if you guys get anything from
society6 or if you get anything that I
got please tweet me a photo I love
seeing you guys as photos on Twitter it
makes me so happy so my Twitter is
fierce etosha by the way but yeah
totally tweet me your photos anyways I
just bought a brand new backpack today
so I figured I'd throw it in here
because it kind of goes with you know
the college haul so I got this backpack
from Lululemon because I
with lemon and this is my favorite color
this burgundy color I don't know if it's
like showing off right yeah and it was
just calling my name
so it is the all-day backpack it was a
bit of a splurge but this puppy holds 50
pounds and I don't know I just really
need a backpack because I'm going to be
walking in two of my classes from my
apartment and everything so yeah I
really love this they have it in black
as well but birding is my favorite color
ever and I just think it's so so cute
yes so that is everything that I have
for this haul video for back to college
once again if you have any questions for
me about you know what I've been doing
or going to college actually just any
questions for me totally leave them down
