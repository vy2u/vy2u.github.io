today as the start of my moving vlog
2017 for college and I didn't know if I
was going to do this basically I am
moving from my current apartment to a
house and I dunno if I was going to do
this because I actually have movers
physically moving my stuff just because
I am NOT I don't have a car like I
wouldn't be able to do it myself
but I still wanted to kind of film the
process of unpacking everything and
figuring out my new room because I
thought it would be fun so basically the
reason I'm moving is because my
roommates are moving out of my apartment
and I didn't want to stay here and get
random people again I mean it didn't
work out for me last year I love my
roommate but my son anne-marie actually
asked me if I wanted to live with her in
the house she's living in with two other
girls and I still have my own room and
bathroom and it was closer to campus and
cheaper so that's why I'm moving but
basically I'm so stressed because I have
so much stuff and the room is a lot
smaller yeah so I have movers coming I
know some people are going to like oh my
gosh like spoiled brat do-it-yourself
but I literally go to the car
I am a 100 pound five foot girl like I
can't carry a lot of so I'm still
going to sleep in my bed tonight so I'm
leaving that but this is the current
state of my room I have clothes
everywhere but I don't really feel bad
because I'm paying them to pass them
like I just did laundry and stuff I just
put the stuff that I don't want to lose
in here like bags passport whatever some
stuff that I took off my walls more
stuff my closet guys this is a disaster
because I had a hanging organizer here
that broke so yeah all the clothes and
here all the bags of stuff I'm trying to
sell disaster my bathroom is pretty much
cleaned and then we have all this stuff
on the table that I'm bringing with my
Keurig and food and then my roommates
are moving back home and they live in
New York and Chicago so basically they
didn't want to bring like all the pots
and pans and stuff so they just let me
keep everything so that's why I have
like all this but
yeah I'm like really sad to be moving I
really like living in this apartment
complex like honestly in case you guys
are wondering I lived in Lorenzo this
year if you guys are looking in the u.s.
see I really like it it's like super
nice it's beautiful but it is kind of
far from campus so yeah I just want to
try something new this year I am moving
and I guess the next time I update you
guys I'll probably be like moved into
the other house so I'm not going to film
the movers I'd probably like weird them
out but yeah okay guys well a million
hours later
sure I am this is going to be a disaster
honestly like I'll just show you because
me saying it is not going to do it
justice this is the problem
and then literally my bathroom doesn't
even come close to having enough storage
so I'm going to try and buy some stuff
for here order it online but basically
all I can do now is just kind of wait
yeah all I can really do now is wait
until tomorrow when the roof is
conferring out the movers the IKEA
people come on my furniture because from
now I just really don't have anyone to
put things my closet is full and I'm
just waiting for like furniture and
storage so I can actually start on
package boxes but yeah hi guys so it's
night time now if I look disheveled I
literally it's been a day it's been a
day it's like 11 p.m. now basically I'm
back at my my first apartment everything
moved out I just kept some sheets here
and I brought my pillow and blanket back
so I think I mentioned this earlier in
the video but I don't have like a bed
frame or mattress coming until hopefully
tomorrow I know I have like a dresser a
bed frame a mirror and a desk coming
tomorrow and a chair from Ikea because I
got those I'm getting those delivered
tomorrow but I'm not positive if my
mattress is going to come tomorrow so I
might be on the couch I don't really
know anyways that's why I'm sleeping
here tonight because I don't need to be
out of this apartment until tomorrow
morning so tomorrow morning I think I'm
just going to leave here check out and
whatnot and then go right over to my new
house I'm excited I'm like I'm not
regretting it but I have noticed that I
just have so much more room here and
everything is like a lot newer so I
don't know I'm not I'm not regretting it
yet I'm sure it'll be fine but it's just
like the whole thing I'm moving and
stressful and oh my gosh the movers
earlier okay so I'm know I'm going to
say this and some people will probably
be like oh my gosh Tasha you like
complain about getting complements and
guys like that's so annoying but like do
you know what it's like some movement
was being like kind of order in the
other like you guys I may have skied a
ton of English but toward the end of the
trip
um it's not that trip but like they
dropped off my they dropped off my stuff
at the new house whatever they did a
good job and then the guy was like
looking at me and he goes do you go to
the gym and I was like yeah like once a
once in a while when I can and he
totally goes you have a beautiful body
oh it's like okay I know like he it
probably didn't mean to come out like
creepy but like come on the wording you
have a beautiful body I mean like thank
you Thanks
it was like so uncomfortable and then he
like wanted me to take a picture for a
yelp review and then he's like let's
take one together so I literally have a
selfie with this man on my phone so as
you guys could see earlier I have way
too much stuff I was so lucky with the
apartment and right now that I had so
much room because it is supposed to be
for two people and I'm one person but
you know I'm just going to have to make
do
might need to get rid of some more stuff
might need to work on the whole storage
thing so I've just been on Amazon kind
of like trying to figure out what I want
to get but yeah I think that's the all
for the update I'm going to do now and
I'll see you guys tomorrow
hey guys so update today my IKEA
furniture was supposed to be delivered
from anywhere in between 10 a.m. and 2
p.m. that's when I scheduled it and it's
now 2 p.m. no furniture and I just got a
call from them and they said yeah it's
going to be in between 4:30 and 5:30 so
I look like trash I'm going to get ready
and try and film a video because
I've had to someone and this one I have
to film so that's I'm going to do I've
moved everything to this side of the
room because I wanted my bed over here
so yeah that's the situation currently
well guys someone's 11 p.m. and this is
a disaster basically the moving guys did
not show up until around 6:00 clearly I
wasn't happy I was just sitting around
all day and like I couldn't leave
because I didn't know when they were
going to come and then they come and I
guess I just felt my room was bigger
than it is because I have no room
basically right now everything is in my
bathroom the bed came I'm putting stuff
in the drawers I have the mirror and
desk over there and then like right on
top of my bed is this dresser I mean
everything opens everything works and
I'm also dumb and didn't get the flats
or the boxspring to go with my bed so I
can't even put a mattress on yet not
that I have one yet anyways it's a mess
but it's my own fault for having so much
stuff so I'm just trying to unpack all
the boxes that I do have here and trying
up the stress out too much I know how to
work out in the end
but I just have to get used to having
less space through yeah
hello guys so Bay three of my move-in
blog this is going to be like a week
long to be honest so basically I think
last time I updated G wives oh by the
way I'm not wearing makeup because I
could not be bothered today many ways I
think I updated you guys last night and
I was talking about the bed how I didn't
know I was supposed to buy / and then
how some people might be thinking Kasia
is so down like how did you not know you
needed those or like a box spring and
guys like I've never done this kind of
thing by myself my parents usually help
me move and then this year they aren't
so I just had no idea about a bed and
like every other dorm room I've lived in
has already had a bed so I just didn't
know but basically this is my bed
currently so I'm going back to I
keya which is not desirable because it's
like 30 minutes away and I have to over
to get with slaps on my bed so I could
put my mattress on which came today from
Lowell Lowell send me a mattress like
blossom I'll probably talk more about it
later but yeah Spectre go back to Ikea
not ideal hopefully the stuff fits in
uber because that's all I have and then
I need to figure out how to put that
together and put it on my bed so yeah
today is going to be interesting
my room is still a disaster but I think
I think it'll work out eventually guys
this is a massive box it doesn't look
very big so I'm very intrigued to see
how it fits
hi new roomie those houses here so
they're art Massey house this will be
clean someday but yeah thank you so much
to lull for sending me this mattress and
I can't really say thank you yet because
I haven't opened it but I think it's
going to be nice so yeah let's go okay
guys I hope I don't get copyrighted
music but I found a bunch of stuff what
I wanted and then we realized it
wouldn't fit in and were his car when I
was like I was like should I over and
try to shove all the stuff in the uber
and if that would work
so basically I'm biting the bullet and
I'm just going to get it paid to get
delivered and assembled again because I
am hopeless but it's just hard and I'm
really bad at assembling things and I
don't have like power tools and whatnot
so
today yeah exactly so wish me luck eyes
finally oh my gosh literally blessed
here's my low mattress and then also
today I got this little guy delivered I
was going to put it over there but I
can't lift it and it goes over the edge
a little bit here but I think it's fine
and then I also got this thing for more
storage but I'm just so happy that I
have a mattress now so yeah I'm going to
make my bed well guys I didn't think it
would ever happen but here we are I have
a bed and I think it looks so pretty and
it's so comfortable and clearly the rest
of my room is still on time but just
having a bed makes me feel so much
better about everything so I'm sure from
now it'll be smooth sailing and yeah I'm
just going to update you guys from now
on once I have like a major improvement
but I think this is pretty major so yay
hi so I don't even know what day of the
vlog this is at this point it is now
Thursday and the move started on Sunday
so basically my clothing rack just came
in the mail because I don't know if I
showed you but this closet is not do
into hot I have stuff that I need to
hang so hopefully that won't be as like
jam-packed but I ordered of this
clothing rack from The Container Store
and I'm hoping it's not that hard to put
together
because I am NOT the best of that but I
think I'm going to try to do that now
and then hang my stuff on it and like I
want to put a shoe on my shoes are
because I also got like a shoe rack
thing so I don't know we will see how
this all works out guys I was actually
the easiest thing ever that took me like
five minutes maximum so yeah now I'm
just going to start putting my clothes
on it hopefully it fits in my room hello
guys so I think that this is going to be
the end of my move-in vlog I'm not
completely done but I do have this
clothing rack up which I will show you
in a minute but you know I think I have
everything like manliness places I need
to get a few more things to organize my
bathroom with because my bathroom still
a disaster but I thought I'd show you
what I have done
now and then later on once my room is
done I will do a room-to-room for your
eyes but yeah let me show you okay so
this is a clothing rack I just put all
of my jackets and sweaters and then like
thermals on this rack and it works
really well I also put my favorite bag
on the end of it so this is definitely a
good call it does kind of make my room a
little more cramped but I was able to
fit my printer under there so that was
nice my closet I still need to put away
some clothes but I'm hoping everything
will fit and if not I'll just have to be
selling more on Poshmark
my desk I need to get that stuff off of
it but other than that it's doing pretty
well and then my bed I'm really happy
with and then I don't know if I showed
you guys but I put this tapestry up from
society6 it's in the side medium in case
you guys are wondering I have my
suitcase over there because I'm going to
sandwich the skillet a few days so I
need to pack but yeah but it's really
really comfortable I'm so happy to have
a full-sized bed even though it does
take up more space I really like it
and then I have these two little
organizers I've started putting stuff in
there and then I did have to move my
shoe thing over here for now I bought
something to go over the store but I
kind of have to install it so I haven't
done that yet but for now these are
going to have to work here and then I
have my laundry bin over there and then
the bathroom that's still disaster oh
and I hung my little sign up right there
so yeah I think that's the conclusion of
my moving flaws the a/c still have not
been fixed if you shoot at gurgling
anyway I hope you guys like this like I
said I am a junior at USC so that is the
situation here I hope this entertaining
and maybe you found it helpful and as
always thanks for watching and stay
tuned for more videos bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
