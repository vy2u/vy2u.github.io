I say no way try again so today is a
very exciting a day it's the day that I
start to moving to college and it's
actually like not as planned because I
was actually supposed to move in
tomorrow but we contacted the housing
department and they said we could move
in early since were from like east coast
and we already have all my stuff and
we're here just waiting so basically
what my family did is we rented a house
and this house is only like four minutes
drive from campus so it's really handy
we have a lot of stuff here we're gonna
like drive back and forth to bring this
stuff um but there's not going to be
that many people there moving in at
least I don't think because movements
not till tomorrow so I think just like
athletes and stuff moving in but yeah
and me so I wanted to vlogs experience
for you because I know a lot of people
requested that and like these types of
videos so I'm really excited um so I'm
rich are you like half of it today and
then the rest of it tomorrow an actual
move-in day but yeah I'm really excited
to bring you along with me I'm excited
to move in and yeah and in case you guys
don't know I am going to LMU Loyola
Marymount University in Los Angeles and
I'm from New York so I'm from the East
Coast so this is like a big move for me

pick up some things that we left here
and bring them back and it's really hot
but I'm really excited to move in I'm
excited to show you guys the process
Bojo we're just back in the car we've
got more suitcases of clothes in the
back I'll see if I can fit them all but
idea so I'm currently trying to hang up
my clothes and hopefully they fit I've
got some of the bed made this is as of
now there's some drawers here but yeah
this is what happens when you have too
many clothes yeah yeah ok so I look
disgusting because it's a million
degrees in here which sucks because
there's no air conditioning like my hair
is curling up here so um yeah I didn't
finish by any means but I've made some
progress so I decided I would show you
guys here's my bed so far I really want
to find a raspberry colored pillow but
I've been struggling with that this
still needs some organization but look
how cute this little elephant guy is I
love love what love umm cheer trashcan I
put my shoes in here and then my dad put
together this thing and then my closet
right now my suitcase is up there

still could put away my roommates bad
but yeah slowly but surely making
progress I thought I wrapped it you guys
hi guys so it's actually the next day
now and we actually mostly finished last
night but I didn't film there probably
because I forgot and probably because it
was dark in there so you couldn't really

to show you me finishing up in a few
minutes and also my roommate comes in
off them a little bit of that and
film like the primal product but I will

not going to get like super into depth
or anything but yeah today's like the
actual moving day I wore like a dress
