you guys are new to my channel and you
have no idea who I am my name is Tasha
and since this is a college video I'll
let you know I am a junior communication
major at the University of Southern
California so as you can tell by the
title this is going to be a college week
in my life this is going to be slightly
shortened because I actually leave for
Coachella on Thursday like Thursday
morning / afternoons this is gonna be
shortened but I have so much stuff going
on this week and that I know this video
we packed full if you guys want to keep
up with my life more I will put my
Instagram here on the screen and I post
there all the time just photos from my
daily life or my outfits and stuff and I
will put my other Instagram Instagram my
other social media handles down below in
the description so totally check there
if you guys want to follow me that would
be awesome
so I woke up and slightly got ready it's
really really hot today and I slept with
wet hair so my hair is in a bun
currently but it's supposed to be like
90 and sunny today which is aggressive I
have class soon but I just kind of woke
up earlier so I could pack up some
Poshmark orders I talked about Poshmark
all the time if you guys follow me and
you've held me for a while but you know
this Poshmark is the app that I sell my
clothes on so yeah so I'll put like a
little scrolling scrolling of my
Poshmark account on the screen it is at
Tasha for Sachi and yeah I love Poshmark
I buy stuff on there as well as sell
stuff on there there are so many so many
amazing brands they always go on there
to find things that are maybe a little
bit pricey that I want to try and get a
deal on or if something is sold out I
try and look on Poshmark
for it yeah so I'm pretty much always
adding things on Poshmark
all the time I think I have like over
600 listings that I've added in total on
Poshmark which is pretty amazing so I am
going to link Poshmark and my profile
down below in case you guys and want to
check it out Poshmark actually is
sponsoring this video which is so
amazing but this is probably one of the
most honest sponsorships I could ever do
because I literally have used Poshmark
forever oh and one more thing about
Poshmark if you guys use the code jb KWD
on your
order you can get $5 off and free
shipping okay so today is a very busy
day for me if you can tell my nails are
repulsive they were gel and they got to
the point where they were pretty long
and they started breaking and that's
when I was just like nope and I ripped
off all the nail polish normally I would
just kind of leave them leave them
stubby leave them be but Coachella is
Thursday and I want my nails to be
poppin so I think I'm gonna get fake
nails which isn't my favorite thing to
do
I like how they look but I know my nails
afterwards always end up getting pretty
janky but I think after my classes I am
going to get fake nails cuz this is just
like I know I think I'm going to attempt
to make a scramble slash omelet really
quick if class kind of soon but I have
to eat because I have like a long block
of classes so let's see how this turns
out yum yum yum yum kind of hey guys so
it's awhile later now basically I went
to my two classes and then I got my
nails done and then came back and got
ready normally I wouldn't blog more
during the day but I'm super rushed
today I'm about to go on a date actually
like what Tasha put some dates what so
yeah I'm like really rushed to trying
get ready a pump guys my nails oh my god
I figured if I was gonna go all-out with
this like holographic or like chrome
nail I might as well just do it on fake
nails for Cachola so yeah I got these
bye guys the saddest thing happened
today I'm actually really upset about it
basically I was leaving to go to class
like super rush and I step outside and
my bike is gone literally my bike got
stolen and it's like technically my
fault because I only had the wheel lock
to the fence but that's because the way
the fence is it's so hard to get your
bike close enough to the fence to lock
the frame and so I would like lock the
wheel to like and the piece of a wheel
like a thicker metal part and the wheel
to the fence and it's been fine always
and they literally cut my wheel to get
my bike off because my lock is still on
the fence so this is where my bike was
and
is all the remains and what okay so sad
now there's no bikes here because
everyone has gotten their bike stolen in
the past few months
yeah so I'm really really bummed about
my bike and trying to decide if I want
to get a new one or if I just want to go
without a bike again because I think
every single person I know at USD that
has had a bike has had it stolen at some
point I guess like the bike thieves
around here are really smart or like
know what they're doing or whatever but
in case you guys are wondering this is
what I'm wearing I literally threw this
on so so randomly like I said it's like
91 degrees out right now so it's very
hot but I'm just wearing this little
black romper and it's from steli by the
way and then these shoes from Steve
Madden so yeah I'm probably gonna bring
a jacket but it's just so all right now
and so sweaty hey guys so it's the next
day now I'm not doing so well I don't
know if this is weird to talk about on
my channel but I'm 21 so I feel like a
lot of you guys can relate it doesn't
matter if I have like one drink with
alcohol or two or five I'm always
extremely hungover like I could
literally like not even be drunk and I
will be so hungover and I can like
totally tolerate headaches or just being
tired or whatever but I get so nauseous
and I can not handle being nauseous
anyways I had a few drinks last night on
a Monday and I feel so sick and so
nauseous and I've been drinking
Pedialyte if you guys like you know what
this is
not sponsored but yeah I've literally
been drinking this but it tastes really
really bad so yeah I just put some
makeup on and I need to go to class soon
but I really don't okay so my outfit for
class is really not that cute like I
said I'm not feeling too great so I just
do on this maxi jumpsuit from Urban
Outfitters the back is really pretty and
like strappy and then I'm just wearing
some like espadrille slides it's super
comfy it's really really hot out again
today so I figured this would be good hi
guys so I just got back the class and
Ruiz here I'm saying a little better I
told me about my hangover is how bad
they are
yes I'm feeling better now I just one
cup some pasta from last night somebody
eat this and then I also have I bought
these that's kind of hot well I bought
these Trader Joe's frozen garlic fries
that I would like to try so I think I'm
gonna do those in a bit first of all I'm
eating some pickles because I literally
eat a jar of pickles like every two days
fun fact about me and I'm watching Ann
Marie like try and take a selfie for
snapchat she's been trying at this for
like 20 minutes so guys I normally do
unboxings on my channel stuff like on
the mail but I didn't get anything today
but Ann Marie did took longer it took so
long guys look at my nails though it's
still focused on you honey men's they
look really big did you get men's check
no I'm leaks that says men's and women's
size on like the tongue or at the side
anyone was a foot-fetish she'll be happy
but like I'm a six and a half and look
at this oh my god we turn to this that's
so weird maybe honestly maybe the
Ottomans and they're just like
mislabeled
one time I ordered a pair of shoes from
PacSun that were sold as women's and I
came in their men's size that's so weird
and those are from PacSun right yeah
they
guys so Emily and I were about to start
studying and I was like you know what I
really just want like a coke and you
should and then I was like I couldn't
breathe it and then I saw that
McDonald's has turtle iced coffees what
what I don't it's like chocolate and
caramel caramel whatever you want to say
sounds like well so then and Marie
suggested that we just go to McDonald's
so I got a burger too so basically my
coachella diet is just not gonna work
out but here we are guys I just ate all
my pickles why am I like this I eat so
many people I'm just trying to do my
stats homework but I'm honestly like so
exhausted I'm like trying to decide if I
want to just go to bed now and then I'll
feel rested and be able to finish
everything tomorrow or if I want to like
push through good morning everyone happy
Wednesday I am much more alive today I'm
actually feeling really really good so
that is good because I have so much to
do today I'm just gonna like lay it out
for you so I'm about to get lunch it off
of fee its flatbread pizzas today one of
my favorites and then I'm going to class
and then after class I need to rush back
here and change and I have this like
super informal interview in Venice
California which is probably like 30 35
minutes for me so I have to change go to
that and then I have like a five hour
gap and then at 7:00
so I interview step 3 and then at 7:15
we're having a surprise birthday party
for my friend and big Brooke and it's
also in Venice so I decided for those
like five hours in between my interview
and her dinner I'm gonna find a coffee
shop in Venice and trying to write my 7
page paper let's do the Monday after her
Coachella so I would we have so much
stuff jammed in I just like looked down
at my hand and something occurred and I
realized like this is pretty common so
some of you guys might encountered it so
I'm not trying to flip you guys off but
I have I got like this eczema on my hand
and I never have had eczema before so I
was like really shook a--the when I
looked at my hand I didn't know what it
was but then I like googled it and it's
definitely eczema but it like Reese
crowded and it looks pretty bad so I'm
gonna show you guys and let me know if
this has happened to you or if you guys
know like what to use on it okay so like
I don't know if you can tell but this is
my finger and like you can see like
those blistery bumps on the side of it I
love how it just doesn't focus it's
really yeah I know it's like kind of
hard to see but yeah it's not a huge
deal and it's like not really bothering
me I think it's just kind of like weird
also okay this is also super weird and
random but as well as I'm talking about
that I might have got thrown a thing so
for the past like over a month I've been
getting these like itchy bumps on my
body but they're not like a rash they
literally look like a bug bite but it's
just like they go away after like three
days they like kind of scab over and
then they pop up in other places like
I've had these all over my body
currently I have them in my neck my neck
is itchy I have one of my butt cheek
that's great
I've had them on my stomach on my back
on my legs on my hand on my wrists on my
arms and it's like the same thing
they'll only be like one or two in its
place and then they'll go away after a
few days and I'll be like okay like I'm
chilling I went to the doctors actually
like over a month ago about this and
they just told me to take this allergy
medicine but that didn't help at all so
I don't know what it is I'm currently
getting my bed thing dryclean cuz I
don't know if that's the case I've
washed on my sheets and I've like looked
for bed bugs and stuff and there's like
nothing to be found so I just don't know
what's going on and it's like not so
itchy to the point where I like can't
handle it it's just like kind of itchy
so it's easy for me to ignore but I just
think it's weird that it's been like
it's honestly been like 2 months and it
just like it's still going on so if you
guys have any idea of what I should do
like I've been taking oh I really have
over here I like put like anti-itch P
mom mom
I've tried benadryl I've tried
fexofenadine I think that's what the
doctor had me take and just like nothing
works so if you guys have any idea what
that could be like please let me know
yeah so I'm like kind of ready this is
not what I'm gonna wear to the interview
but I just wanted to wear this for class
honestly I have not been obsessed my
outfits lately but I'll show you guys
anyway I'm just wearing this little
polka dot dress from princess Polly and
then just some like tan lace-up sandals
also from princess Polly
hello so I just got back from class
luckily I got laid out like an hour
early now I have time to breathe before
I like come back and then go to the
interview it's not even really an
interview it's more of like they just
wanted me to come into the office don't
even know if I said read for replied for
this summer internship so I kind of just
like have talked to him on the phone
already and then they asked me to come
in and just like kind of meet them or
whatever so it's like kind of an
interview but it's really not gonna be
formal at all they're like the type of
super chill company I'm not gonna say
what it is now unless I like get and or
accept the internship I'll tell you guys
then okay guys I'm about to leave I just
put on this striped jumpsuit it's like a
striped culotte jumpsuit with my black
espadrilles and I also brought a black
denim jacket to wear over it later on
when I'm at dinner whatnot but like I
said I know this is not appropriate for
like I know I'm interview four but for
the circumstance I mean I know this is
fine my um but yeah by all means if
you're going to like a serious more like
traditional interview wouldn't wear this
but um yeah
so I eventually stopped doing work I got
most of my paper done I have like one
page left and I'm just by Abbot Kinney
right now this is where the restaurant
is so I just kind of came to walk around
a little bit before but it's like so
cold it's actually got super cold and
windy but yeah because I go to my
favorite streets in LA so if you guys
come you should totally go it's super
trendy but yeah I'm just walking around
a bit until it's time to meet everyone
at dinner all right so I honestly didn't
know if I was gonna film right now
because well a I'm a fresh out of the
shower and I look like a hamster also
like I don't know if I've ever been this
stressed out ever and like I know like
no one wants to hear this because like
no one wants to hear people complaining
like that's the worst thing ever but I
just feel so overwhelmed all of a sudden
I just got home from the dinner and like
I really want to go to that I know I
didn't have to but like I really wanted
to be there to surprise my friend Brooke
I've been like working on finishing up
my paper but I'm just like I feel so
extremely anxious and like just so
overwhelmed my whole body started
itching honestly the itching is probably
from stress probably these bumps on my
fingers I like picked them all like
they're all like oozing now I just don't
even know what I'm doing but
nevertheless this is a real life college
student i procrastinate sometimes and I
get myself into like circumstances that
wouldn't happen if I was a little bit
more productive sometimes but yeah
overall I am really happy with how
things are going for me lately and how
life is going but just know that I
literally get so stressed as well like
I'm just like you guys and I know how
you feel and like this time of year is
insane there's so much going on I think
I'm gonna stop blogging for today and
then I will obviously update you guys
tomorrow hopefully I'm not such like a
ball of stress but yeah hi guys so it's
currently Thursday morning I feel so
much better now I ended up back
finishing and submitting my paper last
night because I knew I just wouldn't
want to have to like add finishing
touches and submit during Coachella or
like in the car ride or anything I just
not focus on my face ever there we go so
yeah I did all of that I woke up and I
just finished packing pretty much for
the weekend I hate packing so much so
I'm really glad that I got that out of
the way I guess I can kind of show you
my suitcase but it's like pretty packed
solid right now this is what it looks
like I just have like a ton of
toiletries I have my shoes makeup
bathing suits and then I have like all
the outfits and stuff under there yeah
so I'm really really excited for this
weekend I can't wait to actually relax
and have fun because I've been so
stressed out this entire week but I
think I'm gonna end the vlog here I'll
probably be vlogging Coachella I'm not
totally sure why I might just not
focusing like I said I'll probably be
vlogging Coachella I'm not sure because
I know that everyone there's gonna be
vlogging so I feel like my vlog would
just be the same as their vlogs but we
will see but if not thank you guys so so
much for watching I hope you enjoyed
this video
I feel bad if I didn't have a lot of
like actual campus footage once again be
sure to download Poshmark
