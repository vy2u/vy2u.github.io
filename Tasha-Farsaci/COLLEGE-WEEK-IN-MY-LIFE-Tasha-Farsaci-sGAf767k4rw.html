this week I am filming another college
week in my life video so it is Monday
this is the start of the video basically
I already had my workout class if you
guys watched my college week in my life
the previous woman I did you would know
that I have a workout class every Monday
Wednesday morning if you guys haven't
seen that video I will link it down
below
in case you guys like these types of
videos but yeah basically I had my
workout class and I didn't really sweat
that much because it was outside and
it's like a little bit chillier out
today so I didn't really want to wash my
hair and it's kind of greasy so I'm
wearing this little hat and guys I
literally used to hate these hats so
much and honestly I still don't know
really how I feel but I think they look
cute and I know some people hate them if
you hate them I'm sorry but I needed to
cover up my hair and this is like trendy
so yeah I put on this little hat and I
put some makeup on but now I'm about to
go to Alba fee and get some lunch I
think today it's like a sandwich and
panini bar and then some like soups so
I'm really excited about that and yeah
I'll show you guys my offer really quick
because you guys said you want more
outfit of the weeks and I can kind of
like throw them in this video
I feel like I'm always apologizing for
my messy room so I'm sorry but yeah I'm
wearing this hat it's gonna be my Black
Friday haul if I ever end up filling it
it's from Express and then I'm just
wearing this like oversized sweater II
thing I honestly don't even know what
this is from some random online website
and then these jeans from Topshop and
then these little mules from Nasty Gal
so yeah this is the outfit for today
I just got a hazelnut latte from the
coffee bean this is so good if you guys
haven't tried it you totally should have
but I'm about to go to class and he'll
update you guys after hi guys so I just
got back from class and I got a package
from Amazon not sponsored I really don't
think that it's anything super exciting
I think it's a bike basket because I'm
gonna be getting a bike but in case it's
not and it's something else more
exciting I'm gonna unbox it for you guys
the only other thing it could be would
be these two hats I ordered for an
invite I'm going to I'll tell you guys
more about that later in the week but
from the feel of it I'm almost positive
it's the bike basket yeah I'm really
excited because I got this like cute
wicker one and it's not very sturdy but
I'll link it down below in case you guys
want it I don't know I wanted a wicker
one because the better the bike guys I'm
gonna get okay guys so basically they
just opened this new pasta restaurant on
campus in the new University Village and
I'm so excited pasta is my favorite
thing ever I love it and yeah so I'm
gonna go there with my friend Leia soon
and I'm really excited because I look at
the menu already I always do that do you
guys ever look at the menu before you go
somewhere or do you not that's just me
anyways I look at the menu and they have
a tortellini Alfredo which is like my
dream I mean it's like a thousand
calories and I'm so ready to indulge
also I just randomly got this like weird
does that thing on my forehead so I
ignore that it's like red I don't know
where that came from
but yeah I think she's in like a meeting
right now so I'm waiting for her to get
out and then we're gonna go there and
I'll be sure to blog it cuz everything
in the village is so aesthetically
pleasing
so pretty on the inside so yes I'm so
excited this is the place just waiting
for Leia hi guys guys we just went to
the pasta place we are in line and then
the man says they're closed because they
ran out of product so now we're walking
to blaze pizza you know not a bad option
but it's just not what my flirt with
sanam on ya know Tasha's been waiting
for this I don't think you guys
understand like the gravity Tasha been
waiting for this pasta place for the
entire year entire year and I once gave
her the fake news that it opened and she
was like so excited and then it wasn't
we walked there already
sorry guys there was just a lot of
people coming at us and I felt really it
can't be really fast
Tasha loves vlogging like for everyone
to see she thinks she's like very yeah
I'm really living it up right now
yeah anyways I was really excited for
that place and it's closed so typical
hey guys so I am back home in my room
now I'm literally so upset about that
pasta place like Leia was saying I've
been looking at this place every day
I've been so excited for it to open I
have been stalking the menu because
everything that's in the village right
now is pretty healthy and to be
perfectly honest I do not like healthy
food very much I do not eat very
healthily I like pasta I like chicken
tenders I like Chinese food like I
really am NOT one to eat healthy food
very often so all of the restaurants in
there are kind of pricey and like very
salad II based and like vegan and
vegetarian which is good it's fine
but that's like everything that's open
right now so I was really excited for a
pasta place and we get there and the man
at the front says they're all out and I
thought he was joking because he was
kind of smiling a little bit but he
wasn't and so maybe some other time this
week I will go and actually be able to
eat there but basically for the rest of
the night I think I'm gonna work on some
stuff for my dota internship and then
some schoolwork but before I did that I
wanted to show you guys so basically I
am doing vlogmas with do't if you guys
don't know what dough is basically if
I've worked with them on YouTube and I
also interned for them over the summer
there's a shopping app and they
basically have so many stores that you
guys probably love because I love them
they have revolving Outfitters Topshop
ASOS Free People literally so many
stores all on their app and you can shop
them all at once it's super great it's
handy it's all on your phone it's super
easy to check out and buy everything
it's kind of dangerous if you guys do
want to use it my codes Tasha you can
get five dollars off and free shipping
on your first order I believe this is
not sponsored I seriously just love them
and it goes with what I'm about to say
but anyways yeah I'll put the link to
dope down below if you guys haven't
downloaded it yet I'm literally giving
you like a free five dollar gift card to
one of your favorite websites or stores
it's great you'll get addicted but
anyways so they're doing this thing this
year with influencers who are doing
vlogmas and basically they send me
package with a little wrapped gift to
open every day of vlogmas so it's kind
of gonna be like an advent calendar with
gifts oh this giant box came to my house
here and I want to show you guys guys
just look how ridiculously cute this is
they've wrapped all the presents with
wrapping paper and they numbered them
for every day of vlogmas they have these
little letters there's a bathing suit in
here because I guess they just kind of
threw that in there for me they know me
I love my bathing suits but yeah this
has been sitting in my room and I've
been so tempted to open them because who
wouldn't want to like the child at heart
just wants to rip these open but I'm so
excited for vlogmas this year but yeah I
know there's a bunch of youtubers doing
it everyone at doe is so cute and I know
that took them so much time to put it
all together and organize it because I
am still interning for them so I kind of
know more of what goes on behind the
scenes but yeah I'm so excited for that
so yeah I just kinda want to tell you
guys about that because this package
came yesterday and I would keep staring
at it I'm so tempted to peek but I won't
I promise I won't but yeah I think I'm
just gonna do some work now and I will
update you guys tomorrow hey guys happy
Tuesday so I basically got up and got
ready I like did my hair today I feel so
much more put together when I do my hair
there and when I just leave it like
messy or natural so I'm gonna try to
maybe start doing it a little bit more
just for like normal days but anyways I
got ready because there is an event on
campus today and my friend Leia who was
in my vlog last night actually helped
organize it she's a HBO an HBO
ambassador for USC and so there's an HBO
event on campus and all I know is that
there's puppies and there's gonna be
free ice cream I think a lot of it has
to do with Game of Thrones which I don't
watch so I only know a lot about that
but Ann Marie and I are going to go so
I'm just waiting for her to finish like
a group project thing she's doing but
before that I think I'm gonna go to
sonlife it's this super overpriced
smoothie place in University Village but
I really want a smoothie for some reason
I'm like never really in the mood for
smoothies but when I am I really
so I think I'm gonna go there but before
I do that I will show you guys my outfit
okay so on top I'm wearing this flannel
from Express it's pretty new this was in
my most previous haul video but it's
really lightweight I love the color of
it it matches my nails I never try to do
this on purpose that always happens and
then I'm actually wearing the same pants
is yesterday I swear I'm not gross it's
just these are a little bit tight on me
and I kind of want to stretch them out
so I'm trying to wear them again and
then I'm wearing these shoes from Steve
Madden but yeah I really comfy but just
cute casual outfit okay guys so I'm back
I got my smoothie for some reason I
thought it was gonna be like $8 I fully
got this before and it was over $10 like
that's honestly ridiculous there should
be like cracking this if it's gonna be
over $10 I don't even remember what's in
it I'll put it on the screen if I can
find like a screenshot in their menu
it's really good but it's really
overpriced and people here literally go
there like every day and they don't
understand okay guys well we're here I
look to scope out the puppies but there
weren't any pugs and they're not really
Poppy's they're more like old dogs which
is like you know it's fine but not what
I was expecting
so yeah I just texted my friend and was
gonna ask her where should we should go
but yeah guys the line is so long
Andrea's thought soon so and I don't
have fancy but I didn't get one for me
because I didn't know she was gonna want
to come so I like like actually pretty
much pretty well alright so sorry bye uh
sorry hey guys so I'm currently in the
bathroom I just got out of my
earthquakes class it was painfully
boring do you guys ever think about how
much stuff you would get done in the
amount of time that you went to an
extremely boring class because that's me
but yeah now I have two more classes
that I have to go to I don't want to go
but you know here we are so idea I
mentioned earlier in the vlog that I was
waiting for these hats to come from
Amazon because I'm going to this
fraternity invite where the girl buys
two wigs or hats and then you drop one
off at the frat house and then you guys
show up separately it's a mystery date
thing I'll explain more I guess later in
the week what I'm actually going but
anyways I ordered these hats for this
thing and I had to drop it off at the
frat house by today and I ordered them
Amazon Prime so they were guaranteed
delivery today and I wasn't I wasn't
home I like went to alpha P to get some
food and I got a phone call from this
like random Seattle number like three
times and I didn't answer because my
phone number was recently leaked which
was like really annoying so I just like
haven't been answering phone calls
unless like I knew who they were from
obviously so I didn't answer and then I
googled the number and apparently it was
like Amazon or something so then I
checked my order online and it says that
what did it say it says delivery
attempted and okay these hats were not
that expensive it was like $30 total and
delivery attempted they didn't want to
leave it on my doorstep like I were
stuff from Amazon Prime all the time and
it's never been an issue so I like
didn't even think of this being a
problem and I literally needed these by
tonight to drop off like that it was
really specific that I needed to drop
mine off by tonight
so I
and online chat with Amazon and then
they were like oh yeah we should be able
to deliver it tonight but they weren't
being like for sure they're like oh but
call this number to make sure so I
called the number and the guy was like
yeah we can probably deliver it tonight
but like no guarantees I'm like okay
what the heck so now I don't want to do
I'm really hoping they deliver it
because I don't feel like you know
making a big deal of it and like trying
to drop it off late and I don't know so
we'll see if my hat gets delivered
tonight are the two hats they better
because I'm gonna be really angry if
they're not so yeah guys this is
slightly random but these ice cream
cookie sandwiches from Trader Joe's are
so good
I've been eating one like every single
night so I would recommend hey guys
happy Wednesday
I think it's Wednesday yeah so basically
it's the next morning I just had my
workout class but it wasn't really like
a sweaty class because we had like a
little world quiz or whatever so I
didn't have to shower thank God anyways
so I still have not received my package
from Amazon they severed be delivered
last night so that's not good because I
was literally supposed to deliver that
hat to the opportunity yesterday by
yesterday and now I still don't have it
and it's like mid-afternoon so I am
stressing slightly and also I had a
package from FedEx that was supposed to
be delivered today and it said signature
required but I'm literally like not at
my house for the majority of the day so
I called them to see if I could get like
the signature requirement waived and
they were like no so now I'm probably
not gonna get that package and it's
actually literally this sweater in a
different color because this is my
favorite sweater ever it's by a Joyrich
which is some like streetwear brand I
swear I'm not cool I just really like
this sweater and I got this like a year
ago and it was really pricey but it's
like my favorite sweater ever I'm
obsessed with it and the quality is
amazing and so I ordered another one
from their Cyber Monday sale and
apparently I can't get it unless I sign
for it so who knows how long that's
gonna take but anyways I'm just stressed
out with packaging and stuff right
I'm about to pack up some posh Mike
orders and then get lunch at Alfie today
is my favorite lunch that they make it's
flatbread pizzas and then they also have
pasta salad which is so good I love
pasta salads so much so yeah I'm doing
that and then I have class okay yeah so
here's the sweater it's actually like
unisex so it's like kind of baggy but I
love it like that and then just these
cropped jeans from Topshop and then the
same black shoes I've been wearing
except in like this pink color so I
think they're so cute and I'm comfy and
cozy okay guys so it's awhile later now
I finished all my classes it's about
like 5 p.m. or so and my Amazon box
finally came it's gonna be so late when
I drop it off but whatever my FedEx box
they came when I wasn't here and
surprise surprise so I didn't get that
but I wanted to open this box on camera
because I think it's gonna be really
funny and I really hope that both of
them are in here because if not I'll
probably cry but I think these are gonna
be really funny so yeah I'm doing a live
unboxing here
okay good they're both in here goods
like this I'm gonna open one and I think
I'm gonna drop the other one off at the
house still in the packaging so excited
for what this looks like
sorry I'm going really slow at opening
packages guys oh my god
can you see what this is it's a
champagne bottle hat and you guys are
probably thinking Tasha you're not 21
and my answer to that is you're right
and I have never ever drank champagne in
my life guys this is ridiculous and it's
amazing and I really hope my date
appreciates it
hi guys so I think I left flogged when I
was wearing my champagne bottle hat but
anyways yeah um I guess I'll tell you a
little bit about the invite right now I
guess I'm gonna set you want my my
handy-dandy hold the camera also my nose
is red again why does it do this it
bothers me so much but it's only a night
when I'm like sitting in my room and so
on
so anyways basically the invite is the
guys break down a list of a few girls or
one girl or no girls they write random
of people that they would want to be
their date to the invite and they're
like phone numbers and then the social
chairs of the fraternity basically match
them up with either a random girl or one
of the girls that they listed and they
text the girl and say okay you're going
to wig makai which is Sigma Chi it's
like a wig Mekhi because the girl has to
buy two wigs or like hats I bought hats
and
case and they're either matching or they
go with like a costume idea and you drop
one off at the fraternity would like
your name on it and then they give it to
the guy and then you're wearing the
matching one and then the girls and the
guys show up separately at the venue and
then you find your date based on who's
wearing the matching hat or whatever so
yeah I'm like pretty nervous I think I
know what my date is but I've like never
met him before so it's still like a
random set up kind of so yeah I'm
excited though like I really love going
to these kinds of things it's super fun
and I like the way the invites more than
like frat parties because they're a lot
more chill and less like dirty and rowdy
and like gross
so yeah that's like what the whole hat
situation was so anyways I drop that off
and now I'm just kind of making a
presentation I have a short presentation
and my Earthquakes class tomorrow
so I'm kind of doing that now and I'm
also starting to edit this vlog because
I'm so dumb right now it's the 29th of
November and I swore the 30th of
November it was Sunday but it's tomorrow
which is every day so I thought vlog
nights was starting in a long time but
it's literally starting Friday so I'm
just like all shook right now so anyways
I'm trying to get this finished so I can
post this hopefully before vlogmas so
yeah I'm gonna do that yeah so I think
tomorrow is going to be the last day
that I blog for this week because I
don't have class Friday and then I'm
gonna be starting vlogging this Friday
so we've been blogging every day now
that's gonna be crazy but yeah all right
I'm gonna do some work now hey guys
happy Thursday so I just woke up and got
ready I did these little braids in my
hair that are inspired by Amanda Stanton
everyone tells me that I look like her
so I thought it would be funny if I did
her hairstyle and I just tagged her in
my insta story and she dumped me back so
I was happy about that but yeah comment
down below if you think I look like
Amanda cuz I see it but I don't know let
me know anyways yeah I just did my hair

to lunch and then go to class the whole
spiel and then after class today

other roommates I'm going or trying to
go to that pasta place again because you
know I really want to go there still so
yeah we will see if that works out okay
so I'm wearing this floral
off-the-shoulder like half smock top I
got this literally like a year ago I
know I got it for Black Friday last year
at a store called altered state I
believe it's only in the south I was in
Texas when I got it but don't quote me
on that it's just really really cute and
pretty comfy and then I'm wearing you
know my classic jeans these are a
different pair these are the ones that
aren't tight on me
so yeah I'm wearing these from Topshop
and then these little platform
espadrille sandals from I think she in

from these people at USC who started
fade websites selling like USC apparel a
lot of this like gameday stuff but the
thing that I got is just kind of like
you can wear it whenever and they
offered to send it to me to post on
Instagram about but yeah I just give me
