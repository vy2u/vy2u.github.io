I was recently in California if you
follow me on Instagram or Twitter you
might know and it wasn't just some
random vacation I was actually looking
at colleges because I'm a junior in high
school and this is kind of one college
because it's start but it was amazing I
love California so much I really hope
that I can't go to school there but
naturally being me as I was there for
nine days I went shopping I don't really
have an excuse for any of these things
that I bought
I'm just a Shopaholic I'm going to have
to clean out my closet very soon by this
stuff is going to hold me through spring
in summer I hope so
yes I'm gonna show you the first thing
I'm going to start off with was my
splurge purchase I guess I've been
wanting Ravens for the longest time and
I never really wore sunglasses a ton
because I live in New York and it's not
very sunny here but I got my license
like in March or something and I always
need sunglasses when I Drive so I got
some Raider vans and I'm excited so they
came in a little case I got the for
Nordstrom and I love Nordstrom so much
I'm so mad that we don't have one here
in New York but they are just the plain
aviators and I got matte gold with brown
lenses and I'll put the bond for you I
guess I hope they look good because they
weren't cheap so let me know if you like
them
Oh me I guess yeah that's that MA
okay so I'm gonna kind of jump around in
this because I didn't get a lot of stuff
from like one store so I'm gonna start
off with this bathing suit that I got
it's two separate pieces but I really
don't have very many bathing suits that
I like so I first got this plain black
bandeau top from H&amp;amp;M and I needed a
plain black bandeau top I love the style
house I put it in the front and it's
just a tie back it's really small I have
literally like no boobs so this is nice
and this was only like 12
dollars which is really great because
bathing suits are ridiculously priced I
didn't plan on ganging up bottom with
that but I was in forever 21 and I saw
this bottom and it's really cute and as
you're gonna see by this haul I'm
obsessed with some flowers and daisies
lately so it's this little bottom and it
just has a rough on the top with some
sunflowers I believe and they look like
this and I think it's really cute and
with the black top it's just a good
match and these were only like 12
dollars as well so good price for
bathing's okay moving on to the next
fading suit I got this was the most
amazing deal of my entire trip I was in
La Jolla which is near San Diego and
there was a Roxy store and you could get
a full bathing suit a dress and
flip-flops for $99 and if you know Roxy
it's expensive so this was an amazing
amazing deal the bathing suit alone was
$80 so yes anyways the top looks like
this it's kind of one of those like
Copts style tops and it's really pretty
I don't exactly have the boobs to fill
it like just barely you know but it's so
cute it has like this kind of tropical
like neon design thing the straps come
off as well if I want to take them off
and then the bottoms look like this and
I love this bathing suit so much and I
can also wear these bottoms with this
top so yes the dress I got with this
deal was alone $70 so as you're seeing
this deal was amazing but it looks like
this I'm also obsessed with tie-dye and
maxi dresses so it looks like this on
top it's a maxi dress and it's hot pink
with some like peach and blue tie-dye on
the front and then it goes all the way
down like that and then the back is on
the back is like crust and then it's
also the tide I don't think that I got
with this deal with these white
flip-flops and my white sandals are like
grimy and disgusting now so I figured I
should get a new pair and they just
stuff like this they have braided white
straps and they're really cute okay
moving on to the Daisy theme I went to a
store called pink zone and I got this
shirt and it was only like five dollars
so it's kind of why I got it but it's a
cropped Daisy red tank top thing yeah it
looks like this and that's cute I went
to a store called cotton on you may or
may not have heard of it I've been to a
few of them but they don't have any of
your means and I just got these kind of
high-waisted like acid-wash like shorts
and I do have a good amount of shorts
but these ones to be perfectly and it's
really hard to feed if I the choice that
fit because I'm like I don't know weird
think really small and Schwartz never
fit right on me some and these ones
they're really nice and I like them I
like how they're ripped and they look
really cute with this Daisy
cop cop so I really like these I went to
a store called angle or angel it's angl
and I really really liked it so first
thing I got from there was this tie-dyed
tank top yes it looks like this it's
like black and tokey ish and it's really
soft it feels kind of like brandy
melville and yeah I just thought this
was really cute and then also from angle
I got this crocheted long-sleeve shirt
this is just like me to a tee it's so so
pretty and it's long-sleeve the sleeves
kind of fell out at the end also with
that crocheted detailing and
so so pretty and it looks good with the
tan and I love this I went to a store
called Tris and this was in a ball near
me and it is like me in a store and this
is how it's spelled and there's also a
little on where they're located down
here if you want to check it out but I
got this 10 tub and it's like a great
red coral color which I want and has
some blue kind of floral on the front
it's kind of wrinkly I apologize but it
flows out at the bottom and then the
back is like crossed and tied as you can
see there and this store reminded me so
much of free people they had some free
people in there but most of it was just
like their own brand so I love this
shirt I also went shopping on Melrose
and I loved it so first thing I got were
these shorts I am obsessed with these
types of shorts now ever since I got
these ones and they're my go-to shorts
now for summer because they're so
comfortable and they're so cute they
look like this they're daisy print of
course they have some little castle pump
up thingies on the ends and they're so
so cute these with a shirt that I have
to show you still are just so so cute so
yeah I'm really excited about these and
they feel like pajamas and they're so
comfy yeah this is the top that goes
amazing with those shorts it's from
brandy melville it's like the only thing
about from brandy melville so whoo go me
but it's just this plain white tank
because I've been needing a plain white
tank for like 10 years now and I just
never feel like buying it so I got this
one and with these shorts it's like a
dream so I love this there was one more
shop on Melrose that I literally fell in
love with like I can't express to you
how amazing it is first thing I got were
another pair of those shorts and they
look like this they are amazing they're
plural and then they also have those
little pom-poms and I just can't get
over how cute they are like I love them
so much so
just let that let that sink in how cute
they are but yes also with this white
tank it would be a very cute and I'm
obsessed lastly from that story I got a
romper which is weird because I normally
really don't like robbers but I'm
starting to like them a lot and I
thought there was a lot of them in
stores so I'm thinking maybe they're
gonna be like a trend or something but I
got this one and it's just kind of like
a Paisley four leaf print like my
favorite prints you know and it's a tank
top round bird has like this lying down
the front I don't really know but then
it just goes into shorts and it almost
looks like a dress the way it is and
they were super comfortable because you
off to worry about your dress flying up
because it's not a dress and yeah so
here's a better look at it yes I believe
that store was called just the shop on
Melrose or something I'm not totally
sure but that's what I think it was so I
love that store and I need to like
deliver or something but when to
Francesco's and I got a pair of earrings
my friend and then I'm not gonna show in
case she watches this and I also got
this white tank top it's really pretty
it's a chiffon kind of sheer white tank
like halter I guess and then the sides
have like tribal stitching with like
some shiny beads and stuff so I thought
this was really pretty and it'll also
look over the tan SM oh yes things I got
were actually College apparel because
you guys might know I'm obsessed with
college up a role even though I like
dressing humilis at the time I still
love college clothes so from my dream
school by number one choice at the
moment USC I just got a v-neck that says
u.s. the Trojans on it and I enjoy it I
was gonna get a sweatshirt but they
didn't have any of that I liked that for
me so yes I got this
and then from UCLA I know I got the two
rival schools but I got a sweatshirt and
I suppose just in the wash so it's still
kind of wet but it's just a baby blue
spot sure it says UCLA and light blue
and yellow on it and I really like it
it's so
cozy and comfy and I'm going to wear
this all the time so those are the
clothing items that I got from
California I had so much fun I love it
there any of you guys love them so
jealous of you but hopefully I will be
yet hopefully I will be back in about a
year and having school there so yes we
