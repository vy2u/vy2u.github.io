and yes if you see something right here
it is my chair but I really I didn't
have anywhere to film this intro anyways
as you guys can tell from the title
today's video is going to be a get ready
with me for when I go out in college
this is the final product yeah this is
what I wear most of the time when I'm
going out and I always get questions
from you guys about my makeup or like
outfits I like to wear when I'm going
out so I figured I would put them all in
this video super quick before I get into
the video if you guys are not following
me on Instagram and you want to it's a
great place to keep up with my more
personal life and you could just see
these going out outfits even more so a
shameless plug if you guys want to
follow me it will be on the screen here
as well as in the description okay
without further ado I'm going to stop
blabbing and get right on into the video
hey guys so here I am with no makeup on
it's actually only like 4 p.m. right now
and normally I don't get ready to go out
until around 7 p.m. but I wanted to film
this when I actually had some natural
light I don't have a ring light yet so
if I were to film this at 7 p.m. it
would be horrendous lighting and you
guys wouldn't even be able to see what
I'm doing so I'm just going to get ready
earlier on in the night and kind of hope
that it stays until when I actually go
out but I will probably do like a few
touch-ups
then so yeah I am barefaced right now
and I'm just gonna start with my makeup
opinion I mean it's pretty simple it's
really nothing crazy but you guys always
ask me how I do my makeup for going out
so I don't wear foundation I normally
actually don't use primer ooh but I
think I am just because I'm doing my
makeup so early this is the hourglass
primer mineral veil primer I really
don't know I just got this or I didn't
get it I feel like I got it at like
beautycon or something like that so I'm
just kind of like trying it out but yeah
I'm gonna put this all over my face and
my mirror is right here so if I'm
looking over here I'm sorry it's kind of
hard for me to get like situated in my
room but yeah I've found that I really
need to blend this in because it's like
white and it really
like shows pretty white so I just make
sure that I get this like all the way
blended in okay so once that is all over
my face
I don't wear foundation I personally
just I don't think I need it and I've
just never really wanted so I only wear
concealer this is the Maybelline instant
age rewind concealer this is what I've
always used this shade is a little bit
light for me but I'm just gonna really
try and make it work so basically I just
put this under my eyes like so I'll put
it in between my eyebrows right here a
little bit on the tip of my nose and
then on my chin as well as my eyelids so
I guess like I'm kind of putting it all
over my face but not really just like
the main areas and then I will take some
sort of a Beauty Blender this one is
like a ver coffee blender I don't know
what brand this is I need to dampen this
but I will take this and then blend it
out okay so after I put the concealer on
I move straight into powder this is the
Rimmel stay matte pressed powder this
one is it almost gone I have two and
they're both like at this same state
right now I'm kind of like crumbling
everywhere but this is super super
affordable and it works really well for
me I don't really have oily skin or dry
skin I guess you would call it
combination skin but this is just nice
to kind of likes everything this is in
nude beige so yeah hopefully this
doesn't like crack everywhere right now
but I just take this big fluffy brush
and then I put this all over my face
okay it's so probably the most crucial
part of my makeup routine and the part
that takes me the longest is my eyebrows
I don't know if you guys can tell or
maybe it's just I can tell more cuz it's
myself but my eyebrows are like pretty
not non-existent
but they're just not like super defined
and I normally have obviously like super
defined eyebrows if you guys that's
super defined but just a lot more like
eyebrow and then I naturally have so I
basically just start by spooling school
eing
them out I normally use the Anastasia
brow is but I ran out and happened to
have this benefit precisely my brow
pencil this is in the color three number
three I don't really know whatever this
is like fine I like the Anastasia one
more but this is also you know it does
the same job so basically what I do is
kind of line the front part of my
eyebrow underneath and then fill that in
and then I will take the anastasia
dipbrow pomade and kind of fill in the
edges so okay so I don't know if you
guys can see this but this is where I
like draw the line under my eyebrow and
then like I said I'm just going to fill
it in going upwards okay so once I've
done at the front of my eyebrow with a
pencil I take the dip brow pomade and
then I kind of fill in the outer part
and then once I do that I kind of go
back in with a pencil and perfect it so
this kind of takes me a while I'm not
gonna film this part but you know I just
kind of do whatever with them okay so
once I have them all filled in I take a
little mascara you could also use a brow
gel I've literally never had a brow gel
I always use this clear mascara it's the
Maybelline Great Lash it looks kind of
disgusting right now but I always use
this to kind of brush on my eyebrows and
to set them a bit so I will show you
nearing that I always wipe off the
excess just so it's not too like goopy
and globby on my eyebrows because no one
wants that and then I just kind of
brushed them obviously like how I want
them to look I brushed them up in the
front and yeah I just literally just
kind of like shaped that I want them to
look but especially when I'm going out
and my eye makeup is more dramatic I
like my eyebrows to be more dramatic you
know what I mean so kind of like
balances out but yeah this just mean
okay so once my eyebrows are done it's
time for me to move on to my eyeshadow
and this is where I get the most
questions people ask me this all the
time and I feel like I've answered what
I use for eyeshadow but I guess people
just like obviously don't watch all my
videos but I'm normally using the Urban
Decay Naked ultimate basics
this is the best palette ever sorry it's
so dirty but
all matte shades I really like matte
shades I used to be all into shimmer but
most of the time nowadays I'm always
wearing matte so I normally kind of just
do whatever I look at the color as in
depend on what I'm wearing or depending
on how I'm feeling I choose what I'm
gonna use but I normally just do this
color kind of like a basic color on the
lid and then these all in the crease and
then maybe a little bit of its dark ones
so yeah and I always use just the same
brush for all of its just kind of blends
nicely but yeah I'm taking this color
commando and then a little bit of nude
and that's what I use all over the lid
just as like a base but yeah I'm gonna
be taking tempted instinct and lock out
kind of mixing them together and then
putting them all in my crease and I just
kind of do that until I like how it
looks there's not really any rhyme or
reason it's just kind of I do it until I
like it I make sure I like keep my eye
open and look at myself while I'm doing
it because then I can see what it's
going to look like so obviously now it's
really not that intense so I just keep
building it up and building it up so I'm
gonna do that and then I will come back
okay so i zoomed in a bit so you guys
can see more if you guys say the washing
machine on by the way sorry one of my
roommates just turned it on
so yeah but I assume them a little more
so hopefully you can see the eyeshadow
right now this is definitely a really
pretty I would wear this to like to
class and stuff but I need a little bit
more I'm going out so I'm gonna take
this really dark color this is lethal
the one in the corner it's like a dark
pearly color just a tiny bit of it
mixing it with instinct and I'm gonna
put back in the crease a little bit more
on the outer V or outer corner and just
lightly start building that like I don't
want to like plop it all on it once you
know cuz that could be a little extra
but just lightly adding it and building
it up until I get it how I want it okay
so hopefully you guys can see how this
looks right now I kind of just built it
up as much as I like it but you can
never forget to put some eyeshadow
underneath your eyes
- kind of like balance it out I never
used to do this and then I started doing
it and it looks so much better so I'm
just taking these three colors I don't
think I'm gonna use lethal because
that's a little bit dark for under the
eyes and I'll probably be adding
eyeliner but I'm just sitting in saying
tempted and Lago and then I'm just gonna
run them underneath my lower lash line
and then connect them to the eyeshadow
on top yeah so there is that and then
I'm going to highlight under my brow
bone if I can find my brush we go and
just stick with the matte trend I'm just
gonna use the pre-game color here and
just plop that underneath my brow bone
and that I'm gonna take a little bit of
that as well and put that on my in a
corner I'm gonna take a black eyeliner
this is the Loreal extra intense intense
intense liquid pencil eyeliner I use
pencil on my upper lash line and my
bottom lash line I I think it's easier I
don't really know people fight me on
that but yeah so I need to sharpen this
but then I'm just gonna put this medium
thickness on my upper lash line no wing
because I can't wait my eyeliner to save
my life okay so I just put the black
eyeliner on my upper lash line and then
I'm taking a different black eyeliner
this is the Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner in
Xero just the black one this one is a
little less potent so I'm using that on
the outer half of my lower lash line
okay so I'm gonna put this on like I
said just the outer part of my lower
lash line I don't put it all the way
through cuz I think that's like a little
aggressive for me just the outer part
works just fine like so and then the
last thing I do is just apply mascara so
my mascara switches up all the time I'm
currently using the falsies a throwback
I think this was so popular like back in
the day and the other day I was just in
the drugstore trying to get a new
mascara and I remember it I used to like
it so I picked it up not like obsessed
with it but it's fine
so I just put a lot of this on my upper
lash line not lash line lashes and then
a little bit on my lower I don't wear
fake lashes because I feel like I look
like a hooker with them it's so annoying
because so many people look really
really great with them and they look so
good when they go out but I swear when I
put them on I look like a prostitute oh
I also don't curl my lashes my lashes I
guess are pretty curly on their own
because I've never really felt like I
needed to okay so once I put the mascara
on I'm just going to apply some blush I
sometimes use bronzer but I really just
don't know how to do the whole
contouring thing I remembered tried once
in a video and everyone told me it
looked really really bad so I don't
really do that anymore this is the NARS
orgasm blush and I'm just gonna put a
little bit on my cheeks just to add a
bit of color because
I feel like I'm all one color right now
and then in terms of a highlighter I'm
using the Becca one in opal and I'm just
gonna put that I'm using a different
brush I'm just gonna put that on my
cheekbones and then the tip of my nose
yeah so that is a makeup I hope you guys
can see okay this lighting is like kind
of janky honestly my whole setup right
now is janky but this is the makeup oh I
should put something on my lips I never
wear stuff on my lips because I have
really small lips so I don't like
drawing attention to them necessarily
but I always use chapstick and then when
I go out sometimes I'll use a lip gloss
also my nails are disgusting right now I
picked all my gel off it's gross I'm
sorry um yeah this is my makeup room now
I'll probably add some lip gloss later
when I'm actually like going out but I
have a substantial amount of time before
I'm going out so I'm just gonna chill
for a while and then I'm going to
obviously show you guys my outfit and
what I do to my hair when it's closer to
the actual time okay guys I know you can
hike II see my camera in this screen but
you know that's just like makes it real
whatever I don't know if I'm supposed to
look myself or look over here I feel
like if I look over here then I'm
looking in the viewfinder but if not it
was so anyways in the bathroom I just
got dressed
I'll show you obviously my outfit more
fully after this but I'm about to do my
hair and normally when I go out I do
curl my hair but tonight a I was kind of
lazy be a heavenly had my hair straight
out in a while and see it's already kind
of straightened earlier so yeah I'm just
gonna straighten my hair I use the
original Chi I have used this puppy
since like middle school and it's still
going strong
so I'm just gonna kind of like
straighten it but then curl the pieces
like toward my face under it so it's not
just like totally just straight but it's
basically just gonna be straight comment
down below if you guys like my hair
better curled or straight because I
swear I always ask people this and I get
different answers all the time and I
genuinely don't know what looks better
on me so whatever you think looks better
is like more flattering on me let me
know because I'm curious okay hopefully
this lighting is not horrendous and
hopefully this camera doesn't die but
basically I'm wearing this really really
cute black bodysuit from steli it has ly
gonna open back hopefully you can tell
it goes like pretty deep but I have no
boobs so it's not like super scandalous
but it's really cool it has like this
ruching in the front and then I decided
to wear my classic lace-up jeans from
Topshop they're just super cool and I
thought they kind of like added a little
bit to this outfit because it was really
simple and then I just threw on my
classic black booties from Steve Madden
I love these but yeah I mean a pretty
simple outfit but I think it works and I
think a lot of people would look awesome
in it so yeah yes so that is everything
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope it gave you what you were looking
for um if you want more getting ready
