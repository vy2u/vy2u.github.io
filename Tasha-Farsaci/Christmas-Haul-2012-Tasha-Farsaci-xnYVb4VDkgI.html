my Christmas haul video and I'm doing it
pretty early I'm actually doing it on
Christmas because I actually celebrated
Christmas yesterday on Christmas Eve
because my dad's working today which is
really sad but yeah he's working today
so we celebrated it last night and we
opened gifts last night and all that
stuff so I'm just doing it today
so before I start I just want to do a
little disclaimer and say I'm not trying
to brag or anything honestly I'm so
grateful for everything that I got and
if you take this as bragging and you're
gonna like leave a mean comment or say
something rude just don't watch it you
don't have to watch it I'm doing this to
the people that like watching hauls and
like watching Christmas videos and
that's what I like so that's why I'm
doing it so this stuff is pretty much
closed and the reason for that is I
really didn't know what I wanted for
Christmas this year
I don't really need anything I'm having
with everything that I had I didn't
really need clothes but I went shopping
my mom on Black Friday and the stuff I
picked out and she just got me for
Christmas
so this is also kind of Black Friday
haul I gots the but yes so I'm just
gonna get right into this this is just
the stuff I got from my parents by the
way this isn't from anyone else um I
just didn't know when I was gonna get
that stuff and I didn't want to like lag
this video out too long so yeah I'm
gonna start off with the kind of random
stuff so first things I got were this
adorable Starbucks cup ornament and I
wanted this every since I saw it in miss
Clara Roxy's video and it's just like
this gold cop and I told my mom I wanted
this but I didn't think he was gonna
actually get it and she did and it's so
cute and she also got me um $20 to
Starbucks which is amazing because I
love Starbucks I got this little soft
lips duo in vanilla and I use chapstick
all the time I love chapstick chapstick
is my life so yeah okay so I also about
to bath and Bodyworks candles which are
my first ones I'm finally a true beauty
guru because I have bath &amp;amp; Bodyworks
candles but first one I got is mahogany
teak wood and I got this because it
smells just like Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch and
that is my favorite smell ever so yeah
this is what the little candle looks
like and oh my gosh guys it smells just
like Abercrombie
so if you like that smell definitely
give this and I haven't even lighted
this yet I've just been letting it sit
in my room with the cap off and it makes
my room smell good so I couldn't tell
this is gonna make my room smell really
like and my mom also got me at the
candle and copy crunch which smell smell
yeah which smells just like buttery
toffee and kind of like caramel corn I
just smell so good I'm really excited to
bring this one too okay my mom also got
me this little mini tree I keep saying
my mom but it's from my dad too
this little purple tree and I really
wanted to pink one but I love this one
because it's so sparkly and I actually
posted a picture on Instagram of this
tree like in my room and people were
estimates from and apparently it's from
Urban Outfitters I guess that's what my
mom told me so it's so cute and it
matches my room cuz a lot of my room is
purple so I really like this I got to
loofas yeah okay so you guys probably
know I'm obsessed with college apparel
so my mom got me this Cornell University
sweatshirt because she loves Cornell and
yeah so I got this I guess I'll kind of
go by store because I kinda knew about
all this stuff basically cuz it was
Black Friday but okay so or not Ritter
is my mom got me these little earring
sets and I want to wear these and like
my MIDI cartilage piercing and probably
like my second home and I think they're
so cute I think I'm gonna put these ones
in my or one of these in my MIDI and
then like public these ones in my second
hole but I think these are really like
you and I love the next thing I got I'm
so excited about I wanted this so bad
and it's this scarf from urban and it's
just like the prettiest scar ever I love
it so so much and it's a circle scarf
and I love it it has like little beads
on the castles and stuff and I'm so
excited that I got this I feel like this
is gonna be my new favorite scarf okay I
got a lot of sweaters so brace yourself
booths whatever it's but I got this one
and I believe this is from PacSun and
it's so cute I tried this on in the
store and then I never got it but my mom
would back and cut it for me so it's
just like this purpley kind of color
almost maroon
I know almost I got pinky purple and
it's just like a big loose cardigan with
some pockets and it's kind of hard to
show you but I think it's really cute
and it has like a collar and then in the
back it almost like you can't really see
but has like a triangle kind of thing
going on yeah you probably can't see
that but I think this is really like you
and it's so soft and I love the color
I've been eyeing this cutting in for a
really long time and then my mom
surprised me with it and my dad okay I
in my dad I'm just gonna keep saying my
mom though uh-huh and it's just this
really really really pretty
cardigan and cope is one of my favorite
colors ever I just love it and it's
cable knit which i think is really cool
it also has kind of the same shape as
the last one it has like a kind of color
thing and it's cable knit like on the
back and down the sleeves sleeves and
then there is no there's not pockets
wait maybe no I don't know but this is
really really pretty and I love this so
much next thing I got with some gift
sense gifts
oh my god I can't talk next thing I got
with some gift sets from pink and I
asked for these I'm really excited that
I got them so first one I got I can
never open this okay
so first thing I got with these gray
yoga legging tank top little duo so this
is what the front looks like and then
this is the back it's all silvery and
then they're just a legging kind which I
really really like and they're super
comfy and that came with this tank that
matches it and I feel like these are
great gifts because sometimes it's kind
of hard to like you match your yoga
pants and stuff but with this it's just
stuff that matches perfectly and they're
made to match so I think this is really
cute and I really like their tank tops
as well so I'm looking forward to
wearing this together and they also come
in like really cute boxes so that's a
plus I mean I can say these from next
year and use them
lol walls okay and then I got this big
hunker box and this one is the sweat
pant the boyfriend pant because I don't
have a boyfriend so I have to buy pants
that look like boyfriend's pants anyways
pant t-shirt kind of do both thing and I
bought these for the pants because I've
wanted a pair of just like plain grey
boyfriend pants from the store before
and I really hadn't found any that I
just liked and I really like these they
just have the silver dog and they're
just like a dark grey and they're like
the plain spot pants but they are the
most comfortable spot parents in the
world guys I'm not even lying so these
came with this really really cute kind
of liked aqua blue v-neck and then it
just says pink and silver and once again
these go really nice together so you
don't feel worried about matching things
and yeah okay now I have some more like
accessory kind of things I got this
really cute beanie and it has like this
it's just almost like a knit pattern and
I totally like you from H&amp;amp;M and I'll put
it on and I think it's adorable I really
like it and I just like how it's floppy
and stuff in the back and now have nice
hat hair sexy right oh yeah I got this
swear hmm has the best scarves like
honestly it's scarf Wonderland in there
and I've been wearing this one scarf I
got from there probably every single day
at least once a week to school people
probably think I'm weird but it's just
awesome and it's this same scarf only in
maroon so when I saw it in taupe I like
crap my pants a little bit because you
guys probably know I love taupe so it's
just the same kind of knit circle scarf
and these are so warm and I've laid they
go with everything they're casual so you
can wear them with a casual outfit with
like yoga pants and stop or you can kind
of wear them with a nice outfit and like
I love these stuff and last guys in this
Christmas haul I promise I've been
really into circle scarves lately so I
saw this one and I thought it was really
pretty and so
Santa got it for me um it's just gray
and then it has like this Paisley kind
of shebang thing going on yeah so you
just put it on and loop it why am i
doing it why am I putting this on I
don't really know yeah guys can't get it
up okay last week hmm
I got this puffy vest and I'm so excited
okay so it looks like this and it's just
a black puffy vest with a faux fur hood
and it's so cute
when I think of like Washington DC don't
ask me why I think of Papa bear's
with waffle shirts or thermal shirt and
like rain boots and I I kind of want to
recreate that outfit I don't know why if
you live in Washington DC and I'm
totally off letting you know people wear
these or don't but I think it's so cute
and I'm really excited to it I think the
final place that I got stuff from was
American Eagle and I picked this stuff
out on Black Friday but first thing I
got with these really cute earrings and
they're just like little arrows and I
think these are really cute and I really
like these so I got these next I got
just take a guess another sweater this
one's not a cardigan though and this is
so cute I'm in love with it so it's this
like pullover sweater and then it has
like this really cute kind of knitting
at the bottom and then ties here and
then the hood I love the hood so much
it's striped which i think is adorable
and I came in I can't wait to race with
some leggings and boots and stuff and
this is amazingly soft guys and I love
it actually pieces on sale right now cuz
I want to know your daddy knows on sale
so if you like this go check out your
American Eagle because it's amazing
I got this tank top which is kind of
more summery than folly but you know
what else
it's so cute it has like taupe and
purple and like light blue and cream and
stuff kind of tribal on it and I love it
and I'm thinking that this will go
really nicely with this cardigan yeah
I'm seeing a little see a little
something going on there but yeah it's
like you and it's just like I raised her
back okay and lastly I got a jean jacket
from American Eagle and it's just one of
their plain crop jean jackets because my
jean jacket is kind of awkward and long
and not really fitted but this one fits
really nicely and it's nice and
distressed and I really like this say
okay so you guys probably know that I do
indoor track and it's really hard for me
to bring on my crap to school because I
need to bring heavy stuff because we've
been outside even though it's the door
track it's the stupidest thing ever we
brought in the snow and it's freezing so
I'm bringing like sweatshirts and
earmuffs and gloves and all this stuff
and I try to shove it in a drawstring
and I go to school with a whoopie
drawstring and I have to like Jam
everything in it stuffs like flying out
so I got this a hum my mom got me in my
dad got me this bag and I really excited
because I can finally fit all my stuff
in here and it's just a pink adidas bag
and I'm gonna put all my tracks top
penny here so I don't be able to bring
it to school and not look like a Santa
or something with my sack okay the last
couple things I got for my parents were
lots of candy and I'm not gonna go over
all of it because it's a lot of candy
but I guess I'll just show you guys a
little overview so yeah um pretty much
I'm gonna get obese because all this
candy and my mom made fudge and cupcakes
and stuff last night so I'm gonna get
really fat guys so if I should include
all my friend got me because I actually
did get that stuff so I guess I will
really pick my best friend Randy we
exchanged gifts so she got me
two pairs of sour gummy worms because
she knows me so well these are my crack
honestly we're getting love these things
they're so good and she got me to thanks
girlfriend then she got me a pack of gum
she got me an Essie nail polish in lilac
ISM and it's just a really pretty light
purple and I really want to pay my nails
this and do like silver on my ring
finger and thumb I think that would look
really cute and then she got me a
Sephora gift card because she knows I'm
a makeup junkie so yeah she got me this
and I think it's really cute packaging
like look at that BAM oh my god guys I
suck I'm so uncoordinated when it comes
with a little mirror and stuff so I
think that is really cute and thank you
