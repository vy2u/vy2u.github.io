the Christmas haul of 2013 get one of
these last year and it actually got a
lot of views and I think that's because
Christmas halls are probably the best
videos ever because you basically have a
second Christmas being all excited to
see what someone else got so it's almost
like a second Christmas I don't know
they're just so great and they're
honestly like my favorite things like
after Christmas I go and watch other
people's Christmas hauls for like days
straight so yeah I know there's got to
be those people that don't like these
videos because they think they're
bragging but I am honestly so beyond
grateful for everything that I got my
parents are amazing for what they got me
I'm so grateful and I'm not trying to
brag in any way and if you're going to
be offended by this video just don't
watch it because there's no you spooning
it for other people so without any
further ado I'm going to get right into
it so the first things I'm going to show
other things I got from my best friend
Maddie and I got her stuff like we did a
gift exchange like a little bit before
Christmas so I got this stuff first
thing are the targets our dummy will
miss because we always get each other
these things are the best our double
worms ever and if you've never tried
them you're definitely missing out she
gave me the minty OS lip balm the Jura
Dahlia peppermint bark squares which by
the way I have opened and there was like
one laughs because I like all of them as
like a little joke she got me this
bracelet that says fierce cuz I mean for
obvious reasons
she got me some solid fuzzy socks
because if you guys know me if anyone
knows me I wear fuzzy socks every single
day in the winter with my boots like
every day and sometimes lately I'm cute
at all and you can always see them
because I put a short so these ones are
cute and I'll be wearing these with my
boots just watch he got me these cute
little tribal earrings she don't be this
adorable little Starbucks kit has a cute
little mug and then hot cocoa mix and
this is adorable because she knows that
I love Starbucks and drinks and all this
awesomeness and finally she got me the
nail polish that I'm wearing it is
Essie's shilling darling and it looks
like this and it's really pretty these
are my favorite colors following winter
colors are my absolute favorites and so
that is the stuff she got me thank you
so much Manning that was so nice of you
if you're watching this
but if you are shut out girl okay moving
on to the gifts for my parents I got a
ton of candy because I love candy so I'm
not really gonna show you guys that
because it's not that interesting at all
things but I got a lot of it and I got a
bunch of no chocolate-covered pretzels
so the item that I am going to show you
guys is a little bit a little bit out
there um my mom went a little ham so I
really really like assorted chocolate
even if they don't taste that good like
I'm just obsessed with them just the
idea of like a bunch of random chocolate
flavors and if you don't look at the
little key on the top and you don't know
what you're gonna eat I don't know I
just really like it so my mom yeah this
has like 80 something chocolates in it
and it's probably gonna take me like a
year to eat hopefully because I don't
want to eat all this and like one night
but that was pretty awesome I got some
nail polish remover with acetone because
I just had gel nails and I was trying to
take them off myself cuz I don't like
going into nail salons because the
ladies would always mean and they just
like talked about me and Chinese so I
want to take them off myself and you can
take them off with this so they come
pick out some gum right away this is my
Fifi I love chapstick I'm always wearing
chapstick always have chapstick so my
mom thought she'd be funny and get me
chicken poop chapstick
don't think it has an evil poop in it
but um solve it I'm gonna keep saying my
mom because my mom was like with me when
I picked up most of these things but
obviously the sauce for my dad as well
but I told her the two nail polishes
that I really was eyeing so she got me
these two and they're both asking cuz se
is my favorite and this one is sable
collar you can see that and this one is
devil's advocate from Bath and Body
Works I picked out a bunch of candles
for Christmas so I've got a red velvet
cupcake because we have all the cupcakes
my favorite company's ever in the smells
just like red velvet cupcake like just
like I'm not spiced apple toddy
I got twisted peppermint vanilla bean
Noel and lastly cranberry pear Bellini
and this one is
so good I can't get over it it's it it's
really fruity and fresh and like it's
just it's a great time and then I got
some hand lotion from there because my
hands get so dry in the winter it's
disgusting and I gotta fight with I got
one vanilla sugar because this is just
an all-time great second man I got this
frog toothbrush holder can't exactly
tell you why but I'm not gonna complain
because it's pretty cute like I said
before I love Starbucks so I got this
little I don't know what you call this
is it it's not at um where it's like a
like a mug thing and I bring coffee or
like warm drinks to school every morning
so at this one it's very sleek and
pretty and then I also got a little
tumbler with a little Starbucks logo and
I have one of these it's like blue that
I bring to school when I have iced
coffee so had to get the Starbucks one
cuz I'm basic and then along with those
I got waiting $20 to Starbucks I think
so that is awesome cuz Starbucks is my
one true love oh if you guys haven't
noticed this tree sitting here because I
was gonna film it in front of my
Christmas tree but my mom and dad are
like cooking downstairs and that's like
right next to my Christmas tree and I
really don't want to film in front of
them because I that's awkward
and they just be staring at me so I am
incorporating this cute little tree
right next to me has some sunglasses in
it or something so yeah I got this super
adorable beanie and it matches my
sweater maybe I'll put it on for you
it's really baggy and I love beanies and
hats and like headbands
and all that cute wintery stuff so okay
I probably look really dumb I have to
like fix it a little bit but you guys
get the point
my hair is looks like a mess oh my god I
slept on it just like natural and whoo
okay my mom picked this sweater out for
me it's like a dark green color and it
has a pocket down here somewhere there
it is
and I love the sweater if there's my
favorite thing in the world and I wear
them with the scarf every single day so
if you scroll to scold me you'll
probably see me wearing this scarf
at least once a week and we'll match
this photo what a surprise though yeah I
got this a maxi skirt that I actually
picked out it's from Macy's and it's
like a really bohemian kind of thing it
has like a stretchy band and then it has
this really pretty pattern and then it
goes all the way down into this pattern
and then on the back it has like a
little little slit somewhere there it is
so I think this is super cute and I
can't wait to win it is once it gets a
little warmer because in New York is not
very warm right now it's like snowy and
like 10 degrees from PacSun I bought
this sweater that's just like the brandy
melville cardigan because my brandy
melville on I had it and it completely
shrunk so I don't even wear it anymore
because it's just really awkward so I
got it in this version and it's just
like the big like oatmeal color sweater
and this is a medium so it's really big
but I hope this one doesn't shrink
because it's like my favorite sweater
and then I got this shirt and it's more
like a to Nicki dress shirt it's like
tribal it's really soft and it has some
layers and it just goes down like that
so yeah moving outfit is it's probably
my favorite store so I gotta get scarred
from there and it came in this we're
really cool like a psychedelic kind of
thing and it's $100 which is so generous
of my mom and dad so thank you so much
guys and then I got so Lululemon wonder
wonders okay if you guys know me I
literally buy leggings every single day
but I hate leggings that are see-through
which is like every single pair of
leggings because if you get leggings
that are tight which you want them to be
tight you know they're going to see
through eventually it really sucks so I
always weigh like athletic leggings but
it looks weird because they look
athletic and they have like that my key
side of them so I really wanted these
and my mom got them for me they're a bit
of an investment for what they are but
they have a really great quality and
they're just black like stretchy legging
like yoga parent things they have
lemons I'm look back and they're just
fabulous these fit great and there's
such a stretchy like thick material but
they will never be see-through and I'm
just so excited about these
I belief about I got this perfume it's
the Hollister Millea that's what it
looks like I don't really know how to
say it but I love this perfume if you go
to Hollister it's the one that looks
like this this is the one that I have
except mine is really nasty and dirty so
don't look at it but it has like a
little pump and it smells so good so
mine's looking a really nasty and rough
so I'm glad I got a new one okay my last
kind of big present is a coat and I got
this before Christmas because I really
did not have a thick warm coat which is
crazy because I live in New York and
it's freezing here all the time but I
just never had a cute coat and I didn't
want to wear like hourly one so I was
looking around for a coat and I found
one but it's from Roxy which is like a
surfy brand and i got this from a
Quicksilver store if you guys are gonna
be looking for it but it's really cute
it's black and I love the lining of it
it's so cool and it has like toggle
button I'm gonna probably put a clip in
me wearing this so you'll see it but
it's just a black coat and the toggles I
like with a twine and stuff they're
really cool the hood is awesome
it's like puffy I have a picture of me
and I'm wearing this on one of my
Instagram pictures so some of you guys
were asking me what's from its bye Roxy
if you don't follow me on instagram
please go follow me please please please
I always update on there and is PX
Latasha just like my youtube name so
that is what I got for Christmas 2013 I
am so excited and I'm so grateful for
everything that I got once again if you
guys do a Christmas haul video please
leave it in the video responses because
I'll probably be watching these for like
a year probably till next Christmas oh

last year I look so different
