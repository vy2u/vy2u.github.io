this black tank top and it's like
chiffon and then it has like this kind
of tribal tribal yeah okay then I have
this kimono and come on oh is that like
really trendy right now so so I don't
know what print this is but it's kind of
cute and it has like long sleeves and
then there's like something like floral
stuff on the bottom with pom-poms
I love the pump pump yeah nbsp cute I
think you never like white shorts really
yeah okay and then I got lastly that's
like a floral dress thing it has a
little ruffle and then it cinches in it
flows out and this is really weird
because it's sushi inside but the tag
says cotton on oh yeah I remember saying
so yeah I mean I guess if you like this
you can look at cotton on - so yeah I
don't try and link all of these I'm just
the mall today okay we both went to our
combi and normally I don't really shop
there that much they have stepped up
their game I know I told Tasha like you
can fire up there now it's so cute I
love their stuff sorry my voice is calm
we were terrible coming kids and they
closed mine in my mom so we're boys

waist and then they're just like really
tight and black skinny jeans and then I
just got these little shorts cuz they
were on like 60% off yeah and I don't
know I feel like I always ready you know
that anyone's Victoria's Secret and sure
over the Victoria's Secret Pink etosha
me I got a bunch on underwear but we
can't show you it's too scandalous so
naturally I've got more baby bottoms
