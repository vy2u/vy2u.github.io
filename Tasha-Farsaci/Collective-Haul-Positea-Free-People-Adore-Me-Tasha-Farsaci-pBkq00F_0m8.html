haul video it's kind of just a bunch of
random stuff that I've gotten recently
collected into a video I can't tell if
my hair looks cute or if I look like an
alien princess kind of thing so let me
know if you like it okay I'm gonna get
right into the video the first place I
have things from is adore me and the Box
looked cuter than this when I got it but
you know I ripped it open and I've Hulk
from adore me a few times before if you
don't know what it is it's pretty much
one of those subscription or website
services except it's for bras underwear
lingerie loungewear pajama is etc you do
not have to use a subscription you can
just buy it as a one-time thing or even
use a subscription if you do choose to
go with the subscription it's cheaper
you can get the matching set for 3995
you guys help me know if you want a
Victoria's Secret pretty much one bra is
going to cost you like $50 so you get a
bra and underwear for 2495 and it's your
first time so yeah it's a really cool
website I've gotten things from them
numerous times and I have a code for you
that I believe is $10 off I'm gonna put
a hero also put in the description if
you guys are interested okay so the
first thing I got is this unlined black
bra this is such a sexy bra like I'm not
you know a sexy person but like I get
this bra is super hot I also do not have
boobs so these work for no boobs in
boobs yeah this one it's just not light
at all as you can see you can like see
me through it not padded but it looks so
good on it's like so pretty and then the
underwear came with I am literally
obsessed with they look like this as you
can see there's a bunch of lace in the
front and then the back and I get the
thong styles because I hate underwear
lines so much but you don't have to get
thongs you can get like hipster or
cheeky the next one I got is this really
pretty like nude pink one as you can see
there's some lace and this one has
padding but it's not pushed up or
anything it's just line really really
cute and then the underwear is the same
as the black one just looks like this
with the lace on the front and then the
back I got this really really pretty one
it's like a purple burgundy color with
pink and this one has like some pushup
but you can like remove it it's kind of
like you can pull it out but yeah it's
really cute I love the color of this one
really pretty and on the bottoms look
like this really cute I love the lace
their underwear is so so cute the last
thing I got is actually a pajama set and
I don't have the pants with me because
they're in like the laundry right now
because I've worn them so many times but
they're just black pants the top is so
cute it is white lace and it's a tank
top and as you can see it's just like
lace all the way up and then it flows
down it's like a black baby doll and
then there's adjustable straps and it's
so comfortable and so cute and then the
bottoms are just like a really
comfortable black pajama pant and I'm in
love with them I've already worn this so
many times if my background is different
and parts of this video are four
switches around I apologize I had to
film things a little bit scattered and I
filmed at different times so things are
changing around me I apologize okay the
next thing I have to show you I'm really
excited about I've been seeing like teas
and detox teas all over social media
lately and I've always wanted to try
them out because they seem super awesome
I love tea I love the idea of
fat-burning and just being healthy so I
decided to try out a tea called positi
and this is the body detox 28 days so I
got this and it comes with this a cute
little strainer that you put the tea in
and then plop it in the tea so it just
looks like this um it's cute packaging
I'm super excited to try it
you know how the LA lifestyle is
everyone's like super healthy and super
into like detoxing so I thought it would
be cool to me to try out I've only tried
it once so far but it's really good I
think everyone would like it it's
nothing like crazy so I think a lot of
people would really like it this is what
the packaging looks like and I'm gonna
show you really quick how I make it
okay so first thing I'm doing is just
getting up some water thumbs up if you
like my paga mug shout out to my best
friend Mel for giving me that but
basically this tea is supposed to
support your metabolism burn fat and
give you more energy so who doesn't want
that I'm gonna show you how I make it
I'm just setting the microwave or for a
minute 30 seconds here's another look at
the tea what it looks like on the inside
it's really cool-looking
well my water is hot I'm taking it out
carefully of course and then this is the
strainer comes with its really cute
looking you just put your tea in the
little capsule as I'm doing right here
it looks and then I'm just putting it in
the tea stirring it around and let it
seep in to the water and then I'm
drinking my delicious tea I really
really recommend it so that's how I make
the tea as you can see it's super easy
and quick if you want this tea it's from
positi calm I'm gonna put that down
below and i also have a coupon code if
you want to get this for 10% off its
fiercely Tasha ten once again
everything's gonna be in the description
but I definitely recommend it because
it's something that's cool to try I
think everyone should try it out if they
like tea so let me know what you guys
think about body detox teas if you use
them before if you want to use them
which if you do try this one out but
yeah let me know what you think about
them okay so to go along with the
randomness of this haul video I'm gonna
show you a few of the bathing suits I've
recently picked up because you guys may
or may not know I'm obsessed with buying
bathing suits they're probably my
favourite thing to buy and I've found
some really cute ones lately I know it's
the winter but not gonna live in LA I
feel like I can kind of get away with
buy more bathing suits um and also I'm
going to Florida in like a month for my
spring break so I'll be able to wear
some men but I thought it would be
something fun to show you okay so the
first one is gonna be kind of hard to
show these are both from Elle space if
you have a bit of elf space it's one of
my favorite bathing suit brands they're
all so cute so this one is one of the
wrap style tops so if you don't know
what that is basically like you put the
straps on either just to like flaps and
you cross them around each other and
then tie them behind your back so it
looks like this I got the reversible
ones so on one side it's black and the
other side it's this really cool pattern
but basically you put it on like this
and then take these two little straps
and cross them over it's kind of hard to
show but I'll probably try and find a
picture of it on the model and they put
it here this is just a close-up look on
the pattern I think it's really pretty
and there's tons of colors in it so you
can mix and match the bottoms which is
why I didn't get bottoms to go with it
but I love this top so much the next hop
from Elle space I love just as much of
that one I might like this one more let
me know which one you guys like more but
pretty much it's this like dusty purple
colored top and as you can see it has
all this really pretty like crossing in
the middle and I know the tan lines for
these would not be the best but you know
I'd rather have cute bikinis and deal
with tan lines
uh-hum but I love this so much the
material is great it's so pretty the
colors really unique and then it just
has an adjustable straps and such but I
love this one
so much so pretty and like honestly you
could probably wear this as a burlap
which is great so it's kind of like a
two-in-one deal okay and the last bikini
I have to show you this from Frankie's
bikinis which is probably one of my
favorites too I have so many favorite
bathing suit brands let me know if
you're gonna want an updated bikini
collection because I have one from last
year I'll try and link it down below but
I got a lot more bikinis since then so
let me know if you're gonna want to
update one and then yeah so anyways
Frankie's bikinis I found out about like
once I moved to LA and I loved them so
much so I got this bathing suit and it's
beautiful so basically at the top looks
like this it's kind of like a high
neckline and then the best part is the
back if you can tell it's all extra fee
all over your rack so beautiful so
unique and then I got the bottoms too
they're like really tiny like cheeky
bottoms but they're so so cute I love
the print of this one I'll show you a
little up close so here is what this one
looks like I love this print so much
once again the back is really strappy
yeah seriously it's so obsessed I do
post a lot of bikini pictures on my
Instagram just because I like the vibe
like I love like beachy vibes and beachy
photos so if you like those types of
photos once again go follow me on
Instagram if you have any other swimwear
lines that you would recommend for me to
check out let me know because you guys
know I'm obsessed ok the last few things
I have to show you in this haul video
from 3 people 3 people is my favor
store ever and I've gotten a good amount
of things lately so I thought I'd show
you the first thing I got is there
halter lace bra light and black because
I have it in cream and gray and I love
it so much
I used to get the Urban Outfitters ones
but I love these ones so much more I
like the material a lot better so I
definitely recommend these if you want
to go to halt umbrella I just got the
black one and I wear an extra small I
have two of the vents your thermals and
I'm pretty sure that's what they're
called I absolutely love them I was
wearing one in my stalker experience
video so it looks like this it's
basically just a loose long t-shirt it
has like waffle knit and then it has
just regular knit and I just really like
how its high-low and comfy and I love
how these look with the bra let's so I
got this like teal colored one and then
I also have this light like seafoam
green color wine if that is so so cute
as well so I love these second to last I
got one of theirs slip dress as you guys
may or may not be familiar with them but
I just got this gray a floral one it has
like some pink and purple and then as
you can see it has like lace little
lines through it and then it just kind
of like flows down I have one more of
those and I got this slip to wear
underneath them because the lace kind of
shows like your underwear area so I just
got a nude slip from Free People and
this one is just like a tight like it
looks like a cami but it's just a long
slip dress and this is great 200 oh
that's perfect I needed one of these and
this was $30 so it wasn't horrible so I
thought this would be a good piece that
I will use a lot okay so I hope I didn't
rush through this video my roommate was
like trying to come back in the room and
