you and I don't really know what to call
this maybe I'll call it fall haul I have
three beauty products and the rest are
all fashion this is kind of collective
some of these things I got a while ago
some of them I got like a week ago and
then some of them I just got in the mail
today so I'm gonna get right into this
okay first place that I went with
Sephora and I only got one thing but I
still want to show it to you guys so
it's this little box from benefit and
it's one of their little box set things
and this is the go tropic coral box and
I love the packaging it's so cute but
pretty much I've been wanting to try
there for at least a blush and there
high-beam for a really long time so this
comes with the coralista blush high-beam
cha-cha tint and the coralista lip gloss
so I thought that was a really great
kind of mixture of the products and
their Mideast so I can try them out and
this whole box was $28 which I thought
was a pretty good deal but everything
that had in it so I got this from
Sephora I don't know if this is like a
limited thing they're doing they have
lots of other colors I just like using
corals but I don't know if this is
limited time so if you're interested in
this definitely go to Sephora and check
it out
next place I went was Ulta and I just
got one of my eyeliners that I use every
single day on my upper lash line this is
the NYX slide on glide on something is a
really long name eyeliner in brown
perfection and as you can see it's just
a nice dark brown and I use this on my
upper lash line every single day and
these are dupes for the 24/7 glide-on
pencils from Urban Decay feel like
exactly the same I've tried both so I
definitely recommend these because
either like half the price I'm from Ulta
I also got a nail polish because I can't
go to altar without buying a nail polish
but this is just China Glaze devotion
and it's just this really pretty purpley
kind of silver color it's not really
showing up very purple but it's really
like a silvery purple color which is
really cool and once again it is the
motion I don't know if you can see that
but yeah I know in the clothing first
place I went was H&amp;amp;M and I really
haven't found anything in H&amp;amp;M lately
I'm like but I love this top so maroon
is probably one of my favorite colors of
all time and it's really in for this
fall so I found this shirt and pretty
much it's just this maroon lacy
three-quarter length shirt and it's kind
of it's not really cropped but it's like
I guess kind of cropped and then the
back has buttons going all the way down
and it kind of has like a scalloped
bottom as you can see and I think this
is really cute I love the color they
also had this same fabric in like a
dress and I really love the dress too
but I figured I just get more use out of
the top and this was 24.95 also only got
one thing from forever 21 I really
haven't been finding anything there
recently either but I got a pair of a
leather shorts or not real leather but
they were fake leather and I've been
wanting a pair of leather shorts for a
long time and I know it's fall I'm not
gonna be making shorts but I definitely
wanted to pick them up because they are
something I've wanted forever and maybe
I can pair them with some sheer tights
or something but yeah they look like
this they're a little bit high waisted
and these are were 1780 will be the next
store I went to was open Outfitters and
the first thing I got is this amazing
necklace I've been wanting this necklace
for the longest time or a necklace at
least like this because I love triangles
I don't know I just like them so I've
been buying a necklace with like some
sort of triangle thing on it and I saw
this one at urban and I love it so it
has five triangles you can kind of see
it better here and they're kind of like
a feminist metal the outside ones are
bronze and the one in the middle was
like a tarnished silver and I just think
this is super pretty it looks and really
pretty on I had a lot of compliments
I've already worn this but yeah so I
really like this and this was $18.00
which is kind of a lot but I don't know
it's a good quality necklace Urban
Outfitters is expensive to begin with so
yeah I don't know I thought it was worth
it okay I got two more things from Urban
Outfitters the first thing is just this
shirt that I've already won before so if
it's kind of like wrinkly that's why but
it's this olive green color and it's
really a basic shirt
kind of has like a slit cut here and the
whole fabric looks really distressed
kind of on purpose and it's just kind of
loose as a pocket here and it goes down
this was extremely overpriced this was
$39 which I know is way too much but I
loved it so much it's just so soft and
like distressed looking as you can
probably tell and this is just something
that I feel like I'm gonna wear a ton I
know it probably was not worth $39 but I
loved it so much and they had this in a
few other colors this one was just my
favorite and yeah I don't know I love
this next thing I got from Urban is a
sweatshirt and I know it's not really
the most fashionable thing ever but I
love this and I saw online and I loved
it even more and it was $10 off so I
thought it was a good deal and it's
basically this extremely soft softest
thing I've ever felt um
burnout kind of sweatshirt and I got it
in this life raspberry kind of faded
maroon color because I love maroon and
yeah it's just extremely soft it's so
soft like Fela guys and it just burn out
as you can see it kind of looks tie-dyed
and the sleeves are all burn out and it
just goes down it's just a nice zip up
and I'm I'm seriously it's so soft I
cannot wait to wear this
they had this in a few other colors I
think a teal maybe a grey I'm not sure
but I recommend this just because it's
seriously so soft and this was $39 but
it was on sale for 29 I didn't really
know that until I checked out so you
know how soft this must be if I was
gonna pay $39 for it but yeah I got this
okay the final store in my haul video
today is brandy melville some of this
stuff I ordered a long time ago probably
like a month ago maybe but I haven't
shown it in a video before except I've
worn this one of the pieces in an outfit
of the week but I haven't shown it so I
figured I'd kind of mush it together
with some stuff that I just got
male:today so these are like fall pieces
but you know whatever so I got this tank
top that you probably see am I out for
the week and it's black and crop and
then it just has a wolf on it and I
really love this graphic so mostly
because the wolf is like pastel colors
which I just thought was really cool and
I love pairing this with colored pants I
actually wore it with hot pink pants in
my Apple week video so I really do like
this top a lot and I'm pretty sure they
might still have it on their website and
they definitely still have things with
this graphic so definitely check it out
and I believe this was like 18 dollars
maybe 20 but Brady Melville I can't
decide if it's cheap or not like some
things will be extremely cheap and some
things will be like $70 it's just their
website I'm I it confuses me so much but
anyways I also got this dress from that
time when I purchased it and this is why
I purchased it pretty much because I
wanted this dress so it looks kind of
odd right now but it's just this pink
and black and kind of tan tribal print
and it flows out at the bottom it's a
little bit hi-low but basically it has
this tie here it's strapless and you
would tie it around the back and then it
has like these cutouts on the sides when
you wear it it's like all cut out and
then it just ties in the back you
probably don't even know what I'm
talking about but I love this this is so
cute but if you have big boobs I don't
recommend this because they might hang
out the bottom or the side so I don't
have boobs so it's fine with me but I
think this was like 38 or 40 dollars
maybe but I'm really excited to wear
this so I know it's not fully but I
still like it
tell us about two pieces of jewelry when
I ordered those things they're both
rings I got a one a ring with three
skulls on it and then I got this one
that every single person has that's
right so this is one of the skulls
that's what it looks like and this is
the other one I can't really describe it
but I think everyone has this but yeah
and by the way on my nails is
OPI is my private jet but yeah okay and
finally for the stuff that just came
today I really wanted to scope you'll
see a minute so I got back seriesin I
ordered this stuff but you need fifty
dollars to get free shipping and if you
don't have free shipping their shipping
is like 20 bucks it's so weird so I kind
of just had to throw stuff in my car but
I got this bracelet and it's kind of
this corally orange color it looked more
coral on the website but whatever and it
just it's kind of like a wrap bracelet
and it has like these gold beads all
around it and I think this is really
cute and this was six dollars which is
pretty good I guess so yeah I got this
okay now for the reason why I ordered
this stuff I've been wanting this skirt
forever and it's always out of stock
whenever I'm on the website so it went
back in stock and I decided I was just
ordering so it's a maroon maxi skirt and
I wanted a maxi skirt for a while now so
it basically it's just like they're you
know Josie kind of super soft material
and it just goes all the way down and
obviously this is a little bit too long
on me because I am only five foot one so
all I do is kind of roll it under like
this and you can't even tell that it's
rolled so if you have a maxi skirt and
it's too long on you try that you can
also go this kind of high-waisted and
you can't really tell but I'm so happy I
got this and this was 28 okay and the
last thing I got from brandy melville I
got kind of to go with the skirt and it
looks it matches perfectly with the
skirt it's just this sweater and it
looks like this it's maroon and grey
kind of ish and then it has a pocket
over here and it's cropped which i think
is really cute it's not too cropped like
you can't see a belly button or anything
but
see what I seen I did there it looks
really good because I do with this kind
of high-waisted because it's pretty long
on me and this is cropped so it just
looks like nice together I'm definitely
gonna wear this this week so you might
see this in and out for the week
together but this was $20 which I
thought was a really big deal like $20
for a sweater it's cheap but then like
$70 for a Jean vest that's crazy I want
a Jean vest so badly
that's like dis fast so if you know
where I can get one for like under $35 I
guess somewhere in there let me know
because I want one really badly but I'm
not gonna pay 70 from brandy melville
their website is wacko but that is my
haul video I think that's everything
kind of collective I would say so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video leave a
comment down below what your favorite
thing I got was or anything else do you
