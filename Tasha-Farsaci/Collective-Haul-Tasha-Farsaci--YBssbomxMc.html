hope you guys can notice the quality is
a lot better um my camcorder came i'm so
happy it's the sony handycam CX 110 so
yeah i'm so happy with it and the
quality is really nice from what i can
tell and yeah so basically i have been
wanting to do a haul video forever
because i've gone shopping numerous
times and it's been like a month so i've
been click collecting it all together so
this is like a collective haul and it's
just been piling up in my closet so I
really wanted my camcorder to comment
now that has i'm doing a collective haul
so this stuff was not all purchased at
the same time um trust me i'm not buy
this my stuff at one time bomb yeah i
decided i would show you anyways so the
first place I went was Alta because I
had a gift card from Christmas ok so I
have like an obsession with nail polish
it's kind of unhealthy but um I have
free nail polishes and I'm gonna start
off with zoya I haven't tried the way
before and I mean I have now but before
i bought these I'd never tried it and I
always wanted to because they have
really pretty colors and what I found is
that the colors look really pretty in
the bottle and then still nice on your
nails but they just don't look as nice
so um yeah I mean I guess I like them
but they're not my favorite so the first
color I got was in edita it looks like
this it's like a green kind of color
with bronzy gold shimmer um and yeah so
this is the name of it and this is what
this one looks like so I do like this ok
the next one I got I absolutely love its
jem and it's like this purpley color
with a bunch of a gold shimmer and I
really like this so gem okay the last
one I got is an OPI color okie eyes of
my favorite and I'm actually wearing it
right now so um yeah it's in yodel me on
my cell and it's been aa me for a while
so it's kind of chipping but it's a
really pretty kind of aqua blue color
and um yeah so yodel meet on my cell my
hands really shaky that's weird ok the
final thing I got from Ulta i have been
wanting forever and i got this because i
had a gift card it's a perfume and
normally perfumes are really overpriced
I think you know for what they are so I
never leave I for a few
I've been wanting this one for a long
time and it's the DKNY be delicious it's
really popular but I love it so
basically if you've never seen it before
it looks like a little apple and that's
because it smells like green apples and
um yeah so this is what it looks like if
you've never seen it and I got the
smallest size just because the rest of
them were all like over fifty dollars
which i think is crazy but this smells
so nice I love this and it lasts sick
all day so I got this okay so the next
place is for everyone I got this ring
and it's kind of a funny story behind
why I got it um i was in new york city i
think in like november and i went into
the giant 41 and I really didn't find
anything that I wanted which was weird
except for this one ring and the line
was really really long so I didn't want
to check out just to buy a ring that was
like three dollars you know so I didn't
get it and I found it in my friend with
me one so I was so excited and it's kind
of edgy I don't think it's gonna be
everyone's style but I really like it so
this is what it looks like it has spikes
like all around it which i think is
really cool and yeah I really like this
okay now on to the clothing I got a pair
of black jeans from there because I've
always wanted a pair of black jeans and
these are extremely cheap these are like
ten dollars um so I look like this and
these are really short I can never find
jeans that fit me because I'm only like
five one and a half now but these
puppies these fit me and there is kind
of a downside of these so I didn't watch
them before I wore them and I always sit
in class with my hands under my legs
which is kind of weird but whatever and
I noticed that my hands were really odd
to call her and the guy came off of them
and i know that because i was in bio and
i took my paper and like rubbed it all
over my pants and like it came off on
the paper so i definitely recommend
washing these before you wear them
because you know your hands turn odd
colors ok the next thing I got ok you
guys might know that I love royal blue
like all of a sudden I have like an
infatuation with royal blue and I always
wanted a pea coat I never really had
when I wish for my northface but I
wanted like a cute jacket you know so I
saw this and I almost pooped my pants
like honestly so excited so this is what
it looks like it's kind of hard to show
but it just has the buttons in the front
like any Pico dozen it has like a tie
and yeah it's just like this nice royal
blue color and
I am so excited then I got this um
forever 21 is a great place to buy
jackets because they're really cheap I
think this was only like thirty dollars
maybe 35 but I really love this I had
won some of these things in my out for
the week so if you recognize them that's
why this next sure I got um I saw this
in another forever 21 I was in and I had
but I didn't get it because I'm not
Easton so when I saw it in my car with
me one I was kind of regretting it and I
decided I would just get it so it's like
this black long-sleeved like spandexy
loose top but the thing I liked about it
was that had it sequiny pocket and i
don't know why i like that that much
because i'm not a huge sequin girl but I
actually really liked this and it's
really comfy it's so soft so I love this
okay the last thing I got I'm so excited
about I was watching every weeks or
Alison's video and she got this shirt I
was so jealous because it is amazing so
the front isn't all that great it's just
like this fuchsia pink color and it's
loose and it goes down to like these
cinch sleeves but the back the back is
amazing so on the back it has this bow
and then a little cable and then a black
zipper which is basically amazing to me
i love bows and in the little edginess
of the zipper good stuff ok the next
places i went to i only got one thing
but i figured i would still show you
guys the first thing is something from
the victoria secret semi-annual sale
which proves how long I've had these
things because I was a while ago and I
really like pink lounge way like the
pink line but it's really expensive ok
so I keep moving my shirt or too late
awkward ok yeah so it's really expensive
and i really don't buy things like that
often because it takes sweats and i
rather dress up the more sweats so it's
not really practical for me to spend
like forty dollars on a sweatshirt so i
really like their yoga pants as well and
these pair were on sale and i don't have
this style the other cropped leggings
and of course royal blue right but i
really did like the back it's like a
silver zebra print and it just says pink
so yeah I've worn these already a while
ago and I really like these and the cool
thing since I'm so short these come down
longer than they do on normal people so
I can with my tall uggs and the
like fit in there so I can wear these as
pants yeah pretty fancy ok the next
place i went with urban outfitters and i
also only got one thing I wore this in
my recent out for the week swim you guys
thought it was kind of but I
really liked it um so you know ok it's
like this black lace bustier or top or
bustier I don't know but um it looks
like this and its really like you and
then the back has a zipper and I think
this is adorable so I really like this
ok in the next place I went was hmm and
ok so I have one ball that you really
close to me probably like five minutes
and then I have another mall dips like
15 minutes away more that's five minutes
away from me is terrible they have like
no stores the stores are terrible and
then there's like a whole wing that went
out of business so all the stores in
there are like tractor companies and
like dance classes like it's really
weird so the only good store in that
mall was hmm pretty much and of course
it's going out of business so um they
were having a huge sale and it wasn't
buy one get one free all their clearance
like everything was on clearance so I
just got these two things you guys made
I love sweaters and um yeah so I saw
this sweater and it's this black like
cable knit sweater and its really really
thick it has like wool in it and its
really really cute and comfy and I born
this already so yeah I love this ok and
the next things I got ok I have one of
these for a while and for some reason
there was a bunch of in the store
they're kind of crazy I mean they won't
be in style forever but I got them for a
good price because there's buy one get
one free and they are these fringy
sandals they like tan and they have like
fringe with a little bow tie and then
the little fringy tassels would like a
little gold bead and these are just
really really cute I've one of these
forever so they had them when I was like
okay I've got to do it so um yeah I love
these ok the last thing i got is
actually for a video i'm gonna do i'm
going to do like a cool DIY so stay
tuned for that but it's just like a
black t-shirt and then it has a little
pocket in it and this was one like ten
dollars so that's a good deal for sex
so yeah okay the last couple things are
from online websites so I have a formal
dance coming up from my school and I
wanted to get a dress that like no one
else would have so I was looking online
and stuff and I came across this website
called Toby com they're not sponsored me
or anything TOB I and they have some
really cool stuff they have like
designer things like they have wildfox
and juicy and stuff and then they have
like other brands that I've never heard
of so i got my dress from there but i
don't have it right now because it's
getting happened because I'm a midget um
but I didn't get a shirt from there and
you guys may know that I love snake
print I actually love most animal prints
as you can probably tell by my shirt but
snake print is something that I've been
really into lately and i really wanted
like a snake print ship on the shirt
because chiffons like my favorite
material to wear in shirts so when I saw
this I was like so excited because it's
really cool and they do this cool thing
on the website that like when as soon as
they get something in it's like new they
put it on sale just kind of odd but you
know if they do it so I got this on sale
for $28 in its original 842 and then
like right after I got it went back to
42 so it's kind of weird but it's really
cool so this is going to be really hard
to show on camera so I scoops back so
it's this really loose snake print top
as you can see the print but what's
really cool about it I'm showing you the
back that's awkward okay so what's
really cool about it is in the front it
has it these triangle cutouts um and
there's three of them there's two on
either side and there's one in the
middle with a little tie is and then the
next thing is down the sleeves it also
has cutouts so if it was on me it would
look like this which i think is so cool
and then the bottom it's just kind of
like cinched with live elastic and stuff
but I am obsessed with this and I cannot
wait way this and summer would like
sandals and even now in the winter it's
really cute so yeah that's like
everything I got I realize like halls I
don't want you to think I'm bragging or
anything i bought this with all my own
money so I'm also one in New York City
for my birthday my birthday is februari
17th and I'm going the 19th because it's
winter break for me my school has winter
break in February as well so I'm lucky
about that well yeah I'm going to New
York City I'm so excited so if you guys
want me to do a halt on that let me know
because I'm just
guess I don't want to look like I'm
bragging or anything but yeah so I feel
like I talked to do b-fast in this video
and i feel it i didn't like all my
personality come through but um yeah I
don't know I'm going to the bow tonight
with some of my friends that should be
fun you know Channing Tatum good stuff
um so if you guys see that or if you're
gonna see it let me know or comment
anything else down below comment your
favorite thing or whatever because that
would be people and I hope you guys like
this I would be like my new koala d &amp;amp; G
