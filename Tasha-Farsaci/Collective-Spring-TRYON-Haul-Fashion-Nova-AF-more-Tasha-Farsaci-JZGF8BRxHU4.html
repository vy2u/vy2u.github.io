female
Daniel insider is only cute like a
Christmas gift hey guys
so before you be mad at me for posting
another haul video after not posting a
video in like two weeks I have an
explanation in my last video I mentioned
that I've been going through some rough
things and I'm going to address them
right now so basically I just had my
spring break and I plan on filming a ton
of videos and it didn't happen because
right before spring break I actually got
rejected from my previous school I
didn't get into USC and I had like
totally planned on going there my whole
life and I didn't get in so I was really
upset about that for a few days so I got
over that eventually I'm going to Loyola
Marymount University instead so I'm
still going to be in LA but as soon as I
got away with that uh-huh few days ago
actually my boyfriend broke up with me
it really blindsided me it's artists
really couldn't make a video I'm still
pretty upset about it but there's
nothing I can really do and you know
because I'm kind of still like on the
edge of being okay I figured they'd go
home with you okay just to like get done
my um I have some things to show me you
sorry you guys don't mind if you follow
my ex I am so grandma right over please
don't like commenting things I'm sure
they're coming like anything about it I
don't think you guys would but like just
in case like just don't I don't want to
like to start anything anyways I'm sorry
about another haul but I'm gonna try and
like do more videos that aren't hauls so
please leave requests down below or if
you want any videos about like applying
to college just kind of like write down
stuff that you want to know and I could
probably like put together like a whole
like college application
yeah so the first thing I have things
from is called fashion Nova and I've
shown you guys and things for your
before and I have some new stuff so I
wanted to show you the first thing I
have I wore in an Instagram picture and
a lot of you liked it it's an off the
shoulder like cropped top thing it's
strapless but then you can see the
sleeves go down and it has a kind of its
kind of structure with you which is
really nice and then it's pretty crap as
you can see if I if you are like regular
jeans that are like a little high-rise
you can't tell at all and I don't know I
just think this is really cute next week
fashion Nova I got these really cute
flowy shorts and I love flowy shorts for
the summer because they're really
comfortable and airy and you don't like
chafing them and these ones look like
this they're really pretty they have
like a tropical kind of pattern and what
I liked about them is that they have
like a little bow here in the front that
has like a little layer so like as you
can see there's like two little flaps
right here and I just think it actually
makes your little touch and these are
gonna be really nice for the really hot
days I've been drunk or obsessed and
it's honestly gotten to the point where
I really can't buy anymore proper it's
like I'm going on right now I'll
probably show you this later on but like
I've gone romper crazy and the really
popular style of romper right now is
like the one I'm wearing it like crosses
in the front and then the sleeves flow
out so I have like two of those from
fashion coma so this one is a floral
print you can tell me I'm obsessed with
floral rompers like let's just not
address it oh I think it's Navy and it
has an orange and green on it and then
seems go round like this with eggs it's
really cute crochet on the bottom like I
hope that blue crochet and robbers in
floral so yeah anyways
it had like that like dip neck and with
this one and what I do is I take fabric
fabric tape to kind of like keep it up
because I don't have boobs at all so I
just kind of like flops around so that's
what I do with these styles I have do
you want round bruises to show you which
is kind of embarrassing but you know
whatever is so this one I love tie-dye
when it's done tastefully and I think
this one is it's not like you don't look
at it and think like your little sister
did it so it's it's really pretty teal
and like dark blue and if it goes like
this and how does this cute little
buckle in the front and the ruffle
continues on the back and there's
pockets in the front which is great it's
like I hate when I'm wearing a romper or
a dress and I need to like put something
somewhere and I don't have a pocket so
this is very cute but I don't from
fashion know but it's another floral on
board crochet let's just we're just not
going to talk about it okay and if maybe
once again but this one has pink flowers
and I think that's meant to be like worn
off the shoulder like this but I mean I
guess you can wear it but it's like the
scrunchie material or I'll probably wear
it off the shoulder the sleeves go down
once you get in there with like this
crochet except it's me me this time
April what's in with the shorts and yeah
that's about it I think it is no no it
doesn't have a tie it has a little tired
like the top from here but once again
and I'm obsessed I don't really know
what else to say it's very cute and I'm
excited to wear these like forever okay
so I brought you guys
I've been loving statement necklaces
lately they're just super cute with
everything and they add so much to an
outfit if you're wearing like a plain
shirt so I have to pin this really cute
website called happiness boutique so the
necklaces came in this cute little box
and Happiness boutique sick little logo
is a good show
and it's really cute they sent the
necklaces with two little piece of paper
and they wrote me a little note on the
back of this one and I just thought it
was a really cute touch so when you get
the necklaces they're in these cute
little bags in this one the first time
I'll show you is so beautiful like I was
wearing it in an Instagram picture and
they actually before I see my picture
which is like cool but it's so beautiful
so basically it looks like this and I'm
obsessed with the colors and I'm gonna
get closer so you can see so this is
what it looks like as you can see it's
like navy blue and maroon and white and
like black maybe I don't know I just
really love like the shape of it and I
just thought it was really interesting
and the colors were very very pretty and
I love this one and then the next and
last one I got it's just more like
you're not like me fit one but it goes
with everything it's just like a white
crystal color but it's also still super
super pretty so this one looks like this
and I'm gonna close there once again
okay so as you can see this one's just
more of like a crystal color but it's
really great because this goes with
literally everything like I could
probably wear with this if I really
wanted to but it's really pretty this
one could spice up like any outfit and
it's definitely like very classy I think
I'm gonna put the links to both of those
necklaces and Happiness boutique in the
downbar and I'm gonna try and link like
everything in this haul down below which
I always do because I find that super
helpful for you
so I absolutely loved those necklaces I
already won the first one I showed you
and I got comes up complex so yeah the
next place I have some things from its
she inside I haven't halt from living
too long and I have a few things to show
you first is this cream sweater and I
have it in the room and when I got it it
was a slit only on one side and I
thought it was like messed up so I write
it like got it sewn and then I ordered
it in cream and it was the same thing so
I guess these twitter's machine side are
only supposed to have a slit on one side
and I'm kind of confused on that because
I'm used to like sweaters having two
slits so I might sum up the other side
of this one as well just because I don't
know why I feel about like the one slit
oh yeah it's just a cream one I like
these because they're lightweight but
they're still like warm if you want to
layer so I thought I needed like a basic
clean one I also got a dress which
inside this one is floral again I can't
tell if it's black or new UV I think
it's black I mean it looks like this on
the front it has like flowers obviously
the sleeves do that same like flowy out
thing and they have like black crochet I
know you guys are probably sensing a
trend here but it's more like a shift
dress so it just kind of goes down and
then something cool about this dress is
the back I don't know if you can tell
but it has at these like a little oval
cut out things I got a costume she
inside that unfortunately doesn't fit me
so I'm not going to be trying this one
on for you it's a beautiful dress I just
don't have boobs and I'm not tall enough
for it so yeah it looks like this if I
can get the top situated it has like
cherry blossoms on it
yeah it's like a maxi dress as you can
see and it's really beautiful in the
back because it's completely open and it
just crosses if I could never show you
okay I see it officially like this in
the back and it's so pretty if I I just
don't fit in like the food section then
it's very long so I'm you know I could
get it like fitted I'm gonna see if I
want to do that or not but it's a really
pretty pattern and this Willett and it
looks so nice glass thank you she inside
I'm really excited about it's a jumpsuit
and I never knew how I felt about them
but this one is really cool because it
looks like a tank top and pants so it is
a jumpsuit but it looks like pants in
the shirt so it looks very big on I hold
it up but it has like drawstring so you
can tie it in and like pull it up so it
actually fits me and the top is just
like a navy blue like I said tank top
and then it goes into these pants that
are like tribally and blue and white and
like as you can see it it looks huge but
once you cinch the waist
I like pull it up so it's more of like a
drapey tank top and then the pants end
up being like a little bit cropped and
it's perfect I'm going to show you a few
things from Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch because
you guys might know I look through now I
mentioned it a few videos back but
actually this is from ever coming pitch
and they've been getting really cute
stuff lately which is one reason I
wanted to work there plus I turned 18 so
I can work there but this stuff is so
cute I know some people might not shop
there anymore because I think it's like
middle school but this stuff is adorable
now I literally want everything so I
definitely recommend checking it out
first is this romper I'm probably gonna
try it on through to but like you can
see it just looks like this and it's
like a really cool pattern and the
sleeves are really awesome so I really
like this and I got a lot of compliments
on this today so yeah
I got a dress that's really similar it's
like the same kind of style
except it's of dress and it's like
off-the-shoulder so I have that these
little straps here off the shoulder the
sleeves kind of flow out and then once
you go to the bottom of the dress it
looks like this so I really love this
dress and I've already worn it it's
great because you can wear with tights
or you can just wear it with sandals
last thing for Abercrombie infection is
this cropped crochet tank top and I
can't tell who's Navy or black
I think it's black but then I saw it
online who have said Navy but everyone
ever asked said black so you tell me it
looks like this it's crochet high
neckline I think black lace but I don't
know it's cropped the one thing about
this shirt is it so hard to get on and
off like what see I wasn't addressing
with one of my friends when I put it on
because I could not get it off like I am
not wearing this in a gym day and
someone's gonna have to help me pull it
off over my head because it's like
really tight but it's really cute and
I'm really excited to wear this with
like high-waisted shorts and stuff so
that's everything in this haul video
once again I'm really sorry for all the
politics click my channel it's just
dreaming for like Rahal's but like I
said that I've been going through a lot
I really am opening new video ideas so
once again please leave them in the
comments like that would be awesome to
me if you already following me on
instagram that would be awesome because
I love Instagram I love getting more
followers it's just awesome because I'm
freaking obsessed with Instagram so it's
busy Tasha I'm gonna put it up on the
screen and if you want to follow my
youtube twitter it's also if you see
