today I am doing a college day in the
life here at the University of Southern
California if you guys are new to my
channel please subscribe if you like
these types of college videos and feel
free to follow my socials namely
Instagram that's what I'm the most
active just gonna get that out of the
way before I do the whole video but yeah
that means so much to me for you guys to
follow me but today is a Thursday namely
the Thursday before spring break so I'm
really really excited for today to be
done because I'm really excited for
spring break I had my last midterm
before spring break yesterday so I'm
kind of just chillin today but I thought
it would film a day in the life for you
guys because I know you guys really like
these anyways I just got ready I did my
hair and makeup I will show you my
outfit and then I'm gonna go get lunch
at all four feet today I think it's like
chicken tenders or something not the
best for my Spring Break bond but it's
fine okay so for my top I'm wearing this
like strapless flannel not flannel just
plaid top I think this is from like
Chien or something I think it's really
really cute but it's super tight up here
like this barely fits me but yeah I
think it's really cute I like how it
lays and then I'm just wearing these
dark wash jeans from Topshop and then
these little slide on a platform shoes
from princess Polly okay guys and as I'm
looking at my bed right now I'm
remembering something that I need to
tell you guys okay so basically in the
beginning of the school year lull the
mattress company sent me a mattress
which was so so sweet of them by the way
this is not they're not paying me to say
any of this but yeah they said me a
veterus and I was gonna talk about it in
my room to her video but I never ended
up filming a room to her video because I
never really got my room how I really
really want it and wanted to like show
you guys it so I never filmed that so I
completely forgot to show you guys the
mattress and I feel so bad because
they're the sweetest people ever and
gave me this amazing mattress so I'm
gonna show you guys my mattress okay
guys here she is in all her glory it
looks so clean there's a little
hello logo but it's seriously so amazing
I'm gonna try and like sit down and tell
you guys about it more okay so I'm
currently sitting on my floor so you can
see my mattress so sorry if this
lighting is really weird but basically
this was the easiest thing ever all made
it so so easy when I was moving in I
didn't have my parents here to help me
or anything I had some movers help me
move in all of my stuff my other place
but I didn't have any help other than
that and I did this all by myself I
don't know if that seems impressive to
people but for me knowing myself this is
impressive
it just came in this box and I was able
to open the box dump out the mattress
put it on my bed frame and do all that
I'll buy myself it was so easy the
mattress looked great
straight out of the box yeah so it takes
24 to 48 hours to fully expand but like
I said right out of the box it was
amazing and I just think it looks so
nice I don't know I've never had a nice
mattress before and this is literally
like a luxury mattress they retail for
under a thousand which I know sounds
like a lot but for a really really nice
mattress that you're gonna use for a
long time I think it's an amazing deal
and if you are a student you know
looking to get your first mattress
I bought 1 million percent recommend
them it's so comfortable I've been
sleeping on it ever since I've had no
problems so yeah yeah so just a
disclaimer all technically is sponsoring
this video but they're not paying me
they just gave me this mattress and it's
awesome so I wanted to tell you yeah but
if you guys want to get $50 off I will
have a coupon and link in the
description so check it out click the
link it's a great thing I mean I feel
like a mattress is something no one
thinks of buying but you're gonna need
it so yeah thank you low and I'm sorry
it took me so long to put this in a
video I love the mattress it's such a
nice day outside
hi guys so I actually just got out of my
class orally my first class of the day
which normally it would be really
exciting except I have a class right
after it so now I'm just kind of like
sitting waiting to go to that class I am
sitting in the old Annenberg Building
which is the older communication school
building here it's not the cutest but
there's no one around so it's a good
spot for me to film I just have my
coffee bean iced latte and yeah all I
have left today is Spanish done with all
my exams right now so just chillin and
yeah not much else to say it's a
beautiful day out today
to go to Mexico down
now I'm just blabbing but
hey hey do yourself I'm Chevy where did
we come from we just came from just in
Spanish class I scream y'all Spring
Break j18 got some campus shots today
today is alright any last words
yes ring break is here I just came home
to a bunch of packages this is one of
them Express but I'm gonna put this
stuff in all halls so I'm not gonna show
you right now but I guess after I open
all this I'll show you my favorite thing
I have so many boxes in my room the
stuff over there is all stuff either for
a video or for Coachella this stuff I
don't even know what that stuff is but
yes so many boxes okay so I really like
everything I got from Express I'm
excited to show you guys that in a haul
video but my favorite thing I haven't
tried them on yet but this is what I was
most excited for and they look like
they're gonna be awesome or these eenz
red drive down the legs and then they
have like these distressed bottoms and
they have them in short sizes which is
perfect cuz I'm so short so I'm really
really excited about these I can't wait
to wear them with outfits I think this
would like a black tube top and some
white sneakers
would be so cute when you think the
lighting is good to film and then you
look okay so I'm back from class now I
changed my shirt just temporarily
because that thing was cutting off my
circulation let me tell you it's like so
cute but it's really really tight around
the elastic part but anyways like I said
I just unboxed some packages but now I
think I'm just gonna pick out the
bathing suits that I want to bring to
Spring Break and kind of start packing
up stuff for that because I leave really
early Saturday and I have plans
for some of tomorrow so I figured it'd
be fun to kind of show you guys the
bathing suits that I'm gonna bring in
this vlog I say where I'm going I'm
going down to put our by artists so I'm
gonna be there from Saturday to Thursday
and I know some of you guys said that
you're going as well so that'd be super
cool if you see me please say hi to me
I'm going with student City but yeah I'm
soup fiend so I'm bringing a lot and
yeah so I'm gonna pick some out and then
I guess I'll show you guys is this me
being excessive or me being prepared
okay look guys the way I see it is as a
youtuber slash Instagrammer
I don't even think I can call myself
that but like whatever I don't want to
be taking pictures in the same bathing
suits the whole time so you know what
I'm gonna bring options yeah so these
are pretty much my favorite suits that I
have currently I just got this one the
other day at a sample sale this one's
super fun the problem is so many of them
look so much better with a tan which I
do not have right now so hopefully I get
pretty tan there so I just got back from
dinner and this is what I'm watching in
my spare time
thank you John Marbles thank you hey
guys so it is quite a bit later now I
just kind of got ready for tonight it's
actually my really good friend here
Anna's birthday so we're just gonna go
out and celebrate a bit so I got ready I
literally don't like my outfit it was
one of those nights where I put on so
many different outfits I just feel like
really bloated and not cute in anything
so I put on the most basic going out
outfit I have it's literally a black
dress and a leather jacket and boots
like most basic up ever it's not that
exciting but I'll show you it anyway I'm
literally did not shave my legs I'm not
not really ready at all but okay so yeah
I'm wearing this black knit dress it's
from express it has something here you
can't really tell with just my AllSaints
lack leather jacket and then some black
booties from Steve Madden let me know
what your guys's go to going out outfit
