exciting video it's the moment you've
all been waiting for
I'm doing a college dorm room haul in
case you're new to my channel there's a
few things you should know first first
of all I'm going to be attending Loyola
Marymount University as a freshman
LMU is in Los Angeles California I am
from New York State so that means I'm
going to be traveling completely across
the country to go to college because of
that I did not buy all my dorm stuff
here it would be way too hard to pack it
all or ship it all the reason that I did
buy anything here instead of just buying
it all when I got out to California was
because there were things that I really
wanted and I didn't want them to sell
out and when I got there be stuck with
nothing so pretty much this is only like
half of the things for my dorm I really
didn't get any like organizational
things but I do still have a good amount
of stuff that I want to show you before
I go into the hole I'm literally going
to share a life hack with you you guys
are gonna love me I'm guessing with the
majority of people watching this video
or either going into college this year
or you will be going into college
eventually so this will honestly save
all of your lives part of the college
buying process is textbooks and
textbooks can be ridiculously expensive
and it's super annoying to fork out like
200 or 300 dollars for a textbook but
it's necessary like you need these books
for school so what are you gonna do okay
I found this website it's called slug
books calm it's kind of like
PriceGrabber calm or one of those
websites that will compare prices from
like all different websites all you have
to do is find the ISBN number it's like
on every textbook you can find it like
on the bookstores website or anything
like that and you search the book
through that number on slower books it
will literally find you the book for the
cheapest price that you can get it
anywhere this is how I'm going to get my
textbooks this is how I'm going to save
money on textbooks and I thought I would
let you guys know because I get says
kind of like part of the haul and I'm no
textbooks are really expensive and you
can save money on those to put into your
dorm room decor even if you did plan on
getting you books from the school
bookstore you might as well check it out
because you could save
possibly $100 in war on your books so I
definitely recommend checking out slug
books seriously guys like you will thank
me I'm gonna put the link in the
description okay the first thing I'm
gonna talk about is bedding because I
feel like that kind of sets the stage
for the whole room I am living a normal
dorm room with like one other roommate
and there's like a communal bathroom for
the floor so basically this is also a
life hack and how to save money so I was
looking at Urban Outfitters bedding
probably last year because Urban
Outfitters bedding is me reincarnated
into something that you plop on your bed
as you guys can probably tell about my
shirt my fest with like boho prints and
that is literally all open house for
bedding so last year's senior Europe
high school me I was looking at Rubin
Outfitters bedding and I found this
snooze set which basically comes with a
comforter sheets pillowcase and um like
a laundry bag and I fell in love with it
but you guys know Urban Outfitters is
pretty pricey so it was like $200 I was
like well that sucks
like it's so expensive so basically
probably like six months ago I got an
email from Urban Outfitters and it was a
common stuff on sale so I was like hey
you know I'm not look at the dorm
bedding because maybe I can pick up some
bedding for cheaper that I won't have to
spend like $200 when I'm going to
college so I looked and they had this
new set
I'm sale for I think like $80 instead of
$200 so I saved so much money if you
guys I'm going to college this year like
I am I definitely recommend doing this
when you are going to college because
you can get great deals just by buying
things on off seasons so this is what my
comfort it looks like it's like all
folded right now but basically it's like
a teal and a raspberry raspberry colored
like floral thing with some paisley like
borders and I'm in love with this this
is a longer than I it's the same pattern
just so you can kind of see it a little
bit better but it's really cute I'm in
love with it these are like my favorite
colors the sheets that I came with look
like this they just have this kind of
like I don't know filigree culo like
pattern on them from watching other
videos I realized I should probably get
another set of sheets I couldn't find
like the same braz berry color the same
teal color but I got like these this
like magenta color it looks okay with
the comforter I mean it's not perfect
but like it's not bad
and then last for betting I got this
super fuzzy raspberry colored like slow
blanket I have one of these for my bed
now and I absolutely love it so when I
saw they had like the perfect color I
had to get it and it's twin extra long
which is the right size for dorm beds
and I think this is from Bed Bath and
Beyond by the web and that's where like
the pink sheets were from as well my mom
also found me a mattress protector I'm
not really exciting at all but I figured
I'd show you okay next moving on to the
dorm decor
some storage like I said I didn't get a
lot I'm probably gonna be shipping this
stuff out or in one big box but other
than that I'm gonna be getting most of
my stuff there you guys probably know I
have a lot of clothes and it's really
giving me anxiety thinking about how I'm
going to limit myself with great clothes
but I had to get like organizers so
first thing I got I think I'm gonna use
this one for shoes it's basically this
hanging organizer this is some target
but as you can see it kind of just hangs
in the closet and I'm probably just
going to put like pairs of shoes up that
I plan on getting one of those like
white stackable cube things so my mom
and I just got some of these storage
cubes in like the teal color also from
Target and then kind of like the shoe
hanging one I got one for clothes so
sorry your physical arrow but as you can
see it's just bigger and that's I can
also put the cubes in here as well so
they're good for this as well as if I
get one of those white stacking things
but once again Vatican target was really
cheap I don't even know if I mentioned
it but I'm matching my colors to my
comforter so I'm getting like teal slash
aqua and then like raspberry pink I got
this Comfort cuff up garbage can I got a
garbage can from Target and looking back
this was really stupid of me to get this
because we're literally shipping it it's
kind of heavy but it was really cute and
I liked how it's not like really
see-through so like you can't steal your
garbage but it just looks nice like this
is a solid solid find and then I got
this little like I don't know what's
called a sewage protector or an
extension cord
I don't know I'm stupid I think this is
from Christmas tree shops I originally
wanted to get the felt hangers that make
your stuff not fall off but these were
so cheap at Target and they were the
right color so I was like okay maybe if
I want
all hangers I can get them but basically
like all of these hangers for two
dollars at Target so I got um two packs
of them just the raspberry color I
figured they were like the right color
so I might as well just pick these up
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond I got a laundry
hamper once again just cuz it was the
right color
honestly like I knew it'd be hard for me
to find some of these colors so when I
saw things in the right color I figured
I would just get them and we can ship
them so yeah it's just this laundry
hamper nothing really special but um
yeah like I said it's the right color as
far as storing my makeup goes I think
I'm gonna get most of that out in
California but I did pick this up from
BJ's Wholesale it's kind of like a
Costco if you don't have one near you
but pretty much it's like this makeup
organizer that you put like on a desk so
I think I'm going to put like my
everyday makeup in this and then just
put my pallets and things that I don't
use everyday and more of like an
organized shelving unit so here's what
this looks like I don't know if you can
tell but it's basically like clear and
stackable and it has a few drawers and
then on top it has little slots for like
eyeliner or lipstick I think this is
only like $10 so it was a very good deal
once again wouldn't a guide it if it
wasn't such a good deal because it's
kind of gonna be a hassle ship but I
know I'm going to use this it's going to
be great for makeup and just like stuff
but I want to get to quickly I got a
shower caddy from Target it's just this
teal one um nothing really special
because like I said I do share a
bathroom with my whole floor so I have
to walk to the bathroom and this is what
you put your shampoo and stuff in okay
from Costco I got this
vanity mirror light thingy and I have
one of these at home now and honestly
save my life if you don't have one of
these to do your makeup in you
definitely should get one it's basically
just a normal me on one side and then
it's like 10 times magnification yeah
ten times on the other side and it
lights up which is great because I know
in the mornings if I'm gonna do my
makeup and I have to get up early for
class I don't want to wake my makeup by
later turning all the white zones this
was only $15 at Costco like what this is
$50 anywhere else so go to Costco as far
as like wall decorations go I wasn't
going to
anything because once again it's hard to
bring there but I was just in New York
City and I went to Brandi and I saw this
sign and I know it doesn't even match my
color scheme at all but I love
sunflowers I feel like I'm pretty boho
so this sign was my life and I needed it
so yeah I got it okay it's the last few
things that I have on my wall I really
should have probably thought of it
before I made these if you guys follow
me on Instagram or snapchat which I'll
put my snap code hue if you want to add
me and my Instagram is fiercely talk
shop but basically I made these idea
wide them and I don't know how I'm gonna
pack them if you guys have any ideas let
me know so basically I made these little
letter floral things for a wall and mine
is the tea obviously for Tasha it
matches my color scheme as you would
know and then I also made one for my
roommate Danielle which is why it's a D
and this matches like her color scheme
as you see we both have the raspberry
color going on yeah so before you asked
me how to make these I actually learned
from another girl's tutorial here on
youtube her name's Katherine I believe
so I'm gonna link her tutorial down
below I did not like come up with these
on my own and I'm not gonna do a video
because hers is perfectly fine and it's
a great video to watch
anyways that's everything that I've done
for my dorm room so far maybe I'll do a
part two of this once I have the rest of
my stuff I do plan on doing a dorm room
tour once I'm all moved in and
everything so be on the lookout for that
I hope this video helped you out
inspired you to decorate your dorm rooms
I love you guys so much I can't believe
I leave for college in like less than
three weeks it's craziness thank you so
much for watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
