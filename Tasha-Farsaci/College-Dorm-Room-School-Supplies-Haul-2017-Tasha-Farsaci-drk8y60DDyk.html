today I have a very exciting a video for
you bias this is going to be a college
dorm room hall / a college school
supplies haul I got a big box in
society6 calm and it's kind of a mixture
of those two things like the you I would
push them together apologize at this
lighting is super weird I'm filming a
lot later in the day than normal so I
kind of put on a light but it's kind of
orange again so we will see if you guys
don't know what the 36 is I've done a
bunch of haul videos with them in the
past for a room soft dorm stuff whatever
I will link them all down below but
basically they're honestly one of my
favorite websites I love them so much
it's a website where artists submit
their designs and their drawings and
their photos and basically you can get
those designs on almost anything like
they have so many options they have
tapestries they have mugs they have
shirts they have blankets they have
pillows they have sat mats they have
towels they have so many things you can
get these patterns on so it's just a
really great way to kind of personalize
all of your items they're not the things
that everyone's going to have you know
like Target or bed doesn't beyond or
whatever
these are super really personal items
and every item that you get part of the
proceeds goes to the artist who created
the design so I really really well their
website and I got some amazing things
from them and I got a bunch of stuff
this time so I wanted to show you also
super quick if you guys aren't following
me on social media I will put my
Instagram on the screen and also my
other handle is down below if you guys
want to keep up with my life totally
check me out on there okay so a next
year I will not be living in a dorm I'm
going to living in a house so I always
have been really doing them all but it's
still my house for college I'm living in
a house with two other girls and I have
my own room so that's going to be great
we have obviously like a little living
room area so a lot of stuff I did get
was kind of for the living room area
okay so let's start off with the stuff
that's kind of for my room or my house
and they'll go into like the school
supply items okay so the first thing I
got you guys are probably gonna be like
Tasha what the hell
society6 is like Prince and they're
known for like prints and patterns and
designs and you literally got a plain
white blanket let me explain society6
has B softest blankets ever
I got a throw blanket from man and like
my last haul or something and it was so
amazingly soft and I really wanted a
white cream throw blanket for my bed
next year and they have a pattern that
was literally just white so I picked it
up because I know how the softer
blankets are if you can see this side is
super fluffy and fuzzy the inside and
then the other side is just like really
soft as well so I totally totally
totally recommend a blanket I have been
using this one on my bed in my current
apartment and my roommates dog Chester
loves that you always comes over and
laid on it so I totally recommend their
blankets they have them in a bunch of
different sizes okay I actually got
another throw blanket this one would be
for the couch in our living room and the
couch that came with the house is a
chocolatey brown color which probably
isn't you know when I would pick for a
house so I tried to pick items that
would match it so I chose this blanket
I'm not going to completely take it out
to do it's nice and folded but I will
put a picture on the screen of the
pattern it's basically this like pinky
motor Bowl pattern which I just thought
was really cool with higher pink and tan
and I thought it would go really nicely
with the couch so I picked this out and
it's super pretty and I know my
roommates I'm going to love it it's just
so soft so yeah I knew I had to get a
blanket for the couch okay I also got
pillows for the couch I'm going to try
and take them out I hope this was just a
really cool geometric pattern they look
like this so I thought these would look
really cute on our couch and you can get
the pillows in different sizes as well
you can also just get the covers without
the inserts
if you already have inserts so yeah I
just got two of these pillows for our
couch society6 recently started stocking
bath mat and once again this one is all
curl up but I will put a picture on the
screen of what it looks like I just
don't want to undo these because I have
to move on myself to my new house and I
just want to keep them as compact as I
can so it's about Matt this seems like
super nice and squishy and soft so I'm
really excited about this and I love
kind of making my bathroom to you as
well so this is a great sign okay I
thought I loved society6 in blankets but
I think my favorite thing to buy from
them is beach towel
that's not correct grammar our beach
towels I noticed was in a really like
dorm room home room decor stuff but you
could use this as a bath towel as well
they do in a bath towel so I got this
towel honestly they're so soft and
they're really really big I hate when
I'm laying out caning or whatever and my
towel is not as long as me that's not a
problem with these ones so I got this
awesome lease printed this tropical
looking beach towel I'll try to like
show you guys as much as I can but yeah
these are so soft I love them I use mine
all the time and I 1 million percent
recommend some other towels okay I got
two tapestries from them because I
didn't know which one I would want to
use in my room I thought that I would
kind of like hang them up once I
actually gained my room and figure it
out and then just use the other one as
like a beach blanket or something so the
first one is kind of your classic
medallion tapestry if I can delete any
I'll try to show you guys but if you
can't really tell I'll put a picture in
as well it's just these kind of like
muted colors I kind of want to have like
white bedding and then just have some
like cool and muted colors I have really
cute keel pillows with sirak so I kind
of want to reuse those next year so yeah
I got this one and then I also chose
this one I love like beachy vibe room my
room has like some picture of the ocean
in it this year and I kind of want to
keep that going next year so I also
picked out this tapestry
it just has like some some leaves on it
so yeah I will put in a photo of what
this one is going to look like as well
but yeah they have tapestries in
different sizes - I think I got these in
a size small I've gotten a large one
before and they are huge so yeah
definitely look like the dimensions and
stuff but let me know which one this
tapestry is you guys like better because
I have no idea what I'm gonna do with my
room okay the rest myself is kind of
like more school supply ship stuff
I don't know you'll see what I mean so
the first thing is
a laptop cover I love you so much I
actually have one right here I use this
one like every day it looks like this so
yeah I got this one as well
I love these they're super cute they
look great on your laptop and they're
like padded so your laptop stays
protected these are perfect for college
you're going to want one of these when
you're bringing your laptop your club
and everything so society6 have a really
cute one all I also threw in a tote bag
with my order so they do it a co bag in
the same geometric pattern that I wanted
the pillow of in and that I got that
laptop case in so this is super cute
it'll be great for the beach or you know
just carrying stuff around with okay I
got a bunch of notebooks from them
because I just think they're so cute and
you can never have too many notebooks if
you want to write down stuff for class
you want to write notes in it I like
keeping track of YouTube stuff in them
so I got a few to show you the first one
I think is so cute it said badass spades
club on it I love like a little font and
everything and then I just have some
Alliance pages so this is so cute the
next one this is the same pattern in
that second Kappa streets you can kind
of see a better here really like you
love this one okay you're going to see
this batter and later on in the hall but
it's this pug yin-yang oh my gosh I love
this pattern so much so I got sick this
is the same marble pattern as that throw
blanket for my living room so once again
here's a better look at that really
really pretty super on-trend love it and
then lastly this is obviously probably
my favorite one of my favorite prints on
the side a six I have a beach element I
had a phone case in this but I just took
it off my phone I have a ton of stuff in
this print so it looks like this it's
just a pomegranate print it's super cute
and vibrant I love it so much i OS a
compliment when I use stuff with this
print okay I have three mugs in them so
the first one is the same pod yin-yang
print the only thing is but like print
that kind of looks merged up here it's
barely noticeable so it's fine but just
like keep that in mind if you're going
to order this mug I don't know if it's
just like the design or whatever but
guys still super cute it's a ceramic mug
and then it has
the patterns are both sides fun back in
you guys love hugs the designer of this
design makes so many pug designs do you
guys have seen my other side is it
called
I'll obsessed with this one print with a
plug-in a flamingo I'll put on the
create it by the same artist I'm going
to wake them down below because they're
my favorite and they have the cutest pug
designs they have like French bulldogs
and stuff too
but seriously I love them so much and if
you love pugs as much as me you're going
to die when you see their designs so
yeah this one is just so cute I needed
it on a mug that's good to have like in
your apartment or your dorm or whatever
but I also got to travel mugs because I
like bringing coffee and tea and stuff
to class so these are the two I got this
one is that same Marbley print and then
this one is the pomegranate print that I
love so much as soon as it looks cute on
everything like I would get it on
everything so you like your travel mugs
these are the metal ones they also have
ceramic ones like that mug but I think
the metal ones are my favorite okay any
last item in this haul video is a phone
case I love society chooses phone cases
you're always on my phone this one is
the society6 as well and they're so
unique that's the best thing like I
handed a phone case that everyone has so
if you guys see me with a phone cake
it's probably from society6 there's soul
so so many options and they're all
really unique and I love them so this
one is in society six but the one lineup
this time it is actually kind of similar
to this
I definitely like palm leaf designs so I
got this one it's a really cute palm we
printed have some corally pink on it and
stuff so this is really cute and this
will all be going on my phone once I get
sick of this one but yeah their phone
pieces are so nice and they also have
ones that are more protective if you
like that because there's like a bunch
of different styles but this is the
style I like it's the finish and I feel
like it's the sweetest yeah but
everything in this haul video I hope you
