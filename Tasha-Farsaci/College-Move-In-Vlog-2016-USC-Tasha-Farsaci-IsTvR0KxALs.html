because I am doing my moving blog my
college moving blog take-two video for
you guys I did one of these last year so
I am going to link it down below but the
difference is last year I was a student
at Loyola Marymount University and this
year I transferred to USC I figured I'd
wear this hat for the sake the video
yeah I transferred to USC but I am a
spring admit I have videos kind of
talking about all of this stuff so I'm
going to link them down below but
anyways I am living in an apartment this
year I miss friggin MIT so I'm going to
Community College in the fall and then
taking USC class in the spring so I
decided to live in an apartment by USC
I'm not going to say which climb in but
if you are familiar with the area you'll
probably be able to guess but anyways I
actually have a single this year I'm so
excited except it does have two beds
because it's supposed to be a double but
I got it in a single so I think no turn
one until I catch thing and I also do
have my own bathroom I'm so lucky I'm so
excited
see I gotta get kinda half I can't speak
you're gonna kind of get to see me
moving in um I apologize if this is
scattered I don't know if you guys know
I've kind of been posting about it on my
social media but I do have a kidney
stone and I've been really really sick
but I decided to come out to LA and find
a doctor out here instead of delaying my
moving even longer than I had to so yeah
this is like kind of scattered and not
all in like one or two days it's because
I'm sick and I'm going to doctors
um but yeah and one more thing if you're
not subscribed to my channel please
subscribe and if you're not following me
on social media I'm gonna put them right
here as well as in the description box
and you can keep up with my college life
so yeah without further ado time to move
in okay so we just came into the room
and we kind of started unpacking some
stuff so basically I couldn't get the
other bed out of here because I am
living as like a single when I couldn't
get the other bed out so I'm just going
to turn that one into like a little
couch daybed kind of thing and then this
is going to be mine but yeah my stuff is
all over right now the closet is really
big it's really nice because like I said
it should be for two people but it's
just for me so yeah I haven't um
to anything yet and a lot of my stuff is
still in a storage unit year from last
year but then the bathroom is so nice
and big I'm so excited
have my own bathroom and yeah so
basically we're just gonna try and
unpack a little bit more and now I have
a doctor's appointment later for my
kidney stone so we're going to go to bat
and this is going to be like a few day
process it's not like all going to be
done today but yeah my view is super
nice and yeah super excited so it's
currently the next day and I'm in my
closet right now trying to organize all
my clothes so yeah it's not it's not
looking too grey right now I just got a
bunch of my stuff from the storage units
that I left here from last year so yeah
today's going to be like the main moving
day so this is a current situation not
looking not looking too promising but
okay guys so it's awhile later now it's
nighttime my parents left it's actually
like liveable enough that I can sleep
here tonight so I'm just going to give
you guys a little update if you hear
whining my suitemates have a dog so I'll
show you him after but I spawned like
close the door so he wouldn't like jump
up on my bed right now but yeah I have
this like a little corner I just put
some pictures up with a son child sign
Oh Chester stop whining I'll be out in a
minute
right now this is in shambles but I just
got this lamp today from Target I have
to just do stuff with this my bed
currently looks like this it'll probably
be changed my blankets sitting right
there this is going to be my makeup
vanity sort of things so I thought it
would be good here with like the natural
light I put my dreamcatcher there and
then like I said I'm gonna end up
turning this into like a couch kind of
thing because basically I couldn't take
the other bed out and I could have
pushed them together but I figured like
if people were coming over and just
wanna like hang out they didn't have to
sit with me in bed so there's that the
closet right now I don't know how well
you'll be able to see this but you know
it's looking it's looking better I ran
out of hangers so I have to get more of
those and then the bathrooms looking
better I got that cute little shower rug
thing and then I kind of filled these up
but yeah that's the update so far this
is like the longest meaningful hug ever
but I'm gonna go to the mall and buy
some more stuff especially for this
little bed tomorrow so yeah guys this is
Chester hey buddy hey he's really sad
because his mommy's left and he doesn't
know who I am yet he's so confused but
he loves being pet you just can't whine
so much buddy
yes so guys I'm really excited because
I've always wanted dog but now it's not
exactly my dog I don't have the
responsibilities but I still get to pet
him
so yes this is Chester mom okay so we
are back from the mall today I went to
the Del Amo mall by simon malls hi dad
and I got so much stuff so I'm really
excited and thank you to them for
letting me pick out some stuff you guys
will see I'll be doing some posts for
them soon but this is happening right
now
I made this bed into a couch and I
really like how it looks don't mind the
stuff on that and then I put some of my
lights up here I got this lamp and then
this bed is kind of coming along but
yeah this is still a mess so this is
like day three now so yeah hopefully
tomorrow it'll be mostly done but yeah
hey guys so sorry I have gone my mouth I
know people get annoyed with that but I
realize I haven't been showing my face
and like this entire vlog and if you're
new to my channel you're probably like
who is this person um but now my room is
pretty much how I want it to be I'm just
kind of trying to like tidy things up
and organize things but like all the
main things are in their spots so yeah I
guess I'll kind of show you one more
time so right now I'm just kind of
organizing this desk actually not really
organizing it just throwing stuff in it
um I got this really cute little
succulent thing I killed mine last year
so hopefully this one survives
I hung some things up I don't know if I
showed you this yesterday but yeah and
this bed is still looking nice and I
have some hooks with my backpack my
bathroom is starting to look better now
there's my shower I hung this little guy
up and put a candle there and then this
is the situation for this right now so
yeah I think it's coming together I have
some nice like robes there but I'm happy
with how it's looking now I'll probably
change a few things like this needs to
be organized but yeah here's the update
for today hopefully this moving vlog
only lasts for one more day but we shall
see
hey guys so I think I'm officially done
in my room I know this moving vlog has
been really choppy and probably not that
great it's just been really hard for me
because I haven't felt well and it's
just been like super fast paced moving
in but I think it's pretty much done
right now my mom stuff is kind of all
over the place because I don't know if I
mentioned this but I am having surgery
to remove my kidney stone in a few days
so she decided to wait and stay with me
for my surgery so I'm letting her stay
in my room never stopped my feet on some
tables but I will show you the finished
product for now and I will be doing a
more in-depth room tour so that will be
to come okay so this is the table that
has her stuff on it and her stuffs like
here but yes really cute this sorry if
that fans were loud but um I got it back
the door hanger on my backpack and stuff
on it um yeah I mean I don't really know
if I've changed that much but guys this
is my favorite I got this at the Melrose
Trading Post yesterday this little guy
and it's by geometric fossils so I'll
try and like link them down below but
I'm obsessed with it I think it looks so
cute on my desk but yeah that's my room
