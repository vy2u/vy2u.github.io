my channel I know you all probably
forgot Who I am at this point because I
haven't posted in like 12 years but I'm
alive I didn't leave you guys so today's
video is going to be an outfit of the
week for outfits for class okay so I
didn't film all of these outfits on the
same day I know I'm kind of cheating but
I swear these are all outfits that I
have worn and love wearing to class so
the fun part about this video is that
all these outfits are actually going to
include glasses like the ones that I'm
wearing here you guys are all probably
like Kasia what the heck you don't wear
glasses but being a youtuber and a
college student I am on my laptop and my
phone so often and sometimes it really
strains my eyes so I wear reading
glasses once in a while and I think
glasses and so much to an outfit they
make it look so cute so I was so happy
that glasses usa.com reached out to me
and wanted to collaborate on a video
because I wanted some cute glasses yeah
so thank you so much - glasses usa.com
for sponsoring this video before I into
showing you guys the outfits I do want
to tell you a little bit about glasses
USA okay so glasses USA comm is an
online website and they have over 2,500
different styles of glasses they also
carry sunglasses and they don't just
have their own brand like the ones I'm
wearing right now are their own brand
but they also have Ray Ban and Oakley
and a bunch of designer brands as well
their glasses are so affordable and they
have so many options if you guys are
looking for glasses I seriously
seriously recommend it okay something
about me is that I'm a really small head
so whenever I'm ordering sunglasses or
glasses online they always come in
they're way too big so glasses USA calm
has a super cool feature it's called the
virtual neo virtual mirror so basically
you upload a photo of yourself under
their website and then you can virtually
try on the glasses and it's so helpful
so this way I knew they weren't going to
be too big for my face when I got them
even but the best part is and they have
free shipping
returns so yes thank you glasses USA I
also have a super great offer for you
guys when you sign up for glasses USA
got column so I'm gonna put that in the
description totally go check it out okay
so now it's time to show you the outfits
okay so I think this is my favorite pair
of glasses
don't mind me modeling them I just think
they're so fun and cute they're kind of
big but I like the look of it so I'm
wearing them with this cool kind of
overall wrapper thingymajig and this
little gingham tube top I will be trying
to link all the clothing pieces down
below as well and I apologize if some
clips are blurry I didn't have anyone to
kind of see me filming them this is all
done on the tripod but I'm wearing my
platforms to progress with this outfit
they've been so my favorites lately and
I think it's just really cute overall
okay so I really want to try out the
clear glasses trend and I actually
really really like these ones I think
they're super fun so yeah here's a
close-up of my face you're welcome but
anyways yeah I wanted to try these out
with any kind of simple outfit I'm
wearing this denim jacket which is
actually my dad's in high school I love
it it needs like so much to me to women
so it's just like a vintage Levi's and
then I'm wearing it with this kind of
stone washed gray t-shirt dress just
super simple this is something I wear to
class all the time and then I'm just
wearing some vans old school vans and a
little choker necklace I just think it's
super cute and simple but just something
easy for class
okay this outfit is another one of my
classics
I love these tortoise glasses tortoise
glasses are like my favorite i love i
love them i feel like they go with
everything but anyways in this outfit
now please my face in this outfit I'm
wearing this really cool flannel I
thrifted it actually I took like all my
photos but I'm wearing it with some
black jeans and just some adidas
superstars I think glasses with outfits
like this just looks so fun and like
casual I don't know I'm really really
into it so I love this and I would wear
glasses with flannels every day if I
could I think it's so cute
okay you guys are always asking me to
show you more comfy outfits for class
because I do normally dress up for class
so this doesn't come for your outfit I
paired it with these plain black glasses
I think here's our classic that like
anyone could pull off but I'm wearing
this vintage USC crewneck I love it it's
my favorite ever it's so long so I could
literally wear like granny panties and
no one would know and I just heard it
with some black leggings from Lululemon
and my checkered vans which are like my
favorite things to wear with outfits
like this in the glasses of course I
think it just adds like a cute little
touch and this last outfit shows the
sunglasses I got from glasses USA they
are grey bands I want to be so so long I
love them so much I wear them all the
time to class just with a romper kind of
like this one or a dress and I think
it's perfect these are the best you
can't see your eyes so people don't
really know it's you or at least that's
what I tell myself so yeah I love this
outfit and I love these sunglasses
okay I actually have one more pair of
sunglasses from glasses USA that I do in
the show in the outfits because there
were only five outfits but I have
actually won these in an Instagram photo
I'll show you here and I think they're
so fun basically they are this cool
neutral colored sunglass sunglass
sunglasses but I think they're really
really fun they do a great job of
covering my eyes so if I'm not wearing
makeup you can't tell but I wear these
to the beach I think they're so cool and
they have them in a bunch of different
colors I'll have a name on the screen
and I'll have them obviously it linked
down below but yeah I really like these
