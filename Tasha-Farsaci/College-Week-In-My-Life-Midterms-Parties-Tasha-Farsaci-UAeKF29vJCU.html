today I am going to be filming a college
week in my life I haven't done one of
these in a hot minute so yeah I'm
filming another one today's actually
Tuesday we didn't have class yesterday
because it was Presidents a so anyways
if you guys are new to my channel I
attend USC the University of Southern
California and if you guys want to keep
up with my life more he was my Instagram
feel free to follow me a shameless plug
but feel free so I just got dressed my
outfit is not incredible but I'll show
you it in a minute and I'm about to get
lunch at all 50 my sorority so I'll
insert a photo of that here I think it's
grilled cheese today which like who
doesn't like grilled cheese my room is
incredibly messy but I'm just wearing
this gray thermal shirt from Free People
it definitely shrunk in the wash it used
to be like this long so I'm pretty upset
about that but I'm also wearing it with
this faux fur vest from evolve just some
leggings from Lululemon and then these
over the knee leather boots from ENSO
Angelini I think I got them from
Nordstrom Rack so yeah here's today's
outfit hi guys so I just got back in
class I know I'm literally in the same
spot as I was filming this intro I
didn't bill I didn't film on campus or
in class at all today I just didn't
really get a time to do that but I just
got back to my house I'm gonna go get
dinner and off a fee and I bet so I'm
sure I'll vlog some then but I did get a
few packages in the mail some of the
stuff I'm putting in a haul video so I'm
not gonna show you guys that yet but
there are two things that I got that I
didn't I'm not gonna put in a hall I
don't think so
I'm gonna show you guys those now the
first thing is this pair of jeans from
Shopbop these are the redone originals
and I got these because I have a pair
and just like a medium wash and I wear
them all the time in my favorite jeans
because they're not skin tight but
they're still skinny and I really like
them these are pretty expensive but for
as much as I wear them and I really like
the fit of them I think it's worth it
and then this is actually more of like a
wild piece basically I saw the youtuber
Nataly Barbu got this from forever 21
and I thought it was so awesome but I
couldn't find it anywhere this is
definitely a dupe of a jacket by the
brand mother I'll put it in here but
this jacket cost like almost $400 and
this one it was sold out on forever 21
but I found it on eBay
so I think it's super cool it's this
faux for a bomber cheetah print has
normal sleeves it's definitely a
statement piece but I think it will look
really really cool styled so yeah it is
so cool today it's like 50 degrees out
and I bring this like huge jacket
because we're freezing and it's salmon
tonight at alfea so we're gonna eat a
lot Roger how was your day
my day was okay midterm today I haven't
been term in one day morning guys
use the real clip of the day um I just
woke up it's around 8:20 right now I
have a group presentation at 10:00
my class is at 10:00 so I'm just trying
to like get up and get somewhat
presentable but it's so hard I don't
want to get up and then I'm just
thinking like I have class until 2:00
but I have a mid-term tomorrow but I
just haven't studied for at all yet
mainly because I don't like studying too
early because I forget a lot of things
but um also I just haven't gotten around
to it so I need to do that after so
today's not gonna be the best okay guys
so my room is a mess
nothing new here but I just wanted to
show you my outfit I'm wearing this
super cool tank from princess Polly it
like wraps around the front when I'm
going out I normally unbutton too but
for class ones on buttoned and then I'm
wearing these awesome jeans I just got
from the LF sale they have like zippers
here that you can zip and unzip and they
actually are normally have another layer
but because I'm so short I totally just
zipped off the bottom layer and now
they're like ankle jeans but yeah I
think they're super cool and they're
just like really nice quality denim and
then I'm wearing these bad boys and then
because it's not super warm out I'm also
just going to bring this flannel that I
got from Urban Outfitters
sirens okay
I was just debating as to whether or not
I should make breakfast here or go to
Starbucks and I'm so bought her because
I just started going to Starbucks more
this year I have like the whole
Starbucks account and I was there like a
Goldmember and all this stuff and I kind
of just stopped doing that and I
restarted it back up so I remembered
that Starbucks gives you birthday drinks
and my birthday was over the weekend and
I remember it used to be how you would
get a birthday reward and you could use
it whenever you wanted like it didn't
expire and so I got one on my birthday
and then it's gone now
and I looked it up and apparently now
you can either have your reward like a
day or two before your birthday and then
it expires the day after your birthday
which like I didn't know and I would
have used it so now I don't have a free
drink at Starbucks I'm just gonna make
breakfast here or whatnot but yeah I
think that's super annoying let me know
if you guys think that's annoying as
well also I ran out of my eyebrow pencil
today my mascara looks like trash I like
having no mascara laughs I was using
like an old one it doesn't look good so
I did take my makeup later it slightly
burnt but it's fine
hi guys so I just got home I apologized
so much for not blogging on campus at
all so far this week it's just been
really hectic and today I rode my bike
so I couldn't vlog while biking
basically I only have a really a small
chunk of time in between my two classes
today
and normally I don't try and go and get
lunch at alpha feet and I just eat
something at home after him which would
be now but I was so hungry too so I
biked qlv ate lunch for like 10 minutes
and then biked back and made it to my
next class but I ate that and now I'm
back from class and I kind of I'm still
hungry so I have leftover pizza in the
fridge so I'm gonna heat that up and
then I think I'm gonna go back to campus
and start studying because I have a
mid-term tomorrow okay guys a few things
first of all this ice cream oh as I
dropped the spoon is the best ice cream
in the world you can only get it at
Target I think but you need to try it
ASAP it's chocolate with peanut butter
and then like Oreo cookie crumbs kind of
it's
or try this but also something else this
is the stuff I'm doing before I'm gonna
study but this bathing suit I think my
friend's bathing suit was hanging over
top of it when it was wet and I think
the dive from her dripped onto mine
which is not good because this is not a
cheap bathing suit at all and I
literally was wearing it for the first
time I definitely think this is some
sort of dye on it and I don't know how
to get it out this was all they had at
Target and you're me so I just kind of
sprayed it on here and I'm gonna leave
it overnight and then try and wash it
but I just really don't know if that's
gonna work so please let me know because
this bathing suit is not cheap and it
would not like it to be stained hi guys
so I'm currently vlogging while walking
I am walking to a place that I've been
studying lately
basically a USC turned one of their old
dining halls into a Starbucks and they
put like a bunch of tables and stuff in
there and it's pretty close to where I
live so I'm headed there now and I'll
try and show you it when I'm there but
it's just like a cool environment
there's not really many outlets which
kind of stinks but yeah
when we're both little black sheep
I know literally like me we look like we
have no curves like Lois lumps it's old
it's the tundra right now and it's so
weird cuz it's like 80 in New York today
yeah it's like it's cold in Denver but
at least it's snowing like it's not like
good morning guys happy Thursday this
week went by so fast obviously because I
had a long weekend anyway but today I
have my midterm so I woke up a little
earlier barely got ready I'm literally
just when it's like vintage crewneck and
some leggings and then my hair I just
put up in a bun um also my makeup looks
bracket this morning
I had one of those days where I couldn't
get my eyebrows even so I just kept like
adding more and adding more and then
they would look worse I try to wipe them
off and then like I got mascara all over
my face like just not a good day so I'm
gonna end up looking better later today
because I'm going to a pixie YouTube
event sort of thing I'm gonna bring
anne-marie's so that should be fine but
for now I'm just gonna go over to Alfea
and study before my midterm and then eat
lunch there because it's chilly today
and I love their chili so much it's so
good so yeah hopefully the midterm goes
okay it's one of those classes where the
professor's just don't teach the
material and you're expected to like
teach yourself and I just don't
understand that because for me it's like
your professor we don't have like a
breakout session with a TA after to like
explain stuff more like you should
really teach us yeah no she doesn't
so I'm teaching myself hopefully it goes
okay there's today's super trendy look
by the way guys these are like my new
favorite sunglasses I'm wearing them
like every single day so I'll lengthy is
down below
but they cover my face when I don't be
able to see my uneven eyebrows
hi guys so it is a long while later now
basically I finished in my classes hate
some dinner came back here and I just
got ready I told you guys I am attending
a pixie of UE party tonight so I got
ready I'll have like Anne Marie show you
my outfit or something in a bit but yeah
I'm thinking in Marie as my plus-one so
I just got ready I really don't know to
expect from this but yeah I thought why
not I thought it would be fun so yeah I
got ready and then a Marie's getting
ready and then we are headed out I think
this is in like Beverly Hills so yeah so
this princess Polly this is from urban
this is from almost Saints and the shoes
are princess Polly
and there's trouble cries I need to eat
some we got some really really good
drink
and it's so cute in here
hi even the bathroom is so cute cat
toilet though dentine is here I don't I
feel really bad I don't know anything I
don't and I was so close to get it I was
like so close to working up the courage
to asking for a photo and then topically
she's looking at me looking at her and
I'm like I want to do the right angle
because my dream is like whenever I'm
going to take a photo someday with like
Brody Jenner or some celebrity I'm
obsessed with I want someone to take one
photo and have it be like spot-on you
know that's like a magic actually very
imagine if you've got a horrible photo
with your camera hi guys so we just got
back from the pixie that it was so fun
I'm so happy we got to go but I was just
seeing my blog camera I'm using the
canon g7x and it lately it's been
flipping it's my video like I'm looking
in R and I are both filming right now
and it's flipping so much more normal it
just lifts it horizontally and I look
really ugly this way well showing your
eyes not used to this so it's hard yeah
and I'm like I can just flip it when I'm
editing but if you guys know how to fix
this let me know anyways we got a gift
bag I got a gift bag so I thought we'd
unbox them it's just that I think it's
just the UM they were launching all the

sunny so I thought it would be fine but
