know you guys like vlogs so I'm going to
Melanie my friend Nani's lake house I
did have logged there last summer so if
you watched that and you were subscribed
then let me know in the comments yes
oh gee viewer is here so yeah her camps
on Lake Ontario everyone like a lot of
people in New York State or upstate New
York where I live have lake houses I
don't but it's pretty common so I'm
going there and you know you guys can
probably guess where I am right now if
you watched my previous vlog okay I
can't like hold it right there um
anyways yeah I am at McDonald's I got my
medium a caramel iced coffee because
like I said it's the best coffee on the
planet and I have an iced coffee
obsession and that's only like a dollar
ninety I think so go and McDonald's get
your medium a caramel iced coffee um
we're taking some pictures today that's
why I look not like a homeless person my
sunglasses are new a lot of you guys
were asking the style their ray band
around flack and then the lenses are
copper flash so yeah there's that
anyways I am going to drive there
because I'm already late I think we're
just hanging out maybe getting some
breakfast and stuff but yeah I like
doing vlogs I know Mel likes being in
vlogs and she's funny so yes I will
update you whatever okay so we made it
and Mel's like setting up for her grad
party so I want her to show you all the
cute stuff she made so we have these
Snapple bottles with like birla wrapped
around it did I pass of 2016 but yeah
and you're going to Syracuse yeah that's
why I'm not wearing yellow and then like
for the tables like we have like what
are they called like white table cause
with like burlap runners so it's a nice
super cute
really though okay guys so it's time to
address our dating rumors so as you know
it's time to confirm them oh yes
so as you know I went to senior prom
slash ball with this one much to you
dismay it's not because we're dating
there was the last-minute date
cancellation so I swooped in I post a
lot of photos on Instagram event you
know insert some here one I think I
captioned like you date pick something
along those lines and someone commented
asking something like oh I didn't know
you were into girls I'm not there's
nothing wrong if you are but I figured I
would address I would address this um
yeah we're not dating
I'm sorry yeah I know I mean like yeah
so sorry guys uh yeah this year yeah not
not yet maybe maybe it appears we came
to lunch
okay Alec hardy books and I think I'm
gonna go
so I'll show you ain't when it come okay
so I got the pasta with like chicken on
top and that's so good I got chicken
every Mel was having some issues at the
restaurant wait TBT the last bog and
we're sitting here and I showed everyone
my spider bite
oh my gosh I'm totally gonna link the
vlog from here last year down below yeah
so basically like the waiter kept
messing up the charges and then Mel saw
the charges like on your bank statement
or like right online on the app and then
they were insisting that they didn't
charge and like it was basically the
 show yeah now I have to felt like a
fraud report it's drugs but I got nice
coffee so all is good this is my second
of the day
I got a nice hazelnut latte with soy
milk
hey guys so I'm back from the lake house
now I actually didn't really vlog a lot
I thought I would end up vlogging a lot
more but you know it's whatever so right
now I'm like about to go to the gym I've
been trying to go to the gym a lot
actually I got a summer membership only
so I've been trying to get my money's
worth of it and a lot of you guys are
probably gonna ask for a diet or fitness
routine and I really don't have a diet
like I I mean I I try to eat healthy but
I'm not a health freak but any means you
know I eat what I want to eat um but in
terms of the gym what I like to do is
the Stairmaster I do that around like 75
steps a minute for about a half hour and
if I'm feeling pretty good I might go
for like 40 45 minutes so I do that a
lot that really like tones my legs and
butt and then I like to do cardio or not
cardio abs for a little bit because
that's like something I'm really trying
to work on is like my abs and then I'll
normally like walk on the treadmill like
at the highest incline for like 10
minutes and that's pretty much it
nothing like super crazy but yeah I've
been going a lot more and I know you
guys would probably ask but maybe I'll
film a little bit a little at the gym I
don't know it's funny cuz the gym I go
to now is brand new and it's like really
close to my house so pretty much every
single person for my high school goes
there and it's almost impossible to go
there and not see someone that I know
so yeah it's interesting it's like
awkward - if you guys were in college or
in college you know like coming home
from college and seeing people from high
school that you like weren't really
friends with but you guys know each
other it's like super awkward but yep so
I'm on to the gym now maybe I'll blog
there we shall see hey guys so I'm back
from the gym now I'm back home cuz I
wanted like lighting to be able to talk
to you so you guys know how before the
gym I was like oh I bet I'm gonna see
someone I know so funny story back in
the Stone Age what's reversed back over
two years ago when I was just starting
to talk
to my now ex-boyfriend we're not dating
anymore
clearly so I was just starting to talk
to him we were not exclusive we were not
dating we were just kind of like texting
you know whatever and I was also talking
to another guy we can call this other
guy Chris so yeah I was basically a
savage like texting two guys at once
waiting to see which one would pan out I
guess so I figured that out what I
figured out that I liked my ex my now ex
more than Chris because Chris would
always blow me off we'd never want
anything out we're just just really
immature
so I basically told Chris hey sorry I
like another guy more and I ended up
dating the other guy for a year so that
ended last April so over a year ago and
now that I've gotten home for the summer
Chris has been like hitting me up and
like trying to get me to hang out but
not really being like oh like we should
hang out this summer and I'm like okay
like sure I'm down to hang out like
whenever you want to ask me to hang out
like go ahead and I know he's not going
to because he's just one of those guys
but I don't know if he's nervous around
girls or what like but he's just not
gonna ask me so basically here's at the
gym and I like saw him out of the corner
of my eye but I wasn't gonna say
anything because I know he's a little
wimp and like I wanted to see if he
would actually grow up and be able to
say something to me yeah basically he
did not I know he saw me but yeah I just
thought that was funny and I also happen
to see like half of the boys in my
senior graduating class while I was
doing cool but that's fine they're
really nice guys but yeah I just was
funny so I guess that's Karma for me
being a savage and talking to like two
guys at once so yeah just thought I'd
show that little tidbit with you guys
I'm gonna go shower now because I'm
pretty disgusting hey guys so I just
realized that I never ended off the vlog
from yesterday
it's the next day now but yeah I just
want to like take this time to say this
is the end of the vlog if you guys like
vlogs once again let me know in the
comments and give this a thumbs up so I
know that you like them and I will do
more yeah so thanks so much for watching
and see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
