exciting video for you I am doing a DIY
video which I don't know if I've ever
done before I might have but um I just
came up with this because I've really
been wanting a shirt like this so
basically it's a hamsa kind of like
symbol and I know that's a religious
symbol I don't personally practice that
religion I just like the symbol I think
it's really cool hey it's really popular
now they have a lot of a door open
outfitters and brandy melville and
places like that so you know I just
think it's cool that's what i wanted it
um if you're not into that I'm sorry but
if you don't know what it looks like
i'll put in a picture of them right here
so yeah that's what those look like I
just think they're really cool looking I
really like how they look so I've been
wanting a with one on it for
forever and I decided why not try and
make one of myself so I did and this is
what I came up with here's a better look
at what it looks like I mean obviously
it's not perfect but I mean I think it's
kind of cute i put some blue in there
and just some fancy shmancy ness and
then it's kind of cut on the sides and
crop and stuff and yeah so all you need
for this tutorial is a t-shirt a plain
t-shirt you can get them anywhere really
walmart has them and then I know like
craft stores like a seam or or you know
craft stores they have plain t-shirts
like that and they're really cheap
they're probably like anywhere from two
to five dollars nefse not any more than
that but it doesn't really matter what
color you get i have like a heather gray
color here it's probably not my favorite
color it's just what i had lying around
my house but I think black would be
really really cool personally um you
know whatever you want and you're also
going to be puffy paint I call it puffy
paint I don't know if that's what it's
really called but they look like this
and it's watching only decorate short
shirts for if you're doing your flight I
don't know I've always decorated church
with this stuff but this is what it
looks like you can get it at your craft
store once again and I just have it in a
black and a light blue color that's what
I used on this shirt but you know you
get whatever colors you want and these
are really really affordable so that's
all you need to make this show once
again this is what it looks like I'm
going to cut to a clip of me wearing
this just so you kind of get a better
idea of what it looks like and at the
end I've also gonna include a little
giveaway so you know stay tuned for that
so yeah keep watchin
so I'm taking my t-shirt and cutting off
the sleeves about an inch from the seam
and going kind of far down to get the
muscle tank time of look and then I'm
cutting a few inches off the bottom just
so it's a little shorter and craft
looking taking a textbook slip it under
your shirt just to give yourself a hard
surface to work on find an image to go
off of I'm using this one from Urban
Outfitters
okay i meant to fill me sketching this
but when i looked it didn't record so i
basically just sketched the basis of the
hand I did the fingers and palm and
little I in the middle
so now I'm just taking my paint and
going over the pencil lines that I've
already drawn
okay so using the image that you decided
to kind of get inspiration from as well
as your own creativity just start adding
things to your drawing as you can see I
kind of added some black outlining to
the outside fingers that's just because
mine want even I wanted to even them out
but I kind of like how it looks I also
added some black around the eye and now
I'm adding some time of things that kind
of like fingernails but you know
whatever you can do whatever you want
because that's what makes yours unique
ok so now taking my blue color I'm just
adding a few more details to the shirt
just because I feel like it needed
another color you don't have to do this
it's completely optional and you can use
so many clothes as you want you know if
you want to use more than two but I just
liked this nice blue color with the
black in the grave and I'm just kind of
improvising whatever I did here I didn't
really know what I was going to do but I
just kind of went with it and that's
really what you want to do because you
want your shirt to look unique
okay so now that I finish this shirt
this is what it looks like i'll give you
a close-up view right here so i think
it's pretty cool I mean obviously it's
not perfect or anything but I just think
it's a really cool idea especially
because I made it myself and no one's
gonna have the same one but um I
actually decided that I'll give this
away to one of you guys just because I
don't know I mean I don't know if any of
you will even want it but if you do just
leave a regular comment down below if
you'd normally comment and then at the
end of it say enter me don't just
comment and to me because that gets
spammed my video could be taken down
plus that's just boring so just give me
a normal comment you can comment
whatever you want and then just say em
to me at the end and I'll pick a winner
if you want this and this should fit
most people it's not skin tight or
anything so yeah it's actually a youth
large but it's like caught in stuff so
this should fit most people and I mean
if you guys don't want it I understand
but I figured I'd just give it away so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video if
you make one please either tweet it to
me I post a picture on instagram and tag
me um my Twitter and my Instagram are
both just apt fiercelytasha just like my
username so if you do it please let me
know because I think that'd be so
awesome but yeah so I hope you guys
