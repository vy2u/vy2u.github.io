announcement video hopefully it's
exciting for some of you as you guys
know I am a shopaholic and being a
shopaholic you buy a lot of stuff and
your style changes super quickly and
before you know it you have a lot of
stuff that is not your style anymore and
it ends up just sitting in your closet
collecting dust so I have a lot of these
pieces and normally I just called like
plato's closet or something like that
and tell them but I was thinking that
you guys like my clothes and maybe some
of you would like my clothes so I tweet
it out on my Twitter which is fierce
etosha by the way and i asked you guys
if you'd be interested in buy my clothes
really discounted and a ton of you said
yes so that's what I decided to do i
made an ebay account because i figured
that everyone kind of knows ebay they're
familiar with ebay and even if you
haven't used it before you heard of it
and i put up a ton of my clothes and
like purses and that kind of stuff that
I just don't wear anymore I priced
everything super discounted they out of
what i bought it for so it should be
mostly everything under twenty dollars i
have brands like urban outfitters brandy
melville forever 21 packs on all my
favorite brand but you guys probably
like as well and it's really easy to buy
things on ebay i'm pretty sure you need
a paypal account but if you don't have
all your parents probably do and it's
really easy to sign up for paypal and
ebay is just really easy to buy from so
yes my ebay username is to see Tasha
because I thought there would be easy
since that's like my username for
everything and I'm gonna also just put
the link below because I know that's a
lot easier than searching it sometimes
shipping is five dollars which I wanted
to make it cheaper but my dad made me do
it for five because if you live on the
opposite side of the country for me it
would probably even be more than five so
I figure if I was a good number
especially because lots of websites
shippings like eight or nine dollar
unfortunately i am not currently
shipping internationally it still
in the United States but if this is
successful I might switch to
international next time so if you're
interested in maybe buying my clothes
are just checking out what i'm having
for sale definitely check the link down
below so i love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
