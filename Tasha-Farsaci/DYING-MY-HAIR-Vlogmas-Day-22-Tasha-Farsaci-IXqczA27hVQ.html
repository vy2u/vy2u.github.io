could be wrong a happy blowout miss I'm
about to go get my hair done
it looks really really bad so that's
exciting
um I think I said this in my yesterday's
vlog but ideally I was going to wait
until the end of break to get it done
but my hairdresser was completely booked
so I was lucky that I was able to get in
today so I get my hair done in skinny
Alice it's like 35 minutes from where I
live it's a really cute little town so
I'll bring you there mmm
and the name of the salon I go to you is
arabela's I believe so yeah
I'm wearing this thing I also got from
she in and this will be in the hall I'm
gonna try and fill in the hall when I
get back from my hair appointment so
yeah came to Panera
this little beanie just came in the mail
from love your melon which is a great
cause you guys should totally look into
it but I just think it's so cute I love
the color I love the golden black very
exciting don't change in the back
because like I'll get taken down for
child pornography okay hey guys so it's
a lot later now I like got my hair done
it doesn't look as light as I wand it
never I always that's quick cool tone
and it never turns out cool tone but it
does look a lot better than I did so god
bless
anyways I'm at Mel's house now cuz I'm
going to the Syracuse basketball game
with her new boyfriend I'm
third-wheeling was like oh but look at
bar this really really cute sweater from
her it's so cute like look how soft this
is okay you can't see you I kind of want
to buy this for myself but I'm just
wanting out with like black jeans and
ideas and yeah sports
okay hello guys so we got that from the
game basically they lost it was not a
good game and we try to get pizza at two
separate places and they're both clothes
possibly sets then we just came back to
Mel's house and I ate like a million
cookies and she made me some nice toast
I'm probably still gonna eat more when I
go home we watched the weirdest movie
what was it superstar if you guys have
seen that movie a comment down below I
wish to likes assuming white chicks know
that was something else like okay
comment on below if you've seen that it
just kept getting like increasingly
strange yeah just just really weird yeah
I feel like I didn't get a lot on
vlogmas today and I still have not
posted my bonus from yesterday so I
think I'm post to tomorrow
I just think didn't have time to I
didn't have time to edit it today
because I'm just so busy
um yeah this is my hair I guess it
definitely looks a lot better it looked
really bad but yeah everyone follow me
on instagram at mouth feeds I got you
girl
okay mm-hmm
hey guys so I'm home now don't mind all
the coffee sitting there that's kind of
embarrassing um anyways so I just got
home I put on this a really fuzzy
sweater coat thing that I got from she
in it will be you know haul anyways I'm
really salty because when I got home
from my hair appointment today I filmed
a haul video as quickly as I could
because the Sun was going down and it's
already always dark here anyway because
it's never sunny and it started getting
really really dark toward the end but I
thought that the lighting was okay and
then I just like imported it all in my
computer and it's so grainy at the end
because it was so dark like the second
half is just like rainy and bad so
basically I'm just gonna read film the
entire thing tomorrow it was a long haul
so that kind of
but I would rather have the lighting be
good you know so yeah this isn't it yeah
that's sad so anyways I went to the game
with melon and boyfriend Tom you like
saw him briefly it was fun I didn't vlog
a lot yeah I think I like showed you
most of it I don't know if I got a lot
of footage today hopefully it wasn't too
boring I just edited the vlog from
yesterday I think I'm gonna post to
tomorrow because I just didn't get
around to posting it today and I don't
want to post it at like 1 a.m. so I
think I'll probably post it tomorrow
morning and then I'll post this one
tomorrow afternoon / evening so yeah
hopefully that works out I think I'm
gonna end the vlog here unless anything
else substantial happens but I don't
think it will so thank you guys so much
for watching
I can't believe vlogmas is coming to a
close it's crazy
but yeah okay bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
