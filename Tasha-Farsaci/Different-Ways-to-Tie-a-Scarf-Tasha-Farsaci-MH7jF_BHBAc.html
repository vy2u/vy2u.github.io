doing a video on how to tie different
types of scarves or different ways to
tie them I have two scarves today one of
them is just like your average scarf and
the other one is a square scarf because
that's like my new favorite kind of
scarf so I figured I would show you a
way to tie those as well and yeah I did
one of these videos a while back but I
delete a lot of my old videos and kind
of a film them just so you know now that
they're I'm better quality and also that
I'm not so awkward so yeah I'm gonna get
right into it this I know there are lots
more ways to tie scarves but these are
just my favorite ways and I could
probably come up with a lot more but I
don't personally love them so these are
just the ways that I've seen people most
often or that you know I like to do so
yeah here we go okay so I'm gonna switch
back to you so you can kind of see
things better I'm just using this long
kind of plaid scarf I figured this is
kind of like a universal length in shape
and I put on a black shirt for this
video just so I'm kind of matched and
you wouldn't get all distracted but
basically this is just so I kind of like
your average scarf length
so the first way I'm going to do is my
favorite way to wear scarves like this
so what you do is take your scarf and
you're gonna separate it so it's like
even you know and you're gonna put the
center on your neck so it looks like you
have to tow for yourself but you're not
and then you're gonna fling the little
tails behind you and cross them cross
them and then bring them to the front
and now I look like really sexy um but
I'm just gonna pull my hair out and then
I'm gonna loosen this one little loop
and then it's kind of just like this
nice symmetrical kind of thing I'm a
huge symmetrical person with my scarves
so this way I think is really cute and I
think it looks really nice and yeah if
your scarfs long go you could do the
loop up a few more times but I
personally just like the one loop and
yeah I really like this
okay so the next method is my favorite
for when I'm wearing scarves for warmth
because I usually do that first method
where I'm wearing them just to like look
cute but this one is when I'm actually
like really cold and I'm like bundling
up because this like really helps my
next day warm so what you're gonna do is
fold your scarf in half just so it's
even completely folded in half with like
a loop at the top you're gonna evenly
put it behind your neck open the loop
and pull the little tail ends through
the loop
this one's really popular um you
probably already know how to do it but
this one really hugs your neck and it
keeps it really really warm up here and
then it just kind of like flares out
nicely at the bottom and I think this is
really really easy and it's super warm
and I really love this way as well
okay so this next way is not my personal
favorite but some people might like it
so you're just gonna take your scarf
make it even put it around the back your
neck and then you're just going to knot
it so basically you're just gonna take
it and do your normal double knot thing
you know however you tie your knots and
then you're just gonna tighten it pull
your head out and then you have like
this kind of knot look I mean it's not
terrible it's just I don't love it
yeah it's okay I just don't think it's
as cute as the other ways but it's still
pretty cute and it's different because
not a ton people do this way
okay so the next method I have works
better on longer scarves like I'm
probably gonna look really silly doing
it on this scarf because but if you have
like a really long scarf this will
definitely work you guys probably know
that the infinity scarf trend is like
really big right now just like the
circle scarves and you wrap them around
a few times but if you don't have one of
those you can make one out of the
irregular scarves on but once again
you're probably gonna want them to be
longer my mom's actually wearing my
really long scarf right now so I
couldn't use it for this video but
anyways all you're gonna do is take your
two ends of your scarf and tie them
together and you know you're just going
to tie them into a knot like so and this
is gonna look kind of funny I mean you
could tuck your ends in and stuff but
yeah anyways you're gonna put that to
the back of your neck and now you've got
like this necklace thing so you know if
you like this good for you but anyways
you're just gonna twist it until like a
little figure eight and put it back
around your head okay so then you're
just gonna kind of pull these and as you
can see it makes it infinity scarf thing
you can probably tell what I mean about
the scarf being too small like if you
have a bigger scarf it'll be bigger and
it'll go down farther this is just kind
of an awkward looking but um
it still works I mean I would just
suggest longer the bigger scarves for
this but you get the gist of what I'm
doing and I think this is a really cool
way if you kind of want an infinity
scarf but you don't have one
okay so the final way that I have to
show you today is with a square scarf
and if you don't know what that is it's
just what it sounds like it's a scarf
that is a square and they're usually
pretty big this is one of mine into my
favorite scarves they're really popular
right now especially for the spring
because they're usually used for just
like style and not necessarily month but
these can be worn lots of ways I'm just
going to show you at the favorite way
that I like to wear them so basically I
like to fold mine into a triangle so you
just take the two diagonal ends and put
them together like so and then you kind
of just get the ends situated so you
should have kind of like a big triangle
like this and I'm going to do is put the
triangle part around my neck take the
two tassels cross them behind my head
and pull them to the front and then take
my hair out and then kind of just play
with it I really like the look this
gives I like having the triangle right
here and then the tassels to the side
once again because I really like the
kind of symmetrical look I think it
looks really cute you can also leave the
tassels behind you and just tie it into
a knot if you just want to be kind of a
triangle look without the tassels and I
really really like this as well so I
guess this would be a separate way but I
like to tie them in a knot back there
and then I'm going to stay like this so
yeah so yeah I hope you guys like this
video I hope it was helpful comment down
below which way was your favorite or if
you have any other ways you know you
want to share with other people you can
