a hair tutorial this is what it is it's
a Dutch braid into a ponytail um I got a
few requests to do hair tutorials on
more hair tutorial so I have this one I
really like this because it gets all
your hair out of your face but you have
like a really pretty design thing going
on and I always get a lot of compliments
if you believe like how do you do that
and it's actually really easy so that's
what I'm going to show you today yeah so
pretty much um you're going to need to
know how to French braid or Dutch braid
this is Dutch braiding but if you know
how to French braid that you can Dutch
braid it's actually really simple and I
pretty much show you exactly how to do
it but um yeah if you can't do it at
first keep practicing because it is
really easy so basically it's just kind
of looks like a 3d braid going all the
way back into a ponytail and you can
always you can do whatever you want to
the ponytail you can curl it you can
straighten it like I have it or you can
braid it you can even braid the ponytail
or you know you can do whatever you want
with the ponytail so I hope you guys
like this and umm yeah let's get started
okay you're going to want to start off
with any texture of hair I like doing
with straight hair just because I like
the look of straight hair in a ponytail
but if you want to leave down our
natural you can or you can always just
braid the end of the ponytail if you
want so basically you're going to want
to bring your hair into a side part any
side works on my hair's already in a
side part because I prep my hair on the
side but if you don't you just want to
put your hair on either side of your
head mine is on my right side but you
know doesn't matter so what you're going
to need to do for this is to know how to
French braid so then you can know how to
Dutch braid if you already know how to
Dutch boy that's better but if you can
French braid you can Dutch braid um
basically so when you French braid you
know how you put the pieces over one
another well in Dutch braiding you bring
them underneath so I will show you that
right now
so pretty much you're just going to take
a little section of hair from your crown
but I'm looking over here to slide them
you're over there so you're going to
take a little bit not too much just like
this much of a chunk separate it into
three pieces and instead of bringing
them over each other like you would in a
normal braid you're going to bring them
under one another so this piece is going
under the middle piece
and this piece is going under the new
middle piece and you're going to breathe
like that just regularly a little bit
okay so now that we're back to the
beginning we're going to add a little
bit of hair in and instead of bringing
it over once again we're just bringing
it under and then we're going to do the
same with this side add a little bit of
hair in and bring it under and then one
last time add a little bit of hair in
and bring it under the middle strand
your braids starting to develop and now
I'm just going to speed it up a little
bit because you guys probably get the
point
okay once you get to about here you're
going to just start breeding beg you
lowly but you're still going to be
bringing the pieces under instead of
over so as you can see I'm just braiding
and you kind of want to hold it up and
back while you're doing this because
this is where it's going to go once
you're doing the ponytail
and I like to go all the way down just
so that I know I have enough to bring it
into the ponytail just I'd rather be
safe than sorry so I'm going to do that
and yeah I'll speed it up now
so now I'm just taking a hair tie and
securing it's not all the way down but
I'm it doesn't have to be all the way
down just most of the way down so you
know that it will make it all the way to
the back of your head okay so now you're
going to want to like maybe fix it move
it around move some pieces just kind of
pull them and then kind of um you know
even it out because it's not going to
look completely perfect it kind of moves
a little bit while you do it so I'm just
going to kind of move it play with it
until I get it in the position that I
like it
so I like it how it looks like this um
you know just kind of move it around
until you get it so now basically I'm
just going to bring my hair back into a
ponytail and I'm going to leave this
part out really quick
I'm not going to tie it just kind of get
it to the height you want it and then
you're going to take the braid and kind
of bring it back some of the pieces on
the top might try to stick up but you're
just going to have to maneuver it so
they don't stick up as much and then see
how I have it like this I'm going to
pull the hair tie off the bottom and I'm
going to tie the point in with it
so there we go that's it if you want to
pull down some pieces from the front
like I usually do that's cool and if
this piece is sticking up too much you
can always bobby pin it down it's not
being that bad right now so yeah this is
what it looks like and I hope you guys
enjoyed this tell me if you try it out
it's really great and I love it so um I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and
yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
