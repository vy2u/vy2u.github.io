believe I think it's for yes
so I basically woke up just kind of did
some stuff on my computer and put some
makeup on and I'm about to grab some
lunch at alpha thei I think today they
have a grilled cheese and tomato soup
which I'm super excited about so yeah
I'm gonna do that and then I know later
on today and Marie and I are gonna take
some photos on campus because I'm taking
pictures for Albion fit who gave me this
workout set it's actually like a set so
I'm gonna take some pictures in that
post on Instagram but yeah before that
I'm just going to go get some lunch okay
guys so so far today I've been so lazy
I'm just waiting until Ann Marie and I
are gonna take pictures but I decided I
would open my day for do't of vlogmas
gift this one I think is going to be
closed so I'm really excited let's see
whoo-hoo oh wait this is so pretty okay
it's this like burgundy you velvet like
wrap crop top I think this is so pretty
for like the holidays and stuff so I'm
really excited to wear this with like
some black jeans J thank you guys
hi guys so we're about to head to campus
to take pictures and Marie and her
hunter stuff and me in this gingham sat
Rachel okay oh my outfit okay is this
like this wedding is
it's good we're like literal opposites
we're just gonna be you know trekking on
campus guys look how pretty this is
I love this we my favorite little spot
yes
wait what people say the view was pretty
but she said the view was beautiful but
I comment down below I don't know what
it is so we're thinking somewhere around
in here because this is kind of cute and
more secluded and campesi secluded is
the main the main idea here but we'll
see so look at our outfits like guys
fully walking by me while I was booty
popping for the doubter that was
impressive I was like she was like
working it getting the angles and people
were like also this I don't think this
is that aggressive and people were
looking at me so yeah honestly people I
can't I think they're either checking
you out or just looking I don't know
like this is a pretty normal workout
outfit except that it's like brightly
pattern or not brightly patterned like
very busily patterned but people look at
me like I'm actually in saying so you
know
therapy people I dare you can't tell if
you can see me anyways guys I just
changed outfits I'm taking a picture in
this top from Trojan season and I just
got a lavender latte because I love them
probably the only one that orders it
yeah I think it's really good so Ann
Marie and I are walking to go find a new
spot the Lighting's better this way I
blab maybe not okay
hi Tasha how am i running into all of
these vloggers in street and Adams how
could of the day look at that shirt it
was live TV paste and in it that's what
you want that's what we're talking about
beautiful this is what I changed into I
just filmed a little bit of it but now
I'm taking this is the film school I've
never been in this little part before
but it's so pretty
thanks for showing it just I just saw my
reflection I would tan here huh danyoung
guys I just realized I spilled my
lavender latte all over the sleeves of
my sweatshirt so that's great gonna try
to wash this now okay guys I just got
back and changed my clothes and did a
bit of just like online stuff and I'm
about to go get dinner at the Alfie
house I think it's like chicken and
stuff tonight I'll try and take a
picture and answer it here let me know
if you guys like when I put pictures in
of the food because I don't know if I'm
the only one that likes looking at food
pictures but yeah hey guys so I just got
back from dinner and I always end up
craving dessert afterwards and they
never have dessert at the house so I was
a as I was walking back to my house from
the row someone handed me this like the
boots card oh my gosh as I drop it and
there's a code on it for free delivery
during finals week to USC hits if you go
here it's study USC 17 so I think I'm
gonna order some dessert
I found this bakery on here and it says
and they have like pudding and this
pudding says this chocolate pudding says
layers of Oreo wafer is fresh
creamy chocolate pudding and chocolate
shavings and that sounds amazing to me
so I think I'm gonna get that but if you
guys haven't tried it before it's
basically like postmates or any food
delivery service
I will put my invite code on the screen
and I think you guys could either get $5
or $10 off your first thing or maybe
it's free delivery
I'd only know I'll put on the screen and
in description but you guys should try
it because you're lazy like me it's the
best okay guys so here's the pudding
okay on the top it says chocolate
peppermint I didn't think it was
peppermint but honestly like whatever
let's open it okay it's definitely
peppermint but that still looks pretty
amazing so and it's so festive oh my
gosh yeah guys what the heck this is so
good I think I would like it more if it
wasn't peppermint that's probably just
like their seasonal like change to it
but it's so good already guys so I think
for the rest of today's vlog no that
didn't make sense I was trying to say I
think this is going to be the last clip
of today's vlog because I'm not only
doing anything else tonight
ideally I would start an assignment
that's due Wednesday but no might as
well just two of the night before am i
right
my room is still a cyclone so ideally
yes I will clean that I need to shower
my hair is not dirty but I feel like it
will be tomorrow and I'm doing a little
photo shoot with LFT tomorrow and I'm
also trying to film a video tomorrow I'm
actually trying to film my Black Friday
Cyber Monday haul which I think no one
will even watch anymore because it's so
late but everything took so long to come
in the mail and I didn't want to not
include everything because you guys
wanted to see everything so anyways I
want my hair to be looking in tip-top
shape tomorrow so I need to wash it and
then what else is I gonna do I feel like
there was something else I was gonna do
but one more thing that's just been
really bothering me so I really want a
pair of joggers from Lululemon
and they're all so long like do you guys
agree that Lululemon should have a
petite section because I always get like
they're 7/8 length leggings and to be
like full length
on me or like a good length because
they're normal leggings are just way too
long and I know they have a humming
service like if you buy your leggings
they're also here's my nose being red
again why does it do this
anyways they have like a hemming service
where if you buy your leggings from
there they will have them for free but
with joggers you can't do that you know
they have like the band on the bottom
and all I want is a pair of joggers that
fit me right but I'm five foot one and I
do have pretty long legs for my height
but they're not long enough before
they're joggers to fit me so I think
that's so annoying
so let me know if you guys agree and
think that they should have petite sizes
because I feel like a lot of girls are
short I honestly think I was gonna say I
think the average height for an American
woman is five foot three but it actually
might be five foot five I should
probably look this up okay so I just
looked it up and I guess I was like
right in the middle it's five foot four
which is still pretty short I think some
websites still consider that to be
petite so I really really think that
especially Lululemon being so popular
with American women I think they should
have a petite section but that's just me
because I'm short anyways yeah I think
I'm gonna end off this vlog here thank
you guys so much for watching and stay
tuned for tomorrow's vlog bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
