basically I'm in LA I've been out in LA
for like two weeks now I was staying
with a friend from school for like a
week or so in like Malibu area and then
I came down to LA for beautycon and now
Gretchen's with me got to loves beauty
and it's actually the last day that
works here I was planning on blogging
other times in my trip but in the
beginning of the trip I wasn't with any
youtubers so I mean I was just kind of
hanging out with friends from school and
like her friends from home so there
really just wasn't like a time for me to
vlog and then I've been meaning to vlog
the days I've would been with Gretchen
but I just haven't and she's been
vlogging so if you want to see what
we've been doing check out her vlogs but
I decided I to blog the last day right
here because we're going to the Melrose
trading post which I've been wanting to
go to since I've moved to LA for school
and I just never went so it's basically
like this flea market on Melrose
which is a street and I don't know I
think this is supposed to have really
cool stuff so we're going to that and
Ann Marie's coming as well another one
of my YouTube friends so that'll be fun
and then I think after that I might take
Gretchen to the Grove because I'm flight
tonight isn't until midnight so we have
like a full day and yeah so we'll see
hey guys so I'm currently on Abbot
Kinney and I'm really struggling because
I
these shoes that I wear all the time and
normally they don't give me blisters but
I have really bad blisters right now
already so I got some bad dates
hopefully that helps but I just got a
nice coffee from Blue Bottle coffee and
it's really good it's got a nice coffee
with almonds oh so Gretchen went in to
get something and we're waiting for Ann
Marie and then we're gonna go to the

I could take them off right now dried
black pants too so it that's the worst
yeah it's really rough okay so first I
got this two-piece set and these are the
little shorts and then I really like the
top and I like this because I think
they'd look you like separately too you

just like they can go like for the
choker and then you're talking about
camo and you're like oh I definitely

really small neck but it has a little
turquoise stone okay and the last thing

star where she swooped the romper

actually just met a subscriber named
Gretchen I crazy happy so happy I should
have filmed it I always forgot in my
hair is a hot mess because I've been
sweating all day it's so hot
but yeah so I think we're just gonna
shop around a little bit I like never
come to the Grove because it's so busy
in video but then the Topshop here and
there's definitely a press to Surrey and
I've been wined as I but pressed freeze
for like years so so we came all the way
to press freeze and know out of
chocolate flavor which is the only one I
wanted I ran out of chocolate and
vanilla and I didn't want to try any of
the other ones normally but it's fine
I'll survive I'll just try out when I'm
here in the polls by Gretchen got some
so yeah
hey guys so reason that we're back in
the grove and Annemarie
ended up not making so called now we are
all here and we're at her boyfriend
Jacobs apartment and he kindly offered
to take some pics for us yeah even
though I kind of look like a sweaty mess
right now like a lot I got more stuff
guys I really did not mean to but I
literally bought more baby ants but they
were on sale only if only $10 off the
like they were myself and I really
needed I didn't need them but like I
really wanted some just black new
ray-bans I don't know where they are
yeah okay so these are the sunglasses I
got I just wanted all black ones because
but really all the ones I have are
either gold or tortoise with like some
sort of crazy lens so I thought that if

order which is literally like a free
meal like you don't have to pay so I'm
gonna put it like on the screen and then
