you on how I get my hair like this I use
a one and a quarter inch color here so
you'll see how I use that in the
tutorial but I really love these curls I
feel like they're natural curls and not
like too tight but they're not too loose
and I just think they're really pretty I
think they're great for a regular day or
a dance or a formal event or anything I
just think their overall a great hair
look and I've been loving and doing this
lately so if you want to learn how to do
this then keep watching okay so I'm
gonna start off with my natural hair I
just kind of sucked on it and now I'm
going to section off the top part of my
hair and do the underneath first next
I'm going to be adding heat protectant
I'm just using the Tresemme heat tamer
spray and I'm going to spray this all
throughout my hair the color I use is
this kind of one and a quarter inch
barreled
cohered and what I do is wrap my hair
around it and go use the clamp because I
don't know how so I just grab my hair
around so what I do is take a piece of
hair about this big I start from the
back and move forward and what I do is
take my color put it behind the piece of
hair and then wrap it away from my face
like that and then I just hold it there
for about 10 seconds
and then I just continue doing that so
once again I grab a piece about this big
put the card behind my head and just
wrap it around okay now I'm just going
to finish this side but I'm going to
speed it up so you can kind of see what
I'm doing
okay so now that I have this tag done
I'm just going to spray it really
quickly but this one of extremals I
don't recommend this I don't like it at
all but it's all that I have right now
so I just do a really quick spray
because I hopefully like using here to
spray that mop to do this side I do the
same thing except obviously I'm doing it
on the other side so I'm just taking a
section taking my courier putting it
over my head here and wrapping the hair
around so now I'm just gonna do the rest
on this side and I'll come back okay so
now that I'm finished at the bottom this
is what it looks like and I'm gonna show
you how I do the top now so I'm just
going to take this hair down and bring
this hair just betrayed me and then I'm
just going to kind of separate it where
my part line is and bring it to the
front and then I'm just going to kind of
flush it out then I'm gonna add the heat
protectant then I do with a lot of hair
over here so I'm just gonna kind of
split it in half and section it so I'm
gonna take this hair from the front that
I'm not gonna do yet and kind of just
flip it over my head and section it off
in the rest so now I'm going to start
curling in this hair and I just do the
same exact thing that I did on the
bottom section so I take a chunk from
the back
and then just cool it
okay now I'm going to let down this hair
thank God I looked really weird
and then I'm just going to finish
pulling this hair and I will come back
once I've done that okay so I just
finished this side is now completely
finished when I got to the fun I like to
do a little bit of smaller chunks just
because I like having like more curls in
the front but now I'm just going to
finish this side and I don't have much
hair on this side so I leave it to the
end
but yeah so I think you guys get the
point on how I do it now but I guess
I'll just show you a few okay I'm
actually going to stop and then I'll
just show you once again for the fun
pieces so you see what I mean by taking
smaller sections okay so now this is all
I have in the front so I'm starting to
take smaller exceptions and I'm just
going to curl them the same way that I
did
okay so now I have finished cutting my
hair this is what it looks like I
personally love doing this I think it's
worth the amount of time it takes I'll
just show you it from the back
they're super natural looking curls
which I love and if you try this out be
sure to leave a video response of you
doing it or tweet me a picture on
Twitter or on Instagram or something
I'll put all my little links below so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I hope
it helped you and yeah hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
