video and I'm really excited I finally
made a YouTube I've been meaning to do
it for awhile and I just figured since
tomorrow is my last day of school it
would be a good time to just start so I
figured this first video would just be
kind of talk about how to pull your
bangs back and really quick easy ways
because whether you're going to school
and you wake up late or you're going to
school you still want to take a lot of
time getting ready or it's summer and
you don't you know feel like working on
your hair you and you have bangs or just
getting in the way then you want to get
it back so I do have really nasty bangs
that are going at at the moment you can
see that's how long they are and I'll
usually just flip them in my normal hair
if I'm not gonna do anything but you you
know you want good ways so the first way
I'm just gonna show you how I do my pouf
because everyone knows I just take two
Clips like these you know and
just get some on the crown not too much
not too little and twist and push
forward it's that easy I take these I
put one in and you're gonna see that's
gonna be kind of flat and lopsided but
once you put the only one it in front of
it
it pushes it back up just might want to
kind of readjust things and then pull
some pieces to get it right in and walk
the next one I want to show you is this
one I think is you know really cute so
what you're gonna do is I think everyone
knows how to do the twist kind of thing
you know take two pieces kind of just
twist them around each other get
something like this right okay so what
I'm gonna do it cuz I'm gonna start
right here and what I'm gonna do is
start doing a twist so once I have my
first twist over I'm gonna take that
piece on the underside and grab a chunk
and then put it back over then you're
gonna have another piece on the
underside grab a chunk bring it back
over
you're gonna have another piece grab a
chunk bring it back over another piece
grab a chunk bring it back over and then
if you got as far as you want you can
just continue doing it regularly and pin
it back I'm just gonna use these clips
probably won't stay that well but
you would obviously secure more that's
really what you were gonna do and this
is what it looks like I think it looks
really cute especially for being that
quick and easy and I'm just gonna pull
this fun part up a little bit just to
get a little volume so that's that one
okay and then I'm going to show you one
last one that I think is really cute
okay so if Kristin's gonna finish my
bangs back just to get them out of the
way I'm gonna take this piece that would
be under my bangs and I'm gonna breed it
so
just prayed all the way down it's
probably not gonna be really good braid
since I'm trying to go fast for this
all right you don't have to go all the
way down just go you know a good
distance so when you let you bangs back
down you're just gonna take this piece
kind of bring it up and then around your
banks catching them into place then
you're just gonna pin end of that piece
down just using these clips again and
you've got it pinned back in a cute way
they definitely get your hair out of
your face you can bring it up for a
little sloppier style just to make your
bangs look kind of cute like this and
yeah so I might be making more of these
if you want me to definitely comment
below I have a ton more ideas but those
are just a few that I think accepts of a
poop are a little different than you
know what everyone does at school so I
hope you subscribe I'll be doing tons of
beauty definitely hair videos um just
style because I really do like fashion
and style and you know just fun videos
that you know maybe normally you
wouldn't see I don't know I just like
making up stuff so please comment
subscribe bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
