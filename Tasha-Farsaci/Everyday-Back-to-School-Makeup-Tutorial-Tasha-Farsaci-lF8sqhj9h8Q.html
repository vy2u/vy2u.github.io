school makeup tutorial and you guys
requested makeup for school and I
figured what else to do then show you
what makeup I'm gonna be wearing for
school so this is what I'm gonna be
wearing
once again you can kind of like tweak it
to your personal liking because there's
a few things I do in here then maybe you
won't like so you can kind of change it
around but I figured I would just show
you what I wear because I feel like it's
appropriate for a lot of grades because
it's really natural but um it's super
pretty and easy so basically what it is
is just a neutral eye with like one or
two ish colors you'll see what I do in
the tutorial with some brown eyeliner
and little lipgloss and that's about it
so yeah so if you want to learn how I do
this makeup or you want to know what I'm
gonna be wearing I'm waiting for school
then keep watching
okay so the first thing what I do is put
my hair up so it doesn't get in my face
while I'm doing my makeup
next I'm gonna fill in my eyebrows I do
this so it can find my eyebrows me more
and just makes them look better I got
this eyebrow pencil in my glossy box
now I'm going to set my eyebrows I'm
using Maybelline's to mascara and I like
doing this so that my eyebrows don't
move around all day next I'm going to
prime my eyes I'm using benefit stay
don't stray this is great it keeps your
eyeshadow from creasing and makes it
last all day
now I'm gonna put eyeshadow all over my
lid I'm using Stila skin it's just my
favorite eyeshadow of all time it's just
a pretty light champagne color and I
love it I definitely recommend it for
everyone especially if you're just
starting out so I'm putting this all
over my lid next I'm just going to blend
it out so it looks more natural
and there are any harsh lines
I'm not going to add a crease color but
I am going to add a highlight I'm just
going in my math palette and taking a
vapor and putting this under my brow
bone next I'm going to line my eyes I'm
using NYX slide on eyeliner in brown
perfection I love these eyeliners they
go on really smoothly and I'm putting it
on my upper lash line just because I
like how that looks and I feel like it's
more natural than putting it on my lower
lash line or waterline
now I'm going to sell my eyeliner this
is especially important for school
because keeps it on all day so I'm
taking a NYX eyeshadow ember tail it's
matte which I really like and I'm just
setting my eyeliner with it now I'm
going to add mascara I'm using
Maybelline's one by one of my top lashes
and Clinique /w mascara on my bottom
lashes because I like how it works for
my bottom ones now I'm gonna put on a
lip gloss I don't normally do this but I
wanted to for the video so it's just a
two-faced glamour gloss and pillow-talk
it's just a pretty pink moody color and
I love it so now I'm gonna take down my
hair sorry it looks really weird in this
video looks kind of like stringy gross
but yeah so now I'm going to do some
weird modeling but I hope you guys
enjoyed it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
