guest we introduce yourself
yeah hey guys I'm anne-marie and I've
Tasha's housemates and fellow Trojan and
a senior at USC he's a youtuber oh yeah
yeah we've got a few collabs before
Henry chases her channel check it out
subscribe to this crazy bonus videos but
basically today I've been getting so
many questions about USC ever since I
started going here ever since I
announced I was transferring here I get
so many gems and questions for you guys
and I felt bad because I haven't been
answering them because I knew I was
going to make a video like this and I've
made videos in the past about my
transfer experience so I decided I was
going to sit down and film a USC
frequently asked questions video and
then I was like I was just over with Ann
Marie because she'll be a senior this
year I'll be a junior and she's been
here all three years yeah so she has
probably different opinions of me and
her experience of me so I just thought
it would be cool to have yeah I'm are
just like different yeah we're like
probably like awesome personality maybe
wears different quickly before I get
into the questions if you guys aren't
following me or anne-marie and subsisted
yeah totally do you'll see our lives and
a more personal day to day basis so I'll
put those on the screen and in the
description box also one more thing if
you're wondering where we got these
super cute customized USC none of the
blow baby nurses know a girl's chef her
Instagram is sniped by staefel put on
the screen she offered to send me some
USB here and I think it's so cute so I
want to work for the video stay tuned
for on my Instagram yeah it's cuter than
anything that I have is so cute I feel
kinda like a lumberjack so I'm into it
also in this video I'm not going to
really talk about anything transfer
related or my experience with LMU or
other colleges because I do in a videos
about those already so I will link those
down below if you're interested in that
stuff I answered a lot of questions
there as well as how I
adjusted okay for the first question
that we both get a lot is is it easy to
make friends at USC / how did you do it
yeah that's a good question
you want to start I want to hear your
answer services like I really know how
I'm going to answer mine okay I've
definitely answered the question in
transfer videos and it is hard to make
friends as a transfer especially because
I was springing it transfer so I was
coming in in the middle of it so I'm not
going to lie and say that it was easy to
make friends but I did make friend you
just have to really put yourself out
there and I know in high school I was so
shy and then coming to college I forced
myself to talk to people so I mainly
made friends in classes I would talk to
people next to me or with mutual friends
and stuff like that so for me it was a
bit different being a transfer student
so I don't really know if this will help
you guys but yeah input yeah it's like
super different than high school you're
like you grow up with your friends and
you like have your squad you know but in
college like everyone starting new and
for me I think I've observed from like a
lot of people who's been here all four
years is that people either meet their
best friends like on their floor like so
many people are like yeah this is like
my roommate or like she lives down my
like hall or whatever and they're still
best friends and I'm like I didn't have
that cuz I lived in a really isolated
dorm so the way that I made my friends
were like in my classes or in my program
so I spent a lot of time in I was also
surprised at how many friends like out
how good of friends that I made with my
roommates last year like I didn't really
think of that being like a really good
way to meet friends but as long as
you're like kind of like similar and
like-minded it's a really good way to
like make really to actually not yeah
that yeah last year we'll talk more
about housing later but I was put with
random yeah house or apartment mates and
they were actually grad students at USC
yeah I want to make fast shout out stuff
literally became one of my best friends
yeah okay the next question I've
actually been asked this a few times as
well and I'm going to kind of phrase it
as where should you live on campus we're
going to talk about this for freshman
year which I didn't experience but I had
a lot of friends
you're a freshman I kind of a cute thing
but then we're going to talk about
options once you're not living on campus
yeah so I live on campus my freshman
year and it was funny because everyone
was like where you live is really
important but I was like no I don't
think that's true like I'll make friends
anywhere because I'm a nice person and I
was like it's not gonna be hard to make
friends but I think it is actually
really important to choose really
carefully where you live and on the
Facebook pages ever it was like oh I
want women this this this place and like
know they're talking about the places
that I was going to live in and I was
like oh well this place has AC it is
really nice and new but I would say that
it is important to pick like a more
social dorm if you're trying to make
friends like on your floor because
you're just like constantly surrounded
by people where I'd like my I lived in
Parkside IRC which like I didn't know
for an entire year I did not know the
person who live like the next door down
oh yeah yeah a lot of my friends were
freshmen and everyone said the place to
live if you're social and want to have
fun fun in your dorm is new north if you
guys are familiar with you residence
probably heard of it and this is true
it's definitely your stereotypical
college dorm and cata gross it's not
cute but it is very social and I know
people made a ton of friends that way so
if that's kind of the route you want to
go or or just like any social dorms yeah
like yours want to be surrounded by
people because then you're like more
likely to make friends and like if
you're like where I was I was like just
literally surrounded by my suitemates
which like was a good way to make
friends but that's like eight people
okay now talking about when you're not
living on campus anymore like yeah okay
what can i USD I feel like it's way more
common than other colleges yeah other
colleges you live like on campus all
four years yeah but are you at these
different USC it's different so you can
either go like the apartment way or the
house whim and last year I talked about
this briefly but I lived in Lorenzo
which is one of the apartment complexes
and in my opinion it's the nicest but
it's also the farthest and it wasn't
very social I'd have like any friends
really that
there except from my roommate so we've
definitely had the most amenities I
really liked that yeah usually use them
I didn't use them i lay by the pool so
often but i had no friends who lived in
there so i would have to go back to
campus or like other apartments to hang
out with people so unison I was at West
as an apartment and the pros of that was
that it was really social but that's
also like a huge con because like it'd
be like a Tuesday night and the person
like across from you would be blasting
music that's why I discover my like love
of earplugs and the amenities like I
thought the pools I liked wouldn't I
wouldn't go in the pool yeah whackers a
weird smell to it yeah I don't know how
to explain it but yeah I have a lot of
friends that live there one of my good
friends this here was there it's
definitely got very social and it's
really close to the RO so if you think
you'll be going to Greek row a lot
that's nice
but it's still kind of far from campus
yeah Lorenzo had a shuttle so I would
take the shuttle with campus but West
doesn't have that yeah if you're walking
to like sometime like by tire would be
like flat and I'd be like don't walk and
it's literally like a 15 to 20 minute
yeah and then there's gateway which near
bustling yeah but that one is right next
to campus but actually I don't hear the
best things about Gateway I don't know
what time people that live there
I think gateway is really common for
spring myths though and I didn't know
that yeah they actually have like a
little community that's how a yeah I
last like housemate met out like her
best friends yeah so if you're a spring
admit check setup checkout gateway I
wish I knew because I knew a time spring
mix that went there and they call knew
each other because of it so that's a pro
and it's so close to campus and they
have the best food underneath it
they have blaze pizza and cream and
subway and a ton of places so but also
we live in a house now yes top it just
moved here but I personally like I love
living in a house way more first of all
like it's usually less people and
sometimes like depending on what house
you choose it can be cheaper but I also
just like how close we are
to campus versus something that I also
like this is kind of a funny reason we
were just talking about earlier the
awkwardness of elevators oh yeah okay
but like we need an apartment complex
especially West you cannot go in there
without seeing someone Alec I don't know
what my materials I'll always be someone
I know someone I don't want to see you
live in a house you don't have it and
you you can instead of doing that you
can see people like pass by your house
that you know you're like I don't have
the time to the oh wait this is also a
pro or a pro my own a pro probably to
clean house yes
okay whenever I order post mates in an
apartment so I have to go down the
elevator to off this bunch here just
walk out the front door and then it's a
yeah cuz like they mustn't have a lot to
see is like go down in advance yeah like
for uber to I found that when I lived in
an apartment everything was kind of all
set up by the apartment it was very easy
to pay and know what you're paying for
but here we're handling all ourselves
and we've rented some issues with that
so that's a little more difficult but
he's got a kind of way to pros and cons
and see what you think works for you
okay the third question we want to
answer is what is food like on campus
and I can't talk about diagonals because
I welcome here my freshman year what is
required to like have a done in clam
yeah so Allah and we take that over then
we can talk about other options yeah so
I would say the food is okay like it's
not horrible but it's not like amazing
some dining halls are better than others
I live on Parkside or at Parkside so I
went to like the Parkside Cafe it was
usually pretty good you can find a good
array of healthy options I don't think I
was vegetarian then so like I don't
really know I ate a lot of meat so I was
like fine I was like satisfied with my
like diet but I feel like it'd be kind
of harder to go as like a vegetarian I
would say it's just like very very
average oh give it like a that's why I'm
here I might have five out of ten that's
six out of ten yeah yeah I guess in
terms of food on campus it honestly
wasn't that great until right now
because USD just drill University
Village I'll be way better on the
restaurant then on campus there's a few
restaurants in like
the center I like seeds they have like
salad yeah paninis and sandwiches that's
good there's like a ton of coffee
options put the lines can get pretty
long for that the one thing that I think
is we kind of not the best about USC is
like all the food places not on campus
but around campus are fast food which
might be good for some people but
there's not a lot of healthy options at
all that's actually so true I realize
that like you can pretty much name any
fast food chain or tread bag and it will
be like right outside Cambodia except
flat or not like that except PNL but
yeah and if you want to have like a cute
dinner with friends it's like not going
to happen
it keeps you going downtown or whatever
yeah yeah the like we said USC finally
built and opened University Village
which is like this huge structure I'm
staring at so basically there's housing
and then they put like 20 restaurants
but the most important thing for me
yellow yes go for it I'm going to say
Trader Joe's yeah
because before like Adler's I lived in
the same house and they didn't have UV
and if I wanted to like cook for myself
I would have to like drive 20 to 30
minutes to the Trader Joe's like just
there and then I feel like I don't have
to stock up on a ton of food like and
even then like the nearest grocery store
is rouse and that's like probably ten
minutes yeah yeah so basically Trader
Joe's and Target so it's like a little
yeah yeah it's amazing so that's great
okay I got a question about class sizes
and basically this person was asking
okay we see the average class size is
said to be 26 but that people have
classes of like 300 so for me I'm a
communication major and in my calm
classes I probably have anywhere from
like 50 to 100 people but it didn't seem
that big and then you also have a
discussion section which is smaller and
in there I have like 15 people but if
you're taking like a GE class which is
the class everyone has to take like a
math class yeah something like that
it'll be bigger minor around 150 people
but once you get through those and get
onto like more specialized classes yeah
they're a little bit way closer
like the 26 number yeah I would pretty
much do the same is there stuff to do
around campus I'm going to be honest and
say the u.s. is not in the best prime
area of LA in my opinion for what I like
to do either for even for other people
yeah I'm how many would ever pick me up
and he was like I would not even drive
to your five years ago but yeah it's not
ideal there are measures that are taken
to make Gigan feel safe but I think the
closest area that people might go to is
downtown away but even that it's an odd
marker it's not ideal
so I basically uber places I don't have
a car do you think a lot of students
have cars no I don't think you're
allowed to have a car as a freshman but
like yeah my freshman year if I wanted
to go places I had to over a lot but
yeah just know that if you want to go
places in LA if you go here you're not
going to be able to like walk there and
I wouldn't recommend taking like the
public bus I took at once and I was with
like four guys like but I feel like I
was like still like visually violated I
don't know how to explain that if yeah
so honestly uber will become your friend
yeah but they also have they just built
the metro line to Santa Monica that's
true I take that sometimes it's so not
yeah like amazing but I don't feel too
unsafe so yeah do you feel like you have
to be a part of Greek life in order to
be a part of the social scene slash go
to parties so I've mentioned this in
videos prior but I'm about to rush in
t-minus two days or go through a
sorority recruitment someone yelled at
me for calling it rush in a video they
said it was like looked down upon
they're going to rush so yeah I'm
currently not in the sorority but yeah
and restart yeah so I have some
experience in that I joined a sorority
in my sophomore year so like a year
after like most people rush and then I
actually decided to drop my sorority
this year so I didn't like a part of the
reason why I rushed is because in my
freshman year I didn't make that many
friends and I was like I really want to
have girlfriends as I was I feel like I
was fine with guys but I just wasn't
able to meet girls that I like really
got along with and so I was like I so I
truly thought that the only way to make
girlfriends was to like rush and trynna
sorority and I think it is a really good
way to make friends because you're kind
of just like put in this environment
where you're surrounded by hundreds of
girls and like everyone kind of on the
same page right they're all looking for
friends they're all looking for love but
I would say that you really don't have
to join like Greek life in order to make
friends I think coming in since I was a
spring mint transfer I wasn't able to go
through sorority recruitment we don't
really have all recruitment and for me I
would consider myself a social person I
like going out and being with people and
whatnot so it was harder for me because
I found that a lot of people that are in
Greek life are really social and I
didn't necessarily feel left out because
I would still hang out with people that
were in Greek life but I did in a sense
so I don't know for me it was hard to
make friends about being in it that's
why I am going to go through recruitment
and see if that works out for me but I
guess it's just kind of like what you
want out of it and the type of person
you are
I agree I was going to say that but like
I didn't really know how to phrase it
like if you're someone that likes going
out like being social like being
beautiful
like going to events and yeah you might
feel left out if you're not in it but if
you're not that type of person then no
yeah absolutely agree okay this question
is kind of depending on our opinion but
what is the best slash worst thing about
USC I haven't even thought about my
other yeah that's a hard one I would say
the best thing about USC is that like
every single type of person that you
meet is interesting in some way and I
feel like you compromise it about like a
lot of like like top 100 scores or
whatever schoolers oh cool I just know
it is boring here like either they're
super rich or they're super smart or
they're like really in cultures yeah
cultured or they have like a really
unique talent I would say
that no one is just like for bland yes I
think my best thing this is kind of
broad but I feel like USD is just like
your stereotypical colors or dreary oh
okay
also on top of that it's a really
competitive good tool and it's like in
LA and the weather is nice like it's a
beautiful school you have like the best
campus you have the school spirit you're
the football games you have a good
academics it's just like everything that
you think of when you think of college
is USC and that's like what I'd always
wanted so for me an answer no I like
that answer I didn't think about that
I especially thought of it like the
campus when I was walking through ubios
like the campus is like unreal like I
felt something I was like this is really
College work thing oh I definitely know
my answer that subscribe you got the
cost of tuition oh yeah I'm so lucky
that I'm an only child and my parents
told me they'd pay for my school because
otherwise who knows what I would be
doing so yeah I'm gonna say like I feel
you're gonna get at least one comment
that's like you spoiled rich kids yeah
but that's like honestly you you like
people work at their job so that they
can provide for their families like why
would you not take that opportunity of
yeah I'm just in defense otona saying
that and it's so great I mentioned this
in videos before and people were pretty
like supportive about what I had to say
I'm obviously so grateful and I know USC
is so offensive yeah so thank you mom
and dad know what this was this is like
time I just like I'd like to get my bags
have to date that was a really yes I am
so grateful and UNC is exactly where I
want to be easy but it is extremely
expensive I think it's way way more than
that ever it should be yeah so that's
definitely to be worst part for me yeah
I agree
okay I'm gonna copy back off of that
like first of all you can apply to gosh
this every single year
no parents you can do that and like
ivory wasn't all that is different so
like I don't really know what it is but
for like the business school
if they like give out small scholarships
pretty easily like from what I've seen
but you can do that every year but
something that I also
pretty bad about USC is that even like
you're not like tuition related things
kind of cost a lot of money like we were
talking about like to go to like Santa
Monica or like to go to the nearest
place that's like a place to be it's
like super there you know yeah um
location is a bad thing yeah not so much
la like it's good to be like near LA but
like the part of LA yeah unless you like
really like for you Tom like there's
really nothing around last question how
did you know UFC was the school for you
um yeah I knew us seems to school for me
since my freshman year of high school
wait I remember okay like I I don't know
how I came across this but I was like
looking at like an old video and then I
scrolled down in the comments and Tasha
like you come together and play like I
would go to USC like whoo like whatever
you said I was like oh my god but this
is how I met I literally found her
videos back in the day when you were a
freshman at USC and I want to go here so
no bad so I was like watching all these
YouTube videos about USC and then I
found here and I would I want to go here
yeah I just think I wanted to go here
for so long I wanted a school of hard to
get into you're like I said the whole
college area and I wanted to be in
California so yeah for me it was like
choosing between UCLA and USC
and you still excited for me it was like
I would have to pay out-of-state tuition
at UCLA and I first really common to
like have to graduate within five years
instead of four and I was like not down
to spend any more time in school that I
needed to and also that's like a very
high tuition cost and it'll because of
the out-of-state like aspect of that and
so and also I like I actually went onto
both campuses and a story mmm and UCLA
just like felt so huge ein and I was
like I felt too small I was like I I
don't know I just felt very small there
yeah I felt like a normal person
oh I knew you and you're killing it
sucks okay so I think those are all the
questions we're going to answer today we
try to cover a broad spectrum of the
spectrum what am I even saying you guys
are like how did you get
you have if you guys have any more
questions leave them in the comments and
you know I will answer them maybe other
people can answer them if you're
interested in going to USC best of luck
maybe you'll see us yeah on campus so
anyways thank you guys so much for
