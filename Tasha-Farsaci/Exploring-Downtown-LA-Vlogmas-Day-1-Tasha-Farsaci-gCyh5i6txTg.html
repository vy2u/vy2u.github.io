really so excited to be doing vlogmas
this year and if you guys didn't see my
Texas vlogs that I just posted I will
link them down below but in the first
one I was talking about how I didn't
know when I was gonna do the first 14
days of long myths because I'm still
gonna be at school and it's gonna be
like finals and all that stuff so I
think what I want to do is vlog adays I
do things and then also vlog the days I
don't really do things and I can combine
vlogs or if I'm really not doing
something on a day I'll post like a
regular video that day not a vlog so I
think that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
try and post every day but if it doesn't
quite happen it will be everyday
starting the 14th so yeah today I don't
have class it's a Wednesday I don't have
class Monday Wednesday Friday Saturday
Sunday yeah I only have classes Tuesday
Thursdays this semester which is really
nice so today I'm just need to clean my
room because as you can see it's
literally a disaster I haven't unpacked
from Thanksgiving and I hadn't put my
laundry away before I left so I have to
do that and then I'm gonna go get my
nails done because they look really
really bad and there's a place like
walking distance from here and then I
think I'm gonna go to a coffee shop and
do some homework
get some coffee all that stuff I like
doing homework at coffee shops because I
just feel like I'm more productive and I
like the environment so yeah okay I'm
about to leave to you my nails done and
this is literally the only clean part of
my room I really tried to clean I need
to finish later but I made my bed but
then literally just look at this pile of
clothes on my other bed in case you guys
are wondering what I'm wearing today I
just decided to be comfy it's actually
been a little bit chillier in LA it's
been like low 60s which if you're from
LA that's like cold you know what I mean
so anyways I'm wearing this a wild Fox
jumper with just a sports bra and then
these new Lululemon like emerald green
leggings I got they will be in an
upcoming haul video but I really like
them they're so comfy and they're like
high-waisted and then I'm just wearing
these shoes that I think we're from the
example or chien one of those so yeah
really comfy just good for me that good
to do homework in after I get my nails
done I really don't know what color I
want to get
so we will see okay hi guys so I got my
nails done I got this a really really
dark purple color that's like almost
black and I'm really happy with how it
turned out so yeah I went to polish and
paint it's like really close to my
apartment building like I just walk
there so that's really convenient and as
you can see I cleaned this bed off
because it was so so bad but I still
have my suitcase over there that I have
to undo but I think I'm gonna do that
after I go to a coffee shop so probably
later tonight so I think I'm gonna go to
tender greens downtown and get some
lunch and then walk to a coffee shop
nearby um yeah I have no friends so I'm
going alone no but really like it's been
so hard to meet people since I'm a
spring in minute like I haven't Li
talked about it much but because I'm not
taking classes at USC and like I'm not
living with other spring admits I'm like
really hard to meet people so I'm just
like really looking forward to next
semester so I can make more friends and
stuff but I do like being alone and like
studying alone and stuff so I don't
really mind
okay so I'm currently walking to a
different coffee shop because that one
was closing and I'm feel like going back
to my apartment Jack and I'm kind of
like in this sketchy part of downtown so
this is not ideal but I'm going to vu
I've been there before
and I really like that one and it's open
until like 7:00 so yeah we'll see if I
make it there without getting catcalled
like 50 times by old men because that's
always great
okay my lift is almost here but I just
wanted to show you how cute it is
outside here it was like little tables
and then you can see kind of more what
it looks like over there this place is
literally so cute and trendy I literally
love it if you guys are in downtown LA
and you want a coffee shop totally come
to verb cuz it's just like so cool
so my lyft driver is about to be here
I'm gonna go home and probably finish
cleaning my room and stuff hey guys so
it's a little bit later now like an hour
or so if you hear that dog whining
basically my suitemates have a dog I've
mentioned this before and he gets like
really bad separation anxiety when they
leave and if they let him just like walk
around to a wine and like destroy
everything so they have to like keep him
in there every when they're gone and
basically he learned how to open doors
so he's been opening the doors and
escaping our apartment and they had to
put like a padlock on their door like
he's escaped numerous time so yeah he's
like trying to get out right now and I
hear him and I feel bad like I want him
to just like be out and like hang out
with me but he won't like wine whenever
they're not here so they have to like
keep him in the room and after a while
he stops like trying to get out but I
feel bad so if you hear that that's why
anyways I just listed some things on my
Poshmark account I have like a bunch of
stuff I need to sell it's not all the
stuff I'm gonna list but I just listed a
few things so I'll put my Poshmark down
below as well as an invite code I have
an invite code and I think you can get
like five dollars off your first
purchase on Poshmark if you want to use
it so you don't have to use it for my
stop you can use it for anything but I
seriously shop on Poshmark all the time
like I get so much stuff on there but
anyways I did there I'm like with crafts
knitting I literally I didn't do like
any of my homework when I went to the
coffee shops like I online shop for so
long which is so bad I did like one
thing but I need to study for a bio test
tomorrow anyways I hope you guys liked
my first day of vlogmas if you did
please give it a thumbs up and please
leave a comment down below because i
love hearing your guys's comments
especially on like vlog type videos
because i feel like they're more
personal oh my god I'm sorry all I can
listen to is Chester whining
right now anyways yeah so thank you guys
