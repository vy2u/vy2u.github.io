it's still kind of hard free to get in
the mood for filming with the whole
College thing but here I am I'm filming
a haul video for you just like old times
I want to start off with two beauty
products just because I really really
like them and I just got them so i want
to show you so the first one is benefits
they're real mascara i know this is a
really popular mascara i'm like a ton of
people use it and it got really popular
like a while ago like you know I just
jumped on the bandwagon i got it i
really like here i'm going to show you
my eyelashes today because I'm wearing
it and it's honestly probably the best
mascara I've ever used I know mascaras
are different for different people but
honestly this is my all-time favorite
mascara so here is my eyelashes with the
mascara I were a lot of mascara but
honestly it does a great job and I
really really love it in the last beauty
product as well as the second duty
product I have to show you is by
macadamia and I've heard great great
things about all their products so I
want to try something and this is the
macadamia professional moisturizing or
no nourishing moisture mask say that
three times past um honestly my hair has
felt a lot drier since I've been living
in California I don't know if it's just
because it's hard here or what but my
hair has felt a lot drier so I needed
this I've only used this once so far but
it honestly made my hair feel a lot
softer than normally than normal
normally a me of my hair feel a lot
softer afterwards and it had been when I
wasn't using this so I'm really glad
that I got it smells really good it's
just like a thick kind of butter
consistency and your users instead of
your conditioner so I really like this
and I want to try more macadamia
products for sure moving on I have got a
lot of shoes lately and the first four
pairs i'm going to show you are actually
gifted to me by xue shu kaam but after
that i have something i purchased with
my own money so so xue shu kaam is super
awesome they said they would give me
these shoes as well as give you guys a
coupon code so I'm going to put the
little code for the fifteen percent off
in the downbar as well
a link for a chance to win a free pair
of shoes because who doesn't want free
shoes and they have awesome shoes they
have like a ton of good brands like
Steve Madden and then like Chinese
Laundry just like a bunch of cool shoe
brands so I'm going to link that in the
down bar as well please go check it out
because who does not want free shoes so
you guys probably know I am in college
and I do like go out on weekends and
stuff so I happen wearing heels recently
so I found these shoes on the zoo shoe
and they're basically some nude healy de
heel heelys yes Keeley's i bought
Healy's guys they're nude heels of their
lace-up I have not worn these yet I have
a feeling they're going to make my feet
bleed and cry uh because there's no
platform and they're really dig into my
ankle I already know it but they're so
so cute like I love these shoes so um I
got these these are my the brand bella
marie and i just thought they were very
very cute next thing I the shoes from
xue shu aww by steve madden steve madden
is my favorite favorite shoe brand ever
so first pair are these they kind of
look like Birkenstocks and i already
wore these so if they have like crust on
the bottom like I don't know what that
is Rose but they look like Birkenstocks
accept their shimmery and I know a lot
of people hate Birkenstocks personally I
like them and depending on the style I
have a pair of like this style ones but
these ones are like beaded in the sequin
II and pretty the next video shoes from
xue shu are some new flats and i wanted
steve madden nude flats for so long so
i'm so happy i found some these are
pointed toe and I never used to be into
pointed toe shoes but now I'm kind of
like I feel super extra fierce when I
wear them like fiercelytasha times 10
but yeah oh yeah as I drop them and I
like that they're not patent leather
they're very like normal mother matte
leather I don't know um but they're
really cute the sides are super cool
because you can see they like a lake
disappear for a minute like remember
like surprise but yeah I don't know what
I'm saying it's been a long day but yeah
really cute simple can go a lot yeah the
last pair of shoes from xue shu i'm so
excited about and i wore these yesterday
actually i love boots if you
no me I love them but it was really hard
for me to bring boots here to California
because I live in New York and shipping
boots across the country / packing them
in my suitcase is really heavy and
pricey and I just didn't want to do it
especially with like the space issue so
I got these Oh as I show you the wrong
side hahaha i got these puppies and i
have brown riding boots at home but mine
are more of a camel e ground so and i
saw this really dark like Doug chocolaty
Brown I got really excited it has like
gold hardware or some buckles and I'm
not really cute detail is is like gold
on the heel here so yeah I totally check
out xue shu i'm going to be looking on
there from now on because i always try
and find like steve madden shoes on like
dip and website sometimes because a lot
of times they're sold out blah blah and
now you have fifteen percent off with my
coupon code I just looked at my coupon
code is it's tasha loves zoo so i'm
gonna put that right here go buy shoes I
figured I'd show you the shoes that I
bought with my own money recently as
well so you know how real the shoe /
steve madden obsession is so I got these
puppies you guys might know I love
burgundy it's like my favorite thing
ever so saw these esteem Madden like
half died had to get them they're
beautiful that's really all I have to
say about them um I'm obsessed and then
i got these ones as well also beautiful
classic timeless necessary um really
actually not necessary my wallet does
not think so but yeah i got these ones i
have a few clothing pieces to show you i
really haven't been buying that much
clothing so yeah first two things are
from stella calm it's an australian a
boutique website so as you guys know
maybe it's still warm here like it's
still in like the 70s in california and
it kind of stays like that so i've been
learning but i got this rum / it's so so
cute it's like crochet on the top it has
little
out right there see um it flows down
into this pattern and then something I
really love is the back is like lace up
I love this so much it's so me it's so
cute I really cannot wait to and then I
got another romper from Stella com so so
cute like the same kind of colors um
looks like this I have like a fairly low
v in the front with a pattern and then
it just flows out into a flowy shorts
and it has a zipper on the back the last
few things I have to show you my got the
other day and I think they'd be really
cute outfit so i'm showing you together
but the first thing is from granny
Melville and I've noticed that skirts
that are like button-up are really
popular right now so I got this one it's
really cute it's black it's quarter boy
it has buttons up the front and then has
like little little baby pockets in the
front really cute and then I went into
abercrombie and fitch because it was a
flannel that I've been eyeing I didn't
get the flannel but i did get this shirt
and I thought it would go really well
with the skirt so it's this black and
white striped shirt and then it has like
this lace in the front or like lace-up
kind of thing going on this is also very
trendy I realized it's just like a tight
long sleeve but I figured this um
talking to the skirt would be so cute so
I got this and it seriously guys i don't
want you to ever come me anymore but I
did it for a reason like I really like
the clothes so definitely definitely
check it out so that is everything for
