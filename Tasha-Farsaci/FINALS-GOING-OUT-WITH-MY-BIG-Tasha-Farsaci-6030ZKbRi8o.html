the day of my first final exam not too
thrilled about that but I honestly kind
of just want to get it over with um so I
woke up I just put on light makeup
because I really want to go to the gym
after my final I haven't worked out in a
long time and I just feel kind of gross
so put on some white makeup basically
every Friday sorry there's like really
weird reflections going on the red car
is still parked outside my window and it
gives me the worst reflection but
anyways every Friday every sorority here
has brunch and oh my gosh I look forward
to brunch so much so it's basically just
like a huge buffet of breakfast and
lunch food and our chef makes the best
mac and cheese ever and then there's
also like an egg bar like an egg station
you can get like omelets made scrambles
made breakfast burritos made it's
honestly the best thing ever so I'm
gonna go to that and then do some like
last-minute studying for my final
because it's at 2:00 because I literally
haven't worked out at all because this
semester I took a gym class that was two
times a week and I kind of considered
that am i working out but genuinely like
that was not enough I just the recent
main reason I don't like working out
isn't the actual act of it it's just
because I sweat so much and then I have
to wash my hair and I try to like not
wash my hair as much as possible just
because I don't like the color to fade
or get brassy or anything so that's like
the main reason I don't like going the
gym but now that that workout class is
over I'm gonna have to start getting
used to going to the gym again hey guys
so I just got back from brunch I ate so
much as you think I way tell by the
photos that I put in also if you still
get that really loud noise I don't even
know what it is construction is
definitely occurring and it's super loud
but anyways before I started studying
for my final at 2 I just wanted to open
my it don't belong this gift before the
day in case you guys don't know it doe
is or if you're just starting watching
my blogs basically there's a shopping
app they have so many different stores
on there and you can shop them all right
at once on your phone if you guys use
the code Tasha you get five dollars off
and free shipping at
out which is like me handing you a $5
gift card to any of your favorite stores
because they literally have all the best
stores on there they have like oh but
Outfitters we're all free people
everything so anyways
they gave me a new box to open every day
of longest so this is day eight and I'm
excited what is this oh my gosh wait
this is so cute hmmm
oh my god guys I'm obsessed I'm obsessed
oh my gosh I really wanted this okay
it's a great shirt and it has a little
light pink heart wait till you see the
back guys I saw this on revolt I think
that's where it's from and I was like oh
wow I really want that it says
California girls do it better
oh my god I'm like myself Wow
thank you doh I'm obsessed so I wasn't
stressed up until now now it's like an
hour until the final and I'm kind of
like but there's gonna be like a little
group review session on campus like
right before I'm about to go to that but
I really just want this over with
honestly like I just want to be walking
out of there like at this point in time
I'm looking forward to going to the gym
just because I know that I'll be done
with the final guys I finished my first
final thank God honestly I don't really
know if it went too well but I'm just
happy to be done with it
yeah it's literally like a weight lifted
off my shoulders to have that one out of
the way because the only other final I
have left is Tuesday and I'm taking the
class pass no pass and currently I could
basically like not take the exam and
pass so I am really chilling so yeah I'm
about to workout I just put on some
workout clothes I literally haven't been
in the gym in so long and you let me
know if you're like me I hate seeing
people I now with a jam especially boys
and there's two gyms close to me and one
of them is nicer and newer but I refuse
to go there because I know I will see
people I know especially boys and it's
boys that I like used to talk to you or
whatever and I always see them and I'm
really sweaty and gross and it's not a
fun time so I'm trying to go to the one
it's not as popular and I'm hoping I
don't see anyone currently walking to
the gym I'm really hoping that I can do
like 30 minutes on the Stairmaster I
haven't done the Stairmaster in so so
long because like I said I had my
workout class so we'll see hi so I just
finished I'm walking back in the gym now
I actually didn't really struggle that
much and I was watching bones during it
so that helped pass the time yeah now
I'm gonna shower and I think I'm gonna
order pomades because it's free delivery
to USC this week so yeah oh you guys so
I just got back and like I said post
mates has free delivery for UFC students
this week oh gosh my hair is stuck in my
earring so I ordered cafe and I ordered
a lot or this so overpriced it's
actually really annoying so it's kind of
still expensive but I ordered a lot of
food I ordered a half a sandwich that
comes with a salad I ordered a side of
mac and cheese even though I had mac and
cheese for breakfast today and I also
ordered a blended green tea so we'll see
when it comes guys I ordered so much it
literally looks like it's for three
people but if you go to earth you need
to get their blended green tea boba but
I don't get the boba cuz I think both
was kind of weird but it's so so good so
whenever I get earth I get the chicken
curry sandwich it's super good and then
I wanted to get the mac and cheese off
the kids menu because I saw pictures of
it and I thought it looked really good
hi guys so it's a little bit later now I
eat my post mates tried my hair did my
makeup all that I got ready I'm going
out with one of my bigs and then one of
her roommates and I think my other
friend is meeting us out later but yeah
I thought I would show you guys my
outfit I think I like it I don't really
know but I'm wearing the same pants that
I wore
a few vlogs back ok so the show I'm
wearing is super super cropped normally
I like wooden wear one necessarily this
cropped but it's so hard to find things
that go with these pants so whatever I
want to sure it's from saffle and then
this belt from princess Polly and then I
wearing these jeans that are like
lace-up from Topshop I'll try and link
like all this stuff down below but then
I'm just wearing some booties from Steve
Madden so yeah this is like really
cropped but let's just go with it the
best little under ever because she's so
bomb and cool and I'm using and she's 5
foot tall outfit
