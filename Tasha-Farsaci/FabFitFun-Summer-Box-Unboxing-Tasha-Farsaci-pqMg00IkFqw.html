video or at least i think these types of
videos are fun so basically last night
when I got home from work this puppy
just had come in the mail while I was at
work and I was so excited about it and I
came upstairs to open it and I was like
wait I can't I have to film an unboxing
video so I waited until today to film
this video and unbox this and as you can
tell this is the fab fit fun box
if you guys haven't heard of fat fit fun
basically it's another one of those
subscription boxes blah blah blah like I
know there's probably a subscription box
for every single thing out there but the
reason that I was really interested in
this box is because it's fashion like
beauty and lifestyle all that stuff
combined so it's not like just nail
polish or just hair curly it's a bunch
of different stuff and as my channel is
like fashion to your lifestyle like I
thought this was fitting this is the
summer box so this is like the summer
edition I don't know what's in here so
I'm really excited to open it I feel
like unboxing videos are fun too because
you guys you always kind of feel like
you're getting it in the mail and like
even though you're not like as you're
watching the video like you feel like
you are okay so I'm going to cut it open
now with my handy zebra print scissors
and oh my god hopefully I don't cut my
hand off in the process okay so looks
like this on the inside has the cute
little logo and that it has like a
little pamphlet here and it's all
wrapped up I'm guessing this car just
like talks about what's in it and stop
with it does so I'm not going to look at
that yet because I want to be surprised
so yeah I'm gonna open this bad boy up
okay first thing I see is this the
everyday wireless speaker this is
actually very exciting because you guys
probably know I'm going to college soon
and I feel like before you go out at
night you always want to be listening to
some music but I don't want to play it
out of my phone so this looks really
cool and guys this is turquoise my dorm
room is going to be turquoise and like
magenta raspberry colored so this is
perfect actually Wow I'm excited ok the
next thing I see is the gorge gorge I'll
make you look amazing daily spray
magical leave in conditioning spray that
will turn your hair and the sexiest hair
ever okay as you can see my hair is not
the sexiest hair Roberts way because I
literally battle the shower and put some
stuff in it and me how this happened so
I need this I'll make you look amazing
Danny spray because i would like to look
amazing daily ok the next thing I see is
a tart true love lipsurgence lip gloss
looks like a really pretty kind of
bright color and i'm not a huge lip
gloss wear but I've heard really good
things about tart so maybe i will start
guys that rhymed i'm too funny ok the
next thing I see is this hello konjac
pure white I'm a little bit confused
it's a sponge ok it looks like a sponge
like it's looking quite spongy and it
says spoke soak the sponge massage your
face with it so it's like a sponge to
like soak your face with not totally
sure but we'll see alright the next
thing I see is this Vaseline intensive
care spray moisturizer alo soothe
moisturize and absorbs in seconds to
help heal dry skin ok this is really
great because i always have very dry
skin especially like my legs they get
like really like a she looking and i
know i should put on lotion but i'm kind
of lazy to like rub it all in and then
let it dry so if this just sprays on
like I definitely see myself using this
a lot so that's cool ok next thing I see
is this little bag that says brand on it
so it looks like a jewelry bag see
oh it says heart pendant all right oh so
this is actually a necklace whoo 14
karat gold dipped one point black
sapphire accent hmm all right it's in
this little plastic thing I should
probably like open it up for you guys oh
ok this is really cute i'm gonna like
get a zoomed-in of you but it's a gold
heart and then it has like a little
black stone and I've been wanting like a
dainty necklace to wear so I feel like
this will be cute and it's real gold so
that's always a plus ok the next thing I
see looks like a perfume kind of thing
it says inkling when i'm going to post
and pure fragments and essential oils
sultry for women so i kind of want to
just like open it and smell it ok so
it's definitely a rollerball it smells
good like it's not something I would
normally go for but it definitely smells
good like I will definitely be using
this I'm probably gonna put some on now
cuz I'm really sweaty in my room and I
probably smell my bad alright next thing
I see is this
I honestly can say I have no idea what
this is so I'm probably gonna cheat
always this a junk room okay I think
this is a jump rope it's just like
folded okay like now i'm ninety-nine
percent sure this is a jump rope took me
a while to figure that out but it's a
cute pink and black jump rope okay next
I see these scratch limited edition nail
wraps and these are really cool they
have like a triangle pattern on them
I've used nail like wraps once before
but I never really bought them again but
I'm definitely gonna try these out okay
next I see this little card that says
headspace on it and okay it says use
this code to get three months free
headspace I don't know why heads faces
i'm probably gonna have to check the
card for that one so we have said this
app takes you through a series of
life-changing guided meditations when
you want wherever you are it's a
must-have for a-list celebs like once
Paltrow emma watson and now you just a
quick sesh at your desk can change your
mindset and make your day okay so that's
cool I mean I've never really done yoga
and meditation me for but now's the time
to try this box is four times a year
it's not a monthly subscription but it's
like a four times a year subscription
and basically the box costs forty nine
ninety nine and then this little card
tells you like the retail price of
everything and it also tells you like
how much the box is worth so this box
was worth 275 dollars and seventy nine
cents which is awesome because if you
paid you know 4999
then you're getting a ton of stuff and
it's a lot of really cool stuff that
necklace actually retails for a hundred
dollars so that pays for the box twice
so I'm actually really excited about
everything I hope you guys found this
video I know trading I thought it was
fun so if you guys want the box or
anything I'm gonna link like the
information down below and if you want
to follow me on social media it's
fiercelytasha for my instagram as well
as my Twitter and my snapchat is tasha
far saj which is this my full name i'll
put my little like snapchat thingamajig
here so if you guys don't ought to work

like the snapchat like camera thingy so

can view my stories and stuff I update
stories like once in a while so I think
that'd be fun be sure to comment down
below what your favorite thing in the
box was in which thing that you would
want the most in the box I love you guys
