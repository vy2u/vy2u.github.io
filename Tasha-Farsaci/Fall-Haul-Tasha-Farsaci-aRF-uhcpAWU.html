video for you and I know how to do a lot
of halls and I know some people get
annoyed with it but I do go shopping
when I do have free time and I like
watching halls and I want to show you
guys the stuff that I guess so I'm doing
another haul this whole video is
basically all sweaters because not that
I was lacking in the sweater department
I just didn't really like any of mine
anymore place I went actually is really
weird and I don't know if it's around
most places but it's called alleys and
my mom wanted to win there to look for a
toaster or something weird but basically
it's a store that takes like all other
stories like things that didn't sell or
something and I didn't really think that
they'd have like anything good but I
went into like the section where I saw
like scarves and stuff if they have like
everything they have food and like dish
detergent they have like everything it's
so we went into the section with like I
saw scars and stuff and they had urban
outfitters like the BBG brand and I was
like what so first thing I picked up or
these gloves and I actually have these I
bought them when they were at Urban
Outfitters only have them in a different
color and they look like this they're
just fingerless gloves and they have
like the little top part it's buttoned
back but you can bring it on so that
their mittens and these are so cute i
really like my other ones that I have
and I think these are only 299 so that
was a really good deal they also had
urban outfitters scarves so i got this
big knit um just you know really warm
scarf like this is a scarf for warmth um
yeah so it just looks like this and this
one you can see it has like the bdg tag
but it's a crossed out and this one was
399 so such a good deal because these
are probably like thirty dollars so and
then I got one more scarf this wasn't
urban outfitters but it looked really
great and it's just like a huge thick
black one and its really large
long and yeah has like the tassels at
the end and this is super warm and I
love this and it goes with everything
and this one was also oh this one was
only 299 yeah so I don't know if Ali's
is like local or if it's a big thing but
if you have one new you or you've ever
heard of it definitely check it out
because I got some good stuff ok the
next place is bath and body works and i
really don't go into that often i'm not
a huge like lotion body wash person and
by I to a lot with our candles because
I'm basic obviously a cliq come on um I
really like them especially for the
winter i'm not one to like burn candles
in the summer and spring and stuff but
the fall in winter i love candles and
when it's cold i just want to burn
candles and they warm up my room and I
just really like them so I saw they were
having a 24 22 deal and I wouldn't I was
hoping they'd still have some other full
sense because I like those a lot more
than just like the winter sense and the
one I was mainly looking for was leaves
because that's like my favorite and I
was a lucky they did have the / but they
didn't have any of the other ones so
basically leaves smells like apples and
cinnamon to me it doesn't really smell
like leaves um I get like apple and
cinnamon and just like spices and it
smells really good I really like this
one I had this in a mini and that's why
I wanted to get it and then the other
one I got is vanilla snowflake and it
just smells like vanilla no snowflakes
but um it says fragments of creamy
vanilla wintermint and mint and a touch
of coconut so yeah I actually met a
subscriber when I was in bath and body
works so thank you for coming up to me
that was really cool I'm sorry I'm so
awkward and people come up to me but I
promise I'll oh I went to everyone and I
just got one thing I got this sweater
and it's like a ivory color and the
sleeves are just read and maybe and I'm
pretty sure they used to have one really
similar to this everybody Melville
i'm not sure i might be wrong you can
let me know but yeah it just looks like
this i got it in a large so it would be
kind of big on me i scoff his sleeves
and I think it's really cute and this
was 20 to 80 then I went to TJ maxx and
the first thing i got is just a college
sweatshirt it's syracuse which is a
college in New York if you approve it
but yeah this is just a men's and I love
college buy shirts you guys might know
so I got it it's kind of big but i like
it and it was only 16 99 which is really
good for a big sweatshirt like this TJ
maxx have roxy when i was there and i
love Roxy it's basically like a syrupy
kind of California brand and they help
sweaters and stuff and so I was really
excited so the first one is this sweater
dress kind of thing and I like this one
a lot it has a hood which i think is
super cute has like a v-neck and then
Haziq drawstrings there and it just kind
of goes down into a sweater and I think
it's really put this would be probably
like fifty dollars if I bought it from
Roxy so I thought it was a good deal I
got another Roxy sweater and this one is
like a big cardigan but i really love
they both have hoods so it has like this
nice big hood it's like this other
another heatherwood kind of material
it's just your cardigan you know pockets
but it came with a little tie so you can
tie it up and it's super long and warm
and I'm obsessed with sweaters I wear
them all the time and I love this one
and this one I actually went into um
quiksilver afterwards and they had this
in there for how much was it it was like
forty or fifty dollars and i got it for
2499 stay in the last place I went was
Marshalls which is like the same as TJ
maxx part whatever and the first thing I
god I'm actually wearing so i just got
this sweater and
really pretty it has like some cable
knit detailing and then just holes in
the sides and the arms it has like a
slit in the side and it's just really
big and loose and I got it in a large
that bigger but maroon is like my
favorite color ever i love it it's one
of my favorites and this was only like
1699 i think so it was a really good
deal for such a big wasn't TJ maxx of
american eagle sometimes too and i just
got this sure because i don't know i saw
it in american eagle and i didn't get it
but i liked it and then i went to TJ
maxx it was super cheap so it's just one
of these crop tee shirts and this one
has like stripes I think it's black and
white it might be navy and white I'm not
really sure why it's just one of the
crop tee shirts and this was only 6 99
so it was pretty good and I thought that
was pretty much a lot cheaper than it
was in american eagle south last thing
from Marshalls actually my mom's but
we're going to share it because we both
liked it and I like it a lot so i'm
going to show you guys anyways and it's
from the brand bcbg max azria or
whatever that is so it was a pretty good
find because it was only twenty-five
dollars and it's this huge concert pop
hey it's this huge poncho thing um it's
really big it's gonna look huge but I
love big sweaters with leggings and
boots it's a small medium so I don't
really know but it was a hundred fifty
dollars at bcbg okay and so it's just
this camel colored poncho thing has some
pockets and then the arms are like cable
knit or whatever but yeah I'm probably
gonna have little clips of me wearing it
so you'll see what that looks like but
this is a really good deal and it fits
me and my mom so we're gonna share those
are the things that I got
I sister I'm really sorry about the lack
of videos like I said everyone wants me
