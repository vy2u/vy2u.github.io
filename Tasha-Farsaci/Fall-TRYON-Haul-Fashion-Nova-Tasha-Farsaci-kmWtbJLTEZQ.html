haul my website called fashion number
calm they asked me to pick out a few
things from the website for a halt and I
thought this stuff was all really cute
especially for the fall time and i
decided i would show you guys so like
always i'm going to be completely honest
with everything that i bought even
though they can send me these items I've
always totally honest when I show them q
guys and let you know how I feel about
them I know I want my usual background
tapestry is no more because I moved to
California I'm actually about to move
into college and like a day and we are
in a house we rented prior to move-in so
yeah I just found this like wall oh yeah
so the tapestry will be gone for a few
months but we've got a white wall here
the first thing I have some fashion /
are these little booties and they're
really really cute i love the style of
them they're black and then just have
some sober fumbles with make a little
tiny cut out here I do really like these
boots but they're not the best quality
as you can see you can like see like
glue right there and it's really not a
big deal when I'm wearing them but if I
were is gonna buy these myself or if
they are more expensive than they are i
probably would be kind of upset but you
know it's not really noticeable and it's
only on one shoe think there's some
really cute but if you're looking for
really really good quality shoes i
probably would not recommend these but
if you're like me just want some but our
queue and they they're comfortable then
these are awesome the next thing that I
really like a lot it's this blue like
royal blue kind of shirt with some like
lace on the front and then it's really
loose and flowy it's kind of high low
and then it just has some long sleeves
and then the back is also like lacy next
time I got is a green jacket and i know
i have a few of these already but this
one doesn't have a void
so I feel like it's a little bit more of
like a fashionable jacket rather than my
one that has a hood that's more like a
jacket jacket probably makes no sense
but it's just a nice green jacket no
hood cinches into the sides some pockets
yeah I don't know I work being jackets
with like everything in the fall and
winter time so this one's really cute
and I figured why not end the way one to
my collection the next thing I got is a
tank top um it's kind of like we're
looking off it's a salt-and-pepper gray
knit halter I thought it was a tank top
on the website but I guess it's a halter
it's pretty cropped but I think it's
really cute and this can be cute in the
fall time here in LA sorry buddy green
versus those houses i have air
conditioning so like all the windows are
open and kind of hearing some weird dogs
expect anyways this will be leaked you
were like high-waisted black jeans and
then maybe like maybe that jacket I
don't know I just think it's cute I got
this green lace bra black um I don't
know how I feel about it it looks like
this um the lace isn't like really
really nice um it's not bad though it's
not a halter it's more like a Razorback
here's a better look at the lace it's
not bad but it's not like it's pretty I
think as like the one I'm wearing I
don't know I'll still definitely wear
this a lot because I wear them like
everyday next thing I got is really
pretty but it's very like thin I thought
it'd be more like a thicker material but
it's a little bit see-through it's just
a kind of three quarter length sleeve
top and it's really cool because it like
crosses over and then like drapes
underneath my office next Rossmore for
like nighttime going out and college and
stuff and I actually got it happened
because at the bottom of it was like a
weird ahem it was kind of like a warrior
II hem I didn't know like how so I got
that hemmed off so if you're interested
in this just be know that it's like wiry
at the bottom but it's just this lace
top dress and then
down into a black skirt and the back is
really cool it's like open and then
these little ties will tie like at your
back and put yeah I think it's really
Hugh this will be really nice for
nighttime and I'm not a fan of like
tight dresses bodycon dresses off so I
time to like to get things that are more
Chloe's and it was hard to find things
that are more like nighttime that are
not tight so I was really glad that I
found this I think it's a really really
creamy blush i got i'm really excited
about because I've wanted one of these
for a while so it's just one of those
like denim vests with like a sweat shirt
underneath so yeah it looks like this
and I just had the sweat shirt sleeves I
think these are Hugh I think with like a
black t-shirt dress or actually just
like any t-shirt dress this would be
cute for the fall with like a necklace
or something the less I have compassion
on what I can't even show because my
mommy pack is somewhere in our bags and
I can't even find it somewhere buried
within all my pack things for college
but I'm never like a little picture of
them here pretty much what they are is
just like those little like silicone
like nipple covers or if you don't want
to wear like a sticky ball because you
can't have like anything shown here if
it's like a literally low fee or
anything like you don't want to dip oh I
got these little things I think they're
gonna be really handy for certain
outfits and fashion Norma had like a few
kind of things like that so yeah you
never seen those before they're really
helpful and I decided I should pick some
of those up p for college I hope you
