today for the first day of school and
today's September 8th so I go back kind
of later than most people but I leave
there were people I get out I'd like the
end of June so yeah kind of evens out
and it really sinks it's raining this
morning like really hard and I have to
walk my bus stop so that's gonna be
interesting but um yeah the first day of
school I don't really like to dress
really like fancy I know a lot of people
like to wear dresses and skirts and
stuff but I kind of like to keep it
casual because I don't like it to look
like I'm trying too hard you know but if
you like wearing skirts and dresses
that's cool too
um so yeah I'm just gonna show you what
I'm wearing okay so the first thing
you're wearing is this brown top and
it's really cute it has like this super
pretty floral pattern on it like purples
and greens and I just kind of belted it
with my brown skinny belt and put like
this I'm the green color tank top
underneath it so that I was pick enough
for school
we need like two fingers so that's good
I really like the shape of this top I
love like the top neckline and stuff and
yeah so then on the bottom I'm just
wearing my favorite skinny jeans
these are actually from Abercrombie kids
which is so crazy I'm really small but I
can fit into like their biggest size
there's like 16 kids which is really
embarrassing but yeah I love their jeans
so yeah my hair is just demonstrate
obviously and I'm wearing my rings this
is my blue turquoise one my opal and
then this other turquoise one on my
nails is the chili dog purple color to
kind of match the shirt and I'm just
wearing some diamond studs for shoes I'm
wearing these flip-flops with the same
purple that's in this shirt these are
from American Eagle this shirt was um I
don't know where it's from I got in
California this 10 caps with fur between
one so was the belt and the jeans like I
said ever economy kids and these were
from American Eagle so yeah I hope you
guys liked that as you can see to kind
of move some stuff around in my back I
wonder they I felt like my coat rack
there instead of a chair that used to be
there and the Zac I found posters gone
which is very sad but it was getting
kind of old yeah so if you guys have any
questions for me be sure to leave them
in the comments down below and I'm gonna
start doing out for the week so my
outfits that I wear in the school week
I'll put together and then upload
probably unlike Saturday or something
I'm not gonna do it this week because it
is Wednesday and then although maybe
like a three day out for the week and
then this is one of them so I think I'm
gonna kind of just do it next week um so
yeah I hope you guys like this tell me
how you like my outfit and yeah so I
hope you guys liked this video and I
hope your school years going well or if
