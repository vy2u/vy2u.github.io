school today September 5th hopefully I
can get this up today but we'll see so
what I'm gonna be doing is my first day
of school vlog I asked you guys in my
last video if you wanted one of these
and a lot of you guys said yes so I
decided I would do one okay so in that
video I told you guys I'm gonna be a
sophomore in high school this year and
that's 10th grade if you don't live in
the US and you don't know that or
whatever so yeah I'm in tenth grade and
I actually went into the high school
this year which is weird because
normally high school is 9th 10th 11th
12th but mine's just 10th 11th Sidwell I
don't know why I think all of our kids
wouldn't fit in this school because I
have a class of 500 kids which I think's
a lot so having 2,000 kids in one school
would be a little much so yeah anyways
it's only three grades so this year was
my first year I also told you guys I'm
really bad with directions and finding
my way around places so I was pretty
nervous for today well I wasn't really
nervous I mean I knew I was gonna get
lost and I wasn't the only one obviously
so I kind of just went in like whatever
you know so before I tell you about my
day I guess I'll read you my schedule
cuz I don't know then you guys will know
what I'm going through if you guys are
taking any of the same classes of me let
me know now a lot of my classes are in
advanced or they're actually 11th grade
classes because I'm accelerated um so
yeah if you guys are in tenth grade I
might not be taking the same classes as
you but we'll see so first period I have
AP World History which is my least
favorite class so I don't know if it's a
good thing that it's in the first
beginning of the day but basically it's
awful I hate it I had to take the first
part of it last year I am just really
bad at social studies I cannot pay
attention somehow I came out with a 97
last year I don't know I think my
teacher liked me but anyways um it's
really bad but Chris your grades so your
overall grade will be higher because
you're in an AP class so at least that's
how it is for me so I'm thinking a
second half of that this year and I have
an AP test on it and a Regents at the
end of the year which sucks then I have
Honors English second period and I like
English probably one of my best subjects
so I don't mind honors
I took that last year as well so that's
okay third I have drawing and painting
which is fun I like art it's something
I'm good at
I'm not really great at that many things
that sounds so pathetic but like
honestly like I'm not very athletic I
mean I run I'm okay at running but when
it comes to like coordination and like
sports in general I'm just not that
great I used to play soccer but I don't
do that anymore so it's what I'm good at
and I like it so I took that then I have
algebra two and trig once again another
accelerated class that's normally I'm in
11th grade class but I'm taking it this
year
so you know whatever I'm pretty good at
math so I shouldn't have a problem with
that then I have lunch fifth sixth I
have either gym or a chemistry lab
because they're interchangeable segments
they have the other half of chemistry so
every other day I'll have two periods of
time streams which oh guys I am awful
like I know I just started it but I've
actually done a little chemistry before
in seventh grade we've had a little
chemistry I sucked and in last year we
had some chemistry in my biology class
like biochem I sucked so this will be
interesting but my teacher seems really
nice so that's okay um I have health
it's mandatory I've taken health like
three times in my life already I don't
know why I have to take it again I
already watched the miracle of life
movie which was not good I don't want to
watch it again but I have to and that's
only half the year the second half of
the year I have a study hall I was gonna
take fashion design which were going so
much fun but they cut it like seriously
of course the year I was gonna take it
they cut it and that would have been in
place my study hall but whatever and
then last period I was finished three
which I don't remember any Spanish
master maybe like my food vocabulary cuz
food its food at my food but if they
think I'm gonna be able to conjugate my
bird it's in crab it's not gonna happen
like all she was doing is talking in
Spanish and I was just like okay see oh
like I had no idea so don't get too
excited about me like telling you how
lost I get and then me just sitting in
the hallways crying and stuff because
that can happen I really didn't get that
loss which I know is really weird but
something did happen
extremely annoying so first period was
my homeroom period um a people whoo but
anyways we really didn't do much today
all she told us was you know about the
classes and all that stuff and we also
got to burglar lockers so I really
didn't plan on using my locker too much
this year because they let us carry our
bags around which I've never been able
to do before so I'm just gonna pile my
crap in it and see if I can carry it
around with me um so I went to my locker
and my lockers every year are terrible
if you knew me last year you would know
me from my locker like it was hideous it
had been sand nasty and like stuff all
over it but that's because it was it was
like a devil it was evil it was alive or
something because it would always jam
and it wasn't me I wouldn't actually
have stuff and it just wouldn't open and
I have to kick it constantly for it to
open
it was awful I mean people thought I was
like a scumbag like they wouldn't know
it was me and then they'd walk on my
locker they'd be like Oh whose Locker is
that that's me I'm sweating waves I have
a bad experience with Locker so I was
hoping out of a good locker this year so
I when I put my combination and it
wouldn't open it just like wasn't moving
at all I was like seriously so I didn't
like five times and I couldn't do it and
then I asked another girl to help me and
she couldn't do it so then I asked my
teacher and she couldn't do it so she
was like okay well you're gonna have to
go down to the mean office and have them
help you you can remind me after class I
was like okay I guess I mean I didn't
know where I was going
like whatever so the end of class comes
the bell rang and I was like crap well I
still have my second period here but I
was like okay whatever so she gave me a
pass I found my way to the office
the school is three floors by the way
and my luck was on the top floor which
sucks because I only have two classes up
there so anyways I made my way down
there I was like told the lady I'm like
well my locker went up and she's like
okay have a seat so I frickin sat in the
main office for like 25 minutes and I
was like what the crap is going on here
like I was missing my whole second
period and like it was English it was
like the first day of English like I
didn't want to miss it you know and I
was just sitting there and sitting there
and staying there and finally I was like
staring at one of the ladies cuz there
was two but I was staring at the other
one the head and talk to me she's like
um can I help you like they weren't even
gonna do anything about it so I was like
yeah okay so she asked me what my locker
wasn't she typed it in she's like oh
well this one was deactivated what
seriously my locker was deactivated but
it was never activated but what why does
this happen
so then she took like ten minutes she's
like on the phone with her people like
oh I don't care if his girl's late to
her class or whatever and she finally
just got me a new Locker but it's not
like the same place as my old Locker
it's like a different place I'm gonna
say before so I don't know him next to
whatever but I missed basically all of
my second period there was like five
minutes left and I finally got it man
yeah the rest of the day wasn't that bad
lunch I got in there laughs because I'm
on the top floor lunch is on the bottom
and it takes forever to get there and
then where all my friends are sitting
was filled so I walked around like a
loner with one of the girls trying to
find somewhere to stay and then we
finally just had to sit with like I
don't know random people alone for a
while and then some of our friends came
over and sat with us but it was so
annoying like I'm gonna have to sprint
there tomorrow something kind of
interesting about this here is for the
classes that I take that are a year
older than me so like the chemistry and
trig I'm actually with the kids older
than me so I walk through the trig right
and I have friends in that class that's
actually the class way I have friends
like I don't have friends in most of my
classes this year like my two best
friends I have no classes with which
sucks like seriously I always have
classes with that man I don't so most of
my classes I know people but we're not
friends or anything so my one class were
actually had some pretty good friends
and I walked in I was the first one in
there out of my friends and it was all
juniors I was like oh god what so
there's only seven sophomores in my
class and everyone else are juniors and
there's like 25 kids in the class so
it's crazy so that's kind of weird but
it's different because I'm so sick of
having the same people and I mean I
don't have hot guys in my grade and then
 you and your class has hot guys so
you know oh yeah I'm please stressed out
about this I already have homework and I
have so much stuff to get and I don't
know how I'm gonna get to my locker
because I don't even know where it is
but I mean I guess this day wasn't that
bad or anything I filmed an outside of
the day my outfits not that not that
interesting you can kind of see it now
but I films not for the day I'm gonna
have my three outfits from the first
week in and out for the week kind of
like a mini one so stay tuned for that I
kind of like doing vlogs I want
a long channel though I mean I don't
know I don't like having separate
accounts for stuff like okay I just made
a separate Twitter account for my real
life personal Twitter for my friends to
follow me on this firm just if you guys
were wondering that cuz I talked about
on Twitter a little band I was trying to
delete all my tweets on Twitter this is
a really off topic but I wanted to just
start fresh with my Twitter because I
was having like a lot of mixing between
my friends and my subscribers which is
okay I love you guys I think of you as
friends but then some people were like
following my friends and like tweeting
them about me like kind of weird stuff
and I mean I don't know it's just kind
of like weird like you guys aren't weird
but some of my friends weren't totally
okay with that so I just decided I would
make one for me and make one for YouTube
so I'm not gonna be tweeting other
people that I know in real life on my
Twitter anymore long story short I don't
know why I'm airing this in here but
anyways I'm just gonna wrap this vlog up
that's what happened me that was my
schedule that's pretty much what
happened um let me know if you're taking
any of the same classes as me so we can
suffer together especially if you live
in New York State because we can take
Regents together if you want to do a
video on your first day of school or
talking about your first day of school
leave it as a video response because
it's a very high chance that it will
watch it you know so yeah that's what
happened to me hope you guys enjoyed
this if you like vlogs let me know maybe
I'll make a vlog channel but separate
accounts really confuse me so we will
see about that but yeah okay bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
