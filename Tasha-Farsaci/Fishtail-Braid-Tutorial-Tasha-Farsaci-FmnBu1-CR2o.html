me about a fishtail braid hair tutorial
and I actually have one it was one of my
first videos I ever did and I was
thinking of you know tying people oh I
already have one but then I realized
that I really didn't want them to watch
it because it's kind of embarrassing it
was back when my parents didn't know
about my channel so I was really quiet
and it was just it was awkward but now
that I have my new camera I figured that
I would we film it just so I can kind of
show you guys a little bit more into
depth how I would do it this is a pretty
easy hairstyle you're gonna need a lot
of patience this took me about ten
minutes to do but you have to remember
that I do have a lot of hair it's really
long and it's really thick so that's why
but this can be done on all hair types
which is awesome it's actually kind of
hard to do it on store your hair which I
did today with my straight hair but it
is doable it's just kind of hard if your
hair is really smooth because it like
slips a little bit but with curly hair
and wavy here this is great even with
really frizzy hair it really masks like
the frizziness so this is a great
hairstyle um yeah so I'll kind of show
you guys mine close-up this is what a
fishtail braid looks like if you haven't
seen one before they're really really
cool-looking and they're actually really
really easy so yeah I hope you guys like
this and keep watching for the tutorial
ok so the first step is to bring all
your hair to one side of your head it
doesn't really matter what side or you
can also do it to the back but I can't
even do that and if you guys are just
learning how to do this I would suggest
doing it to the side so I'm gonna bring
it to my left side um you know personal
preference but that's just the side I
like to do it on okay so now I have all
my hair on my left side of my head
you're gonna want to make sure it's
brushed out and smooth it doesn't matter
what hair texture you have might happens
to be straight today but I actually
think this works a lot better when your
hair has texture because it likes to
stay I normally do do this with my
natural hair but I really want to do
this video today
and my hair just happened to be straight
so I'm going to do it on this I'm going
to come really close now so you guys can
kind of see how I do the braid okay so
when you're doing a fishtail braid you
actually only used two pieces instead of
three for a normal braid which a lot of
people don't know because a fishtail
braid looks so intricate but it's
actually really easy so what you're
gonna do is get your two sections we're
gonna call these sections and I'm gonna
also call some certain things pieces so
you'll see what I mean these are
sections so starting with either one of
your sections I'm gonna start with the
one closest to my neck you're going to
take a small piece from the outside of
it the side that's farthest away from
the other section which would be this
side a small piece you're going to cross
it over that section and add it to the
other one like so then with this
opposite section that you just added the
other piece to you're gonna take a piece
from the outside of that one that is the
same size from the first piece cross it
over that section and add it to the
opposite one whenever you're doing this
hairstyle make sure you pull really
tightly or else it's just going to kind
of flop around and look loose so then
once again you're going to take a small
piece from the outside of one of the
sections the next one and I cross it
over that section and add it to the
other section and then once again pull
so a piece from the outside of the
section cross it over that section and
add it into the other one piece cross
add the beginning of this braid is
actually the hardest so if you can get
past the beginning it's really easy from
there it's even hard for me especially
with my hair being straight today so
take a piece cross it and add it in so
I'm gonna speed this up and I'm gonna go
a little further down so you guys can
kind of see the how it looks once I go
further
okay so as you can see we're starting to
get the nice fish tell effect I'm gonna
do it one more time up close take a
piece on the outside cross it over into
the other section my cameras going wacko
okay so now I'm gonna finish and then
I'll come back to show you how to finish
it off okay so as you can see I'm pretty
far down my hair now I have a ton of
hair so it is taking me a lot longer
than real probably take you but once you
get to the bottom you want to make sure
you're using very small sections because
it can start to look like a regular
braid and you can go down as far as you
want just personal preference for me I
like to go down as far as I can I like
to use these little rubber bands and
then just tie it off like so okay so now
I have finished my braid it's kind of
wavy and wittily so you're gonna kind of
want to play with it and pull it just a
little bit to kind of get it to how you
like it and maybe loosen it up a little
bit but all-in-all
that's how you do a fishtail braid I'll
show you it close-up now sorry I hope
you guys liked this video I hope it
helped you and if you try it out let me
know down below and I hope it works oh
yeah
