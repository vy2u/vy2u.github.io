just burn
hey guys so today I am coming to you
with another braided hair tutorial I
know you guys love these I love doing
these just because they're pretty easy
and they are awesome inspiration for
hair ideas today I'm doing the four
strand braid I love this one because it
looks super intricate and they're very
difficult but it's not as you will see
later on
I love braids because a lot of the times
this type of year especially mid year in
school I'll be like oh yes I'm gonna
subway along I'm gonna wake up we're
gonna comb my hair I'm gonna look
awesome
and then my mom goes off in the morning
and I'm like no yeah so a braid is
normally what happens the great part is
you can do this with any hair texture I
just chose to straighten my hair so it'd
be easiest to see in the tutorial what I
was doing but you can use any hair
texture that you have to do this braid
you're only I need three things for this
hair tutorial you'll need a brush a hair
tie and also a little mini hair tie it
doesn't have to be but I just prefer to
tie off my braids with little baby ones
as you will know later on in the video
but three things you have to have to
have to have I'm going through this hit
of style are over under over if you can
remember those three words you can't do
this brain so if you won't know how I do
a braid like this keep on watching okay
so as for most hair tutorials the first
thing I'm going to
by doing its brushing my hair out
because you really don't want any
tangles especially when you're doing a
braid because if you get a tangle in the
middle of your brain you're like trying
to rip the knot out while you're doing
it you could mess up your whole braid
and that would be very sad so just take
my budge I'm going to brush through my
hair and once again and make sure I
don't have any tangles before I start
the hairstyle okay so this next step
depends entirely on how advanced you are
and how you want your braid to look so I
find that putting your hair into a
ponytail before you stuck this braid
makes it a whole lot easier it keeps all
the hair in one section it doesn't like
fly all around and it just is a lot
easier for beginners it keeps everything
in one spot and I definitely recommend
it if you're starting out so that's what
I'm going to be doing for this video but
once again if this is in your taste or
you just are too advanced to be starting
off with a hair tie then you don't have
to okay so my to tie the little
deformity but as you can see I'm using a
color that's close to my hair color
because you want it to kind of one day
and as much as possible unless you want
it to be like totally out there matching
your outfit or whatever but I'm just
using this kind of tan colored one
because it matches my blonde hair once
again I want my braids to be on this
side and pretty low so that's where I'm
going to be making my ponytail
okay so since this is a four strand
braid we're gonna split our hair into
four sections and this is where the
ponytail kind of comes in handy because
all your sections are in one area and
you're not losing them all over your
head try to make your sections as even
as possible I know this isn't gonna be
perfect but you know to try and make
them as even as you can okay so once you
have your four sections you're gonna
want to kind of number them just to make
things easier so this outside section is
gonna be one this one or years - this
one's three and the one closest to my
face is four so here is where you want
to remember the over under over
technique that I told you before taking
section one you're gonna go over section
two on nerd section three and over
section four and that's actually all you
do the whole time so I'm going to show
you again removing section two
under Section three
over Section four
for section two
under Section three and over Section
four and just make sure you're
tightening the grade after each little
round just because it creates a nicer
more put together a fact and you can
always loosen it after over
under
and you can see with citing to get the
really cool four strand effect
okay so once I dive into about this spot
I like to just kind of end the braid by
tying it off with my Pole elastic
you can go down further if you like but
I just find that it gets a little more
difficult once you get closer to the
bottom and I think this is a good amount
to leave at the end so this is just
where I stopped I personally don't like
my brains to be super tight and just
like constricted to my head so what I'm
gonna do is just pull out a few sections
with the sides I have like these little
baby hairs that I like to pull out and
then I just kind of loosen up here as
you can see the braid looks super
awesome I absolutely love it and you
really can't see that your tie at all so
if you're kind of worried about that you
really can't see it and the braid I just
think looks super cool and after that I
am all done so I really hope you guys
