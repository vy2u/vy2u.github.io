tutorial that I've already done before
and I know I keep doing that but really
this one is a really great one and I
feel like it hasn't got a lot of use so
I kind of wanted to refill it with my
new camera and kind of like expose more
of you to it because it works on all
hair lengths my hair is really really
long but this works on any length of
hair and it's also super quick and easy
like honestly this is very very easy and
it can take me like 30 seconds to do
this in the morning so if you don't know
what to do with your hair you don't want
it in your face this is perfect so
basically what it is is just like a
twist but you add in hair as you do it
so it kinda looks like a French twist
kind of thing and I don't know if you
can see this but I think it's really
pretty and it's kind of interesting
looking but it's super super easy I
didn't really pin mine too well in the
back so I probably wouldn't have liked
all this extra hanging right here but um
depending on how you want to finish it I
kind of just end however what's is
really really easy and yeah so I hope
you guys enjoy this and keep watching
okay so all you need to know how to do
for this hairstyle is basically that
twist kind of thing that you think known
for ever probably will you take two
sections of your hair and just kind of
like twist them around each other I'm
pretty sure like everyone knows how to
do this and if you don't it's super easy
to just twist them around each other and
if you know how to do that you should be
able to get this hairstyle it is really
easy so now I'm just going to kind of
scoot closer so you guys can see what
I'm doing okay I apologize if I look
really gross right now I just got back
from track practice like ten minutes ago
so um yeah I haven't had a chance like
shower or anything but anyways um what
you're going to do is just take a little
bit of hair from the top of your head
like this much and split it into two
sections and you're going to just start
like twisting it by putting the top
section over the back one you know and
then you're going to have this little
bottom section and normally if you kept
twisting you just bring it over and keep
doing that what you're going to do is
add in a little bit of hair from the
front and then cross it over like you
normally would
okay so then you have a little piece
down here once again and you're adding a
little bit of hair in and then crossing
it over and this game is like a really
kind of like French twist effect which
is like what I like to call this
hairstyle so once again I have the
bottom add a little bit cross it up and
over
and you're just going to keep doing this
it's really really easy and it goes by
pretty fast once you're doing it
and then we're two to about here you can
just kind of finish it off with a
regular twist and I really don't really
know what to do once I get to here so I
usually just pin it back um with a bobby
pin
okay so once you pinned it back it
should look something like this it's a
really cool looking you have like hair
coming up from the bottom but you still
have that kind of twist effect and this
literally takes like a minute if you
want to do it in the mornings for school
it's perfect and it gets the hair out of
your face because I know especially in
like classes and stuff I hate my hairs
in my face so once again this is just a
really really quick hairstyle and I
really like it so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
