ready with me before you guys get
confused and I'm asking why a college
student is doing this I know a lot of
you guys are still in high school and
are attending prom so I wanted to show
you what I would wear and how I would do
my hair and makeup if I were quite a
problem so yes this is the hair and
makeup that I would do if I were still
in high school and were attending prom
this year I actually teamed up with JC
Penney for this video so we are
sponsoring this video thank you so much
to them this amazing dress that I am
wearing I will show you more in a clip
here this is from JC Penney's prom shop

but they're also really really trendy
and beautiful so on March 17th JC Penney

Penney stores the first 40 people that
visit the JC Penney prom shop will

super great offers and deals that you
can use throughout the store you can get
free prom and hair consultations from
the JC Penney salon and free mini
makeover is from the sephora area and
side of JC Penney which who doesn't want
a mini makeover
yeah so I know a problem could be a
super stressful time and it's really
like chaotic and Jacek ladies just
trying to make it easier so you guys
should totally check that out I will be
linking to JC Penney prom shelf down
below in the description so totally go
down there and click and check them out
I am going to be doing a little giveaway
at the end of this video so you guys
should totally stay and and you can win
a prom dress it's either this one or
another one so stay tuned until the end
yes so anyways I feel like it went
blabbing so so much but this is how I
would do my hair and makeup if I were
going to prom now it's pretty natural
it's pretty close to what I would wear
normally but it's still a little bit a
little bit extra so if you guys want to
know how I would do this or get
inspiration for your prom looks please
keep watching okay guys hello Here I am
fresh-faced
straight out of the shower I'm gonna go
ready for my glow up if you guys are oh
gee view Aries and you saw my get ready
with me for prom back when I actually
was going to prom you would remember
that I woke up with a giant pimple right
in the middle of my forehead
and when I say giant I'm not
exaggerating it was huge let me know if
you remember that but luckily I don't
have that today so I'm gonna start off
by priming my face because if you guys
are going to prom obviously you want
your makeup to last as long as possible
and look as fog well it flown flawless
as possible for photos and for your date
and whatnot so I just came back from
Mexico so all my makeup is still in this
traveling pouch so I'm gonna like dig in
here and try to find everything okay so
lately I've been using the hydro blur
primer from Dermalogica so I'm just
gonna put this all over my face but
focusing it on my nose and forehead and
just like areas that I feel like okay
oily or are just more of my problem
areas for my face I know it's always get
so rad if you guys watch my vlogs you
know that
so priming my nose is a must for me okay
so on a normal day I'm not really a
foundation tinted moisturizer wearer but
because this is prom we're talking about
I'm gonna put on this smashbox
camera-ready
BB cream this is what i use if i do want
my skin to look a little bit more
flawless so hopefully this is still my
color I got a little bit Tanner in
Mexico I mean we burned but yes I'm
gonna put this on with a damp Beauty
Blender so my face looks flawless or as
flawless as it can look
take a sip of my coffee isn't this the
cutest mug ever it's from Urban
Outfitters okay so I really didn't put
that much BB cream on because I am one
to like more if it even is of a natural
finish but you can still kind of see
like my freckles and stuff through but I
didn't put a little bit on and then I'm
going to put some concealer this is my
OG favorite concealer it is the
maybelline instant age rewind I'm gonna
put this under my eyes on my nose and
just any other spots I kind of want to
highlight and cover up it everyone looks
so crazy when they're doing concealer
like what the heck okay taking my Beauty
Blender once more I am just going to
blend this into the BB cream and into my
face
okay so once I have my concealer one
today I'm going to keep it I can't speak
I'm gonna set everything with a pressed
powder so the one I have currently it's
a Neutrogena Healthy Skin pressed powder
looks like so and like I said I'm just
going to put that all over my face to
set all of that BB cream and concealer
okay so once my face is all powdered up
I'm going to start working on my
eyebrows this is the longest part of my
makeup procedure so bear with me
basically I start out by spoiling
bullying them if you guys have seen any
of my makeup videos before I'm just
gonna be doing the same thing for that
cuz you why your eyebrows look fleeky
for prom am i right
basically this is the NYX micro brow
pencil I'm used to using the honest Asya
one or a benefit one but I ran out of
both and target was all this nearby me
and this is actually really really great
so I'm using this in the color taupe and
I'm filling in the front part of my
eyebrow is kind of drawing more of a
precise line and then after I use this I
fill in the edges with the anasazi and
it brought pomade okay I brought you
guys a bit closer so as you can see I
kind of just drew a line under my
eyebrow and then I started to fill it up
and then like I said I fill in the rest
so that is what I'm currently doing
okay so once my eyebrows are all filled
in I'm setting them with my ratchet
eyebrow gel this is an even eyebrow gel
this is what I've used for the entire
time I've ever used eyebrow gel so if
you guys have a recommendation if for
one that's not this let me know I mean I
do like this but this is just the
Maybelline Great Lash mascara that's
clear I've always used this as an
eyebrow gel but I feel like that's not
what it's meant for so maybe an actual
eyebrow gel will be better I don't know
but you want to set these puppies in
place because when you're moving a group
in on that dance floor why do I sound
like an old person oh my gosh anyways
you don't want someone to like pick your
eyebrows and then be like not thinking
anymore so we're gonna plop this stuff
on this bottle is almost out but I
basically just comb my eyebrows into the
place where I want them to be it's
pretty self-explanatory this is just a
good way to make her eyebrows look a
little more defined and stay in place
okay so now that I'm done with eyebrows
I'm going to move on to my eye shadow
since the dress I'm wearing has gold
detailing I kinda wanted to like a
shimmery gold eyeshadow look I don't
want it to be super dramatic I know
that's what I did at my prom but I feel
like if I were going to prom an hour I'd
want it to be a little bit more natural
so I'm taking this Becca palette my aunt
actually got me this so in Dena if
you're watching this I really doubt you
are but if you are thank you for this
Becca palette it's amazing and all my
friends are obsessed with it but it has
these really really pretty shimmery
colors and I want to use like these
golden ones so okay so I'm basically
just gonna mix these two shades and kind
of make it just a nice pretty gold color
and I'm gonna put that all over my lid
these colors are so pretty if you have a
tan and they're pretty if you don't have
a tan but oh my gosh I just love them so
much for the summer and it just looks so
pretty so I think they're perfect for
prom okay and then I'm gonna take this
lighter shade here is still like kind of
a gold color and I'm just gonna place
that on the center
it's just to add a little bit of
dimension no I'm gonna do it please
color but I kinda just want this
eyeshadow look to just be a little more
natural and shimmery so I think I'm just
gonna leave it like that on the lid I'm
going to blend a bit that's all so the
good thing about this look is since it's
so natural and light you don't have to
blend a lot I hate blending okay and
because all the eyes are so shimmering I
kind of wanted to do a matte eye brow
highlight and corner highlight so I'm
just taking my naked 2 palette and I'm
taking foxy it's just this matte beige
color and yeah like I said I'm just
gonna put this under my eyebrows and
then I'm also going to put it on my
inner corners and while I have this eye
shadow out okay guys I'm gonna be honest
I really don't know how to contour and
highlight so I just kind of put off
places sometimes I hope for the best so
don't yell at me I'm gonna take that
same color and just put it a little bit
on the tip of my nose and up the bridge
of my nose okay now for eyeliner I would
love to do a nice winged eyeliner but I
can't I wouldn't be honest with you I
could not do it to save my life I can
1/2 to 1 I like a little bit it looks
kind of decent from far away but if I'm
trying to do both just doesn't work so
if you guys are skilled do winged
eyeliner because I think it's so pretty
but I can't so I'm just gonna do a nice
medium slightly maybe a little bit thick
line on my upper lash line okay so once
I've done that I'm going to put a little
bit on my lower lash line but for this
I'm using Urban Decay's I pencil a 2-0
they swoons a little West potent so
that's why I'm using this one but I tend
to focus it on the outer half of my
lower lash line I don't put it all the
way in because that really makes me kind
of look how I looked in sixth grade like
a raccoon
it looks good on you go for it yeah so
I'm just going to kind of put it like I
said the lower lash line / waterline
okay so now once I've done that it's
time for mascara you guys can totally
totally wear fake eyelashes I would
except when I wear them I've said this
before I think I look like a hooker not
even just saying that like I don't like
myself with fake eyelashes I like myself
with eyelash extensions but not fake
eyelashes so I'm sure but I would wear
them I recommend wearing them if you
like how you look in them I guess that's
kind of self-explanatory but I'm going
to apply the falsies by Maybelline so
it's supposed to give me that effect
okay so once I am done with mascara I'm
going to add some blush and highlight
I'm not a huge contour girl I really
don't know how to do it very well if I
did once again I would probably try it
out but I'm not that great so I'm just
gonna take NARS orgasm on my cheeks and
then back out highlighter and opal on my
cheekbones so I'm just putting NARS
orgasm the apples of my cheeks and then
I'm taking the highlighter and putting
it on my cheekbones
I just wanted this to be a really really
glowy look I'm not normally a huge fan
of lip products but I recently got this
lip gloss from pixie and I'm obsessed
with it it's so pretty I don't know if
you can tell but it's like a rose gold
color it's in the color cake filled with
icing in cake but I'm just gonna put
this on totally goes with the whole like
glowy vibe
and then I think I'll must have
especially for prom or events that
you're going to be out late at it is the
Urban Decay all nighter makeup setting
spray so I'm just going to set my makeup
okay so now it's time to tackle the mess
that is my hair
oh my guys so I'm curling my bathroom
hopefully this lighting is not too gross
but as you can see my hair is just
pretty wavy and I think if I turn like
this you guys can see the back oh yeah
here's the back of my hair so as you can
see it gets really really wavy I am
gonna curl my hair over at first I'm
just gonna straight in this top part and
these underneath parts because I don't
want it to be like that and then curled
if that makes sense
okay so I kind of just like running
straightener over these pieces for a
while until they look tired want them to
look when I curl it that makes any sense
police now that it's dry in the top
portion of my hair I'm gonna start
curling it the curling iron I use is
this new me three-in-one curling iron I
believe this is a one and a quarter inch
but I basically just curled us away from
the face all away from my face Oh over
my head so I'm gonna do that I basically
just section off half of each side so
I'll put the top part up do the back
bring it down so and so you know what
I'm saying
like I said I just take pieces about
this big here wrap them
I hold them for don't know about till
been about the fall and I will do my
hand for a bit as they cool down just to
kind of like lock in the curl I guess
there is that one so I'm gonna do a lot
of my head I feel you guys kind of know
what I'm doing but once I get towards
the end I will come back ok so I did all
my hair I'm just on like the last front
section right now but like I said I just
did the same thing all the way around
just curled it away from my face boys so
I am gonna burn myself I should be using
the key protection club but too lazy so
here we go it looks like this this is
how I always call my hair I just think
it's really really flattering and like
super pretty and this is what it looks
like from the back I'm just gonna take
this not your mother's double-take
finishing texture spray and spray the
same kind it was like a hair spray sort
of thing
and yeah that's good for hair okay guys
