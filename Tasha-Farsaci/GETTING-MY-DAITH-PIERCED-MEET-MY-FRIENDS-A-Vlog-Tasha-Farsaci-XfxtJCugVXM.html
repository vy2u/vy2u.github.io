you know the one
photos are my dubiously Oh sir okay so
I'm back in my room out uh-huh
I don't know if we got any footage
because the piercers assistant said
there was no video taking so I don't
know about that but I'm gonna be
completely honest with you guys like
I've had my cartilage my tragus
I bet my cartilage done like three times
and it kept getting affected so I
finally went to like a piercing salamba
get it done I've always gone I used to
go to like Klara's and places like that
like don't do that if you're getting
anything other than Loeb is like
seriously you have to go to like a
piercing Salaam I'm telling you but
anyways
I've had like all those done I say I
have a pretty high pain tolerance and
this one hurt really badly um I said
that I gave it like the guy asked me
he's like Oh what was it out of ten and
I said seven um but then I think it was
like the shop owner I don't know she I
don't know if she owned it I worked
there why but she was like oh like I
gave it a 9 out of 10 when I got done
she's like have you had kids yet and I
was like uh no no I haven't and she's
like yeah I mean honestly like I
compared it to childbirth I was like ah
so at least I wasn't just me that
thought it hurt but um I really liked it
I don't know if you can like see that
well cuz the lighting is not that great
but I got gold with like a white opal oh
and also I guess it's called like Daath
and not death which is weird cause it's
totally spelled Dave B but like all of
them at the place called it goth or
something so oops
yeah but I think I have a pretty small
job um he said that and so I don't know
I know I have like a small tragus too
but still got him pierced so I'm alive
just thought I'd let you guys know um
hey guys so it's actually two days later
and I know I'm wearing the same thing so
let's not judge me um anyways I figured
I'd show you the piercing with actually
good quality because I stole the iPhone
5 and I know probably the quality in
this whole vlog has been horrible but I
am getting the iPhone 6s once it's back
in stock for Virgin Mobile's so you know
if I vlog in the future it'll be better
quality but I figured I'd show you the
piercing piercing after two days um I've
been cleaning it so hopefully it looks
okay but I figured I'd show you with
better quality okay so as you can see
this is what it looks like I got a rose
gold um hoop and then it's a white opal
and I can like touch it it like hurts a
little bit but it's not bad
um I think it's really cute as you can
see it's pretty thick and that is like
all through my ear so I guess that's why
it hurts so bad but yeah that's what it
looks like and while I'm at it I guess
I'll show you my tile bare like
piercings because I have my tragus like
I said and then I also have my cartilage
and this one has like um a blue opal I
don't know if you can really see it I
always feel like you can't see it but
that and then the tragus and these are
like completely healed now I got them
like 6 or 7 months ago so yeah okay so
in case you guys live in the LA area and
you're wondering who pierced me and
whatnot like I said it's a kink monkey
anyways this is the guy's card
yeah but basically his name is Thomas
I'm pretty sure he's the only piercer
there so yeah and I'm thinking of
getting like I don't know once this one
heals I want more because I love your
piercings and I really like that one so
I don't know let me know what you guys
think I should get next I also like like
hoops like right there so yeah I don't
know let me know what you guys think so
