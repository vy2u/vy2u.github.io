woke up and put some makeup on my hair
surprisingly still looks good I won't
even tell you how long it's been since I
washed it and it literally it looks fine
and it's super weird but anyways yeah I
was gonna style it today or like put it
in little braids things but I think it
still looks kind of good so I'm just
gonna leave it but today is an exciting
day so first of all they just opened
this new cafe in the University Village
and I'm really excited about it because
it has a lot of really cool drink
options currently all we have really
nearby is Starbucks and I don't know I'm
really not a huge Starbucks person so
I'm really excited about this place
because they have a bunch of lattes they
have a bunch of matcha
and I think it's I think it's a
Vietnamese based place just because I
think that's what I saw on Yelp but I
could be wrong but I did see that they
had a rose tea or like a rose milk latte
and if you guys know me you know I love
like floral flavored drinks like I love
lavender lattes and I love getting like
rose flavored macaroons I really like
floral flavored things so just super
weird I think most people like don't
like them but I saw they had that so I'm
really excited to go there and test it
out I also think I'm gonna get some food
there they have a bunch of donuts and
then I know they have like a breakfast
burrito that I really want so I'm gonna
do that with my friend Leia and then I'm
picking up something else in the village
which I'm super excited about I don't

I'm
does anyone else feel weird when they're
buying toilet paper because I do
so I finally ate at that pasta place and
I didn't even like it at least now I
know now I know that it's not that great
but I also bought some chocolate peanut
butter ice jams from haagen-dazs I wish
this was a brand deal but it's not I'm
gonna eat this now hey hey guys so I'm
currently in bed kind of working on
writing my paper more slash
procrastinating slash online shopping
and I'm actually super bummed because a
summer internship that I was planning on
applying for I just want to go look at
it and it was like removed apparently
the deadline hit and they didn't post
the deadline so I'm just super mad at
myself that I didn't apply earlier
because I was fully going to apply like
a few weeks ago and then I just like got
too lazy and I was like it's for the
summer it'll be there for a while and
it's totally gone now so I'm really
pissed myself technically I don't lean
over worked anyway because it was July
and August and I already started school
in August but I'm still really mad at
myself because I'm normally way better
about that kind of stuff so this is just
like a PSA if any of you guys are
looking at summer internships apply now
so this doesn't happen to you but
anyways I think I'm gonna end off
today's vlog here just because I feel
like I got a lot of footage today so
basically it's Soleil
gifted me that bike and I'm really
really happy about it they just put a
store in the University Village I feel
like I mentioned this earlier in the
vlog but they just put a store in and I
thought the bikes were so cute so I
reached out and they offered to give me
a bike so I'm probably gonna put it in
like a video later on maybe and talk
more about it or show me actually riding
it but I just thought I would include it
in this vlog and like I said I will link
them down below you can get their bikes
delivered to your house like 90 percent
assembled I believe and they're
seriously the cutest bikes I've ever
seen like they're adorable I've never
seen bikes more aesthetically pleasing
than their
buycks and they have a different like a
bunch of ranges of types of bike styles
of bikes bikes for different terrain and
whatever you're going to be using them
for so yeah I'm really really excited
about that but anyways oh my god I just
like hiccup that was it for today's vlog
I hope you guys enjoyed it and stay
tuned for my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
