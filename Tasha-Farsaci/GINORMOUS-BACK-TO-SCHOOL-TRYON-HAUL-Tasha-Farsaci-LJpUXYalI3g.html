you're new here my name is Tasha I do a
lot of holes today I'm doing another
haul but here before you guys this is
just some stuff that I've picked up
recently and haven't showed you guys yet
and I think I'm gonna call this the back
of school clothing haul because there's
a stuff of enemy wearing back is tool
but do you keep in mind I'm in college
so I don't really have a dress code I'm
thinking about doing a video about fit
to wear if you do have a dress code so
let me know if you guys want that down
below really quick before I start
showing you guys the items if you are
not following me on social media and you
want to see how I style these pieces or
just want to keep up to me keep up with
me yes on a more personal basis and this
is my Instagram account I post on there
almost every day and I will put my other
handle within the description box as
well as all the links to these items so
totally check down there for more info
all of these items were purchased on the
App do't I actually entered for this app
there's the entire summer if you guys
haven't seen my internship video I'll
link it down below basically it's a
shopping app with all your favorite
stores on it and you can shop them all
at once have one shopping cart it's the
best thing ever so I will put the link
to go down below and if you guys haven't
used it before if you use the code
Tashia
at checkout you will get five dollars
off and free shipping which is through
the grade I'm handing you like a $5 gift
card so totally check it out I did order
these things on there okay so the first
item is actually a purse I know this is
really back to school but I've been
wearing this all the time and I want to
show you guys because it's my new baby
so I actually have this bag in a nude
color and I've been wearing it almost
every day you've probably seen it in my
Instagram so I thought I needed it in
black so this is a bag it is the mini
patch Lea satchel I believe from Phillip
Lim I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing this
you guys will probably correct me but I
think it's so cute it's the perfect side
I love small bags and I love bags it
looks structured so I think this is so
adorable
it is an investment piece but a good
black bag
in the necessity so I love panic okay
the next thing I got is a pair of shoes
by Steve Madden I'm actually planning on
wearing these for sorority recruitment
so that's why I got them but I also just
think they're a great shoe to have
they're these little baby sandals and
what I like is they have a little bit of
a heel so they look a little bit dressy
but they're not really uncomfortable and
I got this gray suede color eye candy
they're a classic and I know I'm going
to wear these a bunch from Urban
Outfitters
um dope I got two things the first thing
is this little tube top and it looks
like this it's this smocked little crop
tube top but it's not to cropped if you
wear high-waisted bottoms and then I
have these little rough leaves on the
top and bottom this is really cute they
have this in a few colors and I'm just
been wearing so many little smock tube
tops lately so I thought I had to add a
new one to the collection and then I
also picked up this dress because my
friend Gretchen here on YouTube has this
in white and then I saw it in red and
I've been obsessed with red lately you
can probably tell what my pop and by
things I'm going to show you in a minute
but they have it in red and I was like
yellows so it's this red t-shirt dress
but it's really cool because oh it's not
even time well you'll see in the Tryon
part this this front part ties in a
little knot and it just looks so cute
okay moving on with the red friend if
you guys don't know I go to USC the
University of Southern California and
our colors are red and gold kind of and
I've been wanting a red denim skirt to
wear for football games for a long time
I couldn't find one and I finally found
one on ASOS a soft however you pronounce
it and I think it's so cute it's this
red denim skirt and it's just dress on
the bottom it's highway so is really
high-waisted which is great because I
wear a lot of like a little tube top on
gameday
so yeah this is so cute I got this in a
zero and it is tight let me tell you I'm
normally a size zero or 24 and this fits
but I just can't use a lot that day okay
then one more red thing I actually wore
these two beautycon day two and I really
BAM they're also from ASOS and they're
also read their views a little slide on
mule shoes and they come on sale I
honestly think they were like 30 or 40
bucks which is pretty decent I think
they look like this they have a little
heel and then they have these ties that
lace up your ankle I just think it is so
cute and I love having a pop of bread
with like a black and white outfit I
think it's adorable so well okay moving
on I got a large box from chin so I'm
going to go on and show you those things
okay first is this red of course
two-piece set and I actually wore this
in an Instagram post and you guys seem
to like it this is actually a really
really great quality first is this
little lace-up crop top with these bold
sleep becomes of these cute little
shorts so I really like these together
and separate they're so cute
okay the next thing I got is this skirt
and I believe this is a dupe for a zara
skirt I think it's so adorable and I was
reading reviews and have one said it ran
really really small so I got a site love
but it actually is a little bit big but
it has a good tire on the way so I think
I can make it work it's just as gingham
print skirt and then it has some ruffles
and some floral embroidery pretty funky
and then it has a tie like I said for
around the waist so I do to kind of tie
this tight and I think it works out okay
I posted a photo of this on instagram
and everyone was freaking out so I'm
finally revealing where it is from it's
this little yellow gang on the tube top
and I somehow got like this weird stain
on it I don't know if you can tell
hopefully you can't but anyways this is
a dupe for as our piece as well I think
it actually comes with this mini skirt
I only know if I would wear the skirt I
mainly picked it out for the top but
nevertheless still cute okay kind of
similar to that I also got this black
one I want us in a video and you guys
are asking about it as well it's like
the same kind of thing except it has
these little sleeve I think this one is
so cute and then it also came with a
skirt once again I'm not really sure if
I will wear the skirt but is nice if you
want an option okay next I got this
skirt and I
I'm not finished lacing it up the side I
need to do that but basically it looks
like this it's this floral miniskirt so
cute and then with five place up I just
need to do that I'm lazy but I think
this is really pretty oh my gosh guys I
got something else in that red pattern I
should not be tamed this is a wrap dress
this one actually looks really really
high quality in my opinion it's that
same red floral pattern which I love and
yeah I just the wrap dress you'll see it
better on but I've been loving wrap
dresses lately I think they're so
flattering and the twin of the good
length for school in my opinion so I
think this is a winner
okay this is really really wrinkly but I
think it's adorable
basically it's this little floral print
rubber it ties in the front this will be
tied tighter ulta my boobies will be out
to play and then just goes down into a
little rubber it's this in the back this
is so cute and it's gonna be perfect
because it's so hot here in LA this will
be great for a hot days walking to class
if you guys follow me on Instagram you
know I've been loving jumpsuits so I got
this little jumpsuit it's strapless and
this tropical leaf print and then it
goes down into these little cropped
pants the only thing is this is kind of
sheer in the pant area so I'm going to
try and wear like a nudes along with it
and hope for the best but it's like here
to have some padding in the front okay I
got this two-piece set and honestly the
material is not my favorite I think it
feels kind of cheap but I think it looks
okay so yeah anyways it looks like this
it's this little craft to be top ruffle
top thing and then the bottom is
basically a midi wrap skirt yeah the
bottom looks like this really cute I
think these look so cool together it's
just like I said the material not the
best but you can't really notice so I
think for the price it's still a good
find
well clearly I'm obsessed with gingham
this is a gingham sort of wrap tank
thing I'm not going to show it to you
guys I'll just show you in a try on if
you like youth though I actually picked
out two things for my mom
I'll show you what those are or she
picked them out there for her she first
picked out this sweater I'm not really
sure how this works you'll see it off
this had a lot of good reviews on their
website so I think that might be part of
the reason why she picked it but yeah my
parents live in New York so it'll be
cold I'm sure she will find use for this
she also picked out this mustard and
black striped t-shirt okay I picked out
this dress and this isn't really my
style at all but I thought if I had
something like professional I needed to
go to this would be perfect this reminds
me of something you get it like hmm
it looks like this it's this tweed dress
and that has these little ruffly things
here and it's basically goes down to
about your knees so yeah I think this is
just really professional and
nice-looking and this would be good for
like an interview or something so I
thought and pick this up just to have
and the quality is actually really
really nice on this it's lined and
everything so I think this is really
nice and I know they do have a matching
jacket on the website if your into that
whole look so yeah I do really really
recommend this one oh I also got one of
those drawers but you can see in
probably all over Instagram that you
like try to pull your boobs together
with I have a really really tiny boobs
I'm like you know if this works yay okay
the last few things are the fingers and
I'm not really in love with so I figured
I'd wait till the end to show you those
so the first thing is this romper and
the reason I don't like it is because
it's tiny
this is gonna stall okay I am 5-1 I am
pretty small but this is tiny
okay it just fits in my screen it's so
short it's so tiny and it's cute it's
like cherry printed but I would need
like an extra large or something in this
like what is this this is so small
so yeah I don't recommend this it's cute
maybe if you like cutting where is a
shirt but like no okay I have actually
tried these pants on yet I got these
because Gretchen and if you guys follow
Gretchen she has these pants from Zara
these are Zara Duke the thing is they're
just not for quality if the threads are
all loose they're kind of see-through
but they're dudes gingham pants with egg
ruffles down the side I think it might
be okay if I
it's kind of like pull out the loose
threads or snip them and wear nude
underwear but these are pretty
see-through they're very thin material
but yeah for the crisis they look cute
they won't be that bad I just wanted to
let you guys know that like the quality
isn't spectacular on these okay and on
the last item from Cheyenne actually
isn't bad just for some material iolite
and also they're a little big on me I
think I have this in a small because the
review said to size up and it is a
little bit big and also the material is
just kind of cheap so it's a two piece
set it looks like this it's striped
inner has some floral embroidery this
curve is supposed to be tight and it is
a little bit big on me and then the top
looks like this I need two tires the top
strings but it happens really cute looks
like this once again the materials to
kind of like keep in my opinion so okay
so that everything in this haul video if
you guys like hauls have no fear because
I have more stuff coming in the mail yay
as always thank you guys so much for
watching means so much to me and stay
tuned for my next video I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
