today is my last full day in Paris which
is so so crazy so I thought I would vlog
it for you guys
currently Gretchen and I are the only
ones awake because I wanted to go buy
something hold on I'm gonna close this
door yeah there's something I wanted to
buy and I want to do it here because if
you spend over I think like 175 euros
Americans can get their tax back also I
feel like it's fun to buy something nice
in Paris
it's more of an expensive purchase but
it's not like anything insanely
expensive yeah you guys will see what it
is later so yeah I want to get up early
and do that before we do anything else I
think we're going to Versailles today
I'm not positive so Gretchen and I got
up I'm literally wearing like the same
out but I'm more in the last blog with
just a different sweater because it's so
cold so yeah we're up I'm really really
hungry I'm gonna try and find some food
soon guys this man on the train drew a
picture of me and gave me this Oh cute
it was so nice so now we're just headed
to the store
it's so pretty right now Gretchen's
vol.2 this is where we're going
so faster
the guy at the door for Gucci is looking
at me like what the hell is this girl
doing well guys so much weird ad I was
gonna get there really thin gucci belt
but and i said online that this one had
it that's why we came here and i got up
early
but then we got in there and she said
that they don't have it this lighting is
very unflattering oh gosh and she's like
yeah no we don't have it like the
closest one to your size in italy i'm
like food okay and it's not even she was
the one in italy did 75 wichita she's a
70 yeah so they didn't have my size
anywhere if i really want to like order
it online and also we look at this
display look at the cat heads out of
people how weird is that
so Gretchen I just found we're gonna hit
the kids on fire it's also here my mouth
we just found a little bakery and I
didn't vlog in there because it was
stupid quiet yeah walking right now and
they're such pretty scenery and if I
should know what to say as I'm sorry
like everyone was yelling at me for not
knowing that we were at the looms like
yeah I knew he was aloof when the
pyramid thing was there but before that
I just never seen pictures of it so like
I don't know wise I've know about I say
you have stupid like everyone was
yelling at me but I've never been here
I've never seen pictures of the outside
of a museum
I didn't know that one area that was the
pyramid area was the Louvre so sorry
about that but it's so pretty and I
think we're walking to Angelenos to get
hot chocolate because a lot of you guys
commented so that I should do that yeah
we're both just just looking at
somewhere and everyone is like what are
these people doing
we'll be Americans more comfortable
vlogging here yeah this is like people
actually can understand us it's pretty
much everyone speaks English here but
like we don't know them and they don't
know why I'm not gonna see them again so
okay guys we cam came to Angelina and I
got the white hot chocolate it's kinda
like switch things up so let's see it's
so pretty in here
Gretchen got teeth but yeah I'm excited
hi-hi scratchin why are waiting for the
train but I was just looking and like
all the stations have this like Jumanji
ad and it's pretty intense like like
literally they're all over here and they
have like plants yeah so the funding for
this movie must be actually insane
also I feel like they've made this movie
like four times but you know it's a cool
concept hi guys so we just got back from
Gretchen and I just like walking around
I'm wearing my turtleneck again like I
wore this in the last vlog whatever I'm
honestly just like recycling all my
sweaters here because it's so cold to
wear anything else but instead of going
to Versailles today we're going to the
Louvre instead yes so now you guys can't
yell at me about not knowing what the
loop was because I'll be inside of it
and then I think we're gonna go out
tonight which should be really really
fun also okay that white hot chocolate
low-key tasted like chicken noodle soup
to me like I probably should have gotten
a regular one it was kinda like salty I
don't know you guys probably gonna be
like Tasha you clearly don't have
developed tastebuds but I don't know it
was kind of like salty but anyways yeah
my off it's not that cute I don't know
I'm gonna wear my scarf and stuff
because we're gonna be inside now Paul
you gotta realize what are you but yeah
guys so my hair is all messed up because
I just found this hat there's all these
vendors and cute hats
hey guys show yours we got but I decided
I want to be obnoxious and get this and
it was only 15 years
I know this is crazy
these are huge look at that one you guys
take it like a size comparison like I
don't even know how to like wow but you
see the people and you see that like
that's huge that's bigger than like most
walls I feel
I created my room actually wow I wonder
where the Mona Lisa is oh there she is
let me do a slow zoom
it's focusing on this guy's head nothing
Monalisa really this is like a madhouse
everyone's taking like a zoomed-in
iPhone photos of the Mona Lisa and I'm
just like neither do with those I mean
it's cool but like everyone's standing
like 12 feet away and just zooming in as
far as I can and it's so blurry and I'm
just like lol guys look how beautiful
