the reason I'm starting off this video
like this is because it's going to be
getting ready with me video
hence Z no makeup currently but as you
guys can tell by the title today is
going to be a getting ready with me
video for USC gameday football and I've
been wanting to this video all here and
then I saw Keon on YouTube did this
video for ASU and I'm like oh my gosh
she'd beat me to the punch so I'm like
okay now I actually have to do it so
basically I'm just going to film me
getting ready for game days the reason
that I chose today is because it's a
little bit different
basically it's parents weekend so
today's game day isn't typical normally
I just go to the fraternity tailgates
and then I come home I don't go to the
game but because it's parents weekend I
am going to the tailgates on campus with
my parents and then we're going to the
game so I thought this would be a good
idea and I could film some footage maybe
at the game you know if you guys want me
to do a video of a normal game day
without parents let me know but I
thought this wouldn't be cool so I could
get some footage of the actual Coliseum
and just kind of show you guys what I
wear and a little bit what it's like so
yeah so this is what I'm planning on
wearing I have this little cropped tube
top from varsity blues thank you so much
to them for sending it to me it's so
cute I'm just gonna wear it with this
black miniskirt and then I have these
USC socks and we'll see what else
happens if you guys go to a school that
has like a big football team and like
big football games and stuff let me know
what you guys wear the games because I
know what UFC wears is a lot different a
lot of girls wear like cheerleading
skirts I do sometimes but I haven't
really lately but yeah let me know what
you guys wear I think it's super fun to
hear okay so basically I pretty much
just do my makeup how I normally would
do it and sometimes I put like a USC
face tattoo temporary tattoo on I don't
think I'm going to today
actually out of them but yeah I
basically just do my makeup how I
normally do first thing I do is just
conceal my under eye circles and then
anywhere out to my face I have to
conceal this is the maybelline instant
age rewind concealer this is a way too
light for me I thought I was really
pasty but I guess I'm not as pasties I
thought I was so yeah it's really light
but I'm trying to make it work okay so
this is the concealer that I put on and
I'm gonna blend it out with a Beauty
Blender
okay so once I have with the concealer
on and I would go to ghost I'm just
gonna take this Rimmel stay matte powder
and set it
I don't want foundation or anything and
this is a little bit closer to my actual
skin color so it kind of balances out
the ghost in this so yeah
okay so once I'm all set and whatnot
next thing I do is I browse so basically
I just use the Anastasia brow ways and
taupe in taupe and then the anastasia
dipbrow pomade in blonde and i just kind
of fill in the front of my eyebrow with
the pencil here and then i do the rest
of the pomade not gonna do this on
camera because it takes me way too long
honestly this is the longest part of my
makeup routine I would say just because
my eyebrows are just not even close to
as defined as I like them so I'm kind of
OCD about getting them perfect but I
will come back once my eyebrows are on
okay so once I have successfully drawn
on my eyebrows I just like to set them
with this clear mascara by great lash I
always use this why does my voice sound
like a man hmm
anyways I always use this to set my
eyebrows I've never had like an actual
brow gel you guys have a recommendation
for one let me know but for now this
puppy comes in clutch
okay so the next thing I do is my eye
shadow and honestly depends on the day
but more likely than not I'm gonna be
using the Urban Decay Naked ultimate
basics palette that just has a bunch of
matte neutral shades which are what I'd
normally tend to go for so I just do
some sort of combination of this if I
don't want to wear a lot of makeup I
make up I'll just do like one of these
really neutral couple layers on the lid
but then some days I'll put some crease
color and it's whatever I'm feeling I
really know I'm gonna do today probably
just gonna plop some on so we'll see so
basically I just put some of these light
shades on my lid and now I'm just
putting a little bit of this and this in
the crease nothing too crazy just a
little bit to add definition I'm not
amazing at doing eyeshadow by any means
so I just kind of like plop it there and
blend it out and hope for the best okay
so I brought you guys in nice and close
to my face this is the eye makeup I
don't know if it looks like really
I don't know this is just what happened
yeah so now I'm done no I need some
eyeliner and I need some mascara or
eyeliner I always use the L'Oreal extra
intense liquid pencil eyeliner this
stuff is amazing I would recommend BAE
if you guys are good with pencil
eyeliner I know a lot of people aren't
and they like liquid but it's the
opposite for me so I just put a nice
medium sized line of this on my upper
lash line I am not nearly skilled enough
to do a winged eye I wish I was but I
can I'm also not skilled enough to do
this on camera so I'm going to do this
one off camera for my sanity
so my lines are even okay and now that
my eyeliner is on and I'm starting to
look like less of a naked mole-rat I am
taking this Smashbox x-rated mascara
yeah I like this I think I got a puke on
or something but the packaging is pretty
go I'm just gonna put this on my upper
lash line and
image on my lower
okay so now that my mascara is on I'm
pretty much done with makeup I'm just
gonna add a little bit of blush because
like I said that concealer really makes
me feel extra pale so I'm just using a
benefits Dallas
yeah so now that I'm done with my makeup
it's time to kind of fix my hair and
change not wearing pants right now and
that would not fly also my hair
definitely needed to be washed but I was
really really lazy so I just body shower
and used dry shampoo let me know who
else does that
but yeah currently I'm just doing this
it's not gonna work I showed you guys
what I'm wearing there it is I'm excited
so yeah okay guys this is my a game day
look of the day I kind of showed you at
all but this is it on I've shown these
glasses on Amazon they're like perfect
because they're really cheap you can't
see my eyes and their school colors so I
always wear those and then he was the
top the skirt I just put on my red
converse with this and then this little
bag I got on Poshmark
and then the little tassel ball I got
from forever 21 so yeah in case you guys
want to see what the glasses look like
they're like slightly big for my face
cuz I have a really tiny head but I
still think they're cute so yeah now I'm
just waiting for my parents to come even
though this is like the end of me
getting ready yet like I said I still
kinda want to show you guys a little bit
of the game and stuff so yeah stay tuned
guys so it's actually the next day now
it looks like I'm wearing a wedding
dress it's for a ceremony with my
sorority but anyways I just realized
that I never really ended off the video
from yesterday but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed it I hope you found it
entertaining I don't know
thinking it was really fun we won so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
and stay tuned for my next video I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
