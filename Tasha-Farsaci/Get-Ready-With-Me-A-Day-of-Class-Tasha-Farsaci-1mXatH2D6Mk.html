today I am doing a little get ready with
me a video for you guys because you
recommend asking me how I've been doing
my makeup recently so I figured this
would be kind of a perfect way to
incorporate that so this is just going
to be a get ready with me video for
class but this video is in collaboration
with Victoria Secret pink to show you
their new bra less that I'm wearing so
this is their eyelash lace lightly line
bralla I'm obsessed with it it's
honestly one of my favorite things that
they've sold ever so pinky now this bra
that specifically for spring break but
since when spring break hasn't come yet
I wanted to kind of show you this
brawler in terms of how I would wear it
on a school day but you guys but I will
be wearing it around spring break time
because it's so comfortable and it's so
cute to not only wear on its own you
know chilling around and spring break or
like under something like this for class
so yeah this is you know made for spring
break but I just want to show you guys
that not only is it perfect for
something like that but it's separate
for class and I've been wearing a lot
I think it's literally the cutest thing
ever so before I get into the video if
you guys are not following me on social
media it would be into a little bit
happen I can never speak I always try to
say this and I can never speak if you
guys have follow me on social media and
easily showed my Instagram my Twitter
and my snapchat are all super personal
outlets for me so if you guys want to
see any more on a day-to-day basis class
see me rocking this on my sand break
totally follow me I'm going to put them
on the screen here as well at in the
description box if you guys want to see
a more in-depth to get ready with me
kind of morning routine even for class
video come let me know in the comments
down below and I will do that for you
guys okay so this is just a better look
at the bra lot without a shirt covering
it as you can see if filter you have
some awesome details and then here is
the back as well it's nice and low and
super cute and adjustable my gosh rise
and before I forget there's also
matching underwear because I know that I
like to match I feel more put together
I feel cute I feel fabulous so there's
matching underwear and guys this would
be softest underwear I've ever felt
I am not kidding like I want to sleep on
this this is so soft and look how cute
this is like oh my gosh yeah so you guys
won match
I would 1 million percent recommend that
for their Xena let's go oh yeah mutiny
with no makeup I have a nice temple in
the middle of my forehead like right
here coming down below if you guys break
out like right in the middle of your
face because I swear I always do I'm
going to list all the products that I
use down below so first thing I'm using
is benefit Porefessional ok so after the
primer I'm going to conceal any
blemishes or under my eyes and today i'm
using the maybelline instant age rewind
concealer it's almost gone
if you wanting in the background it's my
roommates dog they just love to be like
freaking out but i just like to put it
under my eyes and kind of in like this
this shape out of your nose you can see
you I'm doing kind of like that and
obviously I'm putting it where I have
the blemish and then I always put
concealer on my eyelids before throw
beanie
yep start blend it in with a Beauty
Blender or nothing too crazy you guys
all know this looks like creation one
side use the concealer I'm going to set
it with the powder right now I'm using
these amazing cosmetics Velvets minimal
powder you set setting powder and I just
put it where I put my concealer so it's
matte and what not create one for skins
done I'll move on to my eyebrows so I
like to use the Anastasia dip brow
pomade and I use this for the majority
of my eyebrows and then once I get to
the intersection I kind of use a pencil
so you will see what I'm doing there
okay so one sec on that now I'm going to
move on to the inner part of my eyebrow
I really like the Anastasia through
always I don't have that right now I'm
just using this one that I got from
generations you need just to see
Mirabella eyebrow pencil basically what
I like to do is kind of draw a line
right here so it looks more defined and
then just fill in a kind of inner part
of my eyebrow
okay so then once I've done that I kind
of like to take a spoolie end and brush
them out there's a little bit more
natural and then I'm just going to step
in with a clear mascara or eyebrow gel
yeah I kind of brushed them into place
how I would like them and that's what I
do for my eyebrows okay moving on the
eye shadow I've been getting so many
questions lately about my eye shadow I
have switched it up so some of you guys
have noticed recently I've only been
using matte shades on my eyes or you can
use shimmery shades all the time but
recently I've just been getting more
into matte shades and adopted Urban
Decay Naked ultimate basics palette for
Christmas and I've been using it a lot
because it's all matte shades as you can
see I just using a fluffy brush to kind
of put them on from the ticking wallet a
mask and color a little bit darker than
my skin color and putting this all over
my lid a lot of Gries I just leave it
like this I could see the one color on
my Lynda to add a little something but
today I'm going to add a crease color so
I'm taking faith which is just kind of
like on warmer brown and I'm playing
this in my crease I'm going to add a
little bit of a highlight so I'm
speaking to the lightest matte shade in
the palette I need to use pre-game or
blow
interesting names Urban Decay
interesting names and then I just kind
of put it either either I put on a my
brow bone as well over the inner corners
of my eyes now after that I'm going to
do my upper eyeliner today I'm just
going to wear a brown so I'm using the
Loreal extra intense liquid pencil
eyeliner this is my favorite I never
used liquid on the top I feel like it's
just kind of difficult from I always use
they really soft pencils though okay so
one line line by upper lash line it's
time for mascara right now I'm going to
need Tarte lights camera lashes mascara
okay the most annoying thing is when you
sleep on one side and those eyelashes it
all myself and the other eyes like nice
the other ones which ones are crunched
in okay so now that the eyes are done
it's time for a little bit of sauce and
highlighter with this one a nice neutral
color so I just put that on my cheeks
and then I'm taking Anastasia's
highlighter in opal yes not Anastasia
backup my bad Becker's highlighter and
opal and I just put a little bit of this
on my cheekbones and that my friend is
my makeup okay so in terms of hair it
honestly depends on how my hair is
looking my day
my name is already sweet from yesterday
so I'm just kind of reading it straight
today I have like a nice clip marks so
I'll definitely be fixing that honestly
normally my hair is just natural for
class so I'll put it in a salon or
something but if it is styled good style
but I think we all not have straightened
hair here so I don't think I need to
show you yeah but I totally cheese out
of this okay so now for the outfit when
I go to class I like to be as
comfortable but also as cute as possible
so I like this outfit is kind of a
perfect balance of the two and I feel
like everyone has similar pieces in
their wardrobe but they could use to put
this together and of course style be it
beautiful through all out that I am
showing you guys today okay so when I'm
wearing this bra lat I like to wear it
with kind of a basic top I like wearing
white tops because you can kind of see
the bra let through and it just has more
contrast the color that I have here I
love this bra that uses padded so it has
more support than other ones that I have
but it's also extremely huggable there's
no like uncomfortable wires or anything
it's just like so beautiful you could
wear a shirt like off the shoulder or
something okay and then I'm Bob
I'm just wearing a pair of denim shorts
this is perfect for class and well as
spring breaks because this bra let is
specifically made for spring break but
honestly this outfit can be born
anywhere and then for shoes I'm
deferring these white Adidas sneakers
super comfortable and they match like
every open okay blows the video I hope
