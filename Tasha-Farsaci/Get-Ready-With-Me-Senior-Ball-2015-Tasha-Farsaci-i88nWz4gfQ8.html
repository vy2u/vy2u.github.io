of my senior ball and as you can see I
have a huge today on my face um I told
you guys about this in my last video and
that I had a huge sin I feel like no one
believed me because I bought this
amazing concealer that I've put on it
you can't even see it but now you know
it's massive
so that really sucks I'm kind of upset
about it but I think I'll be able to
cover it up for sure but yeah it's the
morning this is pre pre ready you got
some like natural hair going on yeah so
I'm gonna do this getting ready video as
more of like a vlog get ready with me
like I'm gonna talk to you guys like
during it's not gonna be like all fancy
and voiced-over cuz I thought that's
what people like the most so yeah this
is me a prior makeup
I'll show you me putting it on but uh
yeah I know looking pretty awful thought
I'd share with you guys I guess you when
I'm putting my makeup on so I'm gonna
start doing my makeup now because I
honestly can't look at this any longer
with outline to cry I'm gonna start off
with putting on like a foundation kind
of thing I'm gonna be mixing my
maybelline dream fresh BB cream the
darker one um I don't know what color
this is but it's like a darker color
with my Maybelline fit me foundation
because this one's too light this is the
red color but I feel like I need a
little more coverage because of this so
yeah I'm just gonna go in with that
I'm gonna finish rubbing this in and
then I'll come back okay so now that
I've done that I'm gonna go in with the
Holy Grail concealer this is the Make Up
For Ever full cover concealer that I got
yesterday and let's see if it covers
this awfulness
and so as you can see it's doing a
pretty good job
it's honestly like barely noticeable now
thank God I'm not makes me feel so much
better I'm just gonna do a little more
and then I'm gonna bring a little bit
down yeah yeah and here just from my
other breakouts were are and then I'm
just gonna blend them in and I will come
back to you
once everything is blended okay so now
that I've done that this it's a lot less
noticeable like I mean you can kind of
still see it a little bit but it's it's
fine for how bad it was before and I'm
just gonna set my entire face now with a
pressed powder I'm gonna start off with
the like zip area though with this
little maybaby one and kind of pet it
this is a grim old stay matte powder and
just Pat that on there and then I'm
gonna take my big big fluffy brush and
do the rest of my face
okay so now I'm gonna move on to my
eyebrows and I'm taking my Anastasia a
level brush it has like an angled end in
the spoolie end and I'm just gonna brush
through my eyebrows the reason I'm
looking over here is to my muse here by
the way um so yeah I'm just brushing
through my eyebrows if you hear a
background noise someone's in the shower
yeah so I'm brushing through brushing
through I'm going to be using a
combination of Anastasia's dip brow
pomade as well as their little like brow
powder duo so I'm just gonna shape my
eyebrows a little bit with a dip brow
and then just gonna fill them in more
with the power okay so I just use the
dip brow and now I'm going to go in with
the brow powder and just fill them in a
little bit more in sorry you can see my
mirror here but I don't get closer to do
this
so it looks like that and then I'm just
gonna do the same thing on the other eye
and I will come back okay so now that
I'm done filling my eyebrows and I'm
just gonna brush them out one more time
with this bully just to make them like
blend a little bit more
and then I'm just going to take an
eyebrow gel and I'm gonna set them in
two plates so they don't like move
around or anything tada
so there's my eyebrows yeah okay next
I'm gonna start with my eye shadow I'm
gonna take benefits creaseless cream
shadow in RSVP I have this little mini
one and I'm just gonna use this as an
all-over eyes shadow base for my look
okay once I've done that I'm gonna take
Urban Decay's eyeshadow insane and I'm
just gonna put this all over my lid it's
like the same color as RSVP and it's
just like a great color for everything
guys it almost to be about the most
important part I have to put tape on my
eyelid it's like going up this place
that I'm gonna have like a nice straight
harsh kind of line I mean I'll blend it
out but it looks like cool so I'm gonna
take a little piece of scotch tape and
put it under my eyelashes and then they
go up like this and like I said this is
gonna create a nice line with your eye
shadow can't believe I almost forgot
that woulda been so bad okay
okay next I'm taking Maybelline's
stylish smoke squad and natural smokes
I use this feel like all my dances I'd
really like it it's drugstore and it's
awesome and I'm gonna take this color
right here and I'm gonna kind of work
that into the face and a little bit on
to the outer half of my lot to make sure
you go all the way to the tape because
that's where it's gonna create the nice
language you want so yeah after that I'm
gonna take my naked 2 palette and I'm
gonna take their color keys it's like a
matte topee color like this and I'm just
gonna put that once again into my crease
and it's just gonna kind of tone down my
shimmer a little bit
after teas I'm going back into the smoke
palette and taking in this color the one
that's labeled crease and I'm going to
put that into my crease and my outer
corner okay so after I did that I'm
going to take the darkest color in the
palette it's a matte Brown a really dark
matte Brown and I'm going to put this
just in the outer corner of my eyes
okay so once I've done that I'm going to
pull off the tape
yeah drop a little bit of my face makeup
but I can always fix that as you can see
there's a nice line on both sides I'm
just gonna blend that a tiny bit because
I don't want it to be so harsh and I'm
gonna blend all of the eyeshadow like
will I do that
so once I've gotten to this point I'm
going to drag some underneath my lower
lashes so I'm gonna find a little pencil
brush and I'm gonna take the lightest
and then the second lightest colors and
this little palette and I'm gonna mix
them together and then just drag them
underneath my lower lashes and connect
them to like the eye shadow that I just
did so I'm going to take my NYX jumbo
eye pencil in milk and I'm just going to
put this on my inner corner and I'm
gonna blend it in
then I'm gonna take my steel a pallet
this is like I don't know what this is
called but I'm just gonna take the
colored glow from it and I'm just gonna
set that in a corner in color and then
I'm gonna once again took that color and
put it under my brow okay so now that my
eye shadow is done I'm gonna put on
eyeliner and I'm using a black pencil
it's the next slide on one in black and
I really don't into this on camera
because it's in my actual ball and I
don't want to miss help so I'm just
gonna put this on kind of like a medium
thick line and remember that I'm gonna
put get fake eyelashes just put on so I
want it to be kind of fixed I'm gonna
put that on and then I'll come back I'm
gonna put some brown eyeliner on the
bottom right now so I'm just gonna put
it on my lower lash line and a little
bit on my waterline just to kind of
blend it into the eyeshadow that I put
down there and then I'm gonna put some
mascara on the bottom you taking a
waterproof mascara that says Maybelline
is colossal and I'm gonna put that on my
bottom lashes okay so now I'm really
going to get my hair done and I will
show you that in my eyelashes and once I
come back it's oh I just got back from
getting my hair done and then the
eyelashes put on and I'm just gonna
touch up my makeup one more time really
quick before I go and like add some
bronzer and stuff so the blush I'm using
is Dallas and it's kind of a bronzey
blush color to begin with but I'm just
gonna put that on the apples of my
cheeks and it's just gonna make me look
a little tanner
and add a little bit of color to my face
and then for bronzer i'm using my roses
laguna and i'm just going to put that on
my temples out a little bit on my
blemish and then a little bit on my
cheeks as well my nose and a little on
my chin and down right now okay that is
it for the makeup i'm gonna give you a
better view in a minute without our
lighting because this lighting kind of
sucks so stay tuned okay so this is the
finished makeup i'll show you my hair
when i'm like outside with my dress all
of my mom film it but i will come a
little bit closer get it into focus and
yeah that's what it looks like
I hope it looks good oh I'm it's a lot
more than I would normally wear on a
day-to-day basis but I figured I should
