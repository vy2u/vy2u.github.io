don't know if this is going to be a
little JIT intro of this video but a lot
of you guys have actually tons of you
guys have been asking me to do like it
get ready with me for going out at your
at piers College things are falling
everywhere going out at like a college
party or whatnot there's a pretty big
one tonight and I have some friends
visiting trip some friends visiting from
home so I thought it'd be fun to show
you guys like all of us once we're ready
it's going to be really difficult to
show you guys me doing my makeup because
it's getting dark out certainly know how
that will go currently I'm in a bathing
suit because you're trying to go to the
hot tub here and the pool is closed I'm
so tired but yeah so I'm going to take
this makeup off except for probably my
eyebrows and redo it because the party
theme is Olympus so it's like Greek
Greek goddess e / Greek god like it
seems like a toga party but like flowy
sands fans here yeah so this was before
me and my bed I'm really I'm really
tired guys but uh yeah okay so I noticed
lighting is actually the worst of all
time and I look like a moldy turtle but
um yeah I mean you guys have really been
requesting this and I want it to be
authentic and me actually getting ready
for the party and that's going to be
happening at night so yeah I'm probably
not gonna show you like every little
thing I do because that can get a little
lengthy but I will tell you what I'm
doing the first thing I'm going to do I
kind of like left my eyebrows on a
little bit but the first thing I'm going
to do is just kind of conceal under my
eyes and any like blemishes that I have
so I'm going to do that and then I'll
come back okay so I just touched up my
concealer also please don't mind if my
room is messy when I have like people
come to say obviously their stuff is
going to be like everywhere
someone rooms not looking its best
anyways I'm just taking a translucent
powder can set my
my concealer and I'm just doing that and
once I do this I'm going to kind of like
fix my eyebrows a little bit because
they're a little bit worn off like I'm
going to refill today and you know what
I'm saying so yeah I just basically put
the powder all over my face focusing
where I'm filming the video you're proud
yes if the lighting is really bad I'm
not something all my makeup I've just
decided to do like Pisac okay so I'm
going to my eyebrows fix them a little
bit and then I will come back okay so
once I did my eyebrows basically had
kind of filled them into the pencil on
menu tomorrow gel I'm going to work on
my eye shadow and I'm going to do matte
eye shadow but since this is like a
Greek theme I wanted to go for some gold
so I'm taking my naked palette and I'm
going to use I'm going to use half-baked
which is the gold color and then I don't
know I think I might use small odd in
the crease and try and like figure
something out I know I have some gold
glittery stuff too
so we will see we will see so yeah like
I said I'm just taking half baked and
I'm going to put that on my lid okay I
just turned off the lamp up here because
I felt like it was giving me like really
really I believe really ugly shadows
anyways yeah I'm going to pack some goal
of the wig so I want it to be really
really shimmery okay so once I do that
I'm going to take smog which I showed
you guys I'm going to put this in the
crease just to add a little bit extra
okay just a lot as like dark as I want
it so I'm taking my naked 2 palette and
I'm taking the color snakebite which is
kind of like a darker goal so I'm going
to put some of that in the crease I
might take with a smaller brush I think
I've no idea what I'm doing with my face
right now
Cassie it doesn't look good I don't know
what's happening there's a glare all
over my face can you give me a tissue
from the bathrooms me did it fall
somewhere I didn't touch it
oh wait I'm using I'm using it to film
by yourself can you guys give me tissues
and I'm using it as I tripod right now
really you know like oh I know I use
until you can do it
I would link to one of you guys excuse
you box yeah well with a low vision okay
so I found this stuff that my friend
left here in Babylon photo already I art
and this one has some gold glitter in
this gold shimmery things so I'm
probably just going to see what happens
with this um I'd want to put the gold
shimmery one and try to do like an inner
corner thing this might look completely
horrendous I'd give it like a 50/50 shot
so yeah we're going to do that right now
yeah I really know what this is supposed
to be used for but pretty gold so let's
see
okay so now that I got my eye shadow I
don't think it looks horrible I don't
think it looks great but it's fine I'm
going to put a black eyeliner on my
upper lash line so I don't know if this
is going to film at all so we'll see how
it works okay so once I've done I'm just
taking a brown eyeliner urban decay
corrupt and I'm gonna put this on my
lower lash line
clusters yeah I don't filming yeah
I'm new new series just err okay I'll
stop filming or just turn it okay so I
display my lower lash line I look scary
sometimes on mascara parasol this is a
Tarte lights camera lashes
oh I don't even know if I look like a
human right now hands over the world
okay this is kind of what I'm working
with this point I swear doesn't look
this ugly with good lighting and it was
like probably the worst lighting I could
ever use it myself I'm just going to put
some Dallas blush on and that I freakin
I want to be done with makeup I don't
really want a lot of highlighter cuz my
eyes are so shimmery I guess I will show
you guys oh yeah yes I think this is
honestly basically the makeup if
anything changes I will let you guys
know okay you guys all really miss
chapter from my vlogmas videos and
everyone kept commenting I miss Chester

about to do my hair I think I'm going to
straighten it I was going to curl it but
I don't feel like it
so I'm just going to straighten it I
think we all know how to do that here so
once I do that I was back okay so I said
my hair I guess you can kinda see my
make up a little better oh this is also
just not flattering at all but yeah
