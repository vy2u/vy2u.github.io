and Gretchen looks theory on YouTube and
we're doing a like a sit down get ready
with us like we're talking through it
because we both watched Lauren curtis's
video yeah by colonel my friends getting
ready and okay was that not quite as
good as makeup we don't wear it like as
much but we still thought it'd be fun to
like sit down you guys like if you like
you're getting ready with us yeah I have
so these are like the final products you
can like come close there but like yeah
this is like everyday makeup we're
wearing like national makeup forever but
yeah we thought we'd show you how to get
ready and if you want to see how we look
like this everyday then keep watching
they were mine mine ears like below me
no makeup
oh pretty I know right Tosh your skin is
way better than okay yeah okay
I'm using the bare minerals concealer in
light too
and what's weird is this was actually
sample like a real long time ago but
I've literally been using it for two
years and it's the best concealer ever
you know it's kind of late for me now I
use it in honestly conceal my dark
circles and then like open my eyelids
because they're like veiny and I don't
like it but Tosh was hurting skin so she
doesn't have to cover up any pimples she
doesn't have any some Oh in this summer
my skin is really good but during school
year it's like bad not to in the one
like whenever the fall it's and this
time light goes away I skip it so so bad
now I'm gonna do my eyebrows how we're
gonna be hard to see because like I have
to do them close-up but I use the
anastasia dipbrow pomade and blonde and
then i like on top of it I use the
Anastasia brow powder duo and bond so
yeah sophisticated
I'm actually a child I've like never
done anything to my brows but recently
and my videos you guys are like you need
to do your brows like they look terrible
I'm like you know what your sister's not
twins okay cut tonight like we're
talking and we've had thick eyebrow hair
because I mean like that you can shape
them anywhere you want but like me I
like thin eyebrows and so does Gretchen
so it's like hard to like get them
shaped the right way yeah like Lily
Collins or like even Lucy Lucy it's like
the thickest eyebrows I almost concealed
my now I'm using the Garnier under-eye
circles
roller thingy I don't know I always join
makeup in a different order - do you
like it same order I'm yeah I don't know
I never like stick to the plan I always
like I don't know it's weird like
sometimes I do my eyes before I do my
face and sometimes I do my face before I
do my eyes today I guess I'm doing my
face and since I was like away I only
brought like less makeup in so I got
this little kabuki brush coming from
health but it works really good and so I
brought this she was like pretty much
for everything and I've been using my
favorite powder ever which is the
covergirl clean powder and I'm in the
shade medium light 535 why do you like
saying the makeup you know I know I
always blend this down my neck because I
don't know why I look right here like
and right here it stand like right here
like right underneath mine what doesn't
and my calves don't dance really I think
your knees always look the tannest sir I
need sexy bars all over them me too
because I ran to the bus and wiped out a
nice cars okay I'll tell you how I got
my nice car so Missy news like auto
camping like before seen your ball at my
school and my friend and I decided we
wanted a roller buddy to Dunkin Donuts
in the
and she was gonna run and I was gonna
use her rollaways so I was really
bleeding and it got kind of difficult
like I didn't know why it was hard
because normally ago everybody was
really easy for me so I was just like
okay it's probably just because it's
like not my rollerblades I'm not used to
them mmm whatever and then all of a
sudden I was getting really hard and we
realized that we forgot it was a rock
stock like in between the brake and not
like like back wheel oh yeah and I was
like okay like it should be fine I mean
I'll be okay whatever but I couldn't
break so then we were coming down like
this huge steep hill I was so scared and
I was like okay I literally can't do
this like lives we need to stop and
she's like oh no you'll be fine and so I
started to go down and no I just fell
and I like ripped a hole and like the
leggings I was wearing and I'm using
this bronzer it's Mac mineralize
skinfinish natural in the shade
give me Sun and inclusive and I took it
I took her tools brush - all right so
after I'm done with that I'll take like
a clear mascara this one's disgusting
though it's you know gross is the
Maybelline Great Lash I need a new one
okay it's brown okay so yeah and I just
kind of set them you know I like butch
up in the front she's like with your
eyebrows I take too long though like
that's what takes me the longest in my
homemade care I rest
I just use baby lifts I don't know this
is just another one clearly oh my gosh
now I'm gonna use this blush I got it
yesterday at Mac it's called
tomfoolery and cuz I know it's summer
but I don't know I was literally like
one it's so dark and the woman I asked
her to put it on me and she like
she put it like right here--like really
dark I was like I'm using benefits
increases cream shadow like a little
baby one and RSVP and I put this on
right before my eye shadow it's like my
favorite colors already it looks like
just like that shiny like champagne
color like saying yeah I'm gonna use it
afterwards he okay I'm taking Urban
Decay sin I'm gonna put this all over my
lid and then just kind of like blend it
out I guess that's a classic I love it
it's like my favorite one ever it's so
pretty I wouldn't be using one kind of
like it I can't tell doc it is is it
dark and then now I'm gonna use this
highlighter I actually thought yesterday
to the back the highlighter I was like
kinda like motor to get it or not cuz
it's like way too expensive then I got
it okay yeah I wanted to get it but it
was like $38 and I had already like
bought too much so I was like no oh
there we go that's opening mine say it's
all tiny
I need like a highlight the mirroring
here is really good I love it
I'm just taking a max of a per and I'm
gonna put this like under my brow and
then in my inner corner is it like a
lighter yeah it's like oh okay I was
shining you this thing is I think you
have to be careful with it cause if like
if I put it on my finger my okay so I've
been like shimmer oh well if you want a
shiny highlighter this is a way to go
it's like a lighter than that one too I
think it literally looks like a pigment
it like eyeshadow Wow okay I'm gonna go
in with eyeliner today I'm gonna use
brown and I'm using the NYX slide on
eyeliner like slide on bite on and it's
my favorite ever I literally love it so
much you're so good I can't believe you
don't do like yeah I don't use liquid on
my top I used to but now it's a easier
community pencils so you probably be
able to see me doing this but yeah and I
do like a medium thick line just on my
top okay
do my eyes now I literally hate my eyes
good enough so bad it is I'm gonna curl
my eyelashes wait to cry Rajesh's no
really yeah they're definitely other oh
look at that
Wow I need to because I don't have any
and I always I learned I have to call my
eyelashes before I put on my eyeliner
really Oh cuz they don't mess it up or
else it messed up your huh okay I'm
she's curled now I got this yesterday
yesterday tea with my favorite island it
is Stila holiday waterproof liquid
eyeliner and I've used this forever
they just like foliage rings out so good
well if I tried doing it without pulling
my eye and it actually worked
and it made it like thinner my pencils
are never show friend I need to get ones
that are like roll-up ones I think okay
and I told Tasha this yesterday I always
do this I put my liquid eyeliner I kind
of like burn it under like on the bottom
lash line which I feel like is really
against the rules but wow that's the way
it looks and then if you put like you
normal black I went down there you know
it kind of rinse on your face yeah but
if you do this it does it
I think about you say something Oh My
gods really excitement okay so I'm done
with me eyeliner me eyeliner yeah okay
and then I'm using the falsies flared I
don't know if I really like it but it's
whatever I'll use it eyeliner done okay
I know so stressful daily mix with your
face you know to me
when out on there like mascara oh oh my
gosh oh my gosh oh my god okay I'll be
back
we put concealer there oh oh
struggle is so real I just did it - oh
my gosh okay no the worst is if you
spend a long time on your eyeshadow oh
and the neighbor land use my eyeshadow
oh my god oh oh well well I was gonna
use this one got you literally bought
those eyeshadows
I'm gonna wear it tomorrow for the
getting ready doesn't wear it um just I
really hate wearing eyeshadow cuz I pick
it looks funny on me but this one looks
so pretty it kind of reminds me of sin
but like hardcore like I literally it's
like so shiny
it's called a sweet heat from Mac and
it's really pretty and shiny and I was
gonna wear it oh okay know when you like
do your eyeshadow for a real long time
and then you're putting on your eyeliner
then you get your mascara finely then
you mess up and even your mascara on
your eyelid then you take it off then
picks up your eyeshadow and then you're
like okay how do I go about fixing this
have it's like first world problems but
I think so the worst thing ever that
always hasn't seen by over you my
eyeshadow so that's why I don't do my
eyeshadow Tosh my book both caught this
Tarte

that the color some questions like super
tall and I'm super short yeah each other
