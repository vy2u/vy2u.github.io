gosh I never know let me check
well mates day 24 that's what I was
going to say so today I just woke up and
got ready because last night I was
hanging out with Mel and we checked the
website of the past or by us and we
found out that they have two pug puppies
so you guys can probably conclude where
we are going because you can play with
the puppies and Mel and I did this like
over the summer and it was the cutest
thing ever so we're gonna go play with
puppies no excited because she loves
pods like just as much as I love pugs
yeah so it's really exciting I think we
might go to Plato's Closet too which is
a place where you can make sell your
clothes you're like used clothes because
I have so many clothes here that I just
don't wear or that like didn't sell in
Poshmark or whatever sorry my bed's
never made I am a literally a mess did
she just get here yes she's got here so
I'm gonna hurry up I'm wearing this
black beanie and then I'm wearing this
cropped flannel shirt that will be in a
whole video and then I'm wearing these
jeans from Topshop and I'm going to wear
my adidas superstars with it hello guys
we're now in the car we're going to
McDonald's so I really want a medium
caramel iced coffee but we have a buy
one gift one coupon but I just wanted to
read you guys this email you last night
because it's really funny and on my
Instagram I have like there's like a
contact button so if you like
you can just you know me and I got this
email is so funny so the title is hi
gorgeous here we go
contacting you from insta I'm a San
Diego guy wondering if you're interested
in some sort of arrangement that would
be fun and good for both of us so good
guys if you have never tried a caramel
iced coffee from McDonald's please do
yourself a favor because it's literally
my favorite of all time I have been to
so many trendy coffee places in LA where
it's like $6 for a latte and let me tell
you that my friends also a hashbrown I'm
not I'm not regretting this at all they
have a point mint so you have to play
with them but definitely I come back
another day because oh my god
okay so basically we asked to play with
a pug and they said that Fridays are
like their busiest days and that there
was appointments to play with both of
the pugs all day like completely full so
you couldn't play with them how do you
feel I'm really sad but we're probably
gonna go back some other time like
during the week so that it's not as busy
because that was such a cute pug oh my
gosh so cute so so we just came to
Trader Joe's and I want the reaction of
the spicy dill flavored kettle cooked
potato chips my eyes are watering okay
we're about to go to dinosaur barbecue
because they have the best mac and
cheese if you like spicy it's like a
little bit of spicy but it's so cheesy
and so good I'm probably gonna get that
to go hey this is not boxing I think the
courts bigger than usual we're literally
about to eat in the car because we just
paid for parking and it's to go so you
can't like eat in there oh my gosh I
just bit my cheek oh it's so good I
could cry wait this is so much mac and
cheese I'm really excited oh my gosh we
both didn't get our own mm-hmm can you
imagine mmm
yeah you know regret hi guys
so it's awhile later now basically I
came home and then I edited my giant
haul video I filmed the try on clips
with hook which took forever and then I
was trying to edit it in final cut and
like all the files went corrupt and I
had to re-import it and do it in iMovie
so it's like not as good-looking as it
would be in a final cut but whatever and
then it's taking like forever to upload
it sounds like 2 hours to upload which
is crazy so anyways I'm gonna go to the
gym now I'm just wearing this shirt from
little lemon and then some leggings from
Lululemon and yeah so hopefully when I
get back the video will be uploaded and
you guys can watch that I haven't
uploaded my blog from yesterday yet I
think I just want to get this haul video
up first before items in it sell out but
yeah I'll see you guys once I'm back
from the gym
hi guys I'm back from the gym I haven't
showered yet because I'm disgusting yep
my nose is red what's new
anyways I uploaded my haul video I'm
like annoyed for a few reasons first of
all people are commenting that it's not
showing up in their subscription box
which is really annoying because I took
so much time like filming that and
editing it honestly like took me so long
to edit because like I said like the
files got corrupted so I was kind of
rushing to get it off and then I
realized I like a piece cut cut out at
the beginning and then I forgot to put
like a photo in it and like so I wasn't
happy with the video but like I'm not
gonna take it down because people have
seen it and then people are commenting
that it's not showing open the
subscription box which is just like
really frustrating and like it's just
like so annoying so I was gonna take it
down and we upload it but then like
people are seeing it it's like I don't
want to do that so that's just
frustrating I posted that and I posted a
vlog from yesterday so now I'm just
sitting here I think don't want to
shower I kind of just wanna like not
shower then go to the gym again in the
morning I don't even know if it's open
cuz tomorrow is New Year's Eve so I
don't know I should probably just shower
and not be disgusting um yeah I don't
know YouTube is just like really
frustrating lately it's like hard
obviously like the whole clickbait thing
and like okay obviously like everyone
does clickbait like I do clickbait like
whatever it's like I know it's annoying
for people that are youtuber but if you
like put effort into your videos like
you want them you want people to see
them like you want people to see the
effort you're putting forth like
literally I had a video like a vlog dad
like a normal title and then I had one
that was like clickbait kind of you know
like a more clickable title and it would
get like over double the views of the
other vlog and it's just like annoying
cuz like JA been like vlogging every day
and like vlogs like you know payday is
kind of hard to vlog every day but like
actual videos like regular videos like I
spend like a lot of time on like it
sucks when they like don't get people
don't watch them you know what I mean
like I don't know me just YouTube is
like bothering me lately and like I
don't even know if you guys are
youtubers literally my subscriber count
has not gone up it's like has barely
moved in the last two weeks and that's
not normal normally it's like steadily
increasing it literally has barely moved
it would go up and then would go down
like it stayed like steady I don't know
if there's like some glitch if YouTube's
like on subscribing people like that's
annoying its YouTube is just like being
so annoying lately I'm like super
frustrated ah I don't know whatever
I'm just getting annoyed sorry for the
rant okay what I meant to say before I
started that rant is that I'm gonna
start picking off my gel nail polish
because it's starting to like peel on
the edges if you guys get gel manicures
you know what I mean when I starts to
peel on the edges and it gets caught on
everything and like gets caught in your
hair so when I have this is so weird
when I have gel manicures and I want to
peel the nail polish off it's like a
game to me I try to peel it off in one
piece and it literally looks like a nail
isn't that so weird to comment down
below if you do that like I want to know
from the only one that does that also I
hate how nails look when you peel gel
off like they look so gross and damaged
my nails are actually so long right now
what the heck but yeah let me know if
you guys try to peel it off in one piece
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
