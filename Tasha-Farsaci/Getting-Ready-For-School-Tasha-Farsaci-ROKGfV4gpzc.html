watching getting read your videos so I
decided that I would hold my own because
I've kind of switched up my makeup
routine and all that stuff so here we go
first I put on my concealer it's erase
paste by benefit I don't normally wear a
concealer but it was picture day so I
wanted to look extra special right then
I'm gonna put on my primer and it's my
eye primer it makes my eye shadow stay
all day its benefit stay don't stray
it's a little mini but it lasts me
forever then I'm taking an eyebrow
pencil I'm just filling in my eyebrows
yeah alright
then I'm going to take my Maybelline
mascara and set my eyebrows with it just
so they're not all wiggle the all day
then I'm taking my matte eyeshadow and
make it lunch and I'm just putting this
all over my lid it's like my new
favorite eyeshadow it's like my skin
color but Cherie which I really like its
natural but it still adds a little bit
of shimmer you know say like shimmer and
then I'm taking this really stiff brush
that I got like an art story which is a
piece of crap but I still use it somehow
and I just kind of blend out the harsh
line my eye shadow with that and then
I'm taking vapor by Mac and just
highlighting my brow bone with this then
I'm taking my favorite eyeliner of all
time it's my NYX eyeliner in brown
perfection and I'm putting this on my
upper lash line these eyeliners are
great they are the slide on glide on
ones and they're just like the urban
decay 24/7 ones so yeah I definitely
recommend knees and Browns my favorite
because it's more natural than black
and then I'm taking a NYX matte brown
eyeshadow and just setting my eyeliner
with this if you guys have problems with
your eyeliner sitting on all day I
definitely recommend setting it with a
brown eyeshadow or a black one or
whatever color you use because it makes
it stay on a whole lot longer so there's
a tip for you guys
sexy face then I'm taking my blueness
million lashes mascara Oriel it's my new
favorite mascara I'm obsessed with it
please go out and try it I mean my
eyelashes are pretty long to begin with
but it just makes them extremely long
and volumize and I put on a crapload of
mascara because yeah I just do so yeah I
love this stuff then I'm taking Clinique
flash doubling mascara and fingers on my
bottom lashes because I like how it
works down under down there yep
okay now I'm taking a white eyeliner
playing it in my inner corners I'm only
doing this because picture day and I
want to look like I'm not sleeping and
then I'm taking booty call to my naked 2
palette and setting it with left there
we go
so now I'm changing I hope you guys like
this bag so that was what I do in the
morning to get ready I hope you guys
enjoyed it

what you do in the morning to get ready
