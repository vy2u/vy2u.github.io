wanted to show you me getting ready
I had my hair done but I wanted to show
you me doing my makeup and my dress acid
thing so starting off I used to be be
clean because my skin is kind of bad
lately and may not look it but my skin
is been breaking out like crazy and I'm
one of my skin to look okay for prom and
pictures another thing so I used this
and I just put it all on my face I like
it I normally don't use skin products so
I don't really have much to compare to
but I recommend it I guess after that
I'm taking my Maybelline age rewind
concealer I love this stuff and I'm
putting this under my eyes and all on my
chin and just on any other blemishes
then I'm just loving bed
that I'm taking my boy out until I play
that's covergirl and I'm just playing in
my eyebrows this takes me so long
because I'm psycho about my eyebrows but
I basically square them off and I might
never do an updated eyebrow video
because I definitely changed I'm eating
a lot and then I'm just filling in with
some powder as well I'm getting the
light shade and darker shades because I
just dyed my hair whiter as well so I
can use all star because I'd be scooped
up I'm just finishing you feeling this
anymore and then I'm just studying it
with a blue mascara they don't move out
of place and whatever then I'm taking a
mixed jumbo eyeshadow pencil in milk and
I'm just putting this all over my leg
just to kind of it give my eyeshadows up
space and I'm using darker shadows so
that's why I use the white color but you
know you can use whatever you want this
kind of gets rid of the veins and my
islands is all we think those are so
annoying and they're really bad on my
eyes then I'm taking my naked 2 palette
and i'm taking a verb it's kind of a
white shimmery silver color and i'm
putting this all over my legs as you can
see here
and then I'm just taking pistol this is
kind of a slippery color and I'm putting
this in my outer corner as well as my
crease just to add some extra dimension
I guess
then I'm taking black out with some
matte black and I'm putting this also in
the outer corner and the crease a little
bit and you can see I'm kind of doing a
back triangle shape I don't really know
but out of me and that what it is but I
like how that looks so that's what I did
and then I just took Mervan pistol again
and kind of put that in my outer corner
and into the corner in the bottom
lashline I had a pistol on the outer
corner and then everybody in a sauna in
there and then taking a black waterproof
eyeliner I'm just putting this on my
upper lash line and I'm using pencil
because I like pencil hi guys and I just
kind of do a medium thick line on my
upper lash line and then I also do some
on my bottom lash line as well as my
waterline just to add a little bit of
extra darkness to the look and then I
set that with a black powder black out
from the Naked 2 palette I think then I
curl my eyelashes and I'm using
Maybelline the falsies mascara here I
don't really show it to you but I like
it and I just put a ton of this all over
my eyelashes I was debating on using
false lashes but I just didn't know how
to use them so here I am using mascara
and then I'm also just putting a little
bit on my bottom lashes just finish off
the Iowa pickups and then I'm just
taking I don't know if that's like foxy
I believe and playing this on my brow
bone and I think I put a little bit of
my inner corner as well and taking mine
I look around there I'm playing this on
my cheeks because I opted against the
spray tan and decided I would just use
my bronzer so I just put this on my
cheeks my temples and then also on my
neck I believe in a moment there we go
yes my neck so I'm doing to look like my
face is a different color than my neck
and then I'm taking this little bitty
highlighter that's been benefit I don't
know what it's called and I'm just kind
of letting this intervention eat so I
eat walked up possibly I don't know if
we share that just blending that in and
then putting on a rim the lipstick that
I can remember the name either wow I
really suck but it's just a light pink
color and that is it's the makeup I was
pretty proud of myself for doing my own
makeup hmm and asked my dress I don't
know where it's fun because I borrowed
it from someone else but I love it it's
like a bootleg color and it's ombre and
so teal and it's just perfect and it fit
perfectly for borrowing it and I was
just really happy about that but my hair
I got done in kind of a half up half
down curl book and I thought that looks
really well I'm really good really well
on what I'm saying but you can see it
better right there and the dress has
some pretty beating and I just really
love the dress my mom told me to do a
spinachy-- film inspired by the way so
if it's shaky that's why about two
that's it I hope you guys enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
