semi-formal for school and I decided I
would feel myself getting ready for it
so this is what this is for you and
starting off with makeup I'm just
putting concealer underneath my eyes and
basically all over my face because I
don't want Foundation and this is just
kind of what I use to cover up my
blemishes by the way my friends will win
during this video so while I'm talking
to them I'm crying during my makeup so
if you see people you see me talking
that's why after my concealer I'm
filling in my eyebrows and I take the
two bogus shades and kind of fill them
in I take forever on my eyebrow so I
only showed you one eye route for this
but I basically split them off and I
have a whole video on this I kind of
chose my routine nose so I might have to
do an updated one then I just set them
with this Great Lash new mascara so they
don't like wiggle around and stuff
because that looks just kind of spicy
mm-hm
now I'm having my eyes with an elf
eyelid primer it's only a dollar so I
definitely recommend it and this will
just keep my eyeshadows on all night
long
then I'm taking this rimmel pot it has
axillary colors because that's what koi
my dress was and I'm putting the
second-lowest color all over my lid and
then I'm taking the second darkest and
I'm putting this into the crease then
I'm taking the darkest shade and putting
this in my outer corner and a little bit
more into my face
and then on the other eye I was totally
winging this I had no idea what I was
gonna do so yeah then I'm taking a matte
black for my naked 2 palette and I'm
putting this once again in the outer
corner of my eye just to talking about
because I wanted kind of like a smoky
look I guess you know was my first time
trying it so I've been taking a black
pencil eyeliner and just putting this on
my upper lash line just like a medium
thick I guess probably thanks the most
you go boy
and then I'm studying it with that same
matte black eyeshadow from my naked 2
scallop just to kind of give it a little
smudgy of a look and keep it lasting all
night long
and then doing the same on the other eye
then I'm taking the lightest color from
that same River pod and I'm just putting
this underneath my brow bone kind of
stay with this silvery theme that I was
going for and I think I put it in my
inner corners too I just didn't fill my
clothes then a favorite mascara and I'm
just putting this on my upper lashes and
I put a ton on I don't film all of it
but I literally wear on the mascara then
I just take that darkest color again and
put this on my lower lash line okay I
actually do my hair right here so I come
back and finish my makeup so that's why
my hair's done but anyways I put
eyeliner on my waterline as well as my
bottom lash line just kind of darken up
the look even more and then I take the
dark color a dope black color and I just
kind of smudge it down there to add to
the smoky effect and then I'm taking my
mascara again and putting it on my
bottom lashes
taking my nose with Luna blonde sir I'm
just going to put this on my skin
because I'm super pacing out and I just
kind of put this on my cheekbones and
kind of all over maybe I don't know pick
my temples and on my chin a little bit
it just adds a nice glow and then I'm
taking my eye beam and I'm just putting
this on my cheekbones to add even more
of the glow and then I'm just rubbing
this in nice and lightly
and I am done my makeup my hair is
actually done here but you're gonna see
me doing my hair next sorry I did it in
a really awkward order so basically what
I did was just curl my hair with a one
and a half inch or I actually think it's
one and a quarter inch a curling iron
and I just pulled the clamp off so it's
just one of the clamps that I pulled off
and I just wrap this around and really
section my hair too much but I just said
the bath going back to the front and I
just did all my hair and I really like
how this works out because it makes my
hair kind of like loose waves instead of
like super ringlets and then I just
sprayed it with my swab hairspray to
keep it in place and then who's me just
kind of finishing because I figured you
guys probably how to do this I'm pretty
sure I do it away from my face in
filming my outfit was really awkward
with my friend did it and I was like
cuffing the whole time but yeah I'm
super awkward so here is my dress it's
from hmm and I'm really good I think
it's cute and then I have some black
heels and Charlotte whoops I think and
my jewelry was also great jazz if you
can't even see that foot yeah I was
and for me but yes so I hope you guys
enjoyed this and please comment down
below anything you like I read them all
and I love you guys so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
