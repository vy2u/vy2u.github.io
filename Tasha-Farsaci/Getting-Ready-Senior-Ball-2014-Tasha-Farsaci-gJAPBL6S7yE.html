boyfriend's senior ball which is
basically like a prom in case you don't
know what that is and I wanted to show
you me gang ready so I got my hair done
actually I wanted it up and I couldn't
do this myself so that is what this
looked like and going right into the
makeup I'm taking Maybelline's BB cream
and putting this all over my face just
because my skin isn't been the best
lately and I wanted to look a little bit
tanner and this was a pretty dark color
after that I'm taking my Maybelline
concealer and I'm just putting this
under my eyes as well as on my blemishes
because I've been getting those a lot
lately as well
then I'm taking my eyebrow pencil and
just filling in my eyebrows a little bit
I don't do too much because I do most of
them with powder but I just square them
off and I might do a whole separate
video on this but we will see so then I
just use those two powder colors and
square them off and finish blowing them
in I also set them but I didn't film it
you'll see that I've mixed a lot of the
filming so I'm just taking the
Maybelline I believe natural smoke
palette and taking the lid color and
putting that all over my lid as well as
underneath my eyes I wanted like a brown
smokey eye for this and then I'm taking
tape I could have done this before but
I'm lining it up kinda with my bottom
lash line and this is just gonna kind of
make the look in the crease look cleaner
and just more precise once I take it off
obviously
and then I'm just taking the crease
color and I'm putting this in my crease
big surprise and you can see it's lining
right up with the teeth there and it's
gonna make a really nice shape
then I'm taking the darkest color and
it's a matte so I really like it and I'm
putting this in the crease but mostly
the outer B
then I'm taking the tape off and you see
that it makes it a nice line like that I
just didn't want that harsh but it looks
good with a lot of books then I just
kind of blended it out because once
again I didn't want it that harsh but I
definitely wanted the shape there and
I'm just mixing the two darkest shades
and putting this underneath my eyes kind
of on my lower lash line and connecting
to the little triangle point I mean so
doesn't look so like awkward I guess
then I'm taking my NYX jumbo eye pencil
in milk and I'm highlighting under my
brows and also setting it I did find my
eyes with this I've totally missed so
many clips in this but I find my eyes
with this as well in case we're
wondering then I'm taking the steel as
kitten and kind of just putting this on
top of my lids just to add a little bit
more brightness to the look because it
was kind of dark and then I'm just
highlighting the inner corners of my
eyes with a lightest color from the
palette
all right I forgot to do a clip of my
eyeliner but I just put pencil on the
top and the bottom lashlines and then I
set it with a black eye shadow so I
apologize for that
then I'm curling my eyelashes which I
don't normally do but since it was a
ball I decided I would curl them and
using L'Oreal voluminous million lashes
which is my favorite mascara I put a
cone on I just didn't feel me doing all
of it I also put it on the bottom did
not get that clip because I suck I don't
know what what's happening also did not
get a clip of me putting bronze around
but ideas knows a bit of bronzer and
then I'm pretty sure I used Watts up
highlighter by benefit so yeah I'm sorry
about that guys and that is it for the
makeup
iris Leigh proud of myself for how it
turned out and yes so awkward modeling
once again and you're gonna see my dress
next so yes get excited
no awkward modelling though oh yeah
alright so my mom filmed this that's why
it's kind of awkward and I had to put it
in slow-mo because she was going crazy
but I love my gift so much I got it from
place in California so I don't really
know the name of it but I love the color
I love all the beading and as you can
see I added some earrings and I wanted
my hair up because the back is really
pretty and low so yes that is it I hope

you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
