face with my brewery ice cleanser and it
wakes me up it's like really cooling and
tingly and now I'm just concealing my
dark circles with my erase paste I
benefit
now I'm taking my NYX jumbo eye pencil
in yogurt and putting this on for base
of my eyeshadows it's a really pretty
champagne pink color and I really like
it now I'm just blending it in now i'm
taking my matte color and all that
glitters and putting this all over my
lid this isn't the perfect color if
you're just starting out
now I'm just blending that out
now i'm taking my map shadowing vapor
and just putting this as a highlight I
don't do any crease colors or anything
else L to the school I just do one lid
color and then I highlight
now i'm taking my wet'n'wild megalang
this was like the first time I used it
so I didn't really know how it was gonna
work but it made them pretty long so I
come back in a minute with them done
because this took me a while so that's
what they look like I'm just letting
them dry and now I'm putting on my Stila
lip and cheek stain and pomegranate
crotch just onto my cheeks
and now i'm taking my glimmer sticks
waterproof eyeliner from avon and brown
chocolate I like brown eyeliner and I'm
just putting this on my waterline and a
little bit onto my lower lashline Brown
I feel like suits me a lot more than
black does
okay now i'm just putting on one by one
mascara on to my bottom lashes this is
almost gone so I just figured I'd use a
little bit up onto my bottom lashes and
that's it so now you can see that I look
really weird and I'm in bed clothes so i
just changed and this is what I look
like when I'm done so I hope you guys
like this and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
