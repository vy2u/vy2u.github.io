yeah
Snickers Mandy
waiting for Mike snow
and training
guys down boring like literally down
boring oh my god that person is the game
friends we are trying to get my phone
away
how long has it been shall we get into
it excuse I'd be pretty sweet had no
time pink play-doh hi guys so it's
actually a few days later now and I know
the last footage that I've logged was
probably Mike snow and the reason I did
not fly after that is what I'm going to
be telling you now so this is kind of a
long story hopefully it makes sense so I
know I said in the vlog that it was
starting to rain and basically it
started to rain around 7:00 and Mike
Snowden come on until 8:15 and we were
waiting in front of the stage because we
wanted like front-row for the concert we
both really like Mike snow so it starts
raining a little bit and then it starts
really raining uh and at this point
neither of us had brought any bags or
credit cards or money because at the gov
ball you could load your credit card
right onto your wristband so we did that
beforehand uh and then we didn't want to
bring a credit card or a lot of cash
with us because obviously we might lose
it I don't know why we didn't bring bags
we just didn't want to bring them have
something else to carry so pretty much
at that point we needed our phones
because you're going to call an uber
after the ferry to get back to the train
station and we didn't have money or
credit card for a cab so we needed our
phones for uber / lift so we get to the
concert you know it starts and it's
really good except it starts downpouring
so we were soaking wet I got lucky
because I was wearing my hat and it was
kind of covering like the front of me so
I put my phone in my front pocket and I
was literally like holding it like my
hands were covering it the whole time
because um I had virgin mobile so I pay
full price to my cell phone and then I
don't have a contract so I like it's
cheaper kind of but basically I
like $1,000 to my iPhone or I play like
ticket price so if my phone broke I
would have had to buy a whole new phone
when I did not want to do that so it got
to the point where Mike stone was doing
an encore and I knew that if I stayed
any longer my phone was going to break
and we needed mine to call an uber
because Gretchen needed hers for battery
for her and to pick us up later on and
we were both had really low battery we
should have gone to one of the charging
stations at golf ball but they were all
full like the whole time so I'm like
kuchen we have to go and she's like yeah
I know I agree and it was really hard to
get we didn't think I'd be able to get
out because we were literally front and
center and as you can see from the one
clip I had there was so many people all
the way around us so we finally like
pushed our way out we ran to the line
that was for the ferry and the line was
very long because everyone was trying to
leave at this point and people were just
leaving like getting out of line and
they're like it's gonna be three hours
like this is such a long wait and
Gretchen and I were like three hours
what but that was our really our only
option we'd already paid for the tickets
we didn't have like money to get back
any other way so we waited for about 45
minutes
finally a ferry comes and we get on the
ferry at this point my boots have like
two inches of water and then they're
sloshing as I'm walking I'm freezing
cold we're just tired we want to get
back so we get in the ferry we both turn
our phones off because we don't have a
lot of battery at this point and we need
them for an uber hmm so finally we get
off the ferry and I turn on my phone and
try to open Oberoi lifts and as soon as
I open the app my entire phone like
shuts off every time I turn it back on
open the app it just goes black so at
this point I was like okay Gretchen like
try your phone so she tries to BRR and
this is her payment failed and then
she's like oh yeah I forgot I got a new
credit card so she goes to put her
credit card in and it's not going
through it's failing so she ties PayPal
it doesn't work so then she tries lyft
she has 5% left on her phone at this
point finally lift works so we get a
lift
luckily the lyft driver
has a charger we get to Penn Station and
then we look at when the train is that
were taking from Long Island or to Long
Island and it's in two minutes so we
start sprinting they're like saying oh
the loud space we like last called and
it was I got a train
we're running like you see in the movies
we finally get on at this point we're
exhausted
crotchet has a little bit of phone
battery that she used from the charger
in the lift so we finally get back she
calls her aunt to get us and it's fine
but honestly it was so chaotic we were
freezing and tired and wet and I
couldn't feel like any of this because
one my phone died and two if I did take
my phone out at any time doing this it
would have broken because the rain was
so intense it's like one of those
high-pressure showers it was insane my
boots are still wet and it's like three
days later like I'm not even kidding it
was crazy but it was so much fun like as
you could see we were really really
close to Mike snow there was like one
person in front of me and it was amazing
I'm really sad that we didn't get to
stay for the killers because the killers
were after
Mike snow but it was just so rainy and
wet and we really had to go what's
really ironic though is we went to
Saturday which was day two and we
originally wanted to go to day 3 which
was Sunday because it was like Kanye and
Death Cab for Cutie and just take a lot
more bands that we wanted to see and
then we couldn't get the tickets because
they sold out first like that day sold
out before any of the other days so we
kind of just picked Saturday and day
three was actually cancelled because of
storm warnings so that totally worked
out in our favor because we literally
would have gone to New York for nothing
so as much as I wanted to go to day
three I'm glad we didn't get those
tickets because it would have been
cancelled and we would have been able to
go at all let me know if you guys like
