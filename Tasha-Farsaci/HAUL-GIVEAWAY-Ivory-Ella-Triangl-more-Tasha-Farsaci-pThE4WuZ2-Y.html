me
hey guys so hopefully I'm not looking
too crazy with this like printed
background and printed me by the way
this tapestry is from ebay just search
tapestry and it'll come up with like a
bunch of different patterns or whatever
people always ask me if so that's where
it's from today I'm doing a haul video
but it's different because I'm including
a giveaway and I know a lot of you guys
get kind of upset when I do a lot of
holes so I figured if I throw a giveaway
in here it'll kind of even out I have
some really exciting things to show you
so I'm going to get right into the hole
okay the first place I have things from
is ivory Ally and if you guys haven't
heard of them you either don't have a
Twitter account or you've been living
under a rock because they're super
popular now so basically every Ally is a
website and they sell like shirts and I
think phone cases and like chokers now
and basically they're really really cute
the shirts they're kind of like what's
the name of the style shirt its
long-sleeve it has like a pocket and
then like something on the back I don't
know if there's a name for it but that's
like their best-selling shirt design
basically a portion from every sale goes
to the save the elephant foundation and
they've already donated like $60,000
which is amazing because it's a fairly
new company and I just think it's
amazing because I love elephants and I
want to help save them and the shirts
are really really cute so I got a bunch
of stuff and I want to show it to you
guys all of these shirts came wrapped
super cute and this like a twine was
like this little elephant thing and I
wanted to show you okay the first shirt
I just posted it Instagram picture in I
will put that right here in case you
want to see it but it's a long sleeve
this is the light blue and then it has a
pink elephant and on the back it has the
Hamza and then the ivory Ella logo the
next shirt is actually one of their
short sleeves this is like a newer style
it's the neon coral which I love I
wanted this in a long sleeve but they
were sold out so it looks like this it
has he pays the elephant on it and then
it just says ivory Ella and these are
really really cute as well I have a
purple of the long sleeve this one
a little elephant pocket once again and
then on the back it has the Paisley
elephant that says ivory Ella I have a
seafoam so it's this really pretty like
seafoam color I love this one it has you
know the pocket and then this one
doesn't have a design it's just the
plain elephant which i think is really
cute as well and then lastly I have a
tie-dye one it looks like this really
really cute I love this one because it
has this little guy I'm a pocket and
this one on the back and I don't know if
these are for sale yeah they threw this
into my order because they found my like
Instagram and YouTube and stuff so they
threw this one in I don't know if
they're selling it yet but I know they
will be soon so keep your eye out for
these because I love this one and I
think it's super cute okay I also got
this adorable little choker necklace and
I'm this is gonna be in the giveaway at
the end of the video so if you're
interested in winning this little choker
stay tuned till the end so yeah those
are the items I got from I've relied
definitely definitely check them out I
love them they're a great company so
I'll put all the links in the downbar
okay next thing is also very exciting so
I've been wanting a triangle bikini for
a really long time and I didn't know
which one I wanted and they came out
with these new colors and I was like yes
so it came today the box is beautiful oh
my gosh I am in love I knew this style I
wanted but I never knew the color so
like I said when this color came out I
almost died so basically it's like this
turquoise like seafoam green color and
then like a neon bright pinky coral and
it's like it's the sheet what style is
this okay so this is a poppy style and
it's like a bubblegum color I'm gonna
put everything like right here so you
know but basically the bottoms look like
this the lining is like this neon orange
which is cool
bottoms look like this and I already
tried this on it fits me perfectly I'm
an extra-small top and bottom and if you
are like the same size as me it's
perfect I am honestly so excited to wear
this it's great quality and I definitely
recommend this color because we can be
twins next I have some things from
machine size so first thing I got is
this top and the reason I got this was
they had that paths on and the Kendall +
Kylie collection and I didn't get it
because I think it was like really
overpriced or something so she inside
like has the same exact of one it looks
like this it's like a white color and
then it has these embroidered flowers on
it the only thing about this classic she
inside is one of the straps it's like
thicker than the other like you probably
would not notice unless I point it out
but this one is like thicker than this
one is I mean I guess that's what you
get ordering from she inside but like
it's still a really cute top like it
looks exactly like and it feels exactly
like the one from PacSun so it's really
cute the next item I got is a dress it
looks like this really cute I want to
say this is like a free people copy I'm
not positive but it looks like this it's
floral kind of like a raspberry color
goes down it has like a layered bottom
if you can see that and a really cool
part is the back it looks like this and
you'll see this more on some of those
steps are a little bit loose on me so
I'm either gonna get it tailored or have
my mom store it or something but it's
really cool it has like double straps
and it's all Crossy in the back and like
open this dress is very wrinkly so I
apologize but it's really cute it's like
a layered dress and it has like this
tribally print with this like crocheted
layer and then it goes down I will come
a little closer so you can see the print
here's a better look at the print as you
can see it's really cute I have some
elephants on it yeah I love elephants
and then just goes down like so lastly
the Machine side is actually also going
to be included in the giveaway I wanted
to get something for you guys that I
think will like be a universally liked
item so I found this shirt and it's a
white shirt it has like this kind of
cord around the neck and basically it's
very very cute it has like these
crocheted sleeves it's so pretty for
summer I think this is adorable and the
good thing about this is that even
though this is a size small this will
fit like everyone actually it might be
one size fits all honestly because it's
really really cute it's nice and loose
and this would look good on anyone I
swear I specially with a tan so yeah I
picked this out for you guys thought you
would like it so
once again if you want to learn about
how to win this and a little chunker
stay tuned till the end the last place I
have in this whole video is now becoming
and fitch because I work there and I
pick up some stuff and I thought I would
show you okay the first thing is
actually this shirt I'm wearing I got
this on sale online I think everything
was like half off clearance so it was
all really good deals I got this shirt
it's super cute I'm pretty sure it's an
online exclusive so if they still have
these things I'm gonna put them in the
downbar but it's really cute and flowy I
love the crochet I love the pattern as
you can see it has like a tie and then
it goes down and the back is actually
like open you can kinda see my band over
there but it's so cute
the next item I wore in my last video
which was my summer morning routine so
if you haven't watched that yet I'm
gonna put the link in the dawn-marie I
should totally watch it because I worked
really hard on it but I showed this just
in it because I wore it and I'm in love
it's basically this like Paisley color
chip dress as you can see like I'm
obsessed with like boho prints but yeah
it's really cute it's kind of like an
olivey green color really really nice
and it's really comfy and flowy second
to last thing I got this Henley shirt
and I'm a sucker for like loose casual
shirts that you can wear like bra less
weight and just wear with like ripped
jeans so this is only like $12 or
something when it was on sale it's just
like this navy blue like Hedley top it
has a big pocket here has some buttons
it's boosts and hi-low and I just
thought this would be so cute with like
ripped up jeans maybe some white jeans
and then brown sandals or leather
flip-flops or something with like a
maroon growl at so yeah I really excited
for this one and last but certainly not
least I got here a pant and I actually
have these another pattern from
Abercrombie and when I saw these online
I believe they were an online exclusive
I had to get them so basically they're
these really comfy harem pants these are
I want to see the most comfortable pants
I've worn my entire life so I knew I had
to get them in this army green color
they're really cute I love one that with
like a cropped halter top they're not
super baggy like your butt still looks
good in them and I
this color I wanted a pair of pants in

excited that they have these online and
