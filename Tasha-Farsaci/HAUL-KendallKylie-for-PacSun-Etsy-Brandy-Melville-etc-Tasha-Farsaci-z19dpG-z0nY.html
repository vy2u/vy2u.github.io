for you which I hope is exciting I love
watching holes than my favorite videos
to watch so I decided I would do one and
I have some stuffs up from there I have
some stuff from some pretty exciting
places I have brandy melville and then I
have stuff from the Kendall + Kylie
collection and TJ maxx and then an etsy
shop so I'm gonna get right into this
I'm not trying to brag or anything I
bought all this stuff with my own money
except with stuff from the etsy shop but
it's really cool so I wanted to show you
anyways before I start this video I'm
going to ask you guys a question um I'm
going to read I my hair brown because as
you can tell it faded a lot um but I
don't have any roots so this much must
be like my natural color but I thought
it was blonde but I guess it's a little
darker so anyways I'm void and I might
her diaper again it faded because
apparently she used a semi-permanent
dive so obviously it's been like three
months and it's almost washed out so i'm
thinking of dying in a lot darker I like
it better than blonde I just I feel like
it goes me better I know some of you
like I've got a blonde but I'm pretty
sure I'm going darker so unless you
absolutely hate it brown let me know but
it'll be pretty damaging to go back
blonde but I'm gonna put in a picture of
what I think I want to do and let me
know if you guys think that would look
good so I'm going to put that in now
so let me know what you think of that
down below if you like that because I
definitely do want to go a lot darker I
just like how it looks so yeah now I'm
going to get into the hall okay so the
first place I'm going to talk about is
the etsy store and this girl send me
these hair bows and if you guys you guys
will see what they are but basically she
contacted me and I love getting
contacted by ft shops because I love
when people make the things themselves
like obviously I like getting contacted
by anyone but I tone down a lot of
people just because I I don't think you
know it's worth it but when people spend
the time making stuff themselves and
selling yet there are really big
companies I just think it's really nice
some she offered to send me some hair
bows and her etsy is on this little card
and all her information so I'm just
going to show this to you guys for a
minute but um yeah her etsy is princess
Darlene so I'll put this all in the
description in the but if you guys want
to look at this really quick yeah so she
sells hair bows and if you don't know
what those are there look like this and
they have little clips and you clip your
hair up in the back with them I mean all
you can clip them off like any way you
want but that is how I'm going to be
clipping them in the back and I love how
these look and I know they sell them at
American Apparel but I never want to pay
how much they were for them because i'm
pretty sure they're not cheap but on
Darlene's website they're only like
three to six dollars i believe so that's
a really good deal and they were
adorable so she sent me six and i'm just
going to go over the ones that i got in
case you're interested so the first one
I got is this really cute kind of moon
movie nebo then I got this really cute
white lace bow which I really like this
one then I got this kind of like royal
purpley blue velvet oh I got this
poopley floral blackish oh I got this
brown bow we'd like this crochet lace on
the edges I think this one's really cute
and then I got this maroon Burgundy bow
with white lace overlay so I'm really
excited to wear those because I wear my
hair have a path down all the time and I
never know how to make it look cute in
the back because I feel like sometimes
it just looks bad from the back like
right now I'm not wearing one of those
bows and trust me it probably looks
really bad but yeah so once again we're
at sea is princess darling
and I will leave that in a little
description please go check her out if
you want some of those bowls please buy
them for her because she was so sweet to
send me these and she seems like a
really nice girl so yeah okay next I'm
going to go on to TJ maxx and usually TJ
Maxx is kind of like a hit or miss for
me but it was I hit this time so first
things I've been wanting one of those
jackets that's just really loud okay
I've been wanting one of those jackets
that's like army green with leather
sleeves and I've wanted one ever since I
saw lolufullyloaded or Warren was a
death I think she changed her username
she had one from urban outfitters and I
wanted that one too so badly but it was
like ninety dollars and I knew it was a
trend so it wasn't worth it and I was
like darn so then I went into forever 21
and I saw one that was longer like more
of a long one you know what I'm talking
about and I wanted to get that one but
my mom told me know because I have a
green jacket just like that except it
doesn't have a leather sleeves and she
told me they were too similar so then I
was in TJ maxx and I saw this one and
it's almost identical to the urban
outfitters ones except this one was $25
so this is what it looks like it's
turning up kind of brown but I promise
you it's like the olive green color and
then it just has the leather sleeves and
this is more like a motorcycle jacket
kind of look um the one on Oban had more
like flappy pockets but i might like
this one better and it's from the brand
since ooh see if you know where that is
from tell me if you know where thats
from because i have a few things from
this brand and i don't exactly know what
stories tell them but yeah i'm in love
with this jacket obviously it's not real
leather but you know i don't need that
and once again this was only at 2499
what a steal and then the second thing I
got from TJ Maxx are these pair of
little combat boots and I've been
looking for these for a long time I've
seen them in stores but they were just
way too overpriced and I just didn't
want to pay that for them but these ones
are only thirty dollars and you're so
cute guys like come on you can't say
these aren't cute they're short little
combat boots with a crocheted kind of
stuff going on and I am in lower these
like seriously they are soaked
I don't know why I feel like these will
be really cute in the summer with like
dresses and stuff um not that they won't
be cute now but yeah okay next I went to
pax on when I first signed up for the
Kendall and Kylie presale thing I was so
excited I had like I was just pumped and
I had it so I could shop like two days
early and then when I went online I
wasn't even impressed there was one
thing I wanted and it was a scarf and I
didn't think there was a point in me
ordering it cuz it was you had to pay
shipping and while she's felt like one
hundred fifty dollars and I was not
gonna do that so I didn't get it and
then I just decided I'd wander into I
packs on and see if they have the scarf
and they did and then I got a few more
things so whoops but um Kendall and
Kylie I'm kind of obsessed with family
I'm not the person to get all into
celebrities but I am in love with that
like honestly girl crushes I'm gonna
push a fan but anyways if you bought
something from the collection um you got
a free tote bag so that's a plus um so
first I'll show you the scar that I
actually went for so this is the scarf
it's like a huge square scarf oh I just
hit my head yeah but it's really big and
it's really cute and I saw it I saw
pictures of like Kendall wearing it and
stuff and then I knew I had to have it
and this is not how I'd weary but I
think it's really humid the stuff was
expensive this was $25 like you're lucky
i love you Kendall and Kylie or else i
would not buy it but it was actually
2450 I lied it just has some nice little
tassels and stuff going on and yeah it
smells pretty good too yeah that was
probably really stupid I don't know why
did that all right then I actually ended
up getting something else from the
collection I gave in and yeah I don't
exactly know how I'm gonna wear this I'm
obviously not gonna wear to school
because it's not quite appropriate but
it's just this little tiny crop tube top
thing it's a lot longer when you put it
on because it stretches downwards I
promise you you can check like I'm tax
on the website if you don't believe me
like that I'm wearing it but I just got
the black one with like the past le
flowers and it has little buttons and
I'll probably wear this with
high-waisted shorts um
or high waisted skirt or something in
the summer not to school this was
expensive to what the heck this was 2650
not worth it why did I do it because I
love them um but yeah this is quite cute
I enjoy it and then i would actually got
something else and passed on they were
having an amazing deal where their red
lines or additional seventy percent off
so i took advantage of that and i got
this flannel and it's like a boon out
flannel i love things that look like
warning and like grungy almost so i was
in love with this flannel and it looks
like this it's like grey and red and
blue and stuff and it's a burnout as you
can maybe see like down here yeah and
this was on sale for twenty-five dollars
and i got seventy percent off bad you
know how much I paid for this eight
dollars for this adorable flannel yeah I
know bargain hunter right here okay in
the last place I have some from is
brandy melville which I know people are
like a brandy melville everyone's
obsessed with it I tend to stay away
from the logo kind of shirts from them
you know like the ones everyone has
because everyone does have them like
even people from my school found brandy
melville so it's kind of kind of a
depressing thing um but hey guys
everything I got brandy melville was
like the same color haha and I got some
jewelry so i guess i'll show you that
too as you can probably tell i enjoy
this maroone purple color very much all
right Joey I got two rings the first one
I got is this turquoise one with some
gold stuff yeah this was six dollars i
think they're julia is so cheap um yeah
i really like this one and then I got
this infinity looking one I like this
one a lot to as you can tell i really
enjoy i keep saying enjoy it sounds
weird i really like this kind of bronzy
brushed gold color yeah this was only
three dollars so that so steel I feel
like I paid for this but it says to him
back so whatever and lastly I got I'm
necklace and I would kept seeing
strawberry lacquered 48 wearing this
and I really liked it so I got it and
it's this long necklace with these
little birds hangings on it and there's
two and there are different heights and
once again it's that like brushed gold
color and I think it'll look really cute
so I got this and this was a dollars
which wasn't bad okay now for the
clothing items that are all the same
color I'm sorry it's just my favorite
color and I feel like it looks kind of
okay on me so the first shirt I got is
really a sheer but most of the things i
have i got this time with the classic
brandy melville softness which i'm so
excited about so it's this kind of light
poopley just a plain basic long-sleeved
um v-neck kind of thing and then I got
this little skirt and its really wrinkly
at the moment so don't mind that but
it's just this little maroon scrutiny
and I've been looking at this on their
website for a while and I finally
decided to get it because I'm going on a
cruise soon and I want to wear cute
little skirts and stuff so yeah I think
this was $22 and how much was this one I
don't know I'm sorry guys not too much
under 30 for any Melville's overpriced
some of the stuff at least okay then i
got this sweatshirt and I've been wanted
to get it for a while just this plane
kind of blue sweatshirt thing but it is
in that classic brandy material and it's
so soft and I love this so much um all
the way this with leggings in Congress
probably and I believe this was like
under 30 once again I don't really know
but it's so cute and it's so soft all
right and the final thing that I got is
this sweater and I really like it and it
was really overpriced like brandy
melville Omni website is the sketchiest
pricing ever like so weird stuff will be
like ten dollars and then stuff will be
like 70 or things can be the same exact
piece of clothing like they have a ton
of these sweatshirts you know and one of
them will be like 25 and another won't
be like 35 it's so weird so weird but
anyways i got this sweater and it was
like fifty six dollars which is really
overpriced but i loved it so much it's
just
this kind of pinky blushy taupe color
and it's really like loose and v-necked
and kind of high low with like a little
slip thingy on the side and i don't know
i love this so much I'm really excited
to weigh this I'm pretty sure one of the
Jenners have this so I wanted of course
um I'm really hoping that one day I'll
be reincarnated as a Jenner it could
happen you know maybe maybe I can grow
like 10 inches and then get my braces
off and then like try and be Kylie or
something some people say I look like
her I wish and maybe I can switch places
with her possibly so that's everything
that I got um pretty pretty fair amount
of stuff I'm really happy with it um let
me know what your favorite thing was or
if you got anything recently make a
whole video and put it down in the video
response um yeah that's pretty much it
let me know about my hair I am
definitely want to keep like the red
kind of undertones in it like it got the
first time but I want to go really dark
so you guys probably saw that picture
let me know what you think about that
and guys I'm getting my braces off in
March I was so excited I feel like I've
had them forever so that's something
exciting coming up and also if you want
to comment down below fun things to do
