video I just got a ton of stuff from
society6 and I decided to kind of put
together a little Holiday Gift Guide
slash holiday gift ideas video because I
got a lot of stuff for friends as well
as a few things for myself and I thought
this would be a perfect time and kind of
show you because it's right before the
holidays and you can get so much
personalized stuff from society6 that
literally make someone feel like you put
someone's thought into it and really
wanted to gift for them if you can tell
by my background I am home in New York
and if you guys can see out the windows
right now it's literally gray like it's
snowing so hard and it's so dark even
though it's still daytime that the
lighting sucks so I have on like some
overhead lighting but I apologize if the
lighting s video is really bad or if it
backgrounds ugly currently my closet
where I normally film is full of plants
because you know when you're a college
student and you move to college and your
parents start putting a bunch of stuff
in your room yeah - plants anyways if
you guys are not familiar with a society
6 I've done a few hauls from them before
I absolutely love them basically it's a
website where you can buy like anything
they have home decor they have clothes
they have office and school supplies and
the cool thing is that you can get like
any design you want and all the designs
are made by artists whenever you buy
something you're benefiting the artists
that created that design and everything
it's just so neat because there are so
many designs and I don't know I'm just
obsessed with it I love going on there
and seeing all the cool new designs I
could find okay so I'm gonna show you
the stuff that I got for myself first
and then I'll move on into what I got
for friends so the first thing is the
shirt that I'm wearing you guys and me
I've been looking at it because it's so
amazing and I actually got two so one
we're gonna be for my best friend so I
can show you kind of up close it's
Christmas pugs ok society6 has so many
pump print so if you guys know me I am
obsessed with palms I love pugs so much
and you know what I love even more I
love Christmas apparel so when I saw
this I like saying onions
like this is amazing you can get this in
so many different t-shirt colors I just
thought it stood out the best I'm gray
but I think it also looks really cool on
black and even white or red or however
fast if you want to be you can get this
in like a t-shirt or a sweatshirt or
long-sleeve but like so many different
options but I just thought this was so
cute and I had to wear it for the video
because I am obsessed with it
okay Society sex with recently came out
with like greeting cards and I always
need cards for like thank-you notes or I
think I started including thank-you
notes in like Poshmark shipments or
whatever so I got two sets of greeting
cards with some of my favorite prints if
you guys have seen my other society6
videos I love the pomegranate print one
of my favorites so I just got some cards
in this crib and then I love this
tropical print as well as light it's got
some greeting cards in this and you
versatile even print so you can get ones
that say thank you blazing also just get
cute ones so you can use them for like
anything like I did okay and the last
thing I got for myself oh my god okay if
you guys have seen my other videos I'm
just gonna leave my other videos with a
size six down below because I have a
good amount anyways there's this print
that I am obsessed with it's a pug
laying on the bathroom floor ingo okay

see what I mean even though I did get
something women on it I'm showing you
that later so in 30 here I'm obsessed
with it I have it in a sweatshirt I have
it in a makeup bag I don't know I love

found that they have tons of pug art as
well as more pop art with flamingos like
what if you guys know me you know that I
also love mugs and travel mugs and cups
and all that stuff like I bought them I
love coffee so I always use them anyways
I found this print I just need you guys
to look at this okay there are more
flamingos and more pugs and it's
colorful and I am dying this is the
cutest
mug I've ever seen and this is one of
society6 is new metal mugs they have
ceramic travel mugs and now they have
metal ones and oh my god anyway is that
I got that for myself but I also got
some travel mugs for friends because I
think mugs are just a great gift and you
can also like stuffs and stuff and then
give them so I think it's great so the
first one I got is the other print I was
talking about it's the pug in flamingo
print I got this for another one my
friends that loves pug the same one I'm
gonna give this shirt too
okay so this is a mug I'm gonna come
closer so you can see the print honestly
if the artist is watching this email me
because I love you like I want to
promote you okay this is what it looks
like as you can see it's a flamingo and
a pug is laying on its back like a loaf
of bread okay this is so funny because i
snapchatted myself wearing this shirt
and the friend who i have the other one
for responded and was like oh my gosh so
jealous about shirt oh well you're gonna
get it tomorrow probably okay so I got
another bug for a friend this one is not
plug inspired but still so cute it's
just this floral one it's all in slated
on the inside super nice there's just a
better look at the pattern this one is
just so pretty
sigh t 6 also has notebooks now which is
super cool if you like keeping a diary
or to-do lists or even for school so I
got this one for my friend she actually
picked out a lot of this stuff I asked
one of my friends to pick stuff out
because I just wanted to make sure that
I knew she would like it but anyways
it's just this marble D looking notebook
really really cool love it I think this
is so unique and free oh wait guys I
lied I got one more thing for myself
I got myself a bath towel society6 has
the best towels I have to beach towels
from them I love them they're the only
ones I use now because they're massive
and giant and soft and I love them and I
also had this problem where I hate
washing my bath towels like I always
forgot and I just I just hate doing it
so I decided I needed another bath towel
so I got a bath towel from them it's
kind of large but I'll show you what I
can it's just this ocean print bath
towel and the inside it's just a towel I
don't know but it's so soft and my other
towels are teal so I think this will
look perfect okay so I don't know about
you guys but I'm obsessed with pillows
like throw pillows you can never have
another cute throw pillow so I think
that's always a great gift because it's
comfortable it's cute everyone likes no
pillows
so I'm society6 you can get throw pillow
inserts as well as just like the covers
so if you just want to like switch up
however you can buy one insert and get a
bunch of different covers or you can get
the cover and the insert of a bunch of
pillows so I got my friend that this
pillow you can get it in different sizes
I don't know exactly what size that says
I serve at but I'll put it on the screen
it will be in the description but it's
this size it's just white with some gold
golden tan colored palm leaves and then
on the other side is the insert and
you're probably like what the heck how
is that a pillow but I swear this is
like vacuum sealed so when you open it
it's like okay this one is very large
but if you have a friend or family
member anyone who loves home decor
society6 has so many great things
so many great prints and just art for
your wall and you can get them in so
many different ways I have a metal print
from them my wall at school I have a
canvas print in my bathroom you could
just get like a plain poster so I got
this one for a friend I thought this was
so pretty and like minimalist it's just
this big white frame with this pink palm
tree thing and I just love how this look
with the white frame and then the white
like matting and then the print I just
thought this was beautiful and it's so
perfect and will look good in like any
room but like I was saying if you're
more like a poster person you could also
get it just like a poster okay the last
thing that I want to show you for
society6 they actually just threw in but
I wanted to include it because it's one
of my favorite things with myself it's
just a throw blanket there throw
blankets are the softest throw blankets
I've ever felt in my life
this one is just a big one that has
their logo on it this lawyer does it's
huge but anyways the reason I love these
is because they're velvety soft like and
then the lining on the inside is so
fluffy like this is another pillows and
blankets you can never get enough
because they're so comfy and warm and
soft perfect for the winter season and
they have different sizes so if you have
like a large bed or a small bed or if
you have a small bed but you just like
enveloping yourself and blankets like
this okay these just came in the mail so
I'm filling this separately from the
other portion but these are just some
examples of their phone cases so I got
this one for a friend and then they also
threw this one in which is cool this
one's like super protective so if you're
someone like drops here hold a lot then
this one is the case for you but I just
thought those print
so so pretty so so pretty I love their
phone cases okay so that is everything I
just want to just close your eyes that
this video was sponsored by society6 but
I love them so much honestly one of my
favorite companies I recommend them to
people all the time for everything
because they literally have everything
they have phone cases also great laptop
cases I use mine every single day you
can get like pencil pouches seriously

so I would have made this video
it wasn't sponsored I love them I just
