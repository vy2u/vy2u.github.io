is horrendous
it's literally pitch-black outside right
now but I really needed to film this
video and get up for you guys because
this is going to be a holiday giveaway I
know Christmas already happened but most
of the stuff I have in this giveaway
isn't really Christmasy so I didn't
think it really mattered plus there's
still New Year's and whatever other
holidays you guys celebrate it's still
the holiday season so I figured it
wasn't too late to upload so before I
get into showing you guys what's in this
giveaway I just wanted to go over the
rules a little bit so the first rule is
that you have to be subscribed to this
channel obviously and make sure you
subscribe you also need to be following
my Instagram my Twitter and following me
on snapchat I'm going to put all of
these down below and I will be checking
to make sure you are following these
accounts when you are maybe chosen to be
the winner so make sure you follow me on
those if you don't have one of those
accounts that's okay but the most
important want to be following me on is
Instagram okay the last thing that you
need to do is give this video a thumbs
up so in order to be entered for this
giveaway like I said you have to be
doing all of those things above but to
actually enter yourself you need to
comment on this video and I would not
like you guys to come and enter me or
anything like that
I would like you guys to comment why you
would like to win this giveaway and a
video request for me followed by your
Instagram username because I will be
DMing the winners of the giveaway if you
don't have Instagram you can give me
your here's your name on Twitter or
something and if you really don't have
any of those like don't be lion-o but if
you really don't you can specify that
and I will message you on YouTube it's
just a lot of times people don't know
how to check their YouTube messages or
just don't check them so I would really
prefer to be messaging you guys on
Instagram so totally leave your
instagrams but make sure you specify if
it's Instagram or if it's Twitter but
like I said I would very much prefer
Instagram so I think I won over most of
the rules if I didn't they are all gonna
be listed in the description so make
sure you check out those make sure
you're following me on all the accounts
that you need to be following me on and
make sure that you know the comment
section of what you have to comment okay
so this giveaway is going to last until
January 6th because I leave the 7th per
school so I just want this to last until
January 6th so I can make sure I should
it out okay literally my mom is food
processing something so even here that
I'm sorry okay so let me get into this
stuff for the giveaway I want to choose
things that I thought everyone would
like by the way everything will be
coming in this Lululemon bag I want it
for myself but you know I'm gonna give
it to you guys the first thing I have
for you guys is this a really really
cute hat from forever 21 it's just a
cream color and it has this like cream
little faux fur poof these are super
cute and trendy right now I'm literally
obsessed with this I love it so from
Lululemon I got you guys a plain black
headband I love these I always wear them
to the gym and I thought this was
something that everyone could use and
everyone would like you know it's one
size clearly so yeah I just got you guys

from Luxy I can find a photo of what the
brushes actually look like I'll put it

you guys that I got this so I wanted to
get you guys one as well it's these

comes with three bath bombs and they're
like gingerbread man which I know it's
holiday-ish but you can use these like
any time so yeah I got you guys this I

socks because who doesn't want fuzzy
socks and these ones are really really
cute

like all this protective covering so
