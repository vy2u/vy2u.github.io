you don't know who I am I'm Tasha please
subscribe that would be awesome okay so
today I have a very requested a video
for you guys basically if you know me or
if you view and just follow me on
Instagram if you don't by the way you
totally should
wink wink I'll put it right here
seriously Tasha anyways if you know me
or follow me on Instagram you know my
number one addiction my number-one
obsession is swimsuits I literally can't
get enough anyways I would say I'm kind
of a swimsuit snob you know I've tried
like all the brand's I have some
expensive brands so you know I know what
I like in a lot of you guys or that's me
hate how I like I love your suits but a
lot of them are a little more than I
want to spend where you recommend
getting affordable suit so because of
that today I'm doing a portable swimsuit
haul I'm going to show you all the
swimsuits and I'm going to try them on
for you hopefully that looks okay
because I just ate a lot of food so all
these questions are from a website
called baffle you guys are probably
heard of them before I know a lot of
people have different opinions on
baffles but this is going to be my
experience my opinion I think that they
have great tooth some people don't like
them as a company but I'm excited to
give you you know my experience and my
opinion on the food so yeah that's all I
wanted to say on that and then one more
thing before I get into showing you what
I got I just want to tell you guys my
sizes so I'm pretty petite I have like
no boobs at all
I'm like a 32 a 34 a and then on bottom
I usually wear a size 24 or a 0 and I
got all these seams in a size small okay
so like I said I am a bathing suit snob
so I'm going to be completely honest
about all these bathing suits most of
them are very affordable like in the $20
range or less which is awesome okay I'm
going to start off with my favorite and
then work to the ones I don't like as
much and my two favorites I would have
to say are both one pieces I've really
been loving one pieces lately they're
not the best for tanning but I think
they're really cute and you can totally
eat a lot of food and then like you get
away with wearing them so
okay so this one it was the most
expensive one I think then I ordered I
believe this is like 40 something
dollars but honestly the quality of this
one is really really nice I think it was
worth it this is actually a bandage
material a bathing suit which I've never
seen before but I was really drawn to
this because it's red and strappy and
all like thick bandage and then the back
has a zipper I just thought this was
such a cool statement piece for maybe
you know like a pool party or some
photos I think it would be awesome 4th
of July this would be amazing so I love
this the quality is so amazing on this
yes it is more sensor than the others
but you could literally also wear this
in the body sooner company because the
material is not really fading soon it's
literally like a bandage bandage dress
material so I love this one I think it's
worth the price and it's super unique I
know they have this in blue as well okay
so my next favorite suit it's also one
piece so the thing was example is I
would say like 90% of their suits are
like replicas or copies of really
expensive brands and I know people have
different opinions on that some people
think that's horrible and that they best
route for the you know the more
expensive brand but you know honestly
like the way I see it is you know if you
if you want the really good quality you
know buy expensive brands but if you
want to wear it like only a few times I
think this is fine so this one is a
replica of a stone Fox swim suit and
this one is awesome I love this one so
it's this leaf print one-piece and the
sides are really cool because they have
this cool kind of caging and then the
basket looks like this it's pretty
cheeky you will see I love cheeky
bathing suits
I don't like full coverage bottoms I
just don't think of flattering I think
they don't like a diaper on me I tried
to get cheeky bottoms they don't some
people aren't into that but that's what
I like so anyways I love this I took the
pads out of the ones that I really like
and I know I'm going to keep others I
might sell on top summer gifts to
friends so I love the passing I just
don't like having pads so I
the pads out of this one most of them
are removable I like using suits that
are double lines they look like they do
reversible I find those the better
quality suits and I think they look more
expensive so this one looks just like a
stone Fox one and I love it okay this
next one I also think is a dupe for
Stone Fox bathing suit I'm not
completely sure I don't know if they've
sold this color but I have no suits this
color it's like this caramel a camel
brown colored triangle top and then it's
kind of has like some geometric things
going on the back is adjustable I really
like panning and these style of bathing
suits because you don't get a bunch of
straps just like these thin straps I
really like and then the bottoms are
super cute once again you can see it's
like this just pick up you can see it's
like this double wide reversible
material which is my favorite that's
what I tend to look for on their website
it has three brighter straps and then as
you can see it's pretty cheeky this one
is good quality as well there are songs
some loose threads up here with its tag
is but they could easily be removed okay
so if you guys do know me you know that
my favorite bathing suit brand of all
time is Frankie 14 but they are very
expensive for you know a bathing suit so
they have this style out right now
that's off the shoulder and I found that
they have a little dupe on example so I
picked it up it's this also shoulder
style a bathing suit top with you strap
and then it has these long straps you
kind of wrap around your body it looks
so cool and for me I don't want to spend
you know a lot of money on something
like this that's trendy and you like
Hamlet and it you know what I mean so
this is awesome as Apple has an
alternative and then the bottoms are
these little black key key ones that are
great for tanning the only thing about
this is that it's a little bit big on me
on top I feel like the decides these
little sleeve things are supposed to be
more tight but I'm neither kind of loose
and they kind of hang down which I think
looks okay because it's off the shoulder
let me know what you guys think down
below but if you definitely still wear
this and honestly this would be worn as
a crop top is so cute okay so next is
this green bikini this functional
husband has in it basically it's a green
triangle top and then it has three
braided strap
and then it goes around to the back and
the strap kind of all comment together
really cute this one is nice I tell a
lot of green bathing suits so I might
not be keeping this one but still a good
quality I really like the bottoms
they're the same as those like camel
colored ones except they're in the olive
green colors so they have you know the
3-step and they're pretty cheeky okay
this next one is a dupe for a okay I
don't want to say it but it's mo and TCE
month
C Mon say if you know how to pronounce
that brand coming down below I don't
have any from that brand I've been
meaning to get some because I think
they're so cute but I know this is a
dupe for it so basically the top looks
like this it's a triangle top and what I
love is that it has these little shells
right here
the one thing is these triangle cups are
extremely small like I thought I have
really small boobs so this is not an
issue for me but if you don't have
really small boobs this is a very small
little triangle so keep that in mind but
a top looks like this it's pretty nice
it's not the best quality ever and I
wouldn't say it's as nice as the other
ones but it's still good and the bottoms
I really like the bottoms are really
nice qualities there that like double
lined reversible material and they look
like this they have like normal size
straps and then they have little extra
straps the shells on that okay this next
one is really really pretty
I just don't really know if I like it
because I can't remove the pads in it
there's no padding removal spot it looks
like this it's like this tropical this
was all like twisted look bad okay it's
just a probable floral triangle bikini
you can tie the top and the back so it's
really good for different sizes and the
bottoms are really really nice these
ones are F Kiki so if you're into more
coverage I recommend me they're really
great quality once again you totally
look out for bathing suits that are
seamless or reversible you know what I
mean those ones are the best quality in
my opinion I just wish you could move
the pads in this but otherwise it's a
really great find
ok this next one I haven't tried on yet
so I'd only know how it looks on I guess
we will all see for ourselves in the
Tryon segment but it's basically one of
those wrap
bikini top where you just wrap it around
the front of you what I like to do with
these sometimes I wrap them and
sometimes I'll just tie a little bow I
think that looks really cute personally
this is just a brew gandi color it looks
a lot more burgundy purpley on the
website and in person it looks a lot
more red so that's my only you know
concern about this one another thing is
you also can't remove the pads and
they're kind of place we are do not only
held in one place we kind of slide
around a bit but you know the quality's
good is that seamless material and the
bottoms are awesome I really like them
there's just you know these kind of
cheeky um seamless blind
okay these last few bikinis are the ones
that I don't like so much okay so if you
guys remember that frenzy bikinis juice
that I showed you earlier in the video
in black they also had it in burgundy
and the reason I don't like it is
because the lining is this white kind of
keeps mesh material that a lot of
bathing suits are lined with and you
know ever have excess hops video I like
when bathing suits have the same color
and material lining then they do with
the outside I feel like it looks better
because with this when I wear it you can
see the white lining in here it kind of
like peeks out I think that looks really
cheap I just don't like that you can
totally see it like where the straps are
in here and then the same at the bottom
it's lined with this white gross mesh
and when you wear that it kind of like
peeps on the sides I don't like that I
think the fantasy would be so cute it
was just lined with the same material
you know what I mean that it would be
great because it's so really cute I love
this style but the lining is a no-go for
me okay so my last bathing suit is the
only one that I really don't like at all
this is a replica of a ko or cows bikini
however you want to say it is the halter
style with the shells of bottom and the
same with this one that first of all
it's very thin you may think it looks
like a double line but this is that same
thin mesh material that I don't like and
just the cut of this the way that it's
cut it does not lie well on your body it
is not it looks really really weird it
looks kind of like just got napkin was
placed on your body I don't know the
bottom is I do like I have these in
black as well and I like them they're
more like a high cut white bottom and
they have the shells on the side these
are not the best quality like I said I
do have them in black and the shells
they almost come off when you like the
first time you wear them but I do think
they're really really cute um just this
top is no it's like stuff you know I
don't recommend this at all I'm not for
summer even you like how it looks on me
but yeah okay so those are the bathing
suits which means apple but I also got a
few accessories and clothing pieces just
to you know kind of test them out I have
shops example before and I really liked
everything that I got I wanted to pick
up some new pieces I've been really
liking the kind of like sporty trend
that's going on right now like the
adidas and you know like the mesh and
the stripes and that kind of stuff
suck on this sweater and I thought it
was really cute it says black sweater
and the sleeves it's like this and they
kind of look like on the finish at the
end which I really like the sleeves have
some leaks lips and then this side also
has some slits this is not the best
quality on the planet there's definitely
a lot of loose threads that I'm going to
need to snip which isn't the end of the
world as you can see there's just like
these friends going on but for the price
I think it's cute I think it's tonight
it's not as long as I thought it's kind
of short but I still will definitely be
wearing this I still think it's really
cute the last clothing pieces that whole
I love I think this is such nice
qualities I've been obsessed with the
floral and greater trend who hasn't been
I have so much of it I'm going to be so
fat and it goes out of style but I saw
this like crop top and I thought it was
so cute I want to get this in other
colors now because they have like three
colors it's just like this white lace-up
crop top with these floral patches on
the boobs this sounds so cute and the
materials really nice it's like this
thick ribbed material okay and the last
two things from example are actually
body chains I have no idea how to work
these out right now so basically I'm
just going to insert images of what they
look like on the website cuz I don't
honestly remember what they're told to
look like but I just got any silver and
a gold bobby chain I think these look
really cool for like photos and stuff
not only the best for like swimming
but I think they're really cute and
trendy right now okay so that was
everything I got from example.com I will
be linking everything down below please
