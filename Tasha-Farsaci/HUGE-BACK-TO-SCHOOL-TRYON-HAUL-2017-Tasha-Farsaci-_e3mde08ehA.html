honestly slightly embarrassed like yeah
I'm lifting another fall and guys are
actually an explanation for this one I'm
so so sorry if you don't like hauls or
if you get annoys my hauls and I know
the majority of you like them so I'm not
that sorry but I know I said I was going
to like sandwich videos in between my
walls and it just like hasn't really
been happening but I have I have our
actual reason so the majority of the
stuff in this haul video is going to be
from the Nordstrom anniversary sale
which starts today the day I'm posting
this so I just really wanted to post
this the day of so that you guys could
get all the stuff and it hopefully won't
be sold out I'm just going to explain
the family quickly because I had no idea
what it was before this and it's
honestly amazing so it's not your
typical sale it's not like old styles
that are on sale these are literally the
new styles for come this coming fall
season and they're on sale and then
after this sale they're like go back up
and they're like still for sale at the
normal price so like this is all
brand-new stuff for this coming season
and it's marked down so honestly it's so
amazing and the sale open to the public
for 21st but you can shop a sale earlier
if you have a Nordstrom credit card
which I don't the only reason I was able
to shop it really was because I'm
collabing with Nordstrom but yeah so
this isn't available to the public which
I would have seen with most of you guys
so I really wanted to post this the day
of so I'm sorry if you guys are annoyed
with my hauls anyways one more thing
before I get into showing you guys the
items I got you're not following me on
social media namely Instagram and you
want to totally do that you can keep up
with my life see what I'm doing on the
day-to-day and I will also put all of my
handles in the description box and I
will be linking everything from this
video so check down there if you're
interested ok so the first thing I'm
going to start off with from the
Nordstrom sale is from blank NYC I have
two things from them they're actually
one of my favorite brands ever and it is
this suede little may skirts I think
this is so cute it has like these little
slits in the front and I
this is so pretty it's really nice it is
real sweet so if you're not into that
I'm sorry but I love this color and I
actually have a jacket from blank NYC in
the same exact material and I just love
it so much for every day's like my
favorite color so I really like this and
I'm just so excited to wear it this was
originally $98 and it was on sale for
6490 okay the next item I got is also
from micro se and are telling you guys I
have a jacket in that same material and
when I saw that they had some of the
jackets on sale for the sale I was so
excited because I've been wanting a gray
suede jacket so this is a blank n where
C 1 oh my gosh I love it so much I am
obsessed with the one I have in that
color and I got that me more from last
year so when I tell this I was so
excited it's just this really pretty
like medium gray color I have some
zipper detailing once again it is real
suede so if you're not into that I'm
sorry but I just I love this so much and
it's just such a neutral color I've been
in love with like moto jackets lately so
and now I'm going to be wearing this a
ton and I'm so excited
so this puppy is originally 188 and it
was on sale for 125 90 so another good
feel okay I got some awesome pieces by
Rebecca Minkoff as well which is another
one of my favorite brands I think she
has the cutest stuff but it's price is a
good price point obviously it's not like
so cheap but I think it's really cute it
looks high-quality which it is and it
has a decent price point so I got these
little slide on sneakers if I finger
it's so cool I love the embroidery I
love little stud detailing here I also
love the platform I love these style
shoes they're just so easy to put on and
I just love you so much it's all like
stitching on there and it just looks it
looks so beautiful so I'm obsessed amis
I got these in a six and a half which is
my normal size and they fit me perfectly
okay I guess I'll show you the other
Rebecca Minkoff items just to kind of go
along with that I think this might be my
favorite item from the entire sale oh
it's so pretty so it's going along with
the same and Rory trend
the shoes looks just a little bag oh my
gosh but this was not me to beg I don't
know what is it's basically like this
new tan colored bag with all this
beautiful embroidery here is a better
look in case you're wondering
but like holy crap guys is if not so
beautiful okay going back to clothing I
got this pair of leggings by della and
these are my knee so much of the alo
yoga moto legging which I actually have
some later on it'll show you in this
haul
so basically I got these they're really
sick workout material and they're kind
of like a grayish green it said gray
online it sounds great or written but I
feel like these are gray green basically
look like this and then they just have
this cool like moto stuff going on and
then the back looks like this these are
really nice quality they're high-waisted
which is like the only leggings I will
wear they like suck you in you know all
right
picked up this dress from the BP line
just cuz I thought it was so cute and
easy
it's the slip style dress but it's swirl
you can see it has like some little
eyelash lace along the top and it's a
mini dress this is my favorite lately
and then I just really liked because the
bottom has this like open slit on the
side so it's not just like a straight
box there's like a little bit of a
little bit of opening so yeah I just
thought this was really cute this will
be easy to style oh my gosh guys this is
a--not a one of the most exciting things
that I've got so if you guys have not
heard of the brand
barefoot dreams holy sorry I keep
swearing if that bothers you I apologize
anyways barefoot dreams I've heard about
it because started in Malibu and I have
some friends that are from there so they
were wearing it and it's basically this
amazingly soft material like this feels
like the softest Bugsy socks but you own
accept like luxurious and spank like oh
my gosh so I saw that they had barefoot
ratings on sale if it is putting pricey
to begin with that's why I never bought
anything from them and I saw that they
had this cardigan that was actually
wearable like a lot of their stuff and
very like you only wear in the house
because it's like literally like a
poncho or something but this was like a
wearable cardigan in my
so I just got the black one I thought it
would match the most thing a bunch of
colors and then it just like has sleeve
that has a side it has pockets and then
it goes down has these like little clips
on the side and this is so so softly I
really got this and I went to my
roommate so much do it feel it so oh my
gosh yeah you guys need to feel this
like if you go by to go in a Nordstrom
and seal it because it's amazing so I
love this and I'm so happy I finally got
one okay I've been wanting a pair of
slippers for so long but are just like
never buy them I just couldn't like
never really justify buying now but so
then they were on the Nordstrom sale and
I was like yes so I got these one
they're just like the gray knit of
slippers and I'm really excited I'm
going to wear these around my apartment
around my house
and I know I'm probably gonna end up
wearing in the class I'm different I'm
just telling myself no tile showed no
but like it's probably gonna happen but
I think they're cute like to be honest
like I wouldn't I wouldn't mind wearing
it to class I think they're pretty cute
and they're so soft
and these I think we're under hundred
dollars which for ugh that's like pretty
good so well okay and the last thing I
got from the Nordstrom sale is actually
a beauty item and I got this because I
came out at a time not just for the name
and then my friend Gretchen Gretchen
with Judy on YouTube was talking about
me and I was like okay so it's the mojo
for this cool little set and it has the
rosewater facial spray and the drying
lotion and the reason I really wanted
this is because the facial spray is like
rose rose scented it has rosewater in it
and I love the smell of roses so much
and I just tried this last night and it
smells so good I love it and then
gusting as high me about the drying
lotion that it drives up your pimples
really fast so I was like okay yes
need that so yeah I'm really excited and
this was $32 a $46 value so I'm excited
to try these out okay next up not in the
sale I still wanted to include a few
things that I've got recently because I
love them so first let me show you the
stuff I got from a yoga which if you
don't know what that area it's basically
like a workout athletics athleisure
brand and I love it it's honestly like
become one of my favorites
mumu by man is like going on the back
burner okay the first thing from ello I
feel like it's there I kind piece this
is what I was talking about when I was
showing you those Ella leggings earlier
these are their moto leggings so I got
them in black just in a classic color
and I got them in the high-rise of
course so they look like this they're a
little bit long on me so what I do is
just like tough them longer and you
can't tell it all the back looks like
this
and then there's like a little allo logo
on the side here this next thing I got
some aloe I've already won a few times I
think it's so cool basically it's this
little crop sweatshirt and then I don't
know if you can tell but how to rips all
throughout it and down the entire arm if
there's all rips so it's really funky I
love but this is cropped because you can
show off all of your high waisted
leggings and whatnot
so I really love this as we have been
wearing a sports bra last few days in my
feed your marks on it but it's just a
black little sports bra and then the
back is super cute and strappy and it
says ello and yeah it's just a really
nice basic sports bra to have and it's
really nice quality and then the last
thing I got from a low I had worn this
as well this one is so quiet I'm gonna
wear this all the time it's basically
just a wrap crop top it's really hard to
show you'll see a moron it just
basically wraps in the front it says a
low down here and then the sleeves are
ribbed and it's just really soft this is
just super cute this can go with
leggings as well the really nice
athleisure outfit so I'm really glad I
got this yeah I seriously love I love
you guys haven't heard of it and you
like athleisure clothes
definitely check them out they like the
same price point absolutely lemon so a
little bit pricier but the quality is
amazing and I love
designs okay and then the last door I
happening from is 2020 app a really
great online boutique everything is
really affordable and really cute the
first thing I want to show you guys I
think you will all be obsessed with so I
have a game print dress but I have some
princess Polly they sell it like
everywhere you know the black-and-white
one so when I saw the 2020 have had a
yellow and white one I was like oh my
gosh yes
so it's just like a yellow and white
little field rest and the Stratford uh
school it's so cute it's not too tired
not too loose I love it and it's just so
happy like this makes me so happy and
you look so tan in this so I'm really
happy that I got my hands on this one
okay the last two things from 2020 our
boats striped big surprise we all know
how I love starts here and this is going
to be so hard to show off me but you'll
see it more the Tryon it's just a
straight wrap dress it's just like wraps
around and this is really cute this is a
good length this is conservative in my
opinion I think it's really nice I love
the stripes on it yeah this is really
really nice quality as well it's thick
it's great I recommend this and then the
last piece from them is amazing as well
this is a striped little mini dress it's
strapless and then the sides have these
cute little ties that you can like cinch
your waist it waist in width then it
goes down and it has these little slits
on the side which i think is so cute i
