title of this video this is going to be
my Black Monday slash Cyber Monday haul
and I know this is kind of late the
reason for that is if you guys have been
keeping up with my channel I just posted
two blogs that I was in Texas so I
actually went to Texas for Thanksgiving
break if you want to know why I will
link those vlogs down below but I was
there and just didn't have all my
filming equipment and all the stuff I
wanted to use to film this video so I
hope you guys don't mind that it's a
little bit late but I still want to post
it cuz I have some really cool things to
show you before I get into the video
though if you guys are not following me
on social media you totally should it's
a great place to keep up with my daily
more personal life so here's my
instagram and i'll put my like twitter
and snapchat here it's really personal
it's not like super business EU to be i
just keep it you know kind of what i'm
actually doing on a day-to-day anyway so
now all this stuff was purchased on
cyber monday or black friday i through
kind of a few other things in the year
but i did go back friday shopping and
cyber monday shopping so it's not all a
lot I just just half of it isn't from
the actual days okay so the first group
of things I have to show you are all
through an app called wish this was not
a Black Friday Cyber Monday thing but
this stuff all just came in the mail so
I figured I would throw it in this video
so basically the wish app is a very
affordable shopping app and they have
anything you can imagine on there they
have like electronics and beauty and
fashion and hair and like home decor
literally everything it's simply fun to
kind of Hunter the app and a lot of
things are only like one dollar with one
dollar shipping so you can get amazing
deals and the shipping is pretty fast if
you order the express items if you join
with shipping can be like up to a month
so just keep that in mind it does have
like a projected delivery day under
item so when you order it you should
know around when you're gonna get it
okay so this is what the app looks like
as you can see there's just a bunch of
stuff you can scroll through and then
you can go to you know fashion
accessories makeup and beauty tops
hobbies home decor bottoms phone
upgrades baby and kids but really there
are so many different types of things
you can just kind of go through you can
go to your profile you can save some
things all this stuff literally so much
fun it's literally just like whenever
I'm procrastinating homework and stuff
I'll just go on wish and like see what I
can find
okay so I'm going to link everything in
this entire video down below if I can
find it and for these items I'm going to
put the prices in the corner because
everything is so affordable that I'm
about to show you okay so the first
thing I got from wish is this little hat
it's just like an ivory knit beanie kind
of hat with this cute little faux fur
pom-pom I thought this would be so cute
for the winter season because although I
do live in LA my home is in New York I'm
from New York but came to LA for school
so I am going home for Christmas and I'm
in where this little guys it's so cute
okay the next thing I got is a pack of
little hair ties but these are the like
I don't know what do you call these
they're basically like those creaseless
hair ties you certainly the only things
I use I use these all the time I think
they look here this is a pack of a bunch
of them and they're all different colors
which I love and I always lose these
literally a cure ties go missing
so often but me the next day I got a
wish I literally almost forgot to talk
about because I'm wearing them I'm
wearing colored contacts in this video
if you could not tell I have a dark
brown eyes normally which on me I feel
like is kind of boring sometimes and I
like to switch it up so I started
wearing close contacts once in a while
just for fun for videos so this is what
they look like they're a lot bigger than
my actual iris of my eyes so I don't
know if you guys can like notice that or
maybe it's just noticeable when I'm
putting them in but yeah these are only
like $5 I think and they have a ton of
different colors the ones I got I
believe are the grey color anyways I
wore these for your little photo shoot I
did
and I really like how they look they
just make my eyes pop a little bit okay
which has a lot of items that look like
popular items and I don't know if
they're like the same thing they just
come from the same Factory
but I got this swell bottle for like
eight dollars or something and it's this
swell honey it looks just like this full
bottle it works just like a small bottle
it's just the same pattern it's a bottle
it's this like purpley marbling pattern
like I was saying which app has a lot of
items that are look-alikes or they look
just like an item I don't know if it's
the same thing but this is a Beauty
Blender and it's just like the pink
normal Beauty Blender I was gonna use it
today but then I want to keep it in the
packaging for this video the next thing
is an eyebrow brush and this actually
says Anastasia Beverly Hills on it so
take what you want from that but I used
this brush every single day not this
exact one but I have the same one so I'm
sanding this but when that one gets kind
of old and worn out
here's just a close-up on what it looks
like please don't mind my nails they're
so gross I was gonna do them and I
didn't okay the next thing I got our a
pair of sheer white over-the-knee socks
and I actually bought these for theme
party and they didn't quite come in time
but I think I'm gonna wear them for like
a holiday party kind of thing I have
like a long oversized spot every dress
and I think these would look really cute
so I'm not open these now and see what
they look like okay yeah so baby just
white stretchy kind of sheer
over-the-knee white stocking socks this
is exactly what I wanted so yeah I think
these are gonna be really cute for like
themed parties or just anything if you
want kind of like the schoolgirl look I
think these are really nice and I
believe these are like $1 the last two
things I got from the wish app are
sunglasses because I have a sunglass
addiction sunglass some Miles's
addiction I have a lot of Ravens which
are not the cheapest sunglasses so I
want to get some more inexpensive a
sunglasses to wear you know to the beach
or places where am I
lose sunglasses so the first carrot I
got looks like this they're just black
with silver of newerth lenses and I
thought these would just go with
everything which is why I wanted these
so I haven't tried these on yet they
look like this let me know what you guys
think I think they're really cool like I
said they match everything and if you're
like me and like creeping on people and
don't want them to see that you're
creeping on them your buns I do the best
because people can't see your eyes yeah
I'm really really sorry okay in the next
pair of sunglasses I got as well as the
last thing from which are these ones
that look exactly like the illest evil
ones I wanted the most evil ones but I
never about them and then I saw these
and I was like wait they look just like
them so they look like this
I got like the pink lenses but you can
get a bunch of the colored lenses once
again your lenses are my because I
can be a creep and I can also look ugly
with no makeup on and wear these and no
one knows yes you guys should totally
download the wish app if you want to
browse and find cute and expensive fun
things maybe for holiday gifts or
whatever totally download the app and if
you already have the app what you're
waiting for
just go brown it's super fun I got a
bunch of cool stuff I'm definitely gonna
be shopping with them again thank you so
much to wish for sponsoring this video
everything I said was totally totally
honest I promise you guys I would not
lie about anything
okay the next door I house and things
from is make me chic calm they had a
great Cyber Monday Black Friday online
sale so I totally hit that up I know I
normally do try on hauls but because I
am kind of late with this video I just
want to get it up as soon as possible so
this one is not fire on and so like I
said I'm going to link everything down
below so if you want to see what
something looks like it should be linked
and you should be able to see it on a
model okay I really been loving the body
suits I just love like the sleek top in
look and there's no punches and lumps so
I got this white ribbed off-the-shoulder
bodysuit it has like this little half
sleeve which i think is cute and it's a
full bodysuit which is perfect because I
hate underlines and it also has a little
clip to the bottom so you don't have to
completely disapprove your
to go to the bathroom okay the next
thing I got is this turtleneck sweater a
dress thing I have another one that's a
really similar to this coming on later
in the hall and I love it so I got this
one is well and it's just a burgundy
color which if you guys know me it's my
favorite color
turtleneck dress and what I really like
is the science or kind of laced up with
these little ties so you tie the bottom
and it looks really cute just another
way to kind of incorporate the lace-up
trend into your wardrobe this next thing
I'm obsessed with it's like a bomber
jacket but it's a sweater material it's
kind of hard to explain it's just like
this super soft squishy sweater material
and then I just have some like floral
embroidery and such on it just really
cute really cozy it's gonna be perfect
for layering for the winter and fall
time time you guys were asking about the
overall dress that I wore in my high
school versus college situations video
it is feasible I wear that all the time
so when I saw that make me chic had
overall dresses in two colors I did not
have I hopped on that so I just got this
overall dressed in a white color so cute
I love how it's like distressed and then
it's just kind of cut off on the bottom
and then they also have it in a denim
color material thing so yeah of course I
got that one as well looks like this and
the same thing it just goes down into
the skirt same like things kind of
happening so I'll probably cut those off
but yeah really cute okay the last thing
I got for making chic is a pair of shoes
they look like this they're kind of out
of my comfort zone but I thought they're
really cool and I should try them out I
feel like they resemble the Puma
creepers I could be wrong if I'm wrong
sorry but they're just this burgundy
faux suede with this like tan rubber
sole I don't know I thought they were
cool I thought they'd be nice it's just
like a basic black and white outfit or
something okay the next story I have
some things
is Windsor store calm I love Windsor
everything's so trendy and cute and I'm
obsessed okay the first thing from
Windsor is just like that other sweater
dress I just showed you from make me
chic except it's a different color so
this one is just like a kind of tan
knitted one but the same thing the
lace-up sides and then it ties at the
bottom this is so cute and I have a
little cowl neck as well so I love this
next one wing sir is this burgundy off
the shoulder top it's a little wrinkly
right now but it looks like this and
then the cool part about this is at the
end of the sleeves it has these little
ties so you can tie like little mops at
the end of your sleeves and I think it's
just a really cute detail I got this
pair of shorts they're just these are
roughly lap shorts they remind me a lot
of the brandy melville shorts I love
these so much they're so comfy and cute
for lounging around I got two t-shirt
dresses from Windsor I love their
t-shirt dresses so this one is just a
black acid wash kind of thing going on
you can say it's great you can say it's
a sand wash I don't know I'm just a cute
t-shirt dress super soft super comfy and
then I have one that's really similar to
that one it's just this olive green
color except this one has a little
pocket but the same kind of like this
dress I should walk acid-wash looking
thing I got this slip dress sort of
thing it's so cool it has this beautiful
lacy detailing in the front and then it
has like a bunch of ties I like ties in
the front and the back and then it just
kind of goes down really trendy right
now really beautiful fast clothing item
from Windsor is this sweater dress kind
of thing it's a super soft material with
this mock neck kind of top and then it
just goes down oops
it's about this following it just goes
down into a dress okay the last thing I
got from Windsor are a pair of boots
these are these thigh-high suede boots
that are so popular right now I got this
taupe color I love these so much I think
they're so cool and I keep seeing them
all over Instagram and stuff so I can't
wait to style these and wear
never zipper on the side that you can
probably just see so it's easy to kind
of get you Megan okay so on Black Friday
I went into forever 21 because who
didn't and I got a few things I don't
think anything I got was on sale like
literally just stuff that I bought on
Black Friday most of it wasn't even on
sale like what the heck
anyways first thing I got is this kind
of brown rust color top it was only 990
and I just thought it would be really
cute
gonna fall it looks like that it's just
a deep V kind of some ribbed stuff going
on kind of similar and color to that is
this orange e and bodycon dress also
ribbed it's just like a v-neck and like
I said body con I got some kind of a
sweater cable knit looking over the knee
socks just gray ones because I think
these are really cute and I like how
people style beads with outfits and
they're really affordable so I just pick
these up okay you know when you're a
forever 21 and you're in the checkout
line they have like all those socks and
headbands and hair ties and everything
and like you just want to buy all of it
so they kind of sucked me in and I saw
these taco socks guys look how cute that
little taco is yeah so obviously I had
to get the taco socks last thing from
forever 21 is this little headband with
a Santa hat on it because I know the
neat way to Christmas parties and an
ugly sweater is not enough for me I need
something more so I saw this I thought
it was so cute and just like funnier
than your normal Santa hat so yeah I got
this like I said I was in Texas on Black
Friday so they have this store I don't
know if it's only down south or what but
it's called altered state and I got this
top I should not have bought this
because it was really overpriced and it
was the only thing basically not on sale
in the store was like buy one get one
free sweaters accessories scarves pants
everything would just tops and of course
what I wanted was a top but I think it's
so cute and it's really flattering on
it's just this floral top but it's more
like a fall wintery floral and it's just
kind of smocked at the top and on the
top of its sleeves and then it flows out
has some flowy sleeves and flowy at the
bottom I went to a
outlet in Texas which I didn't even know
they had Lululemon out west but it was
really great deals so I got a few things
first thing I got are these leggings and
they look really tiny but I promise they
stretch through this emerald green color
which I thought was really unique and
just really pretty and they go down
there like full-length of me I think
they're supposed to be 7/8 length but
I'm really sure I'm five foot one so
yeah I got these I will try and link
them down below if I can find them all
this stuff was very unstable as well
because it was an outlet so that's why I
got this stuff but I just got this tank
top it's kind of a high-neck sort of
thing going on but then the cool part is
the back is like crossover and then
totally open so what you can do is tie
up the sides if you want it to be like a
crop top sort of thing or you can just
leave it open and you can see your
sports bra so that's really cool this is
called the all tied up tank because you
know you can tie up the back the last
thing I got from Lululemon is a sports
bra this is only $19 which is so good
for a Lululemon sports bra I've actually
wanted this one for a while so that was
cool it's just a black sports bra and
then my back is all strapping you like
this which is really cute and this is
called the energy bra my gosh it's like
flying I know as you grow out exhale so
yeah okay and the very last thing in
this whole video oh my gosh it was so
long is a wild fox hoodie I got this
from my Nordstrom Rack know I got it
from Saks off the fifth and it was
originally $100 I got it for like $40 or
something like that but it was just it
just screamed my name it's a wild Fox
jumper it says let's work more vacations
softer kisses stronger drinks and it's
my favorite burgundy color these are so
cozy and so soft if I can find it I will
link it down below and you guys should
