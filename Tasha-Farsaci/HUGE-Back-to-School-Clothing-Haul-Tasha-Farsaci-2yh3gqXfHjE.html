school haul video I know this might seem
kind of late but I don't go back until
like September fourth or fifth I go back
a lot later than a lot of people that's
because I get out I'd like the end of
june so yes I just recently went to New
York City I got back last night so the
majority of these items were bought in
New York City but I do have a few things
that I got before I left there I decided
I would show you as well okay the first
thing was sent to me but this is the
only thing out of everything that was
sent to me this girl has a website
called urban studs on etsy I will call
all the links down in the down bar but
she makes like graphic t-shirts and so
she sent me one and I love like
sponsoring at T stores because I feel
like they're just really like
unrecognized sometimes so anyway she
sent me this muscle tee that she made
and it says for your mind on it and like
this cool kind of like I don't know
pattern font and I just think it's
really cute and I'm really excited wear
this with like a sweater and some
high-waisted shorts so yes she sent me
this and i will put all the information
to the empty shop down below if you're
interested my stuff I didn't get when i
was in new york was just an order from
pacsun so the first thing i got was just
my backpack for school and it looks like
this it looks a lot like mine from last
year if you watched what's in my bag
video or whatever except that one got
destroyed it was from brandy melville
and he liked it fell apart so I don't
really know if I recommend the one that
I had last you about this one I really
like it has lots of compartment and I
think it's really cute next things in
tax oh and I'm thinking of wearing on
the first day of school it's like this
floral little skater skirt thing these
are really popular and I think it's
really cute I also got this little Daisy
kind of crop top thing and I got this
because the back is super like low and
like you can see your back so I wanted
to wear that one like cage brawl out
from brandy melville with it so yes that
then you guys maybe not know brandy
melville cells packs on or what nope X
and sells brandy melville right now so I
just got this
a black skirt that I'm actually going to
wear with this for a concert that I'm
going to so that's why I got this but
it's just a sheer little black chiffon
skirt and these I were like all the time
the last thing I got from pacsun is a
flannel and I'm obsessed with flannels I
with them all the time especially in
like the winter I always wear with like
my puffy vests and like scarves and
leggings so I got this one just because
I love with the print or just like the
colors on it it's like the perfect
flannel I'm always on the search for the
perfect flannel and I think I found it
um yeah this was kind of pricey but I
really enjoy it and the bag it goes down
kind of low so it covers your boss so
you can wear this with leggings so
that's what I got from packs on now on
to the stuff that I bought in New York
City I'm gonna warn you literally all
this stuff is floral print like almost
all of it is floral print and I didn't
do that on purpose I just really really
like floral print so yeah okay first
store was forever 21 and I got this
dress I had to get it a medium I'm
normally a small so it's kind of big on
me but I couldn't find it in any other
size and it looks like this it's like
black floral print and it has like kind
of a bustier-style like corset style
front and then it just goes down into a
dress so yeah I like this also because
it has padding so you don't wear a bra
which is always you know a good time and
yeah next thing from forever 21 is super
wrinkly because it was in my suitcase
but it looks like this it's just like
this kind of peasant style top it has
like this crocheted detailing at the top
and then it's big quarter length sleeves
and it flows out and it has like these
little tassel things somewhere here here
we are but yeah I really like this and
yeah i worked at Lululemon is obviously
he's not go back to school I just kind
of got it to work out and I got one of
the lululemon headbands cuz I'm basic
and I want to look cool to gym so it is
just the black one it has a little
lululemon sign and these are great
because they have like um sticky rubber
things in the inside so it doesn't slip
and I
went so much at the gym especially
buoyed by my hairline so these are great
then I went to urban outfitters and
first thing i got was this tank top it
was on sale I wanted it before it was on
sale but no it's on sale and it's just
like this crocheted Pat I'd kind of
thing it's kind of weird some people
might not like it but I think it's
really cool and the coolest part about
this was it was marked down from forty
nine dollars to twenty dollars and then
when i checked out it was only nine
dollars so that was a good thing so yeah
next thing from urban outfitters i
almost didn't get cuz it was really
expensive like all their stuff but i
really like it and i love dresses for
back to school and just for school in
general because they're really
comfortable so i got this one and i
don't know if this is floral or tribal
or what but it's like black and white on
the front all the way down but then the
sides I like purple and colorful and
just really pretty the front has some
buttons and then some tassels and it's
just really really pretty and here's the
back but yeah this is a really pretty
dress and it's like really nicely made
so I guess the price was justifiable
maybe maybe not okay next place that I
want is necessary clothing you guys
might have heard of it if you've been in
New York but to store only in New York
and they have really cute stuff so I got
three things first thing i got was a
sweater and it's like one of those
really holy sweaters I'd like a bunch of
holes in it and I think these are really
cute some people might think they're
dumb but I like it and it's just really
big it has like some rips hold on lemme
18 let me give you a sneak peek see you
can see it's like ripped a little bit
and it's just really big and comfy and I
can't wait to play this with like
leggings and scarves and boots and I'm
pissed I'm just excited for the fall
clothing what can I say next I got this
chiffon top and it's just like neon
floral colored thing but I got it for
the back because
you can see it has a little bow and I've
wanted something with like the bow back
like this one and i thought this pattern
was super pretty yet so i got this one
next thing I got might be one of my
favorite things it's one of those like
kimono tops that are kind of in style
now only it's going to be kind of hard
to show it's this floral print once
again and it has kind of longer sleeves
and it just kind of goes down like a
cardigan would but it's open and it
doesn't have like any buttons or
anything and I don't know this looks
really cute with like ripped up denim
shorts and like high racing like a lacy
tank top I don't know it's just really
cute and i'm sure i'll be doing a
lookbook you know i'll try to put this
in it okay last but certainly not least
i went to brandy melville i actually got
some subscribers in there so shout out
to you guys for coming up to me if you
ever see me definitely come up to me I
may look kind of like a bitch but that's
just you know how my face gets sometimes
I promise I'm not a bitch but anyways
thanks for coming up to me guys and
Bernie level was ridiculously packed it
was crazy and you couldn't even move and
it really stressful but I got four
things so the first thing i got was at
the Gisele top i have this in white i
went like every single day and I wanted
this to wear with that like floral
skater skirt from packs on and it's just
you know the cropped t-shirt yeah then I
got a pair of pants which might also be
my favorite things I got they are huge
floral like flared pants that look like
this it looks like a maxi skirt when
you're wearing them but I'm really into
like the wide line loose pants like this
I think they called like palazzo pants
or something I might be wrong but yeah
these were amazing and they're super
comfortable and I can't wait to wear
them and there were high waisted so I'm
probably gonna wear them with that black
crop top last two things I got with both
formal what a surprise so i got this
floral dress and it's that super super
soft material that a lot of brandy staff
is in and it's just floral and then it
kind of it goes tight here and then
flows out a little bit it's really
simple but it's so
for boom and I i love this i wore
yesterday and it was it was great last
thing I got from Brandi I don't know if
it's a dresser sure i'm not quite sure i
think i could wear either way because
I'm really short um hmm I just really
really like the print of it floral haha
but it looks like this it has like a
double strap kind of thing going on and
then it's just loose and flowy I don't
know it looks really short like but it
covers my blind everything I'll probably
end up just wearing it with like
leggings in a sweater but yeah and then
it goes kind of low in the back with
double steps and yeah I really like the
print of this is like my favorite print
in there so yeah so that was my back to
school haul video obviously not all this
is rebecca school because some of this
stuff wouldn't really be appropriate for
school but you know whatever i don't
believe a dress code to my school

limits I hope you guys enjoyed this once
