school clothing haul video
this might seem early for some of you
but I go to college
August 25th I leave so yeah it's not
really really for me and I know some
people actually start high school in
August so here we are you guys probably
know that I don't need any more clothes
at all
so this haul was very not needed but I
actually just went to New York City to
meet my roommate in college because she
lives in Long Island so I wanted my mom
to meet up with her new mom so we would
kind of me before College started and
that was awesome so while I was there
you know naturally I did some shopping
because it's New York City and I'm
obsessed with shopping so yeah that
happened I'm a little disclaimer I am
going to college and I'm going to
college in Los Angeles so these clothing
pieces are more summery than they are
fall and they really don't fit a lot of
high school dress codes because I like
crop things I like shorts and I'm going
to college so I don't need to follow
high school dress codes anymore so yeah
I apologize if these clothing pieces do
not match you just code but I want to
still show you guys because these videos
are super fun and they're some of my
favorites
before I get into the actual haul
portion of this video I want to tell you
guys about a really cool app because it
applies to my closet so basically this
app is called snupps
and it's basically like a Pinterest
mixed with Instagram which I love both
of those so it's awesome the items that
you're pinning you have they're your own
items and pictures so it's really cool
for other people because they can see
into your closet see the things that you
like that you have you know all that
stuff and it's good for you because you
can keep track of the items that you
have and so you know like what to pair
things with in the future or what to not
buy more of yeah so it's actually a
really cool app I'm going to show you
guys a little bit of it on my phone
before we get into the hallway so
hopefully you can see this okay but
basically snupps looks like this and as
you open it up you can kind of go to my
profile I'll show you
like so this is my profile right now my
username is just Tasha first ah just
with my full name by the way and I have
a few folders right now I have my makeup
must-haves my shoes and bags and wallets
and I don't pull like all of my stuff in
here just my favorites so bags and
wallets this is my new toy brooch bag I
put it
here and I have my Rebecca Minkoff as
you can see as for shoes I have these
new nude heels like God and then you
know just like a bunch of shoes and
stuff as you can see just my favourites
and then once again might make a bust
has these are the makeup items that I
use practically every day just my
favorites if you go to the Explo page
you can see a bunch of different
people's profiles and things like that
so you can go into like fashion and see
like this person's outfits and stuff so
I don't know I think it's just a really
cool app it gives you some really cool
inspiration and you guys can totally
creep on me and see where I get like a
bunch of my favorite things okay so
really quickly I just want to show you
how to add a picture or a new like
category or whatever so basically I'm
just on my profile you can do this from
anywhere just press this little ad
button and I press add item you just go
into the little like camera roll and I
have this picture right here that I took
of these new pair of shoes that I got
and then you can either add more items
or just continue so I'm gonna continue
as you can see these are the shoes so
I'm just going to name them and then go
to shelves and I'm just gonna add them
to my shoes but you can also create a
shelf here I'm just gonna once again add
them to my shoes and then go back and
you can add more details or share on
Facebook and Twitter I'm just gonna be
done right here and you press done and
then as you can see they're added right
into my little shoe category once again
my username is Tasha for size if you
want to go follow me that I'd be super
awesome so now that I've showed you the
app I'm gonna get right into the hall
I had a few items come in the mail
before I went to New York so I want to
show you guys those two the first thing
is from a website called Stella comm and
it's basically like an Australian
website which I love Australian clothing
websites I think the clothes are so cute
so I got this long-sleeve romper I think
rompers are amazing they're my favorite
things ever this one's really cute I has
this really nice boho print the front is
kind of like a lace-up kind of thing and
then it just goes into some shorts you
guys know that I always have orders from
she inside so some of those things came
before I left the first is this romper
this is a very popular print right now
you guys are probably seen this print
before but basically it's another
same rapper this looks really huge but
the waste actually cinches and this is
really cute it's just one of those
popular like crossover drape in the
front rompers
I got these pants and these are kind of
like the popular pants style like the
harem pants unfortunately they don't fit
me very well but they're still really
cute they're like a blue and white
tie-dye I wish they fit they're just a
little bit too long and they don't
really fit me how I like them too but
they're still really cute next week
inside I have this dress and I'm really
not a fan of it it look a lot different
on the website basically it looks like
this it's like this white flowy dress
and the top has some embroidery
basically on the website it looks like
there was like sequins and like actual
studs but on here it's like all stitched
in I don't know it's a little bit big on
me as well if you guys aren't familiar
with she inside it's basically like an
Asian based clothing website so a lot of
the items run pretty small which is good
for me because I'm very small and short
normally it's really hard for me to find
pants that fit me and I can never order
pants online because they'll never fit
me but I tried it with Chi insider
they're actually like they fit
flawlessly so first pair of pants I got
are these black like jegging jean things
and they just have some rips in the
knees as you can see there's just some
slashes in the legs and that's like a
really popular trend right now these
look super super tiny but they're
extremely stretchy so these fit me great
they're not too long on these so if
you're a really small person like me I'm
five foot one definitely try out shoe
size pants these are a small by the way
I love them I got a pair of boyfriend
jeans mushy inside a wild back and I
love that they fit me amazing once again
so I saw these white ones and I was like
I have to try them out and how amazing
guys so it's these white boyfriend jeans
I love these because the legs are
totally destroyed see they have these
huge rips and these are crop they look
great when you cut the bottoms and I'm
honestly in love with these these are so
cute they fit me great the last thing
when she inside is the same pattern as
that wrapper I didn't even realize it
was the same pattern I ordered them I'm
stupid I actually wore this in an
Instagram picture really cute it's
really popular this kind of dress
see not a few websites but it's this
halter neck and then it has that same
pattern it goes down this one's a little
bit long on me it sounds like my knee
which I don't know being a short person
I don't know if I like that length but I
still wear it I still think it's really
cute ok the last storm before the New
York stuff is romwe and it's basically
the same thing is she inside except they
don't have as big of a selection but I
get stuff from there too so the first
thing I got is this tank top and I think
I wore this in my last video it's really
cute it's like this boho royal blue tank
top was in crochet detailing this is
really like pretty I wear this with
white jeans that I actually have for Mom
wrong way so I'll show you those in a
minute but I love this ok these jeans
were actually just in the wash so
they're soaking wet so I want to show
them for this video but these are like
the same jeans as the black ones and
they just have some like rips in the
legs these are great I love wearing
these with that blue top
next time wrong way I have this dress
and I posted a picture on Instagram in
this dress you guys were loving it asked
me where it's from and it's from around
way basically it's this crocheted dress
and it flows down this is very sheer so
unless you have like a nude thong and
they can nude bra you're probably gonna
want to wear like a slip underneath
I warned you would slip when I was
wearing it but it's really hue it's
beautiful to wear the tan and I love it
the last time from romwe I'm not a fan I
thought it was going to be a t-shirt
material and I got it and it's like this
shiny like satiny material but it looks
like this you might have seen this like
on tumblr or websites like that oh my
god uh-huh and I swore it was like a
cotton t-shirt material but it's not at
all it's like a shiny material I don't
know I'm not a fan probably sell this at
like Plato's Closet or unprinted or
something okay finally moving on to the
things from New York City the first
place I went to is a ritzy yeah I would
compare it to urban outfitters except
maybe a little more expensive because
they have really nice quality materials
so pretty much I never buy anything from
there because that's a very expensive
and I kind of just go in and like want
everything but they were having a huge
sale and when I say huge sale I mean
the entire top floor was all color coded
sale and the bottom half is like the
bottom floor half but was also so it was
intense like crazy sale I only got two
things but I'm honestly in love with
them so the first thing I got is just
it's like purpley burgundy colored kind
of sweater nick long-sleeve crop top and
of course you guys know me I went right
to like the burgundy maroon my color
coated rack but yeah it's really really
cute this was only I think like $15 or
$20 or something which is great for a
ritzy ah because once again I had really
good quality so I love this the other
thing from over its yeah actually looks
really cute with that shirt and it's
this green jacket and I have like an
obsession with green jackets I read them
all the time and this one I saw it I
thought it was gonna be really expensive
because it's erisa
and I open the tag and it was only $30
instead of like how much was it
originally okay it was originally $95
and I got it for 30 which is amazing and
it's just this really cute olive green
like kind of cropped fitted oh my god
jacket and this is gonna look really
cute with that long-sleeve shirt this
will be good for LA and like at like
nighttime and everything so I really
like it by the way and all this shopping
was done in Soho basically except for
one place but like if you guys go to New
York City go to Soho you'll find like
all these stores the next place I went
was mystique boutique which is kind of
just one of those classic style
boutiques if you guys offenders over you
know what I mean so I found this romper
and I'm thinking of wearing this like
going out in college because you know
there's like more nightlife and you
dress up and all that stuff so it's just
this white lace with a nude top and it
kind of crosses over as you can see
there's a cutout right there like in the
stomach and then it just flows out into
this white romper and I thought this was
so pretty especially with like nude
heels I fell in love with it they still
get exposed zipper on the back and I
don't know I thought this was really
really pretty and it was like structured
and it could be really well so I picked
this up I got one thing from necessary
clothing it's just this olive green top
and it's so so pretty basically the
front of it is like crocheted and
have this lace-up kind of thing with
tassels and then the sleeves are all
like crochet I don't know if you can
tell but it's so cute and then it's
moving on I went to Granny Melville
first thing I got is the shirt I'm
wearing it's just this green cropped
halter top i absolutely love the fit
opus so I got that and then I got these
little shorts because I'm going to
college I can't wear like really
mismatched ugly pajamas I mean I guess I
can but I got these cute little shorts
to sleep in because I thought they'd be
good for like college and they were only
like 12 dollars I think so last thing I
got from brandy is such a classic me
piece like whatever it's this maroon
burgundy knit halter and win a Topshop
and I know Topshop is all the rage with
youtubers nowadays but like I never find
anything there and if I do it's really
overpriced so I'm like okay I don't love
it that much to pay like however much
I'm paying for it so I went in I went to
the sale I was like okay I'll see if
there's anything cute and actually
really like this top and it was still
like $25 which like I don't know I mean
that's not horrible but like it's still
not super cheap but it's a really cute
top so it's just this blue little floral
top has some really cute little Chloe
sleeves it's cropped a little off the
shoulder nicely and then the back has
kind of like a layered thing going on
you probably can't see but it's really
cute this would like those white jeans
or maybe even the boyfriend jeans it's
like that could be cute but white ones
but yeah I just thought this would be
cute you know I went to H&amp;amp;M and I
honestly haven't bought anything from
each and I'm in the longest time I just
never find anything there anymore but I
actually found a few things so the first
thing that I got are these are shorts
and it's really hard for me to find
high-waisted shorts that fit but H&amp;amp;M
shorts actually run pretty small so
these fit very nicely I just got these
kind of black kind of like washed out
looking shorts they're not like super
dark which I like they're like a great
black they're just sprayed on the bottom
I don't have any black iris in shorts
that are like frayed and like distressed
looking some these are really cute and
they were affordable I'm
so fast okay and then the last thing
from HN I got these pants and I'm
obsessed with these comfy like harem
pants I have a few of them ever crown me
I wear all the time and I saw these ones
and the pattern was so cute so they're
basically this really cool like boho
pattern and they're just like they're
really loose felt flowy comfy pants oops
except they get tight at the bottom
these are great I love wine these with
just like white flowy tank top so I
could even wear it with like this top is
be cute yeah so comfortable like I'll
probably look homeless and this is like
great airport pants like if you guys I
want a pair of his pants
seriously we're them to the airport you
will love your life I went to urban
outfitter I didn't really plan on
getting anything but what I got because
I haven't Reuben Outfitters near me all
I got was a gray halter Braille lab
because I wear these all the time I have
a black one a cream one a burgundy one
so I got this gray one Urban's are my
favorite
almost done guys I swear I went to
Lululemon my friend Gretchen got to
Moe's beauty has so much Lululemon and
it honestly inspires me to get some
which is sad because I don't work out
half as much as she does but this show
is on sale and it's like my favorite
color it's just this cute tank top and
in the back has a little bit of lemon
sign and then some like grayish black
match and like I said this was on sale
so I was like okay maybe I'll work out
okay guys last item if you made it
through this video I love you but
basically I went to the Nordstrom Rack
in Union Square and my mom and I
normally go to Union Square it's a cute
place I like the Nordstrom Rack so I got
this little vest and basically it's like
my favorite army green color you guys
probably know I love our McCain and
Murrow and they're like my favorites and
they go great together so I got this
like vast and I love it because it's a
very like loose I have like a army bass
but it's it's like thick you know what I
