school clothing haul video this might
seem early for some of you but I I go to
college august 25th I leave so yeah it's
not really really for me and I know some
people actually start high school in
august so here we are you guys probably
know that I don't need any more clothes
at all so this haul was very not needed
but i actually just went to new york
city to meet my roommate in college
because she lives in Long Island so I
wanted my mom to meet up with her who
mom so we would kind of me before
college started and it was awesome so
while i was there you know naturally i
did some shopping because it's New York
City and I'm obsessed with shopping so
yeah that happened I'm a little
disclaimer i am going to college and i'm
going to college in los angeles so these
clothing pieces are more summery than
they are fall and they really don't fit
a lot of high school dress codes because
i like crop things i like shorts and i'm
going to college so I don't need to
follow high school dress codes anymore
so yeah I apologize if these clothing
pieces do not match you dress code but I
want to still show you guys because
these videos are super fun and there's
some of my favorites before I get into
the actual Hall portion of this video I
want to tell you guys about a really
cool app because it applies to my closet
so basically this app is called schnapps
and it's basically like a Pinterest
mixed with instagram which I love both
of those so it's awesome the items that
you're pinning you have their your own
items and pictures so it's really cool
for other people because they can see
into your closet see the things that you
like that you have you know all that
stuff and it's good for you because you
can keep track of the items that you
have and so you know like what to pair
things with in the future or watching
Matt buy more up yeah so it's actually a
really cool app I'm going to show you
guys a little bit of it on my phone
before we get into the hallway so
hopefully you can see that's okay but
basically snopes looks like this and as
you open it up you can kind of go to my
profile I'll show you like so this is my
profile right now my username is just
touch of our saj with my full name by
the way and i have a few folders right
now i have my makeup must-haves my shoes
and bags and wallets and I don't pull
like all of my stuff in here just my
favorites so bags and wallets this is my
new toy brooch bag I put it
here and i have my rebecca minkoff as
you can see as for shoes i have these
new nude heels like God and then you
know just like a bunch of shoes and
stuff as you can see just my favorites
and then once again my makeup must-haves
these are the makeup items that I use
practically every day just my favorites
if you go to the explore page you can
see a bunch of different peoples
profiles and things like that so you can
go into like fashion and see like this
person's outfits and stuff so I don't
know I think it's just a really cool app
it gives you some really cool
inspiration and you guys can totally
creeped on me and see where I get like a
bunch of my favorite things ok so really
quickly I just want to show you how to
add a picture or a new like category or
whatever so basically I'm just on my
profile you can do this from anywhere
just press this little Add button and I
press add item please just go into the
little like camera roll and I have this
picture right here that I took of these
new pair of shoes that i got and then
you can either add more items or just
continue so i'm going to continue as you
can see these are the shoes so I'm just
going to name them and then go to
shelves and I'm just going to add them
to my shoes but you can also create a
shelf here i'm just going to once again
add them to my shoes and then go back
and you can add more details or share on
facebook and twitter i'm just going to
be done right here and you press done
and then as you can see they're added
right into my little shoe category once
again my user name is Tasha far saj if
you want to go follow me that would be
super awesome so now that I've showed
you the app I'm going to get right into
the hall I had a few items come in the
mail before I went to New York so I want
to show you guys those too the first
thing is from a website called Stella
calm and it's basically like an
Australian website which I love
Australian clothing website so i feel
like the clothes are so cute so i got
this long sleeve romper I think rompers
are amazing that my favorite things ever
this one's really cute it has this
really nice boho print the front is kind
of like a lace-up kind of thing and then
it just goes into some shorts you guys
know that I always have ordered from
sheinside so some of those things came
before I left the first is this romper
this is a very popular print right now
you guys are probably seen this print
before but basically it's another
I ain't romper this looks really huge
but the waist actually cinches and this
is really cute it's just one of those
popular like crossover drape in the
front rompers I got these pants and
these are kind of like the popular pants
style like the harem pants unfortunately
they don't fit me very well but there's
still really cute they're like a blue
and white tie dye I wish they'd fit
they're just a little bit too long and
they don't really fit me how I like them
too but they're still really cute next
week she inside i have this dress and
i'm really not a fan of it it look a lot
different on the website um basically it
looks like this it's like this white
flowy dress and the top has some
embroidery basically on the website it
looks like there was like sequins and
like actual studs but on here it's like
all stitched in I don't know it's a
little bit big on me as well if you guys
aren't familiar with she inside it's
basically like an Asian based clothing
website so a lot of the items run pretty
small switch is good for me because I'm
very small and short normally it's
really hard for me to find pants that
fit me and I can never order pants
online because they'll never fit me but
I tried it with Chi inside or they're
actually like they fit flawlessly so
first pair of pants are these black like
jegging Jean things and they just have
some rips in the knees as you can see
there's just some slashes in the legs
and that's like a really popular trend
right now these look super super tiny
but they're extremely stretching so
these fit me great they're not too long
on me so if you're a really small person
like me I'm five foot one definitely try
out shooting size pants these are a
small by the way I love them I'm out of
here a boyfriend jeans mushy inside a
wild back and I love that they pick me
amazing once again so I saw these white
ones and I was like I have to try them
out and how amazing guys so it's these
white boyfriend jeans I love these
because the legs are totally destroyed
see they have these huge bricks and
these are crop they look great when you
cut the bottoms and I'm honestly in love
with these these are so cute they fit me
great the last thing when she inside is
the same pattern as that rapper I didn't
even realize of the same pattern my
order them I'm stupid I actually warned
us in an Instagram picture really cute
it's really popular this kind of dress
I've seen out a few websites but it's
this halter neck and then it has that
same pattern it goes down this one's a
little bit long on me it goes down to
like my knee which I don't know being a
short person I don't know if I like that
length but i still wear it i still think
it's really cute okay the last door
before the New York stuff is wrong way
and it's basically the same thing is she
inside except they don't have as big of
a selection but I get stuff from there
too so the first thing I got is this
tank top and I think I wore this in my
last video it's really cute it's like
this boho royal blue tank top ISM
crochet detailing this is really like
pretty I wear this with white jeans that
I actually have a mom wrong way so i'll
show you those in a minute but i love
this okay these jeans were actually just
in the wash so they're soaking wet so i
want to show them for this video but
these are like the same genes as the
black ones and they just have some like
rips in the legs these are great i love
wine knees with that blue top next time
wrong way i have this dress and I posted
a picture on Instagram in this dress you
guys were loving it asked me where it's
from and it's from brown way basically
it's this crocheted dress and it flows
down this is very sheer so unless you
have like a nude thong and make a nude
bra you're probably gonna want to wear
like a slip underneath I wanted slip
when I was wearing it but it's really
Hugh it's beautiful to wear the tan and
I love it last time from wrong way i'm
not a fan of i thought it was going to
be a t-shirt material and I got it and
it's like this shiny like satiny
material but it looks like this you
might have seen this like on tumblr or
websites like that oh my god um and I
swore it was like a cotton t-shirt
material but it's not at all it's like a
shiny material I don't know I'm not a
fan probably sell this at like plato's
closet or unprinted or something okay
finally moving on to the things from New
York City the first place I went to is
aritzia I would compare it to urban
outfitters except maybe a little more
expensive because they have really nice
quality materials so pretty much I never
buy anything from there because it's a
very expensive and I kind of just go in
and like want everything but they were
having a huge sale and when I say huge
sale I mean
the entire top floor was all color coded
sale and the bottom half of like the
bottom floor half but was also so it was
intense like crazy sale I only got two
things but I'm honestly in love with
them so the first thing i got is just
this like purpley burgundy colored kind
of sweater neck long sleeve crop top and
of course you guys know me I went right
to like the burgundy maroon my
color-coded rack but yeah it's really
really cute this was only I think like
fifteen dollars or twenty dollars or
something which is great for its SIA
because once again I had really good
quality so i love this the other thing
from aritzia actually looks really cute
with that shirt and it's this green
jacket and i have like an obsession with
green jackets i read them all the time
and this one I saw it I thought it was
going to be really expensive because
it's ERISA and I open the tag it was
only thirty dollars instead of like how
much was it originally okay it was
originally $95 and I naught for 30 which
is amazing and it's just this really
cute our olive green like kind of
cropped fitted um oh my god jacket and
this is gonna look really cute with that
long sleeve shirt um this will be good
for LA and like that like nighttime and
everything so I really like it by the
way and all this shopping was done in
Soho basically except for one place but
like if you guys go to New York City go
to soho you'll find like all these
stores the next place I went was
mystique boutique which is kind of just
one of those classic Soho boutiques if
you guys have been to some you know what
I mean so I found this romper and
thinking of wearing this like going out
in college because you know there's like
more night life and you dress up and all
that stuff so it's just this white lace
with a nude top and it kind of crosses
over as you can see there's a cutout
right there like in the stomach and then
it just flows out into this white romper
and I thought this was so pretty
especially with like nude heels I fell
in love with it they still get exposed
zipper on the back and I don't know I
thought this was really really pretty
and it was like structure and it can be
really well so I picked this up I got
one thing from necessary clothing it's
just this olive green top and it's so so
pretty basically the front of it is like
crocheted and
have this lace up kind of thing with
tassels and then the sleeves are all
like crochet I don't know if you can
tell but it's so cute and then it's
moving on i went to brandy melville
first thing i got is the shirt i'm
wearing it's just this green cropped
halter top i absolutely love the fit
opus so i got that and then i got these
little shorts because i'm going to
college I can't wear like really
mismatched ugly pajamas I mean I guess I
can but I got these cute little shorts
to sleep in because I thought they'd be
good for like college and they were only
like twelve dollars i think so last
thing I happen brandy is such a classic
me peace like whatever it's this maroon
Burgundy knit halter and with a topshop
and I know topshop is all the rage with
youtubers nowadays the like I never find
anything there and if I do it's really
overpriced so I'm like okay I don't love
it that much to pay like however much
I'm paying for it so I went in I went to
the sale I was like okay I'll see if
there's anything cute and actually
really like this top and it was still
like twenty-five dollars which like I
don't know I mean that's not horrible
but like it's still not super cheap but
it's a really cute top so it's just this
will do little floral top has some
really cute little chloe sleeves its
crop will go off the shoulder nicely and
then the back has kind of like a layered
thing going on you probably can't see
but it's really cute this would like
those white jeans or maybe even the
boyfriend jeans it's like that could be
cute the white ones but yeah I just
thought this would be cute you know I
went to each and I'm and I honestly
haven't bought anything from each and
I'm in the longest time I just never
find anything there anymore but I
actually found a few things so the first
thing that I got are these are shorts
and it's like hard for me to find
high-waisted shorts that fit but hmmm
shorts actually run pretty small so
these fit very nicely I just got these
kind of black kind of like washed out
looking shorts they're not like super
dark which I like they're like a great
black they're just sprayed on the bottom
I don't have any black iris in shorts
that are like frayed and like the stress
looking some these are really cute and
they were affordable who I'm talking so
fast okay and then the last thing from
hno I got the
pants and I'm obsessed with these comfy
like harem pants I have a few of them
ever crown me I were all the time and I
saw these ones and the pattern was so
cute so they're basically this really
cool like boho pattern and they're just
like they're really loose felt flowy
comfy pants oops except they get tight
at the bottom um these are great i love
wine these with just like white flowy
tank top so i could even wear it with
like this top is be cute um yeah so
comfortable like I'll probably look
homeless and this is like great airport
pants like if you guys want a pair of
his pants seriously we're them to the
airport you will love your life I went
to urban outfitters didn't really plan
on getting anything but what I got
because i haven't urban outfitters near
me all i got was a gray halter bra that
because i wear these all the time i have
a black water cream 1 a burgundy one so
i got this gray one Urban's on my
favorite almost done guys I swear I went
to lululemon um my friend Gretchen
Gretchen owes beauty has so much one who
loved it and it honestly inspires me to
get some which is sad because I don't
work out half as much as she does but
this show is on sale and it's like my
favorite color it's just this cute tank
top and then the back has a little bit
of lemon side and then some like grayish
black match and like I said this was on
sale so I was like okay maybe I'll work
out okay guys last item if you made
through this video I love you but
basically I went to the nordstrom rack
and union square and my mom and I
normally go to Union Square it's a cute
place I like the Nordstrom Rack so I got
this little vest and basically it's like
my favorite army green color you guys
