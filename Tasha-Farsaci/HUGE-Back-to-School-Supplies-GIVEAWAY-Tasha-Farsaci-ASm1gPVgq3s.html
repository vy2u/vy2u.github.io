that I've been waiting to share with you
so today I'm doing a baptist school
supplies giveaway and I really wanted to
do something to give back to you guys to
give back to all my subscribers and my
followers and I figured since a lot of
my videos recently have been geared
towards school and college I would do a
kind of back at school supplies giveaway
because I know the majority of my
viewers are in school I'm in college but
I know a lot of my viewers you guys are
still in high school or you're in middle
school so I picked out some items that I
used even in high school and in college
so I know these items will be universal
to whatever age you are before I get
into the stuff that I bought for this
giveaway I need to go over the rules all
these rules are going to be listed down
in the description box but I'm gonna
list them off now as well so because
this giveaway is for my subscribers and
followers the first rule is that you
