you I know I do a lot of Paul videos and
I've been having a lot recently but
that's because whole videos are my
favorite videos to film I have a
shopping addiction and I know a lot of
you guys do like hauls so if you don't
like them I'm sorry but I have plenty of
other videos that aren't hauls I think
I'm gonna call this haul a back to
school even though it's a little bit
early but I'm moving into my apartment
at college on August 20th so that's only
like a month away so honestly this is
gonna be my sort of back to school haul
but I don't see you guys don't start
till later but you guys can still get
ideas you know start your back-to-school
shopping early okay so the first place
that I have things from is Lulu's calm
and they were actually nice enough to
give to me all these items they're not
paying me to show them or anything but
they did some news to me which is
awesome because I've shopped on Lulu's
before I love this stuff it's so cute so
yeah I totally would have bought this
stuff for anyway because I have shopped
at Lulu's and I do want to lose all the
time but they did reach out to me so
yeah I just wanted to like let you guys
know that oh and before I forget to say
so I'm gonna try and link every single
item that I have in this haul video in
the description box so you guys can
totally twin with me and go back the
same things so if you guys want to see
these clothing pieces styled more
totally check out my Instagram and feel
free to follow me that would be awesome
okay so the first thing when Lulu's is
actually this little necklace I'm
wearing please don't mind my nails
they're disgusting they were gel and I
picked them off I feel like I always say
that because I always pick off my gel
but anyways I've wanted a little black
choker with a pearl on it for awhile so
I saw this one and I just thought it was
so pretty and like delicate and I think
this is gonna be really cute for the
beach because I always want a necklace
to wear to the beach it's not like you
know metal so I feel like this is gonna
be great okay I'm gonna start off with
shoes from Lulu's so the first pair I
got are by Madden girl and they're these
really cute black sandals except they
have a little bit of a heel which i
think is so cute because I am very sure
a lot of you guys are surprised to hear
that I'm only 5 foot 1 so you know every
little bit of height counts but I just
needed a nicer pair of black sandals and
I really like the little heel detailing
on these so I think these are gonna be
great the next pair of shoes I got are
from Steve Madden and I've been wanting
this for a long time actually so they're
beyond this speec Y heels and they're
just like your classic kind of heel with
a strap here and an ankle strap and
they're in just this really nice nude
color I was planning on rushing a
sorority this year cuz I'm going to USC
this year as a transfer spring admit but
they have rush in the fall so now I
can't rush until my junior year but
hopefully I'll get invited to some like
fraternity invites and stuff so I can
wear these but I think these are just
really a staple and they're gonna be so
great okay moving on to clothing I got
this little pullover kind of sweatshirt
thing it just says Beach addict on it
and I am a beach addict if you know me I
love the beach and I just really like
this that's super soft and just looks
kind of distressed I like it cuz like
the sleeves on the end have like a
little cut in them I don't know I just
really really like this and I think it's
gonna be perfect just to wear when I'm
lounging around the next thing I got
from lullo's is this adorable dress if
you guys know me you know I love tie-dye
like Blue Ridge tie-dye especially
lately it's been one of my favorites
so I saw this dress it's just like a
really loose kind of easy dress to throw
on and just have some tie-dye and I
think it has pockets did I just feel a
pocket oh it does have pockets come on
everyone knows that's the best and
dresses so yeah this is just really cute
and easy and I'm really excited about
this okay next I got more of a fancy
dress Lulu's has great dresses not only
casual but they have really nice kind of
like semi-formal dresses so I got this
one once again I was hoping you know to
wear it to like sorority things but if I
go to invites and stuff like that so
it's just like a navy dress but what I
thought was really cool is it has black
lace and normally I would never come by
a navy and black but it really worked on
this dress which I really liked and it
just looks like this in the front it's
kind of body con
then the back is supercool it just has
like that same black lace and then the
rest of the back is open so I just
thought this was really nice and
insanity very flattering and hopefully I
get a place to wear it I got I know they
were blue dress from Lulu's this one is
more of a kind of a navy color I'd only
know how to explain it but it's just a
nice kind of flowy tank top dress as you
can see it just flows down and then the
back has a nice little open back
thingymajig and it's so soft this is a
great material so this is gonna be great
for layering with flannels and jackets
and stuff so I really love this the last
thing I have in Lulu's I'm so excited
about because it's a maxi skirt that
fits me and since I'm so short a lot of
times they're obviously just way too
long and me and for some reason this one
fits perfectly so it's kind of like a
wrap skirt it looks like a wrap skirt
but it's not actually a wrap I don't
know how to explain it but it looks like
this has a tie on one side which i think
is so cute and then there's a little
slit over here and it just goes down
into a maxi and I love this so much I
can't wait to wear this and I'm just so
happy that it fits me yeah so thank you
again to Lulu's for sending me those
items I love every single thing okay and
then the next and last place that I want
to show you is 2020 ABS which is another
one of my favorite online stores so I
got a few things from them the first
thing is so out of my comfort zone and
normally I'm pretty comfortable trying
trends and wearing different trends but
this one is so out of my comfort zone
but I love it at the same time it's a
bomber jacket and it's kind of crazy
it's reversible but I would only wear
the black side I think so basically it's
this silky bomber and the inside is pink
it's like reversible to pink but I
really liked it because it has this
super cool floral embroidery the arms
are white with black stripes and then
there's some pink down here and then the
back once again is just so cool this is
like what won me over it's all like
floral embroidery and yeah I don't know
if I can pull this off
but I just think it's so beautiful so
hopefully I can figure out how to pull
this off and I'll probably posting a
picture of it on my Instagram if I can
figure it out so totally go follow me if
you want to see how I style this okay
the next thing I got is a green bodysuit
because the one I got from Urban
Outfitters that I showed in a few
hollows back the strap literally snapped
off I wore it once and I went to go to
the bathroom and the strap snapped off
so I returned that and I really loved
this one even more it has a cool kind of
mock lace-up thing going down the entire
front and it's just gonna be so cute
okay I'm the last thing from a 20/20 of
AB as well as the last thing in this
haul video is this belt and I've been
wanting a double buckle belt for so long
and I finally found one that I loved I
like it because the back is stretchy so
it'll fit me I found that a lot of these
like aren't super adjustable and then it
would be too big so I love this one it's
just black with some kind of silvery
detailing I think this is gonna be so
cute with so many different outfits and
I'm literally obsessed with this and
it's super affordable so I totally
recommend it they have like a tan one
that I really like too so we'll see if I
have to get that one yeah so that's
everything that I have in this haul
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did please give it a thumbs up and leave
a comment down below telling you what
your favorite thing was that I hold I
love you guys so much and thanks for
