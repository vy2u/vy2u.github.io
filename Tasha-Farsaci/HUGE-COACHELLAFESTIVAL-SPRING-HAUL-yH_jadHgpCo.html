the description okay so this whole video
is going to be a Coachella slash
festival haul video but I guess I could
just call this like a spring haul video
as well so I haven't officially
announced this but I am going to
Coachella with do't I've talked about
dote so many times this is not sponsored
if you guys know or don't know don't is
a shopping app I actually interned for
them last summer yeah I mean like very
familiar with the company I love them I
love the app yes I am headed to
Coachella with them which is going to be
so so amazing if you guys don't know
what do't is it's basically a shopping
app I'll put like a little screenshot
thingy on the screen but they have tons
of different stores on the app so you
can shop straight from your phone and
check out all in one cart it's super
super awesome they have stores like
revolve free people Urban Outfitters
honestly of all my favorite stores are
on there yeah and who would that being
said everything from this haul video you
can get on the dough app so if you guys
have never used dope before and you want
to if you use the code Tasha a checkout
you get five dollars off and free
shipping which is so great because it's
literally like five dollars 20 or
favorite stores and free shipping which
most stores don't have I honestly don't
know what I'm wearing to Coachella yet
but I am probably going to wear a lot of
these pieces and even if I don't wear
them to Coachella I know I'll be wearing
them a lot anyway so yeah this is just
kind of like a Coachella e slash me
living my life haul okay the first box
of things is from express this is
actually not really Coachella G I know
I'm being a hypocrite here but I guess
some of the stuff you could wear I just
got some stuff from them so I want to
show you okay so the first thing
actually does remind me a lot of
Coachella and I think would be great for
that
this black circular straw bag I've been
seeing these everywhere and Express have
won for it very affordable so it's super
cute I just used this in Mexico as I was
there and I just really really love it I
think it makes every outfit look really
cute in boho ok I need to show you guys
my favorite thing for this express haul
I'm obsessed with these I showed these
in a vlog recently but I just can't get
over them they are these genes from
express their high rise butts the only
jeans I will wear but down the side they
have this red stripe all down the leg as
you guys can see and then the bottom has
like this raw hem and the reason I love
these so much is not only they're super
cute but Express has these in a short
length and I'm only 5 foot 1 so finding
jeans that are cute at the bottom that
fit me like ankle jeans I've exposed to
is almost impossible but these ones fit
perfectly so you guys are short like me
test these out in the short length and
you'll absolutely love them okay next up
from Express is this awesome denim
jacket I love this color so much it's
this light baby pink color and it's kind
of like a cropped jacket would like a
distressed hem on the bottom I've been
loving jackets like this lately I think
they look really cool and casual and
then having one in this light like pink
color it's just super adorable and fun
okay from Express I also got a lot of
like basic items and like basic tops and
body suits because I thought they had
really cute styles so I got this
strapless to body suit in two colors I
got it
one in black just hit myself in the face
and then they also had this like burnt
orange e colored one yeah so they also
have this like terra cotta colored one
which I just thought was really cute and
I've been totally obsessed with body
suits lately I think they look so great
tucked into everything so these were a
staple I also just grabbed this tank top
from Express that looks really really
basic but I like the straight-across
neckline and I thought if I type this
into like a denim skirt or something it
would be really really cute and I don't
have a plain white tank top kind of like
that last one I just got this ribbed
like mauve colored tank straight-across
neckline once again would tuck this into
a skirt or something but really really
cute okay I got two more body suits
there
like the top I'm wearing which is from
421 by the way but they look like this
they are just ramped long-sleeved body
suits and then they have these kind of
like I don't even know what you would
call these like clasps going up the
front and then I also got it in this
olive green color so these are really
cute for like going out okay almost done
I got this pair of camo leggings just
feel like lounging around I think
they're kind of fun so yeah kind of
self-explanatory but I really like these
because they are high-rise which is the
only type of leggings I would wear I
will not wear leggings that are low-rise
the less clothing item I got I really
really like but it's too big on me so
that's kind of sad I got the smallest
size and it's too big on me that's not
me trying to like brag about being small
or anything it's just to let you guys
know if you want this make sure you
either size down or if you are my size
it might not work out for you it's just
this really cute white denim skirt with
a zipper down the front I really really
love this but like I said it's just too
big on me okay the last thing to express
is actually an earring set there's only
two pairs in here right now because I
was wearing the other pair I'll insert a
photo of them here but it's just like a
coop earring set I don't really have any
hoops and the first one the one I was
wearing had like really cute little
charms on them so that's why I wanted
this set but I really like these and I
feel like they're like a little bit
better quality than you would get at
like a forever 21 or something so I
really like these once again and I think
it's a great set okay moving on to these
stuff from the stores that aren't
Express I'm gonna start with shoes
because I have like three years of shoes
in here okay the first ones I'm so in
love with they're from revolve they are
these little black booties from the
brand Seoul sana these I'm definitely
definitely gonna wear to Coachella
because they're close toe and the heel
is not very high so I think I'll be good
walking in these everyone says to not
wear open-toed shoes which I know I
shouldn't so that's why I think these
are great but when you see the other
shoes you might tell me but anyways I
love these once again I'm gonna wear
these not only to Coachella I think
they're awesome I love will
detailing ok the next pair of shoes are
from princess Polly I love these so much
but they are open-toed sandals so I'm
not totally sure if I should wear these
to Coachella but I think they're so cute
they look like this they're just these
like new suede lace-up sandals I'll
insert a photo of what they look like
I'm a model here but I think these are
so cute and awesome for Coachella but I
don't really know if I should be wearing
open-toed shoes
so we'll see if I don't end up wanting
them there I will be wearing them out
and about but yeah princess Polly last
pair of shoes are by Steve Madden and
from Steve Madden on dote I love these
I've already worn them once again
they're open-toed so I'm not sure if
we'll be wearing them to Coachella but
they are these platform espadrille
sandals they have these and a bunch of
colors I opted for the black because I
wear black most often but I just love
these so much they're really really
comfortable because of the flat platform
but they do give me a bit of a height
boost since I am so short so these are
awesome I definitely definitely
recommend these for the spring and
summer time ok moving on to something I
got so many questions about from you
guys I posted it Instagram story of
these two broad laptops and everyone was
freaking out asking me where they're
from and I didn't answer because I knew
I was gonna put them in this haul video
so they are through three people but I
think I got them from revolve and
Shopbop Ando don't also has free peoples
he would get them from there but I just
ended up getting I'm from revolve and
Shopbop so I got them in two colors
because I'm obsessed I think this is the
color I'm going to wear to Coachella
it's like this orange e mauve color
don't really know how to explain it but
I love this because it's not sheer where
the nipple is so you could totally wear
these by themselves and then I had to
get it in another color this is like my
favorite color so I couldn't not get it
I actually wore this the other night in
Mexico but I got it in this burgundy
color what am i doing holding it weird
yeah this burgundy color so kind of
similar to that from your vault I got
this a bodysuit and
it's really cute but unfortunately it is
kind of sheer in the boob area so I wore
pasties with it but this lacy bodysuit
some people might call this lingerie but
I wore this with like a black denim
skirt and a leather jacket and I thought
it looked really cute so I don't know I
think this would work for Coachella
though if you do think it's like too
aggressive for day to day from Urban
Outfitters I grabbed this yellow skirt
I've been loving yellow so much lately
you guys probably know you always like
huge right now but I grabbed this yellow
denim skirt I just thought it was really
really awesome avoid this in an
Instagram photo that I took at a pixie
event I went to but yeah really really
nice don't think of minutes Coachella
but I do really like it and I have been
wearing it otherwise so yeah okay the
rest of the stuff is accessories which
when I think of Coachella
I think of accessories I think that's
where you kind of take your outfit to
the next level okay first are this pair
of sunglasses from Free People I'm so
excited about these and I think you guys
are gonna love them especially because
they're really really affordable I think
there's only like 20 bucks but they are
these cat eye sunglasses they're so
popular right now and I think there is
so fun I love them so much you guys
should definitely check these out I feel
like they have a few colors my gosh the
plastic isn't in my ear yeah I think
they have these in a few colors but I
think these are gonna be all the rage at
Coachella this year these little cat eye
sunglasses so definitely pick these up I
love them okay this next thing is kind
of aggressive but from love culture I
got this like I don't even know this
like chain medallion II dangling belt
thing the back is like this you can just
adjust it but I thought this over like
any skirt or dress on the waist of the
SoCo tell us oh I had to grab this not
cheerfully wearing this anywhere other
than Coachella but going along with the
whole body jewelry thing I got a body
chain from Free People its mini
impossible to show you guys right here
so I'm gonna put a picture of it on the
model I think this is gonna be amazing
I'm poppin and wear this every day of
Coachella because I think it's so
beautiful so really excited about this
this one was a little pricier but I
think if you want like a really nice
bobby chain to wear now and again this
one is awesome the last thing I got is
this earring set from Urban Outfitters
on doubt one of them
missing because I wore them but they're
just these dangly earrings this is what
they look like they're super cute I love
laying and that layering them in my ears
so yeah I'll poly me wearing these to
Coachella yeah so that is everything in
my little Coachella festival spring haul
