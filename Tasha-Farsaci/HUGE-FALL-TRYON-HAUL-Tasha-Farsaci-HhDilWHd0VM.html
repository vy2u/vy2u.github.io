for you and when I say giant I mean
insanely giant so I'm going to try and
not talk that much so I can just go
through everything but basically I've
been accumulating a lot of stop and
waiting for a bunch of stuff to come in
the mail to do a big haul for you guys
because I know you guys like my hauls
and this is gonna be try on so give me a
thumbs up because it takes so long to
film Tryon hauls you guys have no idea
really quickly before I get into the
video if you're not following me on
social media you guys totally should I
post a lot about my personal life and
what I'm doing on a day to day basis so
that'd be so awesome I'm going to put
them on the screen here as well as in
the description okay so like I said I'm
going to try and move to this quickly so
I'm going to get right into the hall now
okay the first place I have things from
is adore me.com you guys may or may not
have heard of them before
I've hauled some stuff from them before
but basically it's like one of those
monthly subscription websites for bras
and underwear and loungewear and I just
introduced an active wear line you guys
don't have to have a monthly
subscription to buy stuff on the website
I bought this not as a monthly
subscription and but it's a lot cheaper
if you do get them off a subscription
and I'm pretty sure you can skip monks
as well I will be linking all this stuff
down below and I'm pretty sure I have an
invite code where you can get money off
of your first step so I'll put that down
below as well okay so the first thing I
got is a broad underwear set I don't
know if you guys think it's weird to
show bras and stuff I don't think it's
weird at all because I like you bras so
this one is so cute it's just this like
dusty rose color bra and then I always
get the thong because I hate underwear
lines and then it just comes with this
really really pretty thong I love my
matching bras and underwear I feel so
good together and I just feel like
really good about myself when I wear it
so adore me makes it so easy and it's so
cute I got one more matching set and
this one is kind of scandalous I'm not
why I always wanted a Red Rocks I think
they're like so sexy what the heck I'm
not sexy I feel weird saying that
anyways so I got this red push-up bra
and this one's like mega push-up so if
you're like if you bitty titty committee
like me literally no boobs then this is
great it's so pretty so it's just red
lace and then this one it didn't have a
thong underwear option so I just got the
underwear that it didn't have the option
for which was just like you know normal
kind
I think it's inside out honestly yeah
okay it looks like this it's so freaking
pretty I love this so much okay and like
I said adore me just came out with
active wear so you can get like a set
and normally I just get stuff from
Lululemon
so I was kind of like okay like I hope
the quality is good on this but it's
actually so good so I got the set with
these gray and black crops
I love crops when I work out and just
all the time and then the topic came
with is so pretty it's this bright blue
tank top it's really flowy and long and
just so soft and comfortable I haven't
worn these to work out in yex I wanted
to show them to you if not all sweaty
but it's really soft
adore me doesn't only have sets they
have other stuff as well so I got this
is super pretty bodysuit I've been
loving body suits lately I don't know if
this is supposed to be like lingerie but
I feel like this would be really cute
from going out with like a miniskirt or
something with this black lacy
bodysuit and then it has some cutouts
and some lace I just think it's so
pretty the back is like this and yeah I
just think this was like a miniskirt
look really really good in the last
thing I'm adore me also I don't know if
this is supposed to be like worn out but
I thought it could be it's this black
slip it's like a cottony material but
what I really liked is that the bottom
has this like eyelash lace stuff going
on so I just thought this would be
really good for layering it's like kinda
sheer but I feel like if you were black
brought underwear or new
it should be fine and it's just it's
really cute and I feel like slip dresses
and stuff like this are really trendy
right now so I thought I would pick this
up yeah so that is it stuff from adore
me at once again I'm going to link
everything down below and I put all the
information about adore me down below as
well I seriously love it I get so much
stuff from them and it's all beautiful
and a great quality okay the next thing
I've been meaning to show you guys for
so long I got this hat from this website
called fair
Brody airy I don't even know how to
pronounce it I'm going to put it on the
screen hit yank down below but basically
they make super cute hats for just
baseball caps that have like stitching
and cool sayings on them that are so
funny right now so I just got this black
one that says not more babe on it I
seriously love this hat I think it's so
sassy and cute and since black and white
matches everything and they have so many
cute hats with so many different sayings
and they have ones with little like like
pictures on them I don't know you guys
have to check them out they're so so
cute and I'm literally obsessed with
this half so yeah totally go check them
out I'm going to link it down below as
well okay next I got a few items from my
website called wildest dreams I love all
this stuff it's so trendy and so cute
and so me and everything I'm wearing
right now that you can see is from there
so I'm going to start with those things
the first thing is this choker necklace
and it's kind of like as you can see
like a lace kind of thing going on I
think it's so cute and unique and
different than just like the plain black
chokers also my nails are disgusting
you're not painted in a really gross and
I feel like you guys have been staring
at that so ignore that but anyways yeah
I got this black choker and then I also
got this shirt I wanted from there it's
just this grey cop top I like it because
it has kind of like a weird sleeve line
but it's unique and I like that and it's
off the shoulder which is super trendy
right now it's so soft and it's so cute
and I really really like it I like the
combo of this so yeah love these pieces
the next thing I got from wildest dreams
is this bodysuit it's a lace-up bodysuit
these you know have been so trendy for a
while and I never had one so it's just
this gray lace up and like I said it's a
bodysuit I like this one
a thong bodysuit and like I said earlier
I hate panty lines you you wants a panty
oh my god you I hate the word panties I
hate the word panty underwear lines my
bad
next thing I got is kind of similar to
the top I'm wearing but it's burgundy
and ribbed and off-the-shoulder
and long sleeves and it's kind of
cropped but not to crop do you feel me
if you guys know me you know burgundy is
my favorite color so I'm so excited to
wear this I think this is so cute it is
so my ally and I am obsessed the next
thing that is kind of summery but I
think it's so adorable it's this kind of
what's this called like not Rouge it's
called something now I don't know it's
like this stretchy material tube top and
then it has these little ties that you
tie like around your arm and I think
this is so cute oh my gosh it's gonna
look so cute with like a denim skirt or
denim shorts or anything I am obsessed
with it the last thing I got from
wildest dreams are these denim shorts
I'm kind of sad because they were tiny
bit big on me
it was just like a small medium large
kind of thing but I think I can make
them work I might try and shrink them a
little in the wash but they were so cute
they remind me a lot of the 1 teaspoon
bandit Schwartz which I do not have but
they look a lot like them and they're
just classic I mean you can never have
too many pairs of nice damn shorts so I
thought I would try these out I probably
said cute so many times this video oh my
gosh
I apologize ok so the rest of the stuff
in this haul video I ordered off of the
F dote this is not sponsored at all I
promise you guys I use dope on my own
I've talked about it once before on a
video but basically it's a shopping app
and it has like all of my favorite
stores on it probably has all of your
favorite stores on it it has you know
Urban Outfitters read Melville Free
People Topshop Zara literally every
single store you could think of is on
this app and you can basically just shop
all these stores in one place in one app
you want to have a bunch of tabs open on
your computer ok I'm pretty sure when
you make your first purchase it's free
shipping and also guys if you use my
invite code Tasha you get five dollars
free to do so I'm basically get
you guys a $5 gift card to any one of
your favorite stores and you can get it
with free shipping so if you guys want
$5 just download o and use the invite
code Topshop and you're gonna have five
three dollars to spend okay like I said
I've kind of been collecting this stuff
for a little bit so if anything is out
of stock that I show you I will link
something similar down below but
anything that's still in stock I will
have linked so the first place I got
stuff from off of do't was Lululemon I'm
obsessed with little lemon I do work out
like every other day or and try to and I
do wear it to work out but I also wear
it just when I'm like hanging around you
know want to look sporty so I got this
extremely overpriced tank top uh yeah I
kind of hate myself for it but I love it
it's just this black cropped muscled
tank and I love oh my gosh I hate that
I'm about to say this okay
I've been looking for like a cropped
workout sure because my only good asset
is my butt oh my god I'm so sorry
anyways the like if I'm working out and
I want my butt to look good into
leggings I mean I want you know whatever
call it looks so good it has like a
little nondescript logo on the back and
the arm holes are low so if you have
like a cute rollout keep sports bra one
where this is so cute so yeah I was
super overpriced but I love this and
they have it in a bunch of colors okay
moving on I also got these leggings
smooth lemon and I think they're sold
out because I tried to get more on Joe
and I couldn't find them again but I
will link them down below like I said
similar ones if I find them so this is
like kind of bright blue kind of really
blue leggings crops whatever I don't
know I think they're just really really
flattering and they're so cute they're
like high-rise and then they have some
cool mesh pockets and stuff on the side
I love these so much and they look
really really great with that top so
yeah I've owned the exact name of these
but they're my favorite the next thing I
got I'm dope I got because I was
watching Kenzie Elizabeth's haul video
hey girl for watching I was watching it
and she bought this top and I was like
I want that so it's like packs on and
it's just this ribbed sweater e
turtleneck top I used to be so opposed
to the turtleneck I used to not be down
my mom would always wear turtlenecks and
I was like mom that's so ugly you need
to stop but now I'm obsessed so it's
just this black turtleneck I liked
except tight so I would wear this with a
skirt like one that I'll show you in a
little bit okay going along with that
turtleneck and also any body suits that
I've been showing I think this her will
be so cute I've been wanting a green
army green miniskirt for a while and I
found this one on ASOS a sauce whatever
it is I'm go and I was like yes so it's
the petite line and I'm five foot one so
this is perfect as sometimes skirts can
be kinda like an awkward length and this
is perfect it's just this green button
up skirt it just barely fits me like I
got what sizes I get I think I got a us0
it's a size four UK or whatever and it
just barely fits me I could have gone a
size up I think but it's really cute I'm
obsessed with this it's going to look so
good with that table or that one lace-up
bodysuit okay next I got some stuff from
Urban Outfitters off of the don't app
and the first thing I got is so basic
and I'm kind of late I'm a little
bandwagon but it's some Calvin Klein
stuff so I always you know I wanted the
sports bra thing but I never got it and
then I saw they came out with this style
it's more of like a little bra let thing
and I thought it was so cute so I just
got the black bra that and then I
figured I might as well treat myself and
get the underwear so I got the black
matching thong really cute I haven't
with a fawn yet but I was actually just
wearing this and I changed out of it for
video but so yeah now I'm a basic bitch
hashtag my Calvin's like whatever okay
the next thing I got from Urban
Outfitters is just going along with that
silky lingerie looking clothing trend
thing going on now it's just this black
lacy cami it has some lace and silky
stuff going on you'll see more weight
looks like on the Tryon but this is on
sale and I just thought it was really
trendy and cute so I picked it up okay
last store from do't it is forever 21
first thing I got is this
for funny story I saw a picture of this
romper on like their homepage or
something like three months ago and I
couldn't find it on the website so I
literally did like the live chat thing
on forever 21 and asked about it and
they were like oh like we don't know
like we don't have it right now like we
don't know and then I just found on the
website like few weeks ago so homegirl
ordered it it's so freaking cute it's
just this burgundy-colored whopper it
has some flowers strategically placed by
the boobies oh my gosh I just said
boobies anyways it goes down into a
romper and has like the same flowers
around the legs I don't know if you can
even see this at all yeah really cute
and then the back dips kind of low I'm
obsessed with this I think it's so
pretty and you can totally make this
more fall appropriate with some like toe
booties and a cardigan or something this
next dress I actually ordered to
potentially wear this invite thingymajig
I went to this frat invite and I ended
up not wearing it and I really like it
it's just a little bit longer me let me
know what you guys think it's gonna be
impossible to show because it looks like
this but you'll see what looks like on
it just has like a cool cutout kind of
tie-up thing in the front like I said
it's just a little bit long so I might
get hemmed let me know what you think
but yeah anyways that's the haul it's so
long I hope you guys made it through
this whole thing leave a comment down
below letting me know what your favorite
thing was that I got or what you guys
have been buying lately I love you guys
