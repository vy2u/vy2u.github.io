a haul video from when I went to New
York City and a lot of you guys
requested this I'm not doing this to
brag or anything um I actually asked you
guys on my last video if you wanted a
haul video from New York because I went
there and actually got a lot I mean all
of you guys said yes like I got tons of
comments so I am doing it right now and
I want to say that I did get a lot of
things I honestly don't need this much
but um I put everything but two things
with our own money and I will let you
guys know what those are once I get to
them but yeah I saved up my money a long
time for this and a lot of these clothes
are fall items so they'll be good for
when I'm going back to school and stuff
and I probably won't have to get that
much when I go back to school some yeah
I just want to do a disclaimer I don't
want you guys to think I'm bragging or
anything this was highly requested and
I'm gonna get right into it so what I
really wanted to start off with in this
video is two bracelets I got from street
vendors but the weirdest thing happened
yesterday so I was gonna film this haul
video yesterday but then I didn't
because of what happened so I got two
bracelets one of them being which of the
things that my mom bought for me um and
so I picked them up to put them in my
whole video and then I do have no idea
where I put them like I have looked
around my whole into your house and I
cannot find them anywhere
it's so weird and sorry I keep that to
my hair it looks really odd anyways um
but I have no idea where they went it's
so weird and like I've made my bed I've
done everything to like try to find them
I look downstairs and I have no idea
where they are but I actually have a
picture that I took with them in it so I
will put that after this and then kind
of voiceover and tell you which ones
they were and how much they are so I'll
put that in right now okay so the two
that I got are the two on the right side
the kind of thick beaded one and the
skull one the skull one was six dollars
and the thick beaded one was 16 my mom
bought me two thick one on the outside
and I really hope I find them because I
love them so yeah but I guess I'm gonna
start off with my biggest purchase
because it's kind of like an accessory
you're not really clothing okay so you
guys might know that I have black combat
boots if you've been watching my videos
for a while because um I did out for the
week like I received a week and I wore
them all the time but they weren't real
leather and I mean they were still like
nice boots but I just they weren't
really great qualities
so I really wanted a nice quality one up
here because I really like them so I got
these ones from Steve Madden um these
are the Troopa style in black leather
and I love them I just love everything
about them I think that is really great
and they're full leathers so they're
really nice and like kind of slouchy
when you put them on these ones are also
shorter than my old ones I'll get my old
ones right now so you can see the
difference so this is my old pair and
these are the new ones as you can see
they're just kind of I don't know but
when I put them on they like slow check
right there and it's again nice it's
kind of like a weird line but these ones
are just really soft and I like how
these ones are shorter than these ones
so I'm not getting rid of these I'm
gonna give these to my friend but yeah
so I got these these were pretty
expensive these were $99 or something I
actually got these from a store in New
York I didn't get them from the Steve
Madden store I got them from a store
called David Z's and they sell like
Jeffrey Campbell Steve Madden like a
bunch of really nice shoe brands and I
think these were like a dollar cheaper
than they weren't like the Steve Madden
store or something but I think they're
definitely worth it for a nice pair of
leather boots okay if you guys have ever
been to Soho which is pretty much my
favorite place to shop in New York you
know that there's tons of stores that
sell like the same exact thing you guys
have probably heard of necessary
clothing a lot and it's just a really
great story but there are so many
stories in Soho on Broadway that sell
the same exact things so um I found a
pair of jeans and necessary clothing
that I really wanted but they didn't
have my size so I found them in another
store as well and this store is called
Amsterdam boutiques I think that's what
the bag looks like and that's the
address if you want to go there yeah so
I got these jeans and they're floral
jeans which I really wanted for a long
time but the pair that I wanted were
from ASOS and they were like fifty
something dollars and that's crazy like
a trend because I know like foil jeans
and like pattern jeans will go out so
these ones are only 25 dollars and they
look like this they're white and then
they have really pretty floral and
they're just skinny jeans and for some
reason these fit me really well like I'm
only five foot one but these are long at
me
me at all and maybe they're supposed to
be like ankle jeans or something but um
yeah my jeans are all way too long by me
I have to cough like every single pair
of jeans that I own but these ones are
perfect so I really like these they're
from the brand sans souci or something
if you're interested in looking them up
but I really like these and once again
they were $25 hey I got one thing from
Urban Outfitters which is kind of
surprising because that's like my
favorite store but I feel like whenever
I want to buy something from there I
never find things that I actually want
to buy but I went in like a ton of Urban
Outfitters and I found this shirt in one
of them and I really liked it it was way
too expensive for what it was I know but
I really really liked it so it's one of
those like muscle style shirts um you
guys will see what I mean
so basically it's like this peach pie
dye and then it has two leopard or
Cheetos or something like mirrored on
either side of it and I just think it's
really really a cool shirt and you can
see like this please go down low so I
wear this with a black band oh and like
high-waisted black shorts and those
boots I think they look so cute
but yeah I got this and this was 34
dollars which I know is crazy but I
loved it so much so I got this okay and
then I went into teaching max and for
some reason I've been seeing Urban
Outfitters things and tiamat which is
crazy but maybe this is Marshalls yeah
okay nevermind it's Marshalls but I've
seen them in TJ Maxx too and these jeans
I saw in the Urban Outfitters and which
is crazy because you know they still
sell them there but I think the reason
why is because they have like a thread
loose on the inside I'll show you but
anyway so what they are is just high
rise black jeans they're kind of like
jeggings though because they really
stretchy but they're by the brand beanie
G which is Urban Outfitters and they're
high-waisted and they're just black
skinny jeans and these in the store are
$58 and I open for $12.99 which is crazy
because they're still in the store and
the only reason they were on sale is
because there's like a thread in here
maybe I can't even find it like honestly
it's so barely anything okay so you can
see there's a thread in there that's
loose like this but I can easily cut
this out
so anyways that was an amazing deal
because I went in the open Outfitters
obviously I went in like three of them
and these were in there for $58 I got
them for $12.99
okay the next place I went was H&amp;amp;M and I
got two things I just got one pair of
black leggings which are kind of a
necessity but um I am really small like
you guys don't believe me sometimes but
I am like five one tiny whatever and
leggings are always really hard to fit
me like I'll find a pair of leggings but
then they like awkwardly bunchy behind
the knee which is just awkward so I got
a pair from H&amp;amp;M and these are an extra
small and they don't bunch behind the
knee so if you're really tiny and you
have that problem go to H 2 MB cuz um
they're leggings are great and they
don't bunch and they were only nine
ninety-five so that's a really great
deal and yeah okay the next thing I got
from H&amp;amp;M was a fall piece once again I
love the color taupe taupe is like I
love it so much it's just like so pretty
so I got this really baggy loose kind of
sweater which I really want to wear with
the black leggings because it covers my
butt and I think it'll look really cute
with the boots that I got too so just
this taupe kind of loose sweater it has
like a V detailing in the front and it's
just really cute and loose and I really
like it when I like cuff the sleeves and
stuff and this was 1795
okay the next place I went is brandy
Melville and you guys have probably
heard about that it's been like
explosive on YouTube lately
I don't know why it's just like all of a
sudden everyone's obsessed with it but
it is a really great store it's like
California kind of style but it's really
it's kind of overpriced for what it is
but I'll show you the stuff I got if you
don't know already brandy melville is
one size fits all which is kind of false
like honestly it's not gonna fit
everyone but most of their stuff is
really oversized
that it does you know so the first thing
I got actually the two items I got are
like the same style but I really like
the style so it's just this really huge
kind of burnout black material and it's
long sleeved and really baggy but it has
like these three buttons in the front
and you can see it's like really
see-through so I'll have to be like a
band or cami under this but um yeah it's
just really big but I like this a lot
and I feel like I could tie a knot in
this
and I like willing up the sleeves of
this as well and actually kind of off
the shoulder because it's like massive
so yeah I really like this and this was
$28 which is too much but whatever okay
the next thing I got from brandy
melville is just like that shirt only
it's more of a sweater material so it's
basically kind of like this oatmeal
color and white striped it has the same
three buttons and I cuffed the sleeves
as you can see and it just goes down I
really like this a lot I really love
kind of loose sweaters for like the fall
in winter time and I just really like
this so this one was $35 which is once
again way too much but I loved it so
much so yeah I got this okay and the
last thing that I got from brandy
melville is also something else that my
mom got for me I have a really hard time
finding like bags and backpacks for
school because I bring my lunch to
school which I know a ton of people
don't but I do because school lunches
disgust anyway you do not know what they
put in there like it's like mystery meat
like every day so I bring my lunch and
then I obviously bring my schoolbooks
and stuff so I never have enough room so
I can't get like those really cute
looking backpacks because I can't fit
anything so I either bring like huge
tote bags that aren't very cute but I
found this backpack at brandy Melville
and my mom has been telling me for a
while that she'll buy me a backpack once
I find one that I like and it's big
enough so I'm really hoping this is
gonna be big enough because I love it so
it looks like this it doesn't look too
big on the camera but it's actually
pretty big so I just got it in this
black floral print and then it has real
leather I'm like a flap here and then
what you do is you like on buck
it yeah
unbutton it and then you like pull this
little drawstring and it's really big on
the inside so yeah you guys can see you
have yeah but I love this and I think
it'll be really great for school because
it's so adorable and it's a backpack so
like I can put it on my back obviously
and now I have to like love something
there on my arm and this was fifty five
dollars which is kind of a lot but if
you think that it has like the real
leather on it it's a really good deal
and this is super cute so I to actually
use this like as a purse as well as like
a spool
so I love this okay if you guys have
been watching my videos for a while now
you probably know that I have like an
obsession with college apparel um you
guys probably know I have like them
Jillian Stanford sweatshirts or t-shirts
and stuff because Stanford's like the
college I want to go to but I just love
like all college apparel and like I know
I either want to go to college in
California or New York City so kind of
acquiring college appeal the college
apparel from those two places so I went
to the NYU bookstore in New York because
first of all they're purple which is
awesome you know and second of all like
NYU it's like a swirl that I might
consider going to so I got two things
from there okay the first thing I got is
just this long-sleeved white t-shirt
that says and why you want it in purple
it's showing up kind of black but I
promise it's purple this is actually
from the kids section and it's like big
so this is like his medium and it's big
so if you kind of small and you like a
girl I'm trying to conception because
the stuff is cheaper and it's like it'll
probably fit you so yeah I just got this
because I love wearing long sleeve
t-shirts and this was 1895 so things
from college stores are pretty expensive
but I love College t-shirts so this was
worth it for me okay next thing I got is
a sweatshirt
they had this in purple and I Wanda in
purple so bad but all they have is
larges and that would not fit me so I
got it in green it's just this gray
sweatshirt that says NYU in purple on
the front and it's just your basic
hooded sweatshirt but I love it and once
again love college stuff so this was a
must for me and this was 4595 okay so
the last place that I got stuff from was
forever 21 and I honestly didn't think
that I was gonna get a lot of stuff from
there just because I have a massive one
where I live but I actually did I went
to like three or four stores so this
isn't all from one store but I'm gonna
get right into it okay so I've been
really into shirts that have like
sayings on them I know that's kind of
weird but I really have been liking that
lately so I got two shirts with sayings
on them
with the same colors which is really
weird but anyways the first one is a
tank top and I know beyond Beauty star I
got this so holla back to her and it
just says wherefore vow on it and that's
a quote from when we are enjoy yeah I
actually love Romeo and Juliet I
actually like Shakespeare a lot which is
so weird I know but like I read it this
year I read Romeo and Juliet and I made
someone's night dreaming school and I
actually really liked them so um I
thought this shirt was pretty cool and
yeah it just doesn't kind of like old
writing and all that stuff so yeah if
you like when we want Julie out let me
know cuz I don't want to be the only
woman who but yeah so this was 1590 okay
the next year I had to get even though
they didn't have my size because it's
seriously like my favorite quote ever
and I got it in a medium but I think
this shirt supposed to be baggy anyways
so it's okay
and whoops okay so basically what it
says is be yourself everyone else is
already taken and then it has little the
little guy that you know said that and
then the top of this shirt has like
holes in it which I really like a lot
and I just love this quote I feel like
everyone tries to be something they're
not and it's just it's so annoying like
honestly just be who you are if people
don't like you for that then honestly
they're not worth your time so I love
this shirt and I think it's a really
cute it also has holes in the bottom
somewhere yeah right there you can kind
of see them but yeah I love this shirt
and it was 1690 okay the next thing I
got is totally ugly kind of in khaki but
I had to get it once I felt it because
it's a stop this thing I'm the planner
you guys probably know about wild fox
quit Tora
you're sure I've never know how to say
that word but um they make like really
cute comfy like things clothing what am
I saying with like designs on them like
graphic designs that's what I'm looking
for but they're extremely expensive
they're like hundreds of dollars for
like swatches and they're extremely soft
so I saw this forever 21 is totally
trying to rip off wild Fox but it's okay
cuz I still wanted it so it's this neon
yellow sweatshirt with a neon pink heart
on it and I didn't get this because I
this is really cute I got it because I
felt it oh my god
all right so I know it feels like wild
fox cuz I felt wild thoughts before but
you guys can probably see that how fuzzy
it is it is crazy like I felt this and I
knew I had to get it even though it's
extremely tacky because it is so soft
and then on the inside it's just like
not as soft but it's still extremely
comfy and it's like stretchy this is
just like the wild fox ones cuz I felt a
wild fox one I already talked the tag
off this but I believe it was like 1780
or something so really good deal in
comparison to the wild fox ones that are
like almost $200 so okay the next thing
I got was kind of boring it's just a
pair of yoga pants leggings from there
they're so expensive these were a 780
and may I check that me pretty well
they're not too long on me so I just got
this great pair of leggings ones and
they're really nice for around the house
they're not the best quality I have
another pair but they're great if you
don't want to spend like 40 on
Victoria's Secret ones which is crazy so
yeah these were 780 I really like for
over 20 ones athletic apparel apparel
and it has like this cute little hook on
the back so yeah I like these the last
two things I got with both sweaters once
again and this one is really really cute
it's like a taupe kind of cut again
thing and the thing I hate about this is
the buttons don't work like they're not
buying this they're just like showy
buttons but anyways it's like really
cute and slouchy kind of like a high-low
thing as you can see I love taupe I
think this would look cute with leggings
as well and the buttons look like this
but seriously like they don't unbutton
it's so stupid
so whatever but I still really like that
and this was 1580 so yeah good stuff
okay and finally I am on my last thing
this I tried on okay I have a story I
guess I'll tell you guys why not so I
was in one forever 21 and they had it
and mediums and large eggs but I wanted
it kind of big anyway so I was like okay
whatever so I tried on the medium and it
fit pretty well it's why I was waiting
in line to buy it and then I looked and
it had like 50 medjool Ian like tears in
it we're not Terry Pacino on the threads
come loose and I was like aw crap so I
went back and all of the ones
they all had them in it so I was like
okay whatever I'm not gonna get it cuz
that's stupid so then I went to another
one they only had larges and the largest
way to being and then I went to another
one and they had a small and I guess
it's supposed to be baggy because it was
still big like the medium was and this
one had no tears and I think it's really
cute so it's just this pink and white
striped sweater but the pink stripes
have like um kind of like glitter in
them it's not obnoxious glitter it's
like really cute because I'm not a
glitter person but yeah you guys
probably can't see that at all but it's
still really cute and I thought this was
really adorable this coats like off the
shoulder I like this and this was
extremely inexpensive this was only
thirteen eighty which is so good for a
sweater comparing to like how much I
spend on brandy melville but yeah so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video before
I and this I want to kind of clear up
where I live I guess a lot of you guys
think I live in New York City but I
don't I wish I did it's like my favorite
place ever but I live in New York State
I live like five six hour drive away
from New York City um I actually took
the train this time but I've like driven
there I've done like everything oh my
gosh it was so bad so had my way back I
was taking the train and the train takes
like six hours because you know you have
like a bunch of stops and we stopped at
Albany right and we were sitting there
for like a long time we didn't know
what's going on and they had to like
connect another train to the back of
ours I don't really know that train was
going to Chicago so a lot of people had
to get back on or something so anyways
we were sitting there for like two hours
and we were just sitting in Albany and
it was awful because my iPod had died by
then and my phone was dying so all I had
is like a book and it was a book that I
have to read for school by like the
beginning of the school year so let's
just say it was not interesting book um
so then the guy got on the loudspeaker
and told us that from the new trend they
had to connect ours the engine blew so
they had to put a whole new engine in it
and we were sitting there for three
hours until we started going and it was
thundering and lightning and we were in
a metal object so it was really scary
and yeah that's what happened to me I
don't suggest taking a train if you're
going to New York but anyways that's my
haul video I hope you guys enjoyed this
let me know
