I am coming to you guys with another
haul video first of all oh my gosh I
apologize if my voice sounds weird if I
look kind of hazy I just got back from
my spring break trip to Cabo Mexico and
naturally I was hot sick afterwards so
that always happens
yes I'm sick now but I still want to
film a video for you guys
so I've accumulated a bunch of clothing
pieces that I want to put together in a
little haul video for you I will be
linking everything in this haul video
down with a scription box so if you want
to check anything out be sure to check
there before I get in to show you guys
the pieces if you aren't following me on
social media please please please follow
me it's seriously such like a personal
outlet for me I don't have a separate
Instagram or Twitter snapchat or
anything for like personal life and
YouTube with all one's so if you guys
want to follow me literally as
personally as you can my Instagram is
furiously Hacha
that's where most active and then my
snapchat and Twitter I'll put here and
everything will also be in the
description box ok so the first summer
happens to UM is Toby I actually ordered
these things or at least two out of the
three for Mexico and they came when I
got back so I already wore one so I
don't think I had to return them I
having tried on all of them so I guess
we'll see the first thing I got was not
from Mexico I really liked it
I'm obsessed with this blush pink color
lately and I just felt this was cool so
it's a sweatshirt dress I love t-shirt
dresses I love sweatshirts
so this sweatshirt is specifically made
to be like a dress and it's super cool
what has like some pre-made holes and
stuff so that's cool and it's just this
light pink color which like I said I
can't talk I've been obsessed with so I
thought this would just like to a DITA
speakers would be like really comfy but
also cute and trendy for class so I
picked up it with it yeah so I picked
this up okay next time Toby I also
bought this for Mexico but it didn't
come in time but I actually want to go
today it's really cute it's like this
periwinkle blue dress with some white
floral things on it
I liked it because the sides Diplo and
then you can like tie the sides you'll
see this better on the try on this is
real like you I probably should have
just returned this because I have so
many dresses but I already wore it so
I'm going to keep it okay and the last
thing I got from Toby I haven't tried to
Sonya I really hoped it's fist I feel
like it's going to be 5050
sometimes things until we fit weird this
white cop top but the reason I really
liked it was the back is all openers to
succeed straps I thought this would be
really cute for going out and whatnot so
yeah I'm going to try this on I hope it
fits because I think this could be a
stable piece I've been loving
straight-across neckline lately so yes
we will see ok the next toy I have
things from is 2020 abs or an awesome
online store they have a lot of Simmons
has a Toby actually I really like them I
always like checking yourself out for
cute trendy and affordable pieces last
three things to show you the first one
ba this amazingly soft thermal pop I
love like waffle net thermal things it's
my weakness and this one is so so cozy
so it's the cream color and then it just
has some buttons up the front and then
artistic a nice flowy long sleeve and
the sides that kind of have like the cut
I think my favorite cut ever and I just
normally wear this all the time I just
play a nice table and it's so amazingly
cozy with a gun brawl at and you know
either some Jean there's some leggings
it's perfect
okay the next thing I got is this little
pair of shorts this came on the top as
well I didn't get the top when I might
have to do that they're so cute it's
just this like sage green colored shorts
and the side has this like little
crocheting and kind of thing going on
these are just so cute to throw on doll
made for the beach but if you're lying
around or even with a few outfit I just
think these are so pretty and I don't
have anything this color okay and lastly
from 2020 AB is probably my favorite
piece from them I wore this in Instagram
photo is what I will insert it here it's
so here just a squirrel top I got so
many compliments when I was wearing it
it's going to be really hard to show you
obviously I'm going to try you'll see at
the Tryon basically just kind of a wrap
top that ties
back at the crop top really really cute
I'm obsessed with it I know I'm going to
get a count of wear out of this I mean
it's the last door in there call video
is she in I hope them them all the time
I think a large box from them that I've
been away to show you guys so I'm going
to hop out into that okay so the first
thing is a hit and miss if you guys
haven't seen my get ready with need for
a college party video I will link it
down below
basically the party theme is Greek like
a Greek goddess Koga kind of thing so I
got this headband for it you would think
if it came broken one of these little
leaf things go off so I just remove it
on and it works five for the party but
that K fell off again so I'm just going
to super glue it on again and it'll be
fine if I want to wear it again but just
keep in mind it's probably not the best
quality but she is really really
affordable so it's not like you're
paying a lot you know um but yeah I
thought this was really really cute for
the party
okay the next big pony she in I have yet
to wear but I feel like everyone has one
of these right now and they're so trendy
that I needed to try it out and she and
has such an affordable option it's just
one of those fluffy leopard print coats
this is going to be kind of difficult
for me to wear in LA because it doesn't
get very cold and this is pretty thick
but I'm sure I can work it into my
wardrobe it's just super cool super
trendy right now go to quality and have
pockets and everything so I really
really like this and I recommend to try
this one out if you want a cheaper
alternative okay the next thing from
Shion I really really like this is a
destroyed gray denim jacket so this is
so affordable on the website I think
it's literally under $20 crazy and it's
just oversized gray sorry I kick up grey
Jen and jacket and it just have these
big holes in it all overall you can
probably see here the holy jacket um
this is just cool also kind of like
grunge up any outfit I will just an
Instagram photo as well I'll put that
here just really cool I got this in a
size small I think everything is
nice move pretty much if not I'll tell
you and it's definitely a very oversized
so yeah I think this is a super cool
piece and it's so affordable that you
can't go wrong
okay this next piece of I dunno I
got this in a size large because I read
the reviews and everyone said it was
super small and I like my bomber jackets
could be you know oversized so not just
one to large I'm definitely glad that I
did this is such a nice quality piece
okay with the bomber jacket it looks
like this super super nice quality guys
oh my gosh the insiders all line and
quilted and in the back has this like
beautiful embroidery on it this is so
nice and soft and like amazing I love
this so much like I said I got it a size
large
totally totally check this bad boy out
okay the next thing the machine is
another bomber jacket this one is so
cool I've been obsessed with the rose
embroidery floral embroidery trend like
literally obsessed so I saw this and I
knew I had to try it out it looks like
this it's a normal black bomber but it
has these rows
embroidered patches on the front super
cooled is awesome to throw out of we're
basic outfit and kind of spice it up I
like shopping on chi in when I'm
searching for like steam party clothes
just because they have a lot of options
and it's all really affordable so I
picked up this skirt I know we're at
some point in time in the future it's
just a silver metallic miniskirt perfect
for like you know space like snow party
anything or if you one wear this on the
daily go for it it's really nice good
quality so zipper in the back I think
the others in gold as well I'm not sure
um yeah I knew I'd be wearing this is
how I figured I would pick this up okay
I wrote above the next piece if they
just a cropped black hoodie but I like
it because he cropped him it's like
rocks not finished so it looks like this
it's like a nice heavy material this is
great you know if you want to look cute
or here's why I put it on over some
leggings and you can still show your
butt off you know because if you have
that that nice but you've been working
on and they're wearing leggings you know
crock
there you go you can still see it so
yeah really cute they have this in a
bunch of colors I'm going to get more
colors because I really like it
ok the next thing I'm missing is just a
black sheer long-sleeved top I've
already learned this before I love it
it's perfect to wear with a black bra
underneath I don't have any boobs at all
so I don't find it to be too scandalous
I know some people think that's too much
but for going out I think it's perfect
really cute really affordable from chien
if it's me how I want it to ward out
nothing grips oh yeah I love this okay
this next feat is very wrinkly I
apologize it's at the bottom of the box
but this looks just like something you
get it free people so life hack protic
for you guys wow it's so wrinkly
basically just this floral tunic top
really cute really flowy really wrinkly
um but I swear it wasn't this wrinkly
when I got it and it looked really cute
so I'm gonna have like steam this and
try on to you guys but this is so cute
it's going to be great for so many
different days and occasions the next
day I flew she in is this denim skirt
it's actually it's court has shorts
underneath don't know I fit me how I
want it to you all the reviews had to
sign up so I did miss a little big this
denim maker I think it's really really
cute away it's a skort yeah I had shorts
built in I think it's really cute just
open sent me how I want it to so I tell
this on Poshmark or something off of my
Poshmark down below but ya know really
cute I might consider getting the
smaller size so we'll see also function
I picked up this t-shirt dress is kind
of a weird material I haven't tried this
one on yet I don't know how it fits it
has time it rips in it the only thing is
that has some rips towards the bottom so
you run the back so I'm not underwear
situation is going to be with this
exactly actually made some reviews I'm
aware will be fine yeah it's a black
t-shirt dress with some some slits in it
so if you do this to just be like a
basic piece to have almost done guys I
swear okay
this dress I can't figure out it looks
kind of cool online it's like a wrap
dress maxi MIDI sort of thing
I'll put a picture of it online here it
looks just to get it online but I can't
really figure out how to wrap it I don't
know if it a cool floral pattern like I
said it's just difficult to get the ties
correct so so can you last like clothing
a piece is this bathing suit it's going
to be really hard to show you guys I'll
put a picture of it on the model here it
looks really cool um it doesn't look
quite as cool on me I don't know okay
last but not least I have a few pairs of
shoes so I got this pair of a cheetah
print so kind of like a fur thing booty
I do you super cool really fun I haven't
worn these yet but their quality seems
awesome on them they look great they
look like they'd be way more expensive
than they were so I think these are
super cool and I'm definitely looking
forward to styling these with an outfit
if you guys watched my previous haul of
she and I showed you guys a pair of
suede over-the-knee boots where the heel
literally came off when I wanted them so
I I wanted to get a new pair and a visor
like probably thinking like oh why don't
you get a pair of the same play it just
ain't broke off once they're really
affordable and I was like I'm not going
to wear these ones you know to places
where the heel would fall off you know
what I mean so I got a different pair I
got ones with a bit more of the heel
instead of like a chunky heel and I
ponies a few times I really like them
you know they're they're nice they're
not the best quality ever so if you want
like a really nice quality pair I
wouldn't recommend these but if you just
want them you know as a trend to wear
here and there I think they're fine so
yeah I think these off I like them
because they're tight on my leg whereas
most suits are kind of like saggy on
their leg these ones actually took my
leg so yeah I really like to use oh my
gosh guys my love is another piece of
clothing I forgot I was in the bottom of
the box it's just a white t-shirt I
don't really like this at all uh-huh it
has holes in it but it's like a really
weird of boxy fit I thought it would be
more like slouchy and like channel and
distress but um it's just like it looks
like you got Hanes t-shirt from Walmart
and like cut slits in it so yeah I'm not
the biggest together this okay cuz the
last thing some Sheehan and last thing
in the
all with a passive budget of black
children so okay my problem is I have a
very small neck very like a very small
neck circumference so tokers even though
the smallest setting all the time are
too big and so root looks so stupid if
they're just like hanging you know and
they're supposed to be tight so I
ordered this path of like five chokers
just like different widths of like black
velvet chokers
hoping that they rip in my neck and
they're too big at all too big oh yeah I
don't really know what I'm going to do
with these pumpkins or friends comment
down below if you gotta Tempest the same
problem or if you know where to get
chokers that are small because literally
that's the problem and I love ranch
ogres I had one that's in my neck and I
sneezed and it broke like what the heck
okay so that was my large haul that you
know I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did please give it a thumbs up and leave
a comment down below telling me what
your favorite thing was that I got is
haul video I love you guys so much thank
you all for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
