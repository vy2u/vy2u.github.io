and I know a lot of you guys get math
and I do a lot of Paul's so if you
wanted those people you don't have to
watch it just please don't like yell at
me or whatever but I'm doing that so the
people that do like halls i know i love
halls and yeah first of all i know i
normally do try on holes but
unfortunately this one is map arabia try
on just because i'm leaving tomorrow
morning at 7am to go to LA and I don't
have time because I still have to pack
to film be trying on everything and a
lot of stuff doesn't really fit actually
which kind of sucks but yeah so I
apologize for this video not being a toy
animal because I know you guys like them
but all my next one's will be and my
previous ones are so yeah I'm sorry
about that ok the first story I'm
starting off with is look book store
these are all online purchases so yes
they look book store i'm gonna try and
link everything from all these stores
down below in case you guys are
interested so definitely check the down
bar if you want you guys probably know
look book store because I hulton them
before but they have really cute like
tumblr inspire clothes so the first
thing I got is this necklace and I know
these kind of like coin necklaces have
been really popular lately and I decided
I get this one it was on sale you know
in case you guys want it but it's really
cute it's just silver it has like the
coins jangling the next thing the look
book store is just a tank top and it
looks like this it's just like a cute
printed tank and what I liked was that
the back has a little cross I always
love when there's just like a little
details on things this next item is very
wrinkly so I apologize but it's just a
romper and I've seen this on a lot of
different websites but they also have a
comic book store so basically it's just
this white and blue kind of print I
don't really know what this is if it's
like a flower or like that I don't
Paisley I don't really know what it is
but it's cute it goes with low in the
front but it has like a button kind of
thing so you can just you know it
doesn't really like show that much
cleavage or whatever and it just cinches
at the waist and goes into Shore to a
little tie I got this white crochet kind
of tank top thing
it looks like this and it goes down like
she at the bottom it has like a lining
right here so you can't see you like
your boobs next one look book store is a
romper I'm not too impressed with it
it's kind of like boring to me it looks
like this it's read it has kind of like
a boho elephant print on it and then it
just goes into regular shorts I mean
it's not bad I just kind of I don't know
I thought I'd be cuter I got one on the
tops that is really popular from brandy
melville that has like that crosses in
the front um it's cute it's kind of a
weird material like not like the
branding material at all but it still is
cute it looks like this you've probably
seen these a million times it's a weird
material though you can you can probably
see it's like I don't really know what
material it is but it still looks really
cute on last pink the look book store
once again it's way too big it doesn't
fit me which is sad because I was really
excited for it and it's really cute so
basically it's a romper and it has I got
halter neck like this one but it's not a
tie it like it just assumes your neck is
this big but this is literally bigger
than my head so that is huge on me but
it's a really really pretty pattern i
love the pattern it's like yellow and
blue flowers and then it goes down into
shorts and it would be really cute if it
fits so i don't know i might try and
sell us on vient it or something but
yeah I was really sad this didn't fit me
because it's so cute okay next I have
some things from she inside I get stuff
from them all the time the first dress I
actually don't have with me because it's
in the wash it but I have a little video
of me trying on this is like the one try
on part but yeah i'm just going to
insert this while i'm talking it's like
you its brightly colored has like a wrap
dress kind of thing so yeah the next
thing from she inside i was so excited
about because i wanted boyfriend jeans
for so long and I could never find any
that fit knee or any that fluttered me
or just any that I liked so I saw this
on she inside I was like why not I like
them let's see if they fit and it's hard
because they're only in small medium
large so skeptical I got a small and
they actually fit me perfectly so if you
were like a size zero and you're short I
recommend these um I don't know about
other side
this but they're really really cute I
wore them in an out for the week a
little bit ago they have lot of rips I
cut them they're high-waisted and they
are really really cute so I'm glad that
I got these because I definitely wanted
to boyfriend jeans and it was really
hard for me to find some that were
really expensive so I definitely like
these next machine side is another
romper and this one doesn't really fit
me too well either like it's kind of the
short to kind of long so it's a sad but
it's basically this like orange ePrint
and I've seen this on like Twitter and
stop oh no it's orangie print halter and
then it goes down and the shorts with a
tie and then the back is like open and
you tie the back as well and it's really
cute but it's a little bit awkward
fitting on me so I don't know lastly the
mushy inside is another dress and I
actually really like this one so it
looks like this is kind of the chiffon
material it has like just some flour we
like bohemian prints you know my
favorites and it's just a really loose
dress it goes down into like this
ruffled bottom it has like ties on it
really cute I wore this with like some
chunky heeled booties and it was really
really cute so I like this and it has
pockets so that just makes it 10 times
better next I have some things from a
website called trunk up and thank God
for this website all right I'm gonna
tell you what happens so I graduated
high school yesterday and I had ordered
this dress off of Poshmark that I wanted
to wear to our graduation I like ordered
it like three weeks before graduation
with red because that's like my school
colors and it also matches to make my
camp that I was decorating and I was so
excited and it just wasn't coming and
wasn't coming and a tracking like never
updated after like shipped and basically
we called the post office and they said
it got lost in the mail so awesome they
lost my graduation dress and by then it
was like two days before graduation so I
couldn't like order anything else I went
to the mall couldn't find anything so I
forgot I had these things coming from
trunk up and the dress came in the mail
and I was like yes perfect I'm gonna
wear this to graduation and I did so I'm
so thankful for this stuff by basically
i'll show you the dress it's this really
really bright coral color it makes you
look super tan has this cute little like
em
kind of style front and then it goes
down it's kind of wrinkly because I wore
it and SAT it but it's like pleated it
goes down strapless really cute love
this I'm so glad I got to wear this to
graduation and yes the other thing from
trunk up is a really really cute top I
want to spook grad party um looks like
this you know a nice boho print I like
how the UM the lining of a collar has
like a different like colored print and
then a really cool part about this top
is the back I know this is a GM the back
is like all crocheted and open and it's
so cute and this top is really flowy so
it's great when you want to eat a lot
because this covers everything literally
I was to a grad party with jeans and I
ate so much and you would never know
because it's so flowy and nice guys it's
so hot in my room and my dad is mowing
the lawn so I couldn't have the windows
open because it'd be so loud and it is a
sauna next is wrong way the first thing
is actually the top I'm wearing it's
really cute it's cropped and I love
cropped halter tops and you guys know
maroon is my favorite color so I saw
they had a merman one had to have it
probably gonna get it in more colors
just because it's like a perfect cropped
halter I love the neckline and it's not
a tie one and it fits my neck perfectly
so yeah I really like this definitely
want to get more colors next from Rome
white is this really cute kind of
crocheted kimono sure thing I don't
really know what you would call it but
it looks like this and it just has the
crocheted sleeves this one is like
shutting a little bit i'm gonna have to
cut that but then the bottom it just
goes long and it has like this cool
crochet thing its sheer it's going to
look nice over like dresses or rompers
maybe second to last item from rom way
is this tank top once again like i said
i love just basic like printed tank tops
to wear with jeans and shorts and stuff
in the summer so this one is are really
pretty kind of floral print it's really
flowy which I like and then it has kind
of like a racerback thing which is also
nice for the summer
and it's really cute the last thing if
I'm wrong way is a dress and it doesn't
totally fit me really well I don't think
my boobs are big enough for it you know
anybody titty community problems but
it's this teal dress and it kind of like
has the envelope crossing thing in the
front but it's a bulges out here on me
so I don't know it's a really pretty
design it has floral and I really like
the bottom because I don't know if you
can tell but it has like a little like
overlay scallop ething okay the last
stop I have to show you is from forever
21 this stuff actually came in the mail
today so I figured I'd throw it in here
the first thing I got with some ploy
shorts and I don't know if I'm gonna
keep these because I put me kind of
weird but they were only like how much
were they 1290 so I like to order them
but I don't know how I feel now um yeah
okay they look like this they're cute
the thing is they're not like a stretchy
waistband so I can't wear them the spot
that I want to I don't know the next
item I want you guys to let me know if
you think I should keep it or return it
so basically it's a jumpsuit and I never
knew how I felt about them but I saw
this one online and I thought it was
beautiful the only thing is I am 51 so
what naturally it's too long on me I'm
gonna have to pay to get hemmed so I
don't know if I want to just return it
or pay to get ahem so tell me if you
guys think it's worth keeping so it
looks like this it looks like something
you get it Urban Outfitters personally
what I think it's very very like boho
head and you know my favorite has like a
cutout in the front which is really cool
as you can see my hand is and then it's
all beaded I'm pretty sure you can see
that yeah see it's all beated in the
front so pretty i love the cutout you
can't really wear a bra with it but um
yeah then the back is awesome as well my
blurry very off the back is austin as
well it's all like open and cross e
cross e what it's like a lace-up back so
yeah there you go goes down in the pants
so yeah let me know if you guys think
this is worth keeping or if I should
just return it the last item is not for
me but I need to show you guys because
I'm so excited about it so basically I
have this one friend who where was like
pattern shirts it's a guy and he has
like an American flag one he had some
big fish all over it so when I was
unfortunately one I saw this with
bugs all over it and you guys know my
pug obsession is real like I love pugs
more than life so I saw this and I was
like okay I can't see this and not buy
it for someone so I was like hey would
you wear this and he said yeah so I
bought it for him and if this is not the
best show you've ever seen in your
entire life then I don't know what kind
of shirts you've seen so there are
literally pugs all over the shirt and
it's amazing and I wish I could wear it
