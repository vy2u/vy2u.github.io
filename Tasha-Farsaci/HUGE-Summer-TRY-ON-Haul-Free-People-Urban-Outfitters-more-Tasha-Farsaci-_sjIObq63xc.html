title I have another haul video for you
anyways I have a bunch of stuff to show
you but be pouring into the video first
of all if you're new to my channel and
you're not so so check that if you're
not subscribed please subscribe and you
just click the button down there
wherever it is I don't really know
please subscribe it would mean the world
to me also if you guys want to see what
these items look like on or style I am
gonna go try on but if you want to see
them style more I post a ton of outfit
photos on my Instagram I'm going to post
one in this outfit actually so if you
guys want to follow me that would be
great I'm also going to link my other
social media networks down below
including Twitter and snapchat and all
those great things okay so the first
storm starting off with is called T and
J designs and I've been really liking
graphic tees lately and I went on this
website and they have the cutest graphic
tees with like the funniest things ever
this one is such a cute saying they're
different materials though this sure is
more of a cotton material but it says
coffee til cocktails and I just thought
it was so cute and this one is just more
of your classic t-shirt style and then
the other one I got from them is this
one and I really love the material of
this one it's more of like a soft kind
of like a brandy melville material I
love this one it says shopping is my
cardio which is so accurate although I
have been working out more lately but it
just says shopping is my cardio and it's
just kind of like more of a low loose
hem so this one and that one are going
to be so cute I think they'd look
awesome with flannels and stuff with my
order they also included this super cute
necklace it's just gold and it has some
hot pink tassels and some little
bejeweled circle sphere things I'm
actually going to be doing a little
giveaway with this so I'm going to put
all the rules down below but if you want
to win this super cute necklace just be
sure to leave a comment on this video
comment anything you want and then go
and follow my social media accounts my
Instagram my Twitter and my snapchat and
you'll be entered
like I said I'm going to put all the
information down below
okay these next two items I ordered off
an app called dote and this is going to
be life-changing guys oh my gosh so my
good friend Gretchen loves beauty told
me about DOE and she was like Tasha you
have to try it it's the best thing ever
so basically goat is an app a shopping
app and they have a ton of different
websites on them so literally every
store you'll probably shop at they have
three people there brandy melville and
forever 21 they ever been Outfitters
they have Nasty Gal they have Nordstrom
so many different stores are on the app
don't I like using it because you only
have to enter your payment information
once and then you can use it across all
the stores before I show you the clothes
I am going to give you one more life
path you guys are going to love me but I
actually have a code if you use the code
Tasha you get a free five dollars to do'
and free shipping so I'm basically
giving you a $5 gift card to a website
where you'd probably buy something
anyway yes so I'm gonna put all the
information about the promo code and
stuff down below so the first thing that
I got from DOE is this top from Urban
Outfitters and Gretchen and I both have
it I got it because I knew she had and I
really liked it it's just this green
grayish color peplum style top it's
really loose and it just has like a
little little peplum on the bottom I
think this is so cute and it goes with
so many different things I love it and
then from Yoda I got this dress from
Free People that I've been wanting it's
just this green really sheer dress but
if you were like little pasty nipple
pads it's perfectly fine and it just
goes down and then in the back it's
really cool and it laces up I'm just
gonna have to adjust these straps I
figured they'd be adjustable but they're
actually not so I'm just gonna have my
mom like resew them or something but
it's such a pretty color and I
absolutely love it
yeah so I'm obsessive dope I think it's
so Andy and like I said if you guys want
free five dollars to one of your
favorite stores totally sign up with my
code and I got you okay in the last
place but I want to show you guys stuff
from is she in
and I've mentioned this before but Shion
is one of those Asian wholesale websites
but I completely trust Shion I love
every single thing I got this time
and yes they did send me these items but
they're not paying me to talk about it
it's not sponsored so yeah I'm going to
show you everything I'm going to give
you my honest opinion about them
okay the first thing I got is this
adorable top and guys this has a free
people tag in it this happened to me in
another one of my holes something I got
from one of these Asian wholesale
websites header free people tag and
someone commented and said that they
probably come from the same factories so
it probably is their Free People item
yeah so I don't know if you guys are
familiar with free people but that looks
exactly like their tag so who knows
anyways it's kind of cropped it has a
nice lace up tie thing and the little
embroidery goes onto the back and I
think this will just be really adorable
with some high-waisted denim shorts the
next thing I got I'm super excited about
I don't want a one-piece bathing suit
and I've always wanted one especially
recently because they gotten really
trendy so I saw this one on chien and I
loved it it's just this leafy green
pattern one-piece it's really scandalous
I have a deep v cut and then the back it
has like a little open back and then it
just ties and I think this is going to
be so cool for pictures this next item
is a very wrinkly but you guys will get
the point it's just this crochet top
dress and then it has some kind of
see-through crochet in the middle and it
flows out into your dress a lot of
sheen's items are very short or small
and I'm a very short person I'm 5 foot 1
I'm pretty petite so this is fine for me
but I think it's just something to keep
in mind if you're taller but this fits
me fine because I am so short T next
item I got is also very wrinkly but this
is actually the same item I have from
show PO if you guys have heard of show
PO it's an Australian website and their
stuffs kind of pricey and this is the
exact same wrapper I have except in red
and I compare them and they're literally
the same so it's just this red floral
print romper has some little flowy
sleeves on v-neck and then it goes down
into shorts with little ruffles could
you not same romper so if you want to
save money try the one from Shion I have
a two-piece set and I haven't really
decided if I think this looks like a
weird sort of belly dancer or if it's
really cute so let me know what you
think so this is what the shorts look
like they're black and they have some
like tribal stitching on the bottom
where these little coins dangling and
then the matching top is like the same
kind of thread on it but yeah it's just
a black tank and then it has the same
like tribal stitching and then of the
little coins so yeah I think this looks
cute but I don't know if I'm the only
one that thinks it's cute so let me know
what you think the next thing I got I'm
really excited about I think it's really
flattering and it's gonna be great for
going out so it's just this black and
white kind of crop top when it's on it's
kind of just normal length or like a
short top on me but it crosses in the
front it kind of goes off the shoulder
and it's just really stretchy and
comfortable and I was thinking this with
some high-waisted black jeans will be
great and yeah it's just really really
adorable okay guys the last thing I got
from Shion I'm slightly embarrassed
about I think it's out of stock now so I
apologize but you know I've really been
enjoying those flamingo floaties you
know the giant floaties that everyone
else pictures on but I oh the pool but I
am going on a little trip to New Jersey
and I'm staying at this condo that's a
pool so I saw that Shion had one of
those giant inflatable flamingo floaties
on their website so what do you guys
think I did I got it and I haven't
opened it yet because I'm trying to like
keep it compact until I use it in New
Jersey but when I do use it be sure to
check out my Instagram because you know
there will be a photo so yeah I'm
actually so excited that I got this all
I can set a photo of what it looks like
on the website but yeah I'm overjoyed to
be a basic bitch
and post a photo of me floating on this
okay so that's my haul video hopefully
it wasn't too long if you made it
through all the way to the end kudos to
