weird background noise in this video my
parents are watching like home videos
for some reason I don't know I think
they're gonna be like sad that I might
be leaving for college soon and they're
watching them and I mean I don't know
about you like this is something weird
for me like I feel like most people like
seeing themselves I was like a baby and
like watch tonight cameras off but me
like really freaks me out way I don't
like seeing myself as a baby like I'm
not a huge baby person to begin with I'm
like I don't know like watching you like
they made me watch some and I was like
yeah like I don't know so I'm trying to
film and not have to listen to that
today I'm coming to you with another
haul and I'm gonna call this a summer
haul even though it's really just a
conglomerate of items people always ask
what my chemistry is foam it's from eBay
just searching tapestry and a bunch will
come up I got this one because it
matches my room and yeah okay getting
her into the hall I'm gonna start off
with little bookstore and basically I
did a haul with them to walls back one
whole back I'm not totally sure but I
really love their website I talked about
them more in my last video but basically
their website is really like Tumblr
inspired and pictures you've seen on
tumblr they like recreate those outfits
and clothes and sell the stuff on their
website so actually cool I'm gonna like
all of these places down below and try
and like all the pieces so you can check
them out okay guys I am not gonna lie
I'm a huge Starbucks person but the
McDonald's caramel iced coffee is
amazing like I like this more than any
iced coffee I do at Starbucks it's
awesome and this is only like a dollar
eighty so it's really inexpensive and if
you like iced coffee I definitely
recommend these so yeah okay the first
thing I got from lookbook story is a
bathing suit and I didn't know how I
felt about the whole halter bikini
bathing suit things so I saw this moment
what story I thought was really cute so
I figured I'd try it out
basically it's a blue and white tie-dye
and this one is like it's halter but
it's not too
like much of one I mean it is but it's
not like your whole stomach or anything
but it's just hide I it um you know goes
it on their neck like a halter and then
it came at the bottoms the bottoms are
kind of small but you know I'll make it
work okay the next thing I got from the
bookstore totally reminds me of Hawaii
and my white trip because it's a very
good wine I think it's a dress that
looks like this it's royal blue but it
has these flowers on it there were my
meal a lot of like plumerias which is
like a Hawaiian flower and as you can
see the sleeves have like that a little
bit of like a bell sleeve that's popular
now and then it just goes down and it's
really fun and pretty I like how it has
this little like opening in the front I
think that's cute and it's just a really
happy dress like how it makes me happy
looking at it next to lookbook story I
got this really cute shirt that
definitely reminds me of tumble acts you
like this same shirt on tumblr there's
like one picture with a girl like a
sweater so basically it's just this
white kind of lace Co shade shirt it
goes off the shoulder as you can see and
then it just has these like little
sleeves and it's like mind in the boob
area but not the stomach so it'll look
really cute with a tan and this is just
gonna be really cute in the summer I
love wearing like Q crop like off the
shoulder tops with like jeans or jean
shorts the summer so this is gonna be
really cute the next thing to look what
stores the only thing that I'm not
totally in love with and that's just
because it's too long on me I'm only 5
foot 1 so dresses tend to be a little
bit awkward on me if I don't know I mean
they're not awkward but I just like my
dresses to be like a substantial amount
above the knee like if they're touching
the knee I feel like I have to wear
heels with bab al-sebaa awkward and this
one like kind of touches the knee for me
yeah I don't know first thing it came
with this we're going to slip because
it's very sheer this slip the seats are
roughest sleeves the straps are so long
like I don't know who's like they expect
will fit and then I spend anyways at
least Akeem with a slip I mean the dress
itself is a really pretty pattern it's
just like this boho floral pattern you
know totally me it has like a black
v-neck like binding thing once again the
sleeves are very flowy the dress flows
down it's really cute
I loved it for the back it has like this
crisscross thing going on but the thing
is it hits me like right at the knee and
this being a dress looks like very loose
that kind of swallows me the last thing
I got from luck bookstore there's a
leather jacket and this one is really
really nice so basically it's just a
black one I have a black jacket but I
don't have one with like the detailing
this one has as you can see it has some
like quilting acceptance lines I don't
know what you would call that but it's
on the sleeves too and it's just your
classic like moto style with like the
you know you know what I'm saying you'll
see more when I try it on but it's a
really nice leather jacket it has some
super cute buckle detailing and I'm
excited to do this next I have some
things from she inside which I've often
them like every month so you guys are
probably pretty familiar with them the
first thing I have is probably my
favorite thing I got from them this
month it's so adorable I am obsessed
with floral pelvic you probably know
that by now but this is a floral dress I
actually featured this in an Instagram
post so if you don't follow me on
Instagram and you
like see my life and I hope it and my
friends and all that stuff it's fiercely
Tasha but anyways I posted a picture of
this dress and it's just this floral
shift dress I really love the floral
pattern on it but the reason that I love
this dress was the back as you can see
it's so cool and caged but it's awesome
I love dresses with cool details and
this one is definitely awesome so I'm
really excited to wear this I got
another one for all romper who I'm mushy
inside you guys know my obsession with
floral wrappers and this one's gonna be
impossible to show you me holding it up
but basically it looks the pattern is
this but it's really cool because it
just has these two huge long like strap
things and you like wrap them around you
if there's like a certain way to do it I
know how to do it so you'll see in the
Tryon but it's so cute it's definitely
very different you have like a whole
open back and the shorts are flowy I'm
really excited to wear it in the summer
I got another floral round for Russia
inside they have awesome floral dresses
and Ralph Burton guys so this one is a
long sleeve and it's kind of undone here
but you guys look at the point so in the
front it kind of like crosses over and
has this little triangle thingy with a
strap that keeps it together which I
like because a lot of times I have to
end up like pinning them I just have
some long sleeves like this the really
cute part is the back it's gonna be kind
of hard to show you but it's like this
crochet kind of material as you can see
and it like buttons so there's like a
long opening I don't know you'll see
once again in the Tryon but it's really
cute it's like a rose pattern and this
will be very cute with black watches
like I'm very excited
the last thing from she inside
unfortunately does not fit me so I'm not
gonna try it on for you but it's also
very cute it's a floral dress too not a
surprise the really cool part is that
the sides are cut out and
the back is just like this and you
should be able to see the straps like
this but I think this would not work for
me because I don't have like a chest
like boobs because these like a little
side straps are way too big they're like
gaping on me so this would be really
cute if you're like Bossier I guess it's
still a really cute dress but it just
does not work on me at all so I might be
selling this I'm a big kid or something
if you want to see my video I will link
it down below but yes it's still a cute
dress nevertheless next I have some
things from romwe and runways a lot like
jeans I first thing I don't know how
much I'm in love with this one probably
because I'm not a huge fan of body con
dresses but this style of dress is
really popular right now it has like the
crocheted top and it's like a V and then
the bottom of this one has like this
floral e like feathery looking pattern
and the bottom is scale up to the front
I don't know how well you can tell but
see how it's scalloped and then I have a
nice gold zipper in the back and this is
really cute it's just I don't know how I
feel that body come dresses like I don't
know it's still a really cute dress but
it's like tiny and I don't know we'll
see how I feel about this one next from
runway I got this really really cute
shirt it's inside out because I worried
already but you might have seen this in
an Instagram picture as well I think I
posted a selfie in it selfie is okay so
looks like this
boho pattern you know like everything
else that I own goes off the shoulder
would like some stretchiness you can
wear it on the shoulder but I like it
off the shoulder
sleeves like this bottom like this very
very cute very comfortable great for the
summer I got this maroon colored tent
top which I really love it's great
quality it's gonna be really nice to
like black skinny jeans and watches I'm
thinking so it looks like this it's just
a nice chiffon tank top I really like
the back because there's a zipper and I
just think this looks really like really
classy I don't know it's nice it'll be
great with a statement necklace
the last thing from romwe and once again
is an issue for me just because of my
size it's it's a little bit like once
again it swallows me it's really cute
though so pretty much it's a black dress
and it has some sleeves with openings
like as you can see it has some crochet
on the bottom of the sleeves the part I
love is on the sides of the dress there
are like little cutouts but they have
lace in them there you go you can kind
of see those are on the sides of the
dress so over here as well and then the
back is really cool my thumb gets on top
it's basically open and then it has a
strap here to keep it up and it's really
cute dress but once again it goes to
that awkward spot on me where I just
feel like it's too long I don't know
it's really cute it's really nice and
just it's a little bit big okay I wasn't
going to show you stuff from Hollister
but I saw it I was like okay why not so
you guys know I work at Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch now I can wear Hollister stuff to
work because they're like Turner stores
so Hollister was having really good sale
Saturday so I ordered some stuff and
once again like I said in my last video
I ever come in Hollister have really
stepped up their game I know what a lot
of people here those stores they think
oh that was me in like seventh grade or
ninth grade but honestly I love this top
it totally goes with like my vibe that I
like to crop I don't know if you guys
like the same stuff as me definitely
check out Abercrombie and Hollister and
I'm not just
because I work there like I genuinely
like the stuff first thing now from
Hollis - I have in another color and I'm
obsessed with it so I got it again and
it's just this white t-shirt I love it
because it's super flowy it's like not
high-low but it I mean I guess it is it
has like the slit here and a nice baggy
pocket I have this in maroon I walk
wearing it with like a lace bra lat it's
so cute and these are so so comfortable
then I'm sure I actually worn an
Instagram post this one's really really
cute it's cropped it has like this I
don't know what pattern is saying is
it's it's a cute I don't know it has
some crochet at the bottom and on the
sleeves and this is so cute with
high-waisted shorts I got this
long-sleeved shirt from Hollister it's
Navy I have my pinkish flowers I love
the sleeves because they flow out and
then they have this lace crochet in the
middle and the front it goes like this
and it's just a really nice like looser
I love my blue shirts with tight jeans
like that's my classic outfit so this is
gonna be really cute and the last thing
from Hollister is actually the reason I
made the purchase it basically looks
like the brandy Melville cardigan that I
own except it's more fitted I mean it's
still loose but I feel like it hasn't
swallowed me or fall off me as much so
it's I'm so right now if you guys wanna
go check it out I literally love it it
is honestly like the same kind of
concept it's an open knit cardigan I was
actually wearing it I'm gonna go so let
me like fix it here as you can see it's
like opening the sleeves of are tighter
which I really like because I played the
branding on the sleeves are this huge
and funky so yeah it has the hood like
the brandy one and then it goes down
very long like the brandy wan but once
again this one I feel like just fits me
sir it's awesome I've already borne this
like three times so that's everything I
have in this haul video once again I'm
gonna try and link all this stuff in the
down bar so if you're interested in any
of these items now be sure to comment
anything down below tell me what your
favorite thing was that I got and I love
you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
