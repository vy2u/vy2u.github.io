haul video and I know lots of you guys
are probably like oh my god another haul
video you are so spoiled you're such a
brat all you care about is showing us
what you bought and I know I'm really
sorry guys I'm a terrible person I'm a
Shopaholic oh but before I start I just
want to say I do have two jobs I always
buy a mainly buy all of the stuff that I
bought with my own money then I've
earned so just putting that on the table
but I actually didn't spend money on
these items because they were sent to me
from the website I just figured I'd put
that out there because I know some
people get a little like annoyed by this
but if you learn my situation and a
company wanted to send you free clothes
you would not say no by the way if the
lighting is weird or if I look kind of
funky or it's not that great it's
nighttime it's like 10 o'clock so my
makeups been on all day this is fake
lighting which is why I'm like a weird
place cuz my room lighting sucks
so yeah so you guys know y'all wondering
what the website is it is called lovely
wholesale and it's a wholesale website
so if you've never shop in a wholesale
website you won't really know what's
different about it basically all the
clothing on wholesale websites it's
extremely extremely inexpensive
obviously you know it's not gonna be the
case cuz you get really cute clothes for
super cheap it's kind of that's kind of
rare so on whole syllabus it-it's most
of the time the more items you buy the
more the shipping costs which can be
scary if you look and your shipping is
like really expensive you're really
scared you decide not to buy anything
but honestly can being completely honest
all this stuff that I got if I had gone
to forever 21
seem items it would have cost a lot more
than a whatever lovely wholesale okay
I'm going to sit over here because I'm
also gonna put clips of me trying stuff
on over in this area so the first item I
got was one of the only items that I'm
not super impressed with and it's a
bubble necklace and I've been wanting a
bubble necklace for a while now they're
not really my style but I think they'd
be cute with certain items so I got a
white one but as you can see it's not
all the same color like these parts are
kind of ivory and then the bottom balls
are white so it's a little bit funky but
I was just kind of hoping you'd be all
one color I also got a bathing suit and
yes I am definitely going to be doing my
bathing suit collection video very soon
probably filming it in the next couple
days so I don't have any boobs you guys
may or may not have noticed by now like
if you're looking I don't know so if
it's a little bit big I mean it was a
small but you know I really have no
boobs at all but it's a really cute kind
of Paisley bathing suit most of their
bathing suits were inspired by Victoria
Secret ones I could tell by the website
so it's this kind of cool it has some
padding inside doesn't do anything for
me because I have nothing there but you
know if you do then congrats and it also
came with bottoms these are very tiny
bottoms very very tiny but they're
really cute because the back has like
fancy my butt hangs out of these a lot
but you know they're huge so I might
just have to deal with it okay next item
is a pair of shorts and I'm not totally
sure how we're going to style these yet
I just saw them on the website and I got
there was so cool that I had to get them
and they're a very popular style right
now I took the envelope shorts so they
look like this they kind of hopefully go
skirt in the front it has like flaps
little flappy things kind of come down
and they're super cute I love the
pattern on these so so much I just had
to get them it's not totally sure it's
more than weird I might need
getting a lung sleep white kind of
chiffon shirt or something but I think
these will be really cool and they're
really cool material as well I got this
really like bohemian kind of white tunic
it's pretty long as you can see and it
just has some navy blue
I think it's navy blue embroidery and
it's really cute I like it a lot
next I got this baby blue cool little
chiffon shirt the sleeves are really
pretty there like an eyelet lace kind of
thing and I just think this would be
really cute I wanted to wear it with the
bubble necklace but I'm you know I'm not
totally fuelling the bubble necklace
right now so oops
yeah we'll see if this goes on me next
thing is one of my favorite items that I
got and I don't know if I should call it
a tunic or a dress it's definitely a
dress on me but if you're much taller
than me which I'm five foot one so a lot
of you probably are it would be more of
a tunic on you it's definitely not
interesting pattern I would never
normally go for it but it's a super like
spandexy like really soft material
dress tunic twitter trust
it just looks like this
and it gets it's like just basically
straight down so it comes with as high
if you want on you know I've sent you
wasted all that shebang but yeah it's a
super cool tribal pattern ok I've been
wanting a blazer for a long time but I
never really wanted to spend a lot of
money on blazer because they're really
not my style I just love and people wear
them I can be look so good and I don't
know I just wanted one I want to try it
out kind of see how I feel so I saw this
one and I really liked it it's just your
basic black cropped blazer the sleeves
are kind of ruined so they're kind of
short and it's just nice and fitted and
it's just like a really cute I don't
know book blazer and I'm definitely
gonna try brand guys and don't really
know what to wear with it this once
again it's not my style at all but I
just really want to try it out and look
more like businessing I guess so yeah
we'll see how this works
hearing ideas of how to wear this let me
know because I really want to I'm just
not really sure how ok this next item is
probably my favorite not gonna lie I'm a
little obsessed I live in a cold Park
near st. and it gets very very cold the
winter so big sweaters are a necessity
so I saw this sweater and I love
sweaters to begin with it's um
it's basically it's like a tan sweater
with a hood hoods make everything cuter
it's super big and chunky and goes down
really high low and this is great
because you can wear this with leggings
and
it's an excursion ambassador oh my god I
know I'm so obsessed with the sweater
and it's like not expensive at all so
hop on a speaking fee twins and I think
this might come in another color so if
you don't want to totally come with me
you can have fun with me
get this okay my father's slight
disappointment of the order only because
it doesn't fit not because you know I
don't like it but I've been wanting our
bread dress for a while it was kind of
like a casual one
I don't think red is my best color but I
wish it was because it's like so it's so
fierce like my name like red is a fierce
color
I'm through see Tasha anyways I wanted a
red dress so when I saw one I that I
liked I decided I would get it but it's
to me which is really unfortunate so
it's really cute dress it's just bright
it's kind of showing up pink because my
beard lighting but it's a bright red
it's kind of a tank top dress thing the
back is really really pretty it's like
fast can't really tell but it's a double
strap it's just a really pretty dress I
just wish it wasn't too big okay
and the last item is something that's
just amazing and because of how
inexpensive they could sell it for it's
a huge parka and like I said New York
State it is cold it's like it's very
chilly in the winter and I'm like I'm
the type of person who likes to look
cute all the time majority of the time
so in the winter I don't want a real
like lb jackets all the time so I'll
freeze to death and like my little army
jackets or whatever so when I saw this
baby on the website
I was so excited basically it's this
huge green car cup and you will see it
better once I put it on here but it is
all lined with like fake sheepskin or
whatever and it's all puffy all
throughout and it's army lead and
a really cute faux fur hood and it's got
some like red lining with pockets and
it's just amazing it's an amazing jacket
and I don't understand how it's so
expensive on the website like they had
one similar to this American Eagle for
like a hundred and fifty dollars asleep
oh pretty sure this one there's only
like 25 30 it's amazing so those are the
items I got from lovely wholesale and
once again them sending me this stuff is
not influencing my opinion at all I just
want to thank them once again for being
so generous inside you feel this stuff
and just tubing it so quickly that I
wanted to put my video out quickly I'm
gonna try and link all the items I got
down below so if you want the twin with
me which please twin with me I'm an only
child I need twins

other links down below like my Instagram
