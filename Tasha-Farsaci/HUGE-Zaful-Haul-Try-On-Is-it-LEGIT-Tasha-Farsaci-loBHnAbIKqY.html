today I am doing another example haul
video I haven't done one of these in
quite a while and I actually haven't
posted a video or a haul video in a
while for me I know some of you guys
don't like the Apple hauls because they
do send me these items this video is
sponsored by example but I swear if I
were a lot of this stuff I've already
posted a lot of my Instagram and I am
totally 100% honest and divided with the
stuff that they send me because I know
some people are skeptical of this
website because everything is so
affordable but I have seriously been
getting requests from you guys asking me
to do more Zappa halls and I know live I
do like them so if you know there will
be another haul coming with it's not
Apple but I figured I haven't done one
of these in a while and I got some new
pieces and some suits and some clothing
so yeah I didn't want to show you guys
once the energy don't like that well I
apologize I am being totally honest
because I know sometimes when you're
ordering some websites like this you're
like oh my gosh is this legit or is this
going to end up looking like shit so
okay that rhyme one more thing before I
get into the video if you guys want to
see how I style these pieces or if you
just want to keep up with me on a more
personal basis totally follow my
Instagram I post on there almost every
day and yeah I'll put up with clean up
my other handle like Twitter and
snapchat in the description and yes I am
wearing colored contacts in this video
these are the new ones that I got their
nose política hi decor Corso so I'll
try to link those down below I like
wearing contacts in videos and pictures
and stuff I just think it's fun so if I
looked at prints that's why okay I'm
going to start off with swimming through
some baffle because that's pretty much
what they're known for and I know that's
what a lot of people want from there
so this first swimsuit I actually got in
a variety of colors because I have it in
this orange yellow color and Septimus
and so I had to pick it up in a bunch of
other colors the only thing is that I
feel like these tops are a little bit
bigger than my other one I have really
small boobs so the other one I have the
orange yellow one is really tight so it
pushes my boobs and makes the
like there there and I found that these
ones I'm going to tie it so they don't
do that as much but I still do really
like the suit
so first of all I got is this berry
color it has the keys to a double straps
the only thing is that they aren't
adjustable and then once again it goes
around sore back and same thing it's not
really adjustable it just has been one
class and then the bottom I really like
for tanning I do prefer cheeky bottoms
and these are pretty cheeky it or not
the cheekiest of all cheeky but yeah
these are really really great for
tanning and I love this color
oh yeah and everything will be linked
down below so if you guys wanna check
these out totally go down there okay so
I also got that swimsuit in this light
baby pink color the only thing is that
since this is a lighter color you can
kind of see the padding to it so that
bothers you you can just take the
padding out but yeah you'll see I got a
ton of suits in this light baby pink
color I think it's so pretty and cute
with a pan so here's the top and then
the same style of bottoms and then I
also got that suit in red I love red
bathing suits I think everyone needs a
red bikini so this one is definitely a
good option so cute it's so flattering
and then it has the same bottoms oh and
for reference I got everything in a size
small and I am usually a size zero on
bottom size small extra small on top and
I'm five foot one okay the next thing
that's got the next suit I got I've had
my eye on it for a while it's this
really cool kind of textured textured I
can see little scoop neck top it's just
really pretty at patterning blue color
and then the bottoms look like so these
are cheeky once again I like cheeky
bottoms so that's the one but I picked
out but this quality seems really nice
the straps are adjustable so I like this
and then I liked it so much I have to
get it in baby pink obviously so these
are padded I just think it's cool the
textured detail different than anything
I have and then the bottom okay the next
bikini is the same color as the other
one haha so it's also a textured kind of
material and then as
little high in front I think this one is
so adorable and then the bottom looks
like some I figured I might as well show
you all the little pink ones I have one
here so this one is so nice it's just
too big on need so it looks like this
and I thought that when I looked at it
online I saw that these would be two
ties it would be adjustable and you can
tie it however you want but this is
actually its own little separate piece
that you just tie on the middle so this
actually isn't adjustable so that's kind
of a bummer because it's really cute but
if you do have bigger boobs than me this
will probably work on you just keep in
mind it doesn't like the just in the
front and then the bottom for these ones
look like this they're a little bit more
full coverage but still cheeky so this
one it seems like really nice quality
it's just a little big
okay these last three suits I actually
didn't pick out the lovely people as
dapple pick them out for me so yeah I
wouldn't necessarily think these ones
out but I still wanted to show you this
one I actually really like it's just a
simple gray triangle top looks like this
and then the bottoms are saying with all
those other bottoms I was showing you
these ones I think are a bit more high
cut and they look pretty tiny so we'll
see how these fit
see you next bathing suit I actually
think I ordered this one before so I
might have so this is all before but it
looks like this it's a velvet bikini and
then it has like nude lining on the
bottom and yeah yeah the bottom looked
like so and then the last bikini from
this Apple this one I don't like it I
didn't pick it out and it also seems
really thin and not the best material to
me it says little like off the shoulder
top which I call it wouldn't really wear
anyways because give me weird tan lines
and also this material is just so thin
and see-through and the bottom you would
literally be able to see everything like
you can probably see me through these
bottoms there soaping so I do not
recommend this suit but then again I did
not pick it up
so yeah okay so example has clothing as
well you guys probably know that and if
you like a lot of things that I picked
out from them so I'm going to show you
the clothing pieces now okay I thought
I'd show you my favorite piece first I
worn it on my Instagram and everyone was
freaking out about it
so it's this two piece set which are my
favorite the table pick bit it's just a
little tiny tube top and the pants are
what are super cool because they are
pants what the front has like these
slips so they kind of open and show your
leg and they're really cool and almost
with your skirt it almost looks like a
skirt when you're wearing it and
obviously this one's the best quality
ever but it is super affordable and I
think this is more like a statement if
you come I won't be wearing this every
day and I like that you can wear them
separately so I really love this the
next night I also wore in Instagram and
in a video and you guys are all asking
me pretty wrinkly right now but it's
this yellow top and the cool part is
that it just has these little knees on
the sides so you just tie them in the
back and they fit a cute little bow and
you can kind of make the table as tight
or loose if you want it so I really like
this and I've been loving yellow lately
it just looks so cute and happy I got
another set from Apple and I would
totally love this except the top is a
bit too big so the top looks like this
and it's supposed to the office shoulder
it's super cute but this part is too
wide for my shoulders so it Livia's
falls straight down and I know I have to
put this on my shoulders but it just
doesn't look as cute that way so yeah
unfortunately this is a little bit big
on these but the skirt is really cute
and it does fit it's basically just this
wrap skirt so it looks like this piece
of fabric also looks really short but it
works for me and then I just have these
strings so you wrap it around like I
said the skirt is really cute but this
is a bit too big another one my
favorites from the Apple kind of reminds
me of that yellow tank top but it's a
dress and it strikes now reminds me of
the tank top because it has the same
little guys you tie in the back so the
back is open and then you tie them so I
really think this is cute I've been
himself some stripes lately I have this
top and a few colors and baffle and I
really like
so I wanted to get it in this color
which probably know how I feel about it
kind of like a seafoam II green color I
just never wear this color but I think
it is really pretty and I think if I
wear it was the right outfit it could be
cute okay I got this Dunham skirt from
example and I'm not gonna lie your eyes
the quality is not good at all I know
this is a dupe for use our skirt it
looks like this it looks really really
cute but if you get up close the threads
are just not go the stitching is not
good and this is such a thin denim
material I don't even know if it's real
denim I think this will be cute for
pictures just because you color will be
able to tell that it's not the best
quality but you probably will not get
more than a few ways out of this okay
and the last few clothing pieces we're
also picked by Apple but I do like them
I think they're really cute so I want to
show you the first top is similar to
that green one except it's red and white
stripes I think this is so cute I would
actually pick this for myself teletag on
it so bravely Michelle like brandy
melville so I guess this is a brandy
dupe oh yeah this one's real like you I
would definitely wear this next up they
picked this little white top which is
also cute it just looks a little bit
see-through so I think this will be worn
maybe on the beach or really a bathing
suit and then the last show bickered for
me is really cute as well it's this
mustard a yellow floral shirt and then
it has these two little ties in the
front with you kind of tying a bow
so yeah this will also be really cute
with some jeans or whatnot maybe a dumb
skirt so that one is everything I got
prints Apple as you can see I did like
most of the pieces but just know it's
not going to be amazing spectacular
quality it's going to be what you're
paying for for the most part so yeah
just keep in mind yes I love you guys so
so much
