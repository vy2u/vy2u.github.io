wearing my North Face in this video I
was just like wicked cold and I didn't
want to like change out of it and
there's gonna be some notable things
that are different about me and I'm
probably talking like a lisp because of
one of them and the first thing is
obviously I got a haircut it's natural
but it's not as curly as it normally
would be because like it was dryer
before I started like doing something
with it so yeah basically I got a
haircut
and it's short definitely shorter than
I'm used to it was down to like here
before so I got like 5 inches off I just
like it's not that I didn't like my hair
it's just like it was getting a little
it was really dead in nasty and like I
just wanted to change so my hair grows
really fast it'll probably be like as
long as it was soon enough yeah so I got
a haircut I'll talk more about that in a
minute and second thing is I got braces
and this is actually why I haven't been
making videos in like a week I've been
having some problems with them and like
I can't talk in my mouth so it's like
crazy so uh yeah I look really bad like
it's really embarrassing like oh um so
I'll kind of tell you like the problems
I've been having with these things
because like I know a lot of people
probably like had braces or whatever
yeah so yeah about my braces okay so I
got them put on on Wednesday yeah and
today is Saturday at least when I'm like
filming this yeah I got them put on
Wednesday and like it was fine they
didn't hurt that bad but the thing was
is my top two teeth right here
we're hitting these brackets so I would
have like knocked the brackets off so I
had to go back on Thursday and they put
these things in my mouth
those two big white things are not my
teeth guys they're like these beards
like cement things they put in and I got
to call like spacers and pretty much
stop my bite so like I'm not hitting
like the brackets but what they did
wrong it's like the one on this side
it's like cooking on the top it's not
straight across it's a crooked so my
whole tooth like you cannot fit on it
right and so when I break down my whole
like top jaw is like shifted one way and
this is shifting the other way so it's
like my teeth aren't aligned like if you
look my two front teeth are not aligned
with my two bottom teeth like in the
middle take a look see how like it
should be like that but it's like that
so like I don't know if I should go back
I don't want to be like annoying you
know but it's not it's messed up I know
my jaw be like that like I don't know
but these things you wear them down so I
just want to like wear them down and
like give it over with
yeah and they hurt really bad guys like
I don't know they still hurt and like
I'm so uncomfortable and I like can't
talk straight and it's just really
really embarrassing because I look
really bad yeah so anyways um yeah okay
so I went and got my haircut and they
gave or they didn't give it to me I
bought like this stuff for my hair and
like I'll tell you guys how it works
since I have curly hair like this
doesn't look that curly because it's
really not that curly today um once
again cuz it was like dryer before I
actually started like you know just gun
came with it and stuff but she told me
this stuff looked really good it's like
I don't know how to pronounce the brand
it looks like this it's oh you I da D so
oh he dad or whatever and um this is
like climate control heat and humidity
gel she said this stuff works really
good so I don't have any frizz in my
hair at all right now
like it I know it doesn't look that
great but like there's no Frizzle and I
think it's because she used this stuff
and then this was like about 20 dollars
I think
and then we were gonna buy the other
stuff too but they had only gotten they
only had them left in like little
packets like samples whether other than
make the actual bottles so she we bought
the bottle and then they're gonna give
it to us afterwards and they just gave
us samples right now but this is the we
dad or whatever um
styling gel and I guess it's um supposed
to like reduce prison as well and stuff
and no I'm not sponsored like I bought
we bought this stuff so um yeah so yeah
I'll like start using this and I'll tell
you guys how it works it is kind of
expensive since it's like a salon brand
or whatever but yeah oh my gosh my teeth
hurt so bad and I can't bite and like
seriously I wasn't Dunkin Donuts this
morning and I get strawberry frosted
donuts and usually I like eat them like
like a minute flat and like I was
sitting there for like 15 minutes
and I still wasn't done with my doughnut
because I had to like wrap it in pieces
and it was so embarrassing because like
people like staring at me like what is
she doing oh it was just embarrassing
and like awkward and whatever so yeah um
so you know how I made that video a
while ago like wanting to like dye my
hair well my mom doesn't want me to so I
don't know if I'm probably just gonna
like I'm probably like he has like that
son and stuff and you spray it in your
hair and then going assignment like
lightens it so I probably do that like
over this summer or something but she
doesn't want me like she won't let me
get highlights unless I like pay for
them myself and I don't want to spend
like $90 I'm like highlights cuz I don't
need them you know like I don't really
mind my hair it's just like I'd rather
it be like a little lighter or something
I see yeah and that was so why I just
got like a trim and that I like trim my
bangs but like they're still long
because I don't like when they're show
up since my hair is curly like your
bangs don't look good like curly so um
yeah
so yeah that's that's that's that um one
of my friends actually said she'd make a
video with me so if you guys want to
know like what kind of video should we
do like having one in the mall to like
maybe we'll do a haul but like if we
can't what would you want to see like
would you want it to like a KAG Oh Wally
I don't know what we'd talk about so
yeah we might do that I know I'm doing a
skincare routine video coming up because
I've actually gotten sent some like
skincare products and he wanted me to
talk about them in a video so I'm gonna
like incorporate them into my skincare
video cuz I know like reviews are boring
you know um so I definitely am gonna do
a skincare video plus you guys wanted to
see that some you did um since I don't
really like any foundation to anything
and you guys think my skin's okay
so um yeah so pretty much I'm sorry I
made a video but like I couldn't talk
and I'd be talking with like a lisp with
my mouth would be all that stuff and it
still kind of is now but it's not you
know like as bad as it was and yeah I
think my teeth are already getting
straighter and but look at it's all
messed up so like tell me if you had
this problem like if your teeth out
aligned like they aren't like um tell me
feel like fixed it we're like what you
did what do you think I should do and
everything cuz I don't know I don't want
to be annoying but I don't want it to
like messed up forever um yeah so yeah
hope you guys didn't forget about me

love you guys and yeah so um I'm back I
didn't leave you guys I just happened to
get metal in my mouth and my head
