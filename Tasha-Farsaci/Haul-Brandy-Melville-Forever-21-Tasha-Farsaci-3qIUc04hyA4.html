haul video for you I recently ordered
some stuff from forever 21 and brandy
melville and i decided i would show you
guys because why not haul videos I'm my
favorite and I figured that some of you
guys might want to see it if i seemed
totally out of it in this video it's
because it's 6am i'm filming this before
school because i really don't have any
time after school so yeah I'm kind of
dead right now but I'm trying seem
energetic because yeah you know I'm
pretty sure forever 21 to have like a
thirty percent off sale or something
going on I ordered because I wanted this
one sweater but I wanted free shipping
so I spent fifty dollars um but I'm
pretty sure it was like twenty percent
off a thirty percent off everything or
something like that so it was cheaper
than you know the prices I have ok so
the first thing that I got from forever
21 is the reason why I made the purchase
it's like this huge sweater it's gonna
be really hard to show but I'm going to
try and like add a second frame in this
video where I show you me trying stuff
on but it's a huge poncho like sweater
thing and it has like a I don't know
just kind of like a cuffed neckline
thing I don't even know if it's a
neckline um but the sleeves are really
cute because they have this crocheted at
the end and then the bottom is all like
fringy like this and it has some pockets
here so it's just really cute and I
don't know I think it lays nicely um
yeah I don't know so I got this next
thing i got was a pajama set and i
really got it for the shirt because it
reminds me of like a wild fox saying
wild hogs has some shirts that say like
sayings about the beach i think it says
like big waves salty air or hairs and
like I don't know but it's really cute
and I seem like celebrities wear it but
it's like a hundred dollars and that's
just not going to happen so I saw this
shirt at for everyone what's it say it
says palm trees once and salty
air and ocean breeze and I think the
font is super cute and then the bottoms
that it came with are just little blue
bottoms and they have like shells and
stuff on them okay and then by now I
really didn't have anything that I
wanted to get from for everyone but I
would needed to spend fifty dollars so i
just got these coral pink running shorts
and these are really sheer I don't know
if you'll be able Tala but they're like
pretty sure I haven't worn them yet so I
mean maybe they won't be a sheer on but
they are I just love the color and I
think the with make me look really tan
not anymore because I'm like pasty now
but once I start getting tan again in
like a year okay next place bus brandy
melville I ordered online because i
don't have one near me i think i got was
a little bro let and I got this to wear
under a tank top that I have because um
I got it forever ago and I actually got
it from the store and I'll be wearing it
in this little frame but basically I
wanted the brawl that on to it that was
on the mannequin and they didn't have it
so I've had this tank top and it's so
low that like I really couldn't wear it
without much so I wanted this brawl wet
and I finally ordered it so it looks
like this and it just has a little bit
of a floral pattern and it looks like
barely anything like there's like
nothing in the back but it has a really
cute floral pattern I realized that I
have like no basic tops and I really did
not have a cute plain black top like I
just had some awkward ones not ones that
I would wear so I saw this one and I
thought it was cute and it's just like a
black v-neck kind of thing but it's
loose and I like the shape of it I just
like how soft it is it's that really
soft for an email bill material so I try
to stay away from the really popular
brand email bill
like the logo shirt just because
everyone has them but I really wanted
this one and I really like the logo and
I liked how it was just black and white
so I could wear it with a lot of stuff
and it's the too sassy for you one and I
just really like this one I think it's
really cute I've been told I'm sacia so
yeah this was like eighteen and nineteen
dollars once again super soft I have
this shirt in another design and I
really like it and I wear all the time
because it's really cute and these are
cropped but they're not to crop so if
you wear them with high-waisted shorts
you won't see skin where were some
shirts you were my high waisted shorts
and you still see a ton of skin and this
is good for school I think next thing i
got was a kimono these are pretty
popular right now I have one more of
them and I really liked it so I like
this one a lot this is going to be a
super hard to just look at like this but
pretty much just looks like this it's
like the Sun flower print and I don't
know you can't really tell what this
looks like at all but yeah you know
sunflower kimono okay the last thing I
got I'm really excited about because
Phylly cute it's that super popular
dress what's it called I'm so tired that
I am completely out of it is like the
Jado dress I don't even know this
embarrassing oh wait it's right here yes
yes it is the J dobrze dress so I got it
in this floral pattern I saw this like I
don't know if it was this exact pattern
that was there when I was in New York
then I didn't get it and I saw some girl
wearing one like it would looked really
cute and I was like crap i should have
gotten it so i ordered it and i really
like this Pettitte a lot it's one of my
favorites it's just like a kind of clean
floral living thing yeah it's just you
know the dress with all the layers and
I'm really short so this is not short on
me um I mean obviously a short dress but
it's not like you wouldn't look at that
mean really bad really short um and then
the back you know hag was really low
with the little string
so that's all the stuff I got I know
this wasn't too large but um yeah I
figured I'd show you guys I was excited
about it maybe you guys would get
excited maybe you guys put a lot of
orders and stuff sorry I'm so exhausted
I'm probably a lump in this video
anyways once again that was my home if
you guys fill mahal video you have
recently you know leave it in the video
responses or you can tell me in the
downbar in the comments I mean what
stuff you have gotten you can tell me
