for you it's from brandy melville and
forever 21 and I got some really cute
stuff that i want to show you I ordered
some stuff from brandy that just came in
today and I have two trips from forever
21 that i want to show you as well okay
starting off with the forever 21 items
the only accessory i got were these
earrings and you guys my note that i
really love obnoxious earrings if belong
to the better I always like these ones
like every day and guess what these were
a dollar for some from some like weird
dollar store in my mall but I really
like long earrings I prefer long dangly
ones to hoops so when I saw these you
guys can't see the line there so long
and I just knew I had to get them
they're basically really long silver
earrings with little just little arrows
at the bottom and they were only 380
okay so lately I've been going to the
gym and working out more not because I'm
trying to lose weight or anything just
because I don't know what I need to get
a little more toned and I like going and
go with my dad so it's fun and I wanted
to get some cute workout clothes nothing
I don't have any I just I just wanted
some okay a lot of people love shopping
a little lemon and I've personally never
been in one but I have seen things from
there and honestly forever 21 is really
stepping up their quality and a lot of
the things they have in their kind of
resemble the things from Lululemon so if
you are into totally spending like sixty
dollars on a sports bra definitely try
at forever 21 because I found this
really cute one it's pink it kind of has
a texture looking kind of thing to it I
don't know if you can tell but I bought
it for the back because as you can see
the back is super cool and it crosses
like this and then they have their
little logo right there and this looks
really similar to one of the lululemon
ones except this one was only thirteen
eighty and I think it's really cute so I
got this and then I just got some
matching bottoms to them they're just
like cropped capri workout pants they
look like this they have the also have a
little heart thing and these were only
seventeen eighty so I thought that was
really good I'm not exact
the type of person that would just for a
sports part of a gym so I also ordered a
top from ebay that just has a really low
back so you'll be able to see the bag of
sports bra that's all went that below in
case you guys are interested okay so
that was my first trip I was into the
workout stuff and then my second trip to
forever 21 I got this little denim fine
off shirt that doesn't have sleeves it's
not like a vest I don't think because
you bought it but i really love denim
shirts i wear them all the time and I
just thought this one was really cute
and it would be cute to put over dresses
and even the dress that I got that'll
show you in a minute but I just really
liked it I liked the color of it and
everything about it and this was
nineteen eighty okay the next dress I
got I got it because all like a bunch of
YouTube gurus got it together I saw in
their vlogs like you baby 44 and all of
them like all about this dress and I
thought it was really cute and so I like
madly searched for it and my forever 21
and I found it it's a maxi dress so it's
a little bit long on me at my mom's
probably gonna have to like putting the
straps up a little bit but it's so cute
and it looks like this it's basically
white but it has a lot of like intricate
kind of details to it so I'll pull it
forward it starts out like this with
like a lace kind of thing and then it
goes down into this like sheer almost
like tool material only it's dotted and
then it has a layer like this and then
its sheer after that and then it goes
all the way down to the end this was a
really affordable price it was um 2480
okay now moving on to the brandy
melville stuff I got a lot of your
typical items that I have never gotten
from brandy only two of them and really
count as typical but I will start off
with one of them so it's this little
black bandeau top I think this is called
the chi o top or something don't quote
me but I'm pretty sure and it's just
like a little bralette thing and the
back is all caged you guys are probably
seen this like a trillion times but I
think it's cute and I'll wear it like
under a shirt that has a low back or
something tell you that if you have any
sort of boob don't bother
because I am really flat like I mean I
don't really have boobs I'm not like
super completely flat but I really don't
have that many boobs Stephanie what I
don't have that many boobs only like
five no I don't have big boobs and this
is tight on me so if you have any sort
of chest I go back I'm on buying this I
know that sucks because it's cute but
like right here in the armpits when I
tried it on it was really tight I mean
I'm gonna keep it because it's not like
overbearing but definitely if you a
bigger chest don't buy this I believe
was $18 the next thing I got from brandi
was kind of a splurge but I've been
wanting it for ever and I feel like
everyone has it on YouTube and I
whenever I see people wearing it I get
really jealous so when I saw it on the
website I figured I just go for it it's
that big holy slaughter without everyone
has so you guys probably don't even need
me to show you but I'm gonna try my best
here it's kind of kind of massive so um
yeah it looks like this it's your big
cotton kin kind of thing with the hood
in the back like that this was expensive
this was fifty-nine dollars which is
really ridiculous it's probably not
worth that much but I really love it and
I've wand it for so long when I wear
sweaters like this like almost every day
like I was wearing it over this so yes I
don't really buy the shirts from Brandi
that have like the logo on it that
everyone has so I saw this one and I
really liked it and I didn't think it
was too overused so it looks like this
and it has like a little California kind
of palm tree thing with the face of the
moon in the top and these are really
soft they have little slits on the side
like that and I think this is going to
be really key with high-waisted shorts
in that sweater and I think this was
like nineteen dollars or 18 one of the
two but it's really soft and cute and I
love it lesson i got i'm kind of
disappointed with because i thought it
was gonna be a different pattern um I
was watching someone's vlog and they
were wearing this skirt from Brandi and
the pattern was really pretty it was
like light blue or something so I
thought I found it on the website but I
guess I didn't look close enough because
this isn't the pattern that I thought it
was going to be I was looking to keep it
because I still like it and I feel like
Brandis kind of a hassle to return stuff
so it looks like this it is a maxi skirt
with a slit in the bottom over here and
it's not super high but I think it's
really cute and it has a little slip
underneath um a little tiny one I don't
even know why this isn't there but yeah
it's really soft and as you can see i
think it's navy blue with white flowers
but i was going for more than a white in
light blue one it looked like that i'm a
website but i guess not i still like it
was forty dollars though so I almost
wish I could return it but I'm not gonna
try I still like the skirt i'm still
gonna obviously be able to wear it but i
kind of wish they showed like better
pictures on the website but yeah that's
my whole video if you guys enjoyed them
