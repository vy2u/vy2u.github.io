I haven't found a halt in forever and I
don't really know why I really don't buy
a lot of things at one time I'm just I
don't really do that like I'll go to the
mall get like one thing and then I'll
leave but this time ok this is what
happened last weekend I went to a huge
mall and I found ton of stuff I want it
and then my mom was like I'll get it for
you for Christmas I'll give you for
Christmas so basically I know everything
I got for Christmas and it's all closed
and I could have been a halt on if i had
bought them but I didn't so I don't have
those but then the next day I went to
another mall a my mom was like done for
me Christmas so I bought some stuff at
forever 21 and then I had bought some
stuff from Victoria's Secret so it's
kind of just like it's not a kind of
stuff it's a little bit but i figured i
do a haul since you guys like halls and
I never do them i guess i will start
with forever 21 I got two accessories
and two clothing items my the earrings i
wore in my latest over the week's videos
so if you want to check that video out i
will link it over here but these are
like amazing so basically I'm just going
to hold up one I obviously got to but
they have I'm a triangle at the top like
a bronzy one there's a chain that goes
down and then there's four little cool
beads if I had auto focus you can see
they have like a texture on them and
then there's another silver tile at the
bottom and they go down pretty far and
they're just really really cool I
absolutely love these and I think they
just add a bunch to every outfit and
yeah so that they would look like these
were only like 380 I think which is
amazing i love these so these are
awesome the next thing i got is a
necklace and I've been wanting like a
big statement necklace for a long time
and this one's really interesting I
really like it ok so it's black and it's
like this I don't know
it has three sections and I don't really
don't know how to describe this but I
had one mishap and it goes up pretty
high so when I wear it it'll be like
right here sorry my hair is no it'll be
like right here and this was at least
this was 780 so you know not it's kind
of expensive for their jewelry not
really but I'm really excited to wear
this I actually really like it's not
something I would normally go for I
don't think what yeah so basically this
first top I've been loving royal blue
hoodie you can see in my sweater it has
royal blue this is actually from last
year ago but anyways I've been loving
royal blue so this top totally caught my
eye and I absolutely love it it's kind
of just like this chiffon e material and
it's um royal blue almost a quickly
royal blue I don't know how well my
camera is like picking this up its my
camera kind of sucks uh-huh so that it
has all these really nice buttons down
the front it cinches in right here and
then it has like these ruffles at the
bottom this is gonna be really hard to
see and what I loved about this I didn't
notice this until I tried it on was in
the middle of these ruffles there's kind
of like a peak where they go up and you
can see like a tiny bit of your stomach
like I'm not saying like hoochie mama
stomach or anything but like a tiny peek
of it and it's so cute obviously I with
my magic new cami under this because
it's really sure about yeah and then the
sleeves go down they cinch in and they
have like cute little buckles and this
top is basically like the bomb I love
this thing so this was nineteen eighty
and then I got a dress I just loved this
dress and normally you know I go by
jess's all that much especially now that
it's winter but this dress truly caught
my eye and I thought I was really
interesting um so I'm a fan of the
tribal trend I mean I'm not like hugely
into it like hugely but I do really like
it so this dress kind of went along with
it i'm going to speech back if you see
my pants i am wearing pajama bottoms so
that's kind of embarrassing um okay so
basically it's like a taupe color and it
has like these prisms on it I don't know
it's a tribal Pat and that's all I can
say and it has a mustard lilac and like
me
green like colors in it so if you can
see that all right I'm scooting back
you're going to see my pants they are
mooses or moose I don't know what I'm
saying right now okay so i won't really
drew my attention to this was the top
part it has like a little black like
collar like flap things I don't know you
guys can see it I think that's really
cool this one doesn't want to stay down
I like iron it down or something and
then the buttons that go down the front
I like black in there room in gold and
it cinches and yeah i love this normally
um firma funny when dresses are way too
long on me because I'm five foot one it
sucks um but this one's actually fits me
really nicely and it goes like above the
knee but it's not like too short or
anything and this was 2780 like that you
probably can't see that so that is what
I got from forever 21 now moving on to a
toy a secret pink so black friday i go
to depend yoga pants they were also in
my app of the week video but I figured
I'd just show them again in case you
haven't seen that video or whatever and
then after that water I was on the
website and I found all the things i
wanted so i placed another order so all
in all I got some stuff here it's not a
time but I figured I'd show you so I
love the yoga pants I mean I'm not one
of those girls that where's your pants
every single dime girls in my school but
will wear yoga pants like every single
day and I mean I like them but I like
dressing nice you know what I need and
it's not that they're not nice it's just
kind of like casual so I got these black
ones because when I were yoga pants I
usually wear them with like victoria's
secret connects you guys will see I got
one but you'll see what I me in a minute
and so I just wanted what yoga pants
that would like a color that would go
with everything because my other
Europeans I will actually show you
here's another pair that i have and
they're like silvery and hot pink and
stuff but these don't match everything
so i really want a pair that would match
everything and so i just got this black
and white pair these are on sale on
black friday for me $25 just amazing
because the european
usually like anywhere from 30 to 40 and
so they're just black all the way down
and they say pink on the back and white
and yet all my yoga pants are pink black
and white which is really weird so I
just wanted a pair that would match
everything ok the next thing I got was a
bathing suit and you guys might be like
what but um basically Victoria's Secret
had a ton of bathing suits on sale now
because it's like winter and I don't
live in a place that is hot very much of
the year I live in the northeast and we
get so much snow like I my city where I
live in was like number one snowiest
city like a few years ago it is so snowy
and cold here and we only pretty much
have like three months of summer so you
know I'm not going to spend a ton of
money on a bathing suit so I waited
until now to get her the bathing suit
from there because I love their bathing
suits and this was like on sale so yeah
okay it looks like this it this is the
top part it's a bandeau and then it has
like a twisted part in the middle and it
is hot pink cheetah and I love t to
print so this is awesome and then I
hands like this tie theme for this
little band thing it's kind of too big
for me so i might just tie it in the
bath when I rivest but it's really nice
quality it's like all lined on the
inside too but it looks really cute on I
mean I'm not gonna try it on you guys
that's weird but um yeah I'm really
excited to wear this so yay and then I
got matching bottoms which you know
bottoms and there's a little bit more of
the print I love it so cute and I'm so
excited for summer it's so far away and
we don't have summer here until like you
because it was snowing until May last
year um yeah the last thing i got is
probably my favorite thing okay so even
though I dress up most of the time when
I'm wearing wrist or when I'm going to
school I dress up most of the time I
really love the career secret crew necks
I love them and when I saw this one that
they had in my favorite color and it's
not just like one of my favorite colors
it's like a color that I think looks
good at me not to be like narcissistic
or anything but I feel like this color
looks pretty nice on me and it's one of
my favorite colors and I'm surprised
they had something this call you because
it's not really something that they have
because normally their colors are kind
of right and like not tacky but you guys
might not what I mean just like kind of
break so when I saw that they had a crew
neck in this color I had to get it it's
a really nice dark mooney purple color
and then on the front it says pink or
look pink in a black heart and I like
black a lot too so that these colors
were together was like amazing and then
on the back it says love pink love pink
and they're like different thoughts and
stuff now I'm a very small person I'm
like tiny so normally i would get an
extra small and their stuff i got this
in a small because I like things to be
kind of big on me especially when it's a
really soft like this and inside is
super nice and clean and this was like
thirty dollars so it was on sale for
thirty dollars um which is pretty good
because it was originally like 50 wait I
don't even think it has a tag on it but
yeah I'm so excited about this and the
color and everything so that in the
stuff I got um not a time but I figured
I would do a little halt on it yeah i
did buy all this stuff with my own money
um yes so just letting you guys know
that because i know some people be
wondering um and yeah so i hope you guys
like this video once again leave your
comments below I love reading comments
and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
