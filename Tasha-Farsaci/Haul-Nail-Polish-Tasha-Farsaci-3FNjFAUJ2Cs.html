polish haul video and I'm filming in
kind of a weird area I'm actually
filming on my stairs and that's because
the waiting here is actually really good
and I wanted good lighting for this
video because I feel like especially in
video showing nail polish you really
want to give the true color and I felt
like good lighting was necessary for
this and my room really doesn't have
that great of lighting so I kind of
decided to film on my stairs I've never
been a nail polish haul video before so
i decided i would do one I'm obsessed
with nail polish and you guys might not
know that because i only talk about that
a lot but i have a lot of nail polish
and i don't know why it's just like some
people buy tons of makeup and I bike
onto the Polish so that's kind of my
weakness I have seven here to show you
and they're actually all SE and that's
because I bought a whole essay
collection and then I bought one more
that just happened to be se I'll get
into why about the whole collection once
I get there but I actually used to be an
OPI girl but now I'm kind of leaning
towards asking so i'm going to show you
guys those but first i can I want to ask
you a question so I recently just
ordered this show online off urban
outfitters and not because I actually
really like it because our went out for
you guys when you're may not know you
have to spend fifty dollars to get free
shipping and I really wanted a pair of
sandals on there and I needed free
shipping so I just kind of bought this
shirt and I need you opinion I mean it's
just kind of a basic but I don't know if
I like it that much I like it i'll
probably just keep it because it was
only ten dollars but it's just this like
pink and light pink looks white but it's
actually a light pink striped shirt and
it's kind of short and like this so i
don't know tell me if you think i should
keep it i know i'm kind of wearing it so
i probably should but um yeah let me
know on that and also one more thing my
hair is like this because i'm doing a no
heat summer i am allowing myself five
times to use heat in case i want to go
somewhere nice but i've used one of
those for graduation that I went to so I
have four more times so that explains
this awkward brain uh-huh but now I'm
going to get into the hall so I have
this place in my ball and it's I don't
remember what it's called but all the
nail polish is really
um I believe I see is like 595 and I
think OPI is too which is a lot cheaper
than normal because normal es sino PIR
like 850 so I've been lying this color
for a while and it is SES Bahama Mama
and maybe you can see that yeah Bahama
Mama and it's just this really pretty
kind of like purpley eggplant EEE like
dark color it's like a reddish purple
which are my favorite kind of purples I
just really like this and I think it's
going to be really pretty for the fall
in wintertime I've been eyeing this for
a long time and I really really like it
so this is Bahama Mama ok the next six
colors I got were actually all from the
collection dive bar by SC and I'd all of
these because I wanted two colors from
the collection and so I was looking at
them on ebay and like Amazon and stuff
because you can get them for cheaper on
those websites that's another tip you
can get them for like six dollars so i
was looking on there and then I came
across the whole collection for only 21
dollars which is crazy because there is
six in there and there was seven dollars
shipping but if you think about it six
se colors for $28 is amazing that's like
like four or five dollars per nail
polish which is great compared to the
normal and I actually love all the
colors in this collection there are
actually some of my favorite colors that
I have now so I decides are available
collection because yeah I'm obsessed I'm
going to start off with the colors that
I actually wanted before I found the
whole collection and the first color is
actually the namesake of the collection
it is dive bar and the font is really
small on these so you're probably won't
even be able to read that but this is
dive bar and it's basically this umm
amazing turquoise but it actually has
some purple in it you might not be able
to see it but it has like football and
it's teal and so pretty this kind of
looks like OPI yodel me on my cell which
i already have but this has like purple
and I really really love this it's just
a perfect dark teal it's like really
mysterious and I really wanted this
color so I'm really happy to get this
once again this is dive bar okay so the
next color that I actually really wanted
is called sexy divide that is the name
and it's just this really really pretty
purple color it's like a dark well these
are all really shimmery colors it's a
dark purple it has some blue and pink in
it and I just think it's really really
interesting and really unique all of
these colors are super unique which is a
reason why I love the collection because
I'm really into unique colors on my
nails you probably can't tell right now
because this is a total generic color
but I love this color and it's so pretty
I am obsessed with this so this is sexy
divide okay these next two colors i'm
going to show you from the collection
upon my least favorites i kind of just
want to put these in the middle i still
really like it this one is called over
the top and it's basically just this
silvery shimmery color which I still
think is really pretty it's just not as
unique as the other ones i think i
already have kind of a silvery but this
has like a bluish undertone which is
really really cool and I really like
this as well I like all of these colors
these just happen to be my least
favorites but it's really nice and I'm
really going to like this I think once
again in the following winter time okay
and once again one of my lesser
favorites of the collection is called
stealing the scene and this is really
attaching a really cool color I don't
even know how to describe it it's almost
like a muted kind of gold color which is
really cool I'm this more into like
bright colors on my nails so that's the
reason why these last two want like oh
my gosh to me but I still really like
this is this really cool and it's just I
feel like it's going to be really great
for the holidays um because it's a nice
gold color and I think this would be
cool I like just my ring finger or
something but I really like this and I
think it's nicer this is stealing the
scene okay so this next polish is
actually one of the more popular ones
from this collection this is called
trophy wife I love the name of this but
it's just this really pretty aqua
shimmery color it's awesome I think
everyone needs a color like this they're
just it's like a staple to me I love
aqua colors I'm
nails and this one's perfect it's like a
lighter version of dive bar and doesn't
have poop on it it's just your poo pick
teal aqua color so this is trophy wife
ok and the last color in this collection
is a pinky color and it's called jamaica
me crazy and it's just like a nice kind
of magenta shimmery pink color and this
is really pretty i actually don't have a
color like this but i really really like
it and it's really super shimmery like
all the colors in this collection and i
just really like this i feel like this
is a color that looked really good on
toes as well so i love this so you have
those all the nail polishes that i got i
hope you guys enjoyed this kind of video
i'm thinking of doing a nail polish
collection I'm not sure I kind of just
want to do high-end nail polish

those random brands that you really
can't get anywhere and you don't even

to include those something of just doing
like hi I'm like se OPI worley China
