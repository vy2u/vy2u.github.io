polish haul video and I'm filming in
kind of a weird area I'm actually
filming on my stairs and that's because
the waiting here is actually really good
and I wanted good lighting for this
video because I feel like especially in
video showing nail polish you really
want to give the true color and I felt
like good lighting was necessary for
this and my room really doesn't have
that great of lighting so I kind of
decided to film on my stairs I've never
been a nail polish haul video before so
I decided I would do one I'm obsessed
with nail polish and you guys might not
know that because I only talked about
that a lot but I have a lot of nail
polish and I don't know why it's just
like some people buy tons of makeup and
I buy hansa nail polish so that's kind
of my weakness I have 7 here to show you
and they're actually all Essie and
that's because I bought a whole Essie
collection and then I bought one more
that just happened to be Essie I'll get
into why about the whole collection once
I get there but I actually used to be an
OPI girl but now I'm kind of leaning
towards asking so I'm going to show you
guys those but first second I want to
ask you a question so I recently just
ordered this shirt online off Urban
Outfitters and not because I actually
really liked it because I don't went out
for you guys when your may not know you
have to spend $50 to get free shipping
and I really wanted a pair of sandals on
there and I needed free shipping so I
just kind of bought this shirt and I
need you opinion I mean it's just kind
of a basic but I don't know if I like it
that much I like it I'll probably just
keep it because it was only ten dollars
but it's just this like pink and light
pink looks white but it's actually a
light pink striped shirt and it's kind
of short and like this so I don't know
tell me if you think I should keep it I
know I'm kind of wearing it so I
probably should but uh yeah let me know
on that and also one more thing my hair
is like this because I'm doing a no heat
summer I am allowing myself 5 times to
use heat in case I want to go somewhere
nice but I've used one of those for
graduation that I went to so I have four
more times so that explains this awkward
braid uh-huh but now I'm going to get
into the hall so I have this place in my
mall and it's
number it's called but all the nail
polish is really cheap I believe XE is
like 595 and I think OPI is 2 which is a
lot cheaper than normal because normally
asking OPI are like 850 so I've been
buying this color for a while and it is
ses Bahama Mama and maybe you can see
that yeah Bahama Mama and it's just this
really pretty kind of like purpley
eggplant II like dark color it's like a
reddish purple which are my favorite
kind of purples I just really like this
and I think it's gonna be really pretty
for the fall and winter time I have been
eyeing this for a long time and I really
really like it so this is Bahama Mama
okay in the next 6 colors I thought
we're actually all from the collection
dive bar by Essie and I got all of these
because I wanted two colors from the
collection and so I was looking at them
on eBay and like Amazon and stuff
because you can get them for cheaper on
those websites that's another tip you
can get them for like $6 so I was
looking on there and then I came across
the whole collection for only $21 which
is crazy because there are six in there
and there was $7 shipping but if you
think about it six Essie colors for $28
is amazing that's like like four or five
dollars per nail polish which is great
compared to the normal and I actually
love all the colors in this collection
they're actually some of my favorite
colors that I have now so I decided I
would buy a little collection because
yeah I'm obsessed I'm going to start off
with the colors that I actually wanted
before I found the whole collection and
the first color is actually the namesake
of the collection it is dive bar and the
font is really really small on these so
you probably won't even be able to read
that but this is dive bar and it's
basically this amazing turquoise but it
actually has some purple in it you might
not be able to see it but it has like
cupola and it's teal and so pretty this
kind of looks like OPI and yodel me on
my cell which I already have but this
has like purple and I really really love
this it's just a perfect dark teal it's
like really mysterious and I really
wanted this color so I'm really happy to
get this
once again this is diet bar okay so the
next color that I actually really wanted
is called sexy divide that is the name
and it's just this really really pretty
purple color it's like a dark well these
are all really shimmery colors it's a
dark purple it has some blue and pink in
it and I just think it's really really
interesting and really unique all of
these colors are super unique which is a
reason why I love the collection because
I'm really into unique colors on my
nails you probably can't tell right now
because this is a total generic color
but I love this color and it's so pretty
I am obsessed with this so this is sexy
too bye okay these next two colors I'm
going to show you from the clutch typo
menus favorites I kind of just want to
put these in the middle I just don't
really like it this one is called over
the top and it's basically just this
silvery shimmery color which I still
think is really pretty it's just not as
unique as the other ones I think I
already have kind of a silvery but this
has like a bluish undertone which is
really really cool
and I really like this as well I like
all of these colors these just happen to
be my least favorites but it's really
nice and I'm really gonna like this I
think once again in the following winter
time okay and once again one of my
lesser favorites of the collection is
called stealing the scene and this is
really it's actually a really cool color
I don't even know how to describe it
it's almost like a muted kind of gold
color which is really cool I'm this more
into like bright colors on my nails so
that's the reason why these last two
want like oh my gosh to me but I still
really like this is this really cool and
it's just I feel like it's gonna be
really great for the holidays because
it's a nice gold color and I think this
would be cool I like just my ring finger
or something but I only like this and I
think it's nicer this is stealing the
scene okay so this next polish is
actually one of the more popular ones
from this collection this is called
trophy wife I love the name of this but
it's just this really pretty aqua
shimmery color it's awesome I think
everyone needs a color like this they're
just it's like a staple to me I love
aqua colors I'm
nails and this one's perfect it's like a
lighter version of diet bar and it
doesn't have purple in it it's just your
poop pick teal aqua color so this is
trophy wife okay in the last color in
this collection is a pinky color and
it's called Jamaica me crazy and it's
just like a nice kind of magenta
shimmery pink color and this is really
pretty I actually don't have a color
like this but I really like it and it's
really super shimmery like all the
colors in this collection and I just
really like this I feel like this is a
color that look really good on toes as
well so I love this so you have those
over nail polishes that I got I hope you
guys enjoyed this kind of video I'm
thinking of doing a nail polish
collection I'm not sure I kind of just
want to do high-end nail polish
collection because I think everyone has
those random brands that you really
can't get anywhere and you don't even
know what the names I don't have names

really want to include those something
I'm just doing like hi I'm like I see

of things but I'm not sure let me know
