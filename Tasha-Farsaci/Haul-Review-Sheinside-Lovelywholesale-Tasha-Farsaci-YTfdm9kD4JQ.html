listen you can hear em knows we belong
way down below so today I wanted to film
a really quick haul video for you I know
I do Falls all the time but I wanted to
show you a few things and I combed my
hair so I was like you know what I got
at home the video I'm filming in front
of my Christmas tree again just because
the lighting is really nice here and you
know it still looks pretty nice so I
figured why not so I'm going to show you
a clothes from lovely wholesale and she
inside and I pulled from these places
before they're both like Chinese Asian
kind of websites that you get overseas
and the prices are pretty cheap so I'm
gonna tell you like a little bit about
them ones I'm hauling them but I'm gonna
get right into it okay sorry not with
she inside I was extremely extremely
oppressed with the clothing quality and
the clothes that I got this time the one
thing that I would have to say is that
their processing time is very long
especially during the holiday season
because my items were processing for a
good month before they finally shipped
and if that's definitely a problem if
you're trying to get things in time for
certain events which I wasn't so it was
okay but if you want like a piece of
clothing for a certain event I wouldn't
order from the inside just because you
don't really know how long the
processing and all that stuff is gonna
take because a lot of them clothes are
made to order so the first piece of
clothing I got is this maroon dress and
you guys know
color so there's a lot of moon in this
hall but it's amazing quality I showed
it to my mom and she was like this is
better quality that you would find and
like Lauren Taylor
so it looks like this it's just this
moon kind of maiden flare dress it
crosses on the front which I thought was
really pretty and just kind of like
mature looking I don't know and then it
flares out at the bottom and the
material is extremely nice and thick
guys like it's thick it's stretchy this
would be great but interview dress I
think that's what my mom said but I'm
extremely impressed with the quality of
this and I'm going to be linking all the
items down below so if you're interested
in checking this out I definitely
recommend it next to machine side I got
this really pretty shirt and it's just
like a great t-shirt material on the
sleeves and on the back but I'm afraid
you've got this like almost chiffon
material and it's just this really
pretty floral pattern I love the colors
on this
you've got like some burnt orange and
then navies and you guys can see it but
it has like a little v napkin yeah this
is just really cute and especially if
you don't know what to wear on a date is
where they put some jeans and maybe a
necklace and I think this would be super
cute okay the only disappointment for
the sheen side was this sweater and I
love the sweater it's just I think
there's a little mistake on it
so as you can see it's just another
maroon sweater it's nice and long and it
has slits on the side except only one
side has the slit so as you can see
there's a slit on this side and then
over here everything forgot to do this
list so I think I'm gonna take this to
like a tailor and II don't have them so
up this side or make a slit on the other
side just so I can wear a vest but
overall the sweater is very nice quality
and I would definitely be wearing this
like every day the other site was even
so we'll take it that fixed I am a
definitely gonna be wearing this from a
lot last was she inside is what I was
most excited about honestly guys this
looks just like it would be from Free
People the quality is amazing yeah it's
beautiful
so I got this dress yeah it might not be
everyone's taste it's very bohemian
which I like and it looks like this on
top you've got some floral pattern and
then the sleeves go down like this and
they flare out once again this quality
I'm amazed by it it's really great like
you feel like you would get it for three
people and then like this and then the
skirt just flows out a little bit and
the back of the dress has a little V
like this so once again
honestly they might get this exact dress
of three people a lot of the times like
these websites kind of like made
replicas of Chloe pieces but honestly
this is amazing all this stuff is
amazing quality with the exception of
the lopsided sweater it's still a good
quality but you know what I mean so this
is awesome I'm so excited to wear this
with little booties and yeah she inside
has pretty normal prices as what you
would see on other websites and the
shipping is normal so it's basically
like an American website only not as for
lovely wholesale the items on the
website are very inexpensive like ten
dollars at the most but the shipping
prices increase as you add more items
and so it's a little bit different but
you know that prices basically weigh
each other out I find that but we will
sell items calm I'll walk my crew that
items from she inside if you want
something fairly quick I would go with
lovely wholesale over she inside but
still it takes a little time it's coming
up from overseas first thing I got from
what we wholesale is this
really pretty necklace perhaps I drop it
and it's just a great gold kind of
cheating necklace this is what it looks
like as you can see it's really pretty
and it looks like very nice quality it
feels nice it doesn't feel really cheap
and I think this is only like one or two
dollars on the label sales so if you
like it definitely go check it out
because it's really pretty and it kind
of just sits pretty high up on your neck
actually when you wear it but I just
think it's a really pretty necklace okay
next one well people say oh i got a fur
vest obviously not real fur fake fur
because these are really trendy right
now I really like the look of them so I
just got this brownish colored one at me
and guys just so soft like it feels so
soft I love wearing this like I said cut
off with myself but it kind of has like
some black almost in it so I wear this
with like a black long-sleeve shirt and
jeans it looks really cute so I really
like this alright this one item from lo
a wholesale was really questionable it
looked a lot different on the website
but it's supposed to be like a short
sleeve cardigan thing I don't really
know I'm kind of confused by it because
it looks like the stitching like
inside-out I don't know I'll try out for
you guys I'm just really confused
because there's one spot whether it was
like buttons like right here and then
there was a piece that has the
connecting ones but it would make sense
how would go around
I don't know you'll see me trying this
on and it's an it's good quality and
everything I'm just kind of confused on
how to wear it okay next one lovely
wholesale I got a sweater kind of
cardigan
I don't know website it looks like it
was open so here's another difference
but it's still cute it's kind of just
like a salt and pepper colored cardigan
and then once you get to the bottom it
has some bourbon a maroon stitching and
little pockets and I'm all pockets so
that's awesome
but also like I said
this part was open on the website so
things you get always exactly how they
seem or maybe this was just like a
mistake but it's still really cute and I
plan on wearing this with like I'm a
moon scarf and some maybe some leggings
but it's also really cute last thing in
this whole video from Mobley wholesale
is a vest and this is amazing quality I
think this is only like 10 below is
maybe so puffer vest puffy vest whatever
you want to call them are very in right
now and I warned them to were like a
while and I really love them I have a
black one that I work all the time and I
also really like the color army green to
wear especially with all my ribbon
pieces so when I saw that they had a
nice army green a puffer vest I was
super excited this one has like some
Camel color detailing it looks kind of
orange on the screen but I promise you
it's not Orange I don't like when we're
gonna ship but yes it looks like this I
got a medium because a lot of times
these websites the sizes run small and I
like to wear sweaters under my breasts
so yeah it comes with a nice hood with
some fake fur that you can take off if
you want and a vest looks like this this
is like a suede kind of feeling material
but yeah so that's everything I got from
machine side and what we wholesale if
you have any questions for me about the
websites about the clothing or just any
other questions even if they don't have
to do it the video be sure to leave them
in the comments below and I'll do my
best to respond if you don't have any
follow me on Instagram and Twitter I'll
put them right here the both you see
Tasha I love you guys so much and thanks
