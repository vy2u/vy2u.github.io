posted a video in forever and I do have
a valid excuse if you don't follow me on
Instagram or if you can't read I did go
to Hawaii so I was in Hawaii for about
two weeks or so and it was amazing I'm
so lucky to have been able to go I was
planning on filming videos while I was
there but I sunburn so badly like the
second day on my nose that it was
literally blistering and bubbling and I
was too embarrassed to basically go and
pop like let alone make a video so I'm
sorry about that you guys also may not
know unless you follow me on Instagram
which by the way is fiercely Hacha
but I also turned 18 while I was in
Hawaii a lot of you guys were asking me
for birthday haul but I didn't ask for
anything before birthday just because if
I want something I'll probably spy for
myself and Hawaii was amazing in itself
so and asked for anything but I did get
some things while I was there and some
things came in the mail while I was
there so I decided that I would show you
them in a little try on haul actually
most of these things are things I
ordered that came while I was in Hawaii
so it's kind of not a Hawaii whole but
I'm gonna start off with things that
went from Hawaii just to get them out of
the way first place is she inside you
guys have seen me haul from there
numerous times so first thing I got was
this Tunica dress and the reason I got
this is because it was like a replica of
a free people dress that I have actually
except in a different pattern and I have
to say that it's obviously not it's good
as quality as free people but it's not
I mean it looks like this it has like
this little triangle cut here and then
it kind of just flows down I'm not a
huge fan of the print just because it
has brown in it and I'm not a brown a
person but it's not bad if you guys
watch another one of my calls from
machine side you saw that I got another
Free People replica dress from there and
I got it in the other color just because
I liked it so much so it looks like this
and has some like roses on the front the
sleeves so they flow out and the end
over the bottom goes like this and I
like this one for fall more because the
bottom had black and it had darker
colors so I could wear this on plates
and stuff which I already did I got this
really plain dress but I think it's
really cute it's just this heather gray
color and it's really really stretchy
because a little pocket here and then it
just kind of flows out like a little
baby doll dress last thing from she
inside is a romper and you guys are
probably gonna see a trend I've been
romper obsessed lately especially in
floral wrappers but anyways I got this
floral romper from she inside it has
really cute lace to the top and then
lace at the bottom as well and it's
really cute I also got some things from
romwe or romwe or whatever however you
want to pronounce it first thing is this
a white tank top it has like a little
point in the front and it's pretty cute
it has like crochet not a point but it
is a point I got this white lace bodycon
dress and I'm not really in love with it
just because the quality is not very
good at all I'm pretty sure I poked a
hole in this with my finger
it's a white lace and then it came with
a slip but this slip is a lot shorter
than the dress so it's just not really
great in my opinion I would say you
could probably wear this once or twice
and then it would be unwearable so yes I
got this last thingy from Wang about the
depth at that last thing from the wrong
way is this dress it starts off with a
black top and a biack and then it flows
out into this little floral dress and
dresses with this shape are my favorite
I love skiier dresses just because kind
of insecure about like my hips I have
scoliosis so one hip jumps out further
than the other it's not really
noticeable I guess it's just to me
because I'm really self-conscious about
it so I love dresses that are 10 on top
and flare out at the bottom okay next I
have some pieces from my favorite online
website or one of my favorite online
websites I don't know if a lot I don't
know about it but it's called booboo and
this is totally not sponsored or
anything I got picked all this stuff out
by myself and it's awesome because they
have so many items and they're like
pretty inexpensive first thing I got is
this gray cropped tank top and it's
really soft this was like eight dollars
or something maybe six I don't even know
but it's cute I thought this would be
really cute in this summer with
high-waisted or ripped jeans shorts and
yeah the next thing I got is a romper
and it's the reason I made the purchase
on who unfortunately it doesn't fit me
like in the boob area
I don't know what happened here but I'm
probably just gonna take it in to get it
sized so it looks like this it's gonna
be really hard to show I'll probably
like put a picture either of me trying
to wear it even though it's too big or
the model where I guess you can like
figure it out but it just basically has
this really pretty like boho print and
then it's really strappy in the front
there's like halter straps and mermoo
straps and it's just a romper with
cutouts on the side as well so I thought
this was so interesting and really great
so hopefully once I get this size I'll
be wearing it a lot last thing from
booboo is another floral romper and I
actually wore this one today so I think
this is on sale for like $13 so once
again amazing and it's a long-sleeve
romper so it's more fall as like a dark
floral pattern and
see the sleeves flow out here and then
it has a really deep V in the front so I
just use fabric tape for like garment
tape or whatever do I tape the front
because I don't want these these big
boobs falling out just kidding guys
there's nothing here
anyways then it goes in the shorts
because that's what rappers do okay so
now moving on to things I got from
Hawaii so I really just didn't do a ton
of shopping while I was there just
because it's Hawaii so I wanted to like
spend time on the beach and stuff so
first thing I got was from just like a
little I don't know like flea market
kind of thing where there's just like
tent set up I don't know but it's this
bracelet so it looks like this and I've
really been liking beaded bracelets for
some reason so I saw this one and I
really really liked it it's just like
natural colors I don't know but I
thought it was really pretty and it's
gonna be great for layering like in the
summertime and everything I went to a
forever 21 and I got one thing it's just
this blue dress and it's like a babydoll
dress whoops with a big pocket and it
flows out and the reason I got this was
because I'm like 99% sure when I stayed
with Gretchen over the summer
Gretchen was Beauty the youtuber I think
she was wearing this dress I'm like 99%
sure when she picked me up except in a
different color and I really liked it so
when I saw it in this blue color I
decided I would get it to copy Gretchen
so shout out to Gretchen if you're
watching this all right if you didn't
know this about me I love all the surfy
shops and like Volcom Roxie Quicksilver
Billabong Ruka Rip Curl all those places
and and why are you there with millions
so I only know one thing because they're
a little bit pricey so I just got these
shorts from Volcom and they're so cute I
love flowy shorts like my favorite thing
to wear once again like I said about the
hip thing but just because they're
really comfortable so I got these ones
and they're
pretty foil pattern and I've already
worn these like twice while I was in
Hawaii so yeah I went to brandy melville
and I got one thing for myself and one
thing for a friend so I got this emerald
green just kind of cropped tank because
I think this was once again like twelve
dollars and I love like the color I
don't have anything this color so I
thought once again this would be cute
with high-waisted shorts in the summer
and then I just got my friend Melanie a
black t-shirt dress whoops yeah because
I know she wanted one and this is kind
of short so hopefully it's long enough
order I don't know but yeah it's just a
black t-shirt I hope it's a dress we'll
see you I went to just like one of those
souvenirs shop kind of things I have
liked but Hawaii t-shirts and like
magnets for the fridge and all that
stuff you know what I'm talking about
and they had this really huge tube top
so it's just a black tube top and it has
some crochet detailing on the top I
don't know if you can see it there we go
so hasn't crochet on the top and then it
just kind of flows out and I only like
this one because most of the two cups
I've seen like this or like cinch at the
bottom and I didn't love that so I
really liked this one last place I went
into why he was called local fever I
think I might be wrong cuz I took the
tags off of these but it was local
something and I got two things so I got
this kimono because I saw a bunch of
people wearing it in Hawaiian I thought
it was really cute and then I saw it it
was on sale except they only had a large
so it's a little bit big but I still
think it's really cute so it's just
black and maroon my favorite color
maroon
and it has this really cool pattern on
it so yeah I thought it was really cute
and it wasn't too big on me where it
looked like I was wearing a blanket but
it's it's a good size oh yeah the last
thing I got I posted a picture on
Instagram of me wearing it and everyone
was freaking out they want to know what
it was from so it's from that local
fever or vocal flavor or something weird
local something and it looks like this
it's boho basically and then the sleeves
blow out like this and the bottoms like
that and in the picture I actually like
tuck these straps under because they
kept falling off my shoulders I don't
know if I have weird shoulders or
something but the straps had to be in
the right place like these ones don't
fall off like easily to do so I just
tuck them under and I thought it was
still really cute and this is on sale
also for like $13 so yeah I was a
bargain shopper so I believe that's
everything I got in Hawaii I uploaded a
ton of pictures on Instagram while I was
there so once again if you wanna follow
me had the awesome be sure to come at
anything down below and if you can't
think about to comment let me know what
your favorite thing was that I got I'll
try to link as many of the pieces as I
can in the downbar and I love you guys
so much I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
