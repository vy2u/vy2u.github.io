you are new here I am Tasha
welcome start today I have another haul
video from example calm a new haul some
Apple a lot because I think their items
are super cute and trendy and they're
very affordable and I really like them I
know some people have conflict in
opinions on Apple but I do know people
who are not youtubers who ordered these
Apple as well and get the same quality
items that I do so I do believe that
they tend the same items to everyone and
as you will see in the call video I did
get some items are not that great of
quality so I don't know why I would have
sent those to me knowing that I'm a
youtuber before I get into the hall
video if you guys are not following me
on social media and you want to I will
put it on the screen here as well as all
my other handles in the description box
okay so I'm going to start off with
swimsuits example because I inland are
known for and I am obsessed with limited
okay so this pursuit I believe is a do
quenelle face swim bathing suit and this
one is really really great quality so
it's this navy blue and tan top really
cute I haven't tried these suits on yet
so I'd only know what to say about the
fit but I did order all of them and if I
small and I do have like a 30 for a boob
size and I wear a size zero on bottom
and I'm five foot one so I'm very petite
so I got the one smalls and this one the
top looks like this really cute and then
the bottoms are in really nice quality
as well these ones feels really sturdy
like they're not going to break or snap
or anything they look like this and yeah
overall I think the quality of this is
really nice so if it looks good on this
is a cheaper okay the next food I knew I
would love because I already have it in
a burgundy color and it is just as great
so it's this gray triangle top I love
this one because it's seamless it has
the same color on the inside outside
which I really like
so this is the nice top and then the
bottoms are a high-cut cheeky bottom
which I love and they're also seamless I
don't like when students aren't seamless
because I find sometimes the inside
lining show with and I think it just
looks kind of cheap so I do like
seamless bathing suits a lot
okay this next tune I got because I have
it in red and I really really like it so
I got in black it's this very simple
black one-piece bathing suit I just
think it's so flattering the size goes
really low so if you have any sort of
food you will have side boob I do not
have side boob but it happens and then
the back is pretty cheeky which shows
off the booty I like this a lot straps
are adjustable and the quality on these
are really nice okay so I got two of the
same suit in different colors and one is
very good quality and the other one
there are a lot of loose threads which
is kind of a bummer because I do really
like the suit so I'm going to show you
the one that is good quality first
basically it's a velvet suit which kind
of know how to feel that of all the
suits in terms of actually swimming in
them we'll see so anyway this is velvet
suit it has green velvet and then it has
this kind of blush pink trim which is
not velvet so I think it's really cute
the stitching is all nice it looks good
the bottoms every one of the reviews
were saying that they run small and they
do so I wish that I have a medium in the
bottom but I wouldn't be a medium in the
top so yeah I don't know I can squeeze
into them but they're a little bit small
on me they look like this really really
cute I love like this little buckle and
detailing so this one is definitely a
hit I really like it but you will see I
also got it in 50 blue color and the
poly is just not the same it looks like
it's the same but that if you get up
close the stitching in the front is kind
of not doing too hot okay so I'm not
sure if you can see that don't mind my
growth nails but the stitching is just
like coming undone and it just looks
kind of keep where as in the other one
it's not coming undone I don't know if I
just got unlucky but yeah and then the
bottoms are just it's the same as the
first bottoms except with the teal color
these are good quality so I feel like I
just kind of got unlucky with the top
you wouldn't really be able to notice
that when it was on but it's those kind
of a detail that bothers me okay I
picked up this next two because I wanted
the bottoms I haul this swimsuit in my
last Apple haul that is this color blue
and I really love the top but I wasn't
crazy about the bottom so I wanted these
bottoms to wear with it I love them they
are seamless they're really nice and
cheeky and the top if it fits is really
cute as well it's just this blue strappy
little top seen once once again this one
looks really expensive so yeah at the
top this this is going to be really cute
and the quality is really nice on this I
was just talking about the blue swimsuit
top that I liked and I actually got it
in black because I like to top so much I
don't like the bottom because they give
me a muffin top but I love the top so I
wanted it in black just have it as a
standard color it's a really cool mesh
style top and then it has a little strip
for your nipples are so I just saw this
would be a really cool basic top to have
the reason I don't like the bottom as I
mentioned in my previous video they are
really really cool the quality is great
but they have this like double strap
thing going on and bottoms are kind of
Swami so they kind like leave much fat
so I'm not crazy about the bottoms on me
I've seen them on other people and they
look amazing
but on me and or not the best lasting
cooking vessel I really like I just wish
the top was seamless so it's really
pretty dusty purple color but the only
thing is you see on the inside it has
this like white mesh kind of stuff so
I'm hoping the white master doesn't keep
out when I'm wearing the top you will
see in the Tryon because it's really
pretty I like the color the bottoms are
seamless so I really like the bottom
there's a cheeky bottom with the same
purple color I really like this dusty
purple color I think it's really pretty
okay I'm moving on to the clothing from
this Apple so the first thing I got was
considered a bikini but it's not a
bikini I got that set for the top only I
was just wearing it in another video
that I filmed so it's this crushed
velvet purple tube top I think this is
so cute and I'm obsessed with to cosplay
Lee's okay so the bottoms on the other
hand look like this I guess this is
soaking up some too but it doesn't feel
like you're there for me too also I only
know I got some might be cute for like
pictures or something but I probably
will not be wearing these bottom the
next thing I got is really cute but it
super thin and thinking it might be
see-through I'm not really sure this is
very similar to something they sell I'm
like an Australian boutique
so it's this black kind of a shimmery
tube top like I said I'm obsessive tube
tops so I hopped right on this like I
said it's just it's just really
see-through I don't know if you can see
I think this will probably be fine if
I'm wearing like a strapless bra
underneath maybe like a black one the
next thing is actually the top I'm
wearing I think this is really cute it's
pretty crop you'll see in the tie on but
I really do like this I've been obsessed
with red lately it's probably my
favorite color for season and it has
these cute little sleeves so I really do
like this talk okay I love this pink top
I got this in black in my last call from
Apple and I've already worn it at times
I wanted to get it in this adorable baby
pink color it just has this lettuce hem
I guess instead lettuce hem left video
ended up being right so it has this cute
lettuce time it's off the shoulder but
it's not like I'm not sure if it doesn't
like fly off the kind of space bear so I
really like they're two slightly cropped
and then I got something similar this
one's not really office shoulder but
it's another it's the same material as
grey has the same hem and I just thought
this would be a very versatile so I took
this one off the quality any of them
really goes pretty thick so I like them
a lot
I got another shirt but kind of some
more I don't remember ordering this but
I'm not mad because I really like it
it's this really really really crop top
like I hope you can even call these tops
like crophopper just getting shorter and
shorter they're literally bronze now but
I like high rates and bottoms so it's
chill it's this little crop top
and then have these little
off-the-shoulder long please this is oh
my gosh a cup this is really cute I
think it's going to be great with some
high rates and bottoms I love it
okay and then these last two things are
kind of misses this one is amiss because
I didn't order this
I ordered something else instead I
didn't get it oops
Zack will decide we need items for free
so I can't really like complain too much
letting pay for the wrong thing but yeah
I could keep that in mind this is not
bad at all this quality is really really
great but it's just not my style I don't
wear a collared button-up shirt but if
you do go to like a private school or
something that
you have to wear like a collar button up
this is beautiful the floral embroidery
mix is like really really nice I do i do
love the quality of it it's so nice but
it's just not my style I think I look
really bad and button up shirts the last
thing is not horrible but it's just not
it's not the best I think it looks
better on the website it's a two-piece
set I feel like this is a dupe for a 411
lemon fat not completely positive but I
think it is this is what the top looks
like it's a little burgundy top it has
these ties and then it has these little
embroidered patches things they're not
the best quality there's some like
little threads coming off of them but
it's not horrible I think I'll have to
try this on to see how I like it it also
came with these shorts these both need
to be steamed I think once I've seen
this might be a lot cuter cuz I just
hate like linked leaf stuff this is also
a darker color on the website it's
almost like magenta ish and it was
definitely darker on the site but this
isn't a horrible I'm just not in love
with it I think it looks kind of cheap
but we will see so that is everything in
this haul from Napa lines you guys
enjoyed it

favorite I don't want that I showed and
