showing you how I come on here like this
because recently I've been killing like
a lot and I've been getting tons of
questions not only in videos but on
Instagram how I've been doing it by the
way if you want to follow me on
instagram it's at person Tasha just like
my username and that'd be awesome
anyways back to my hair I've been using
the same method for a while now and I
recently got a new curling iron and I've
been testing it out and I just love the
results even more so I figured I should
definitely be doing this video so the
curling iron I've been using is actually
sent to me and that's not why I did this
video at all I wouldn't know if you used
it in this video if I didn't like it I
was planning on doing this video for a
long time because once again everyone
was asking me how to do it but this is
amazing and I'm gonna show you another
option that you can use if you don't
want to get this one but it is B it's
the Qt performance hair styling one and
a half inch clamp lists curling wand
I like wands because they definitely
give more of a loose kind of natural
look as opposed to the clinic I got it
from flat iron experts calm so I'll put
the links down below but it's not the
cheapest option but it's amazing you're
someone who doesn't want to spend a lot
of money on a curling iron or you're
just don't really clear here too often
this is what I used prior to this this
is a Sakana coin that had a clamp on it
I just ripped the clamp off this one is
one of the quarter inches as opposed to
the one and a half inches but it
basically does the same thing the curls
are just a little bit tighter so you
could obviously get the one the half
inch or the one inch or whatever you
want but this one is basically the same
it just doesn't heat your hair up as
fast and I don't know it's not as sleek
as that one but this one was only like
$20 maybe so yes this is great you can
get this at Toby the drugstore whatever
just rip the clamp off and you're good
to go
so if you want to learn how I get my
hair like this then keep on watching
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is apply heat protectant which I
actually did last night so I wouldn't
have to do it
this morning because it takes a while to
dry but before I actually start curling
my hair what I like to do is straighten
the tops because I have naturally wavy
hair as you can probably tell and I hate
when there's waves on the top and then
it goes into curl just doesn't look that
great so I like to kind of just
straighten that the kinks in the top of
my hair it's not iron that I use is the
Chi original I've had this for the
longest time like three or four years
and it still looks great so I definitely
recommend this and taking my flat iron I
am just going to running it along the
top section of my hair and just kind of
my roots
okay so once I'm done that I'm going to
move on actually cutting my hair and as
far as sectioning it off I don't do a
ton I just kind of split it in the back
and then take half of whatever side I'm
working on and clip it over my head so
all I do is take a section about this
big it kind of varies because I don't
like that girl's to be super neat and
tidy if you can be bigger than this
smaller than this or whatever put it
behind the curl and then just to wrap my
hair around the barrel this curling iron
is amazing and it makes my hair it's
super hot as soon as it's like placed on
there so it's done fairly quickly and
what I like to do is kind of just hold
the curl and scrunch it while it's
cooling and this just kind of helps the
curl lock into place
I like curling my hair away for my face
sometimes I'd like to switch on and off
and do like every other but most of the
time I just do it away from my face so
just like this and I kind of tap on the
curl to kind of see when it's hot which
it once again with this iron is very
quick and just kind of know when it's
right
dr. curls one half of a section of my
hair so I guess a quarter of my hair
what I'm going to do is take a hair
spray use whatever you want this is the
stuck-up mega-haul styling spray by
white sands and I'm just going to spray
not a ton because I don't mean I don't
really like hair spray so just a little
bit and kind of just scrunch it up after
that I'm done with that side of my hand
Clipper top I just do the rest on this
side which I don't think you guys really
need to see so I will do that and then
I'll be right back
okay so once I get pretty close to the
front I like to take kind of smaller
sections so normally I would use this as
one section but since I'm at the front
I'm going to put it in the two and just
do the same exact thing but I kind of
start closer to the room once I get to
this point just that it kind of flow is
better
okay so now that I'm done at this side
I'm just going to spray all of it once
again and scrunch and now I'm gonna work
on the side put the Coon yarn behind the
curl so I'm just gonna do this on the
rest of my hair and I'll come back when
I'm pretty close to the front again okay
so now that I've gotten to here I'm just
going to once again for this set of two
sections instead of leaving it as one
and just curl them okay so then once
I've done that side once again going to
spray it and sunshine after that I am
done so as you can see these are
variable loops kind of messy curls I
don't like mine to be really tight or
structured or anything but I like them
to look neon my hair is super long and
pretty thick so this color does an
amazing job of getting it done in at the
most a half an hour so I think you know
it's definitely a great product and I
think it's a good method that I use yeah
