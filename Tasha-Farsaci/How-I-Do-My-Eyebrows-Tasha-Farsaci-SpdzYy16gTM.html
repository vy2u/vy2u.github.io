how I do my eyebrows which has been
really requesting lately um I've been
doing something new lately I've actually
been filling them in which I was usually
too lazy to ever do but I really like
how it looks now and I've been getting
compliments on youtube as well as in
person which is like kind of a weird
thing to get compliments on so I figured
I should probably do a video as far is
like plucking a waxing I put my own
eyebrows I've never gotten them done
pretty much just because my mom wouldn't
let me but I finally think I have them
where I like them so I'd only have tips
for plucking except don't overclock
because you will regret it I have been
there I think everyone has honestly it's
a bad situation so don't overclock um
you know I mean yeah you can fill it in
but only so much okay so yeah this is
how I personally like my eyebrows if you
don't like it I'm sorry you don't have
to watch this video is just a quick
overview of what they look like um
pretty squared off in the center that's
how I like them and then like a little
bit of an arch and you want to learn how
to get them like this I'm gonna keep
watching so weird so these are my
eyebrows with nothing on them as you can
see there I mean they're okay they're
nothing special they're pretty dark they
match my hair when i stood I'd this
brown color so you know they're not
naturally blonde or anything okay so the
two products that i use the eyebrow
pencil i use is this ofra universal one
um i really don't even know where you
would get this i got this in a glossy
box that i got and that's actually why i
started filling in my eyebrows i learn
why not use it um but it's like this
brown color and apparently it's a
universal for everyone I don't think so
but I yes I like this i mean if you guys
have another recommendation let me know
because I mean want to run out of this
obviously need a new one and then i have
the Great Lash clear mascara but I'm
kind of running out of and it's kind of
getting gross because it has like a
brown in it from the pencil but this is
really cheap and I recommend
definitely ok so now if we're actually
filling in my eyebrows I really like to
have a kind of straight line right here
I just like how that looks and obviously
I don't have that I'm trying to grow my
eyebrows out closer to the middle cuz I
kind of went a little crazy at one point
so I like to draw that line in basically
I'm just going to start filling in the
outside and i'm going to try and make
like a straight line down you don't want
it to be like obviously a perfect line
are also gonna look really fake you just
kind of want to make a nice um like I
don't really know blurry line almost
kind of just like strokes light not like
Oprah online like you know what I mean
and then I kind of like to just go under
the eyebrow and fill it a little bit and
at the top two and then I kind of define
the arch a little bit and then obviously
a little tiny bit on the tail end so
then I kind of just kind of touch it a
little bit just so it's not too crazily
blunt or anything um because i don't
know i just kind of like to play with it
like that and then i will do the same
thing on this now that we are to this
stage i'm just going to stop them and
i'm taking out my clear mascara i'm not
i don't want a lot on the brush so i'm
kind of going to like rub it off a
little bit and then i'm going to brush
the hairs up in the front here kind of
the same along this curve and then down
once i get to the tail end and kind of
just play with it you know and get it
how you like it but i like how that
looks
you
yep so that is how i do my eyebrows I
hope this helped you guys out if you
wanna show me your eyebrows you try this
you know you can tweet me a picture tag
me on instagram it seriously Tosh enough
for both of them I mean you might feel
kind of weird posting picture of your
eyebrows but I mean who cares just just
go with it like if they look good and
show them off why not also leave me
other ideas for videos down in the
comments because I'm always running out
of ideas um you know I do want to do a
nail polish collection video but I don't
know how to film it so it wouldn't get
back like I don't just want to be like
well I'll use blah blah blah use blow
blowing I want to make it more
interesting so let me know if you've any
ideas for that and yeah if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and I
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
