and I just sprayed some heat protectant
it's just as amazed heat tamer spray and
the reason why guys straighter than
normal is because I did use that um that
straightening gel and it did give it a
lot of straighter I mean it still has
some waviness underneath but it's a lot
sturdier than it would be if I didn't
use it so that's nice um yes I sprayed
my heat protectant and I'm just letting
it dry now um yeah so I gotta let this
dry but um yep
so I'll come back when it's dry and stay
tuned okay so now that my heat
protectant is dry I will mod up here so
I have to clip up half of it and then
straighten up underneath and then to the
top so I'm just going to clip up the top
half and this is the hair underneath
typist regan just going to brush it out
a little bit with this comb
split it into two sections and I use the
just a regular G flat iron you know G
just throw a gentle one it looks pretty
nice and yes so I'm going to start
speeding this up now because you guys
all know how to straighten the hair and
yeah so you can mute this because I'm
not gonna be talking
okay so I finish straightening the
underneath of my hair the bottom half or
whatever um I just cut out because it
was taking a little bit and I figured
you guys um you know knew how to start
your hair uh yeah so my hair is pretty
long and what I do is I just take the
Chamba already straightened and throw it
to the back of my head and then I take
this top piece or this top on or
whatever bring it down split it in half
like this and I'm kind of awkward um
push it out
oh dear um but brush it out
and then start straightening so here we
go oh and I leave my bangs separate so
like see who's a chunk of bang I'm gonna
throw it over to the other side but now
you'll see what I'll do you want to get
to that side
okay so now that I have my hair pretty
much done straightened I'm going to move
on to my bangs and I hate them so much
when the whole side bang thing like not
that it's not now but when I was like
really popular I got some caught and
like I've been trying to go to
mouth-filling he's got too long so I got
them kind of cut and they're just really
long and really obnoxious so um to
straighten them to blend in my hair I
take them all I call them in front of my
face and then take my straightener and
just run it down
they get really hot so
and then just take up in the blend enjoy
here more i pushing to this side so i go
like this and then i straighten them up
that way alright so this is what my hair
looks like it's night right now so I
straighten my hair at night and then do
touch-ups in the morning
so it's not perfect now but I will touch
it up in the morning and yeah just you
know brush out um anything that you have
to UM touch-up anything if you're going
right to school or wherever you're going
and yeah um I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I hope it helped
you because I do have curly hair and I
think a reason that my hair does
straighten like pretty quickly is
because of my straightener um yeah I can
do a review on that she bought me two
but I hope you guys um enjoyed this and
it helped you and yeah so vote up and
comment subscribe please please please

about anything feel free to message me
