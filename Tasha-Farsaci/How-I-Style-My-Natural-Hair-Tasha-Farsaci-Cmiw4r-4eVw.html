how I style my natural hair and this
isn't my full on natural hair like if I
don't do anything to it but this is how
kind of it looks once I scrunch it up
and stuff and I've gotten requests on
how I do this before so I figured I
would do a video on it and it's really
really easy I use four products to do
this they should be kind of easy to get
your hands on I don't really know but
this was still question I wanted to show
you some pretty much this is what it
looks like it's kind of just like waves
kind of curls ish and normally it would
not be this curly I did kind of scrunch
it up which you will see in the video
but I do really like it and I think it's
really nice and pretty so this is pretty
easy to do obviously this isn't gonna
work the same on every single person
because everyone has a different hair
type my naturally is kind of wavy like
it's straight on top and like wavy or
kind of curly frizzy underneath if you
have curly hair than me obviously your
hair's gonna end up more curly if your
straighter hair it probably won't be as
wavy but um it's still probably gonna
work out for most people so yeah these
products reduce frizz a lot so you won't
have any frizz and obviously the
scrunching will add some texture to your
hair so this is great for everyone and
if you guys want to know how I do this
then keep watching okay so as you have
probably noticed I am now on my bed out
of the shower or whatever I'm looking
pretty sexy I have no makeup on in my
hair in a towel so you know if you're
looking to figure out how to pick up the
boys I suggest this look okay so now I'm
gonna take my hair out of the towel and
my hair is pretty naughty once I get out
of the shower it's awful so yeah I just
like to brush it out I'm using this comb
and I like to start from the bottom and
work my way up by here that's better for
my hair so that's what I'm gonna do now
I'm gonna speed this up and then I will
be back talking to you once I'm done
with that
okay so once I've got my hair pretty
much brushed out I'm just going to party
I like to put my hair on this side and
pretty much on the side so I'm gonna do
that now
my hair's like so Nadia this is really
annoying if you guys know a good
detangler let me know cuz yeah so now
I'm just going to read brush it out on
the sides
okay so now my hair is brushed out and
coated how I would like it and I'm going
to be using four products in my hair now
normally when I'm not styling my hair
natural I will only use the first two
that's why I'm gonna like braid it or do
something or it's not like down or
straighten it or any of those things but
this is what I'm actually going to wear
it down and natural and I wanted to look
a little better so the first two
products that I'm going to use are the
products that I use all the time no
matter what I'm doing my hair the first
one is the Aussie hair insurance I just
love how this works my nails match the
bottle that's pretty cool but yeah you
can get this at any drugstore it's
really cheap so I definitely recommend
this so what I do is just kind of spritz
it into my hand and then just run it
throughout my hair so I do that on both
sides and I use a pretty good amount
because I do have a lot of hair and I
really like how this smells as well
okay so after I use that I'm going to
use my Holy Grail hair product you might
have seen this in a video of mine
it's the edenal or argan oil and I'm
gonna put a little link to that video
here if you want to know more about this
but this is my favorite hair product of
all time so this is what the bottle
looks like and I just kind of put this
on both sides of my hair focusing on the
ends not really the roots but this gets
rid of all frizz so I definitely
recommend this for using on your natural
hair or anything that's frizzy
okay so now that I'm done with those two
products I'm going to start using the
products that I use when I want my could
be wavier which is when I use it natural
my hair used to be curly but you guys
probably know but over time as I've
straightened it more and it's gotten
longer it's kind of lost a lot of that
curl so I use products to kind of
scrunch it up and make it a little bit
wavy so the first one that I like to use
is this weed add a climate control stop
and I got this from my hairdresser I
don't know where you can get this I'm
probably online probably like any
hairstylist place but this is really
great for curly hair or frizzy hair and
what I'm just gonna do is pop it open
and just put a little bit into my hair
and what I'm gonna do is scrunch it in
instead of putting it in because this
will start the waviness the weed ad
products are made for curly hair so it's
also going to help my hair get a little
more wavy so you can just see that just
the scrunching technique really helps to
kind of add some pretty waves and
texture okay so the final product I'm
gonna need is I actually only have a
sample size of I actually have a ton of
these samples because I was gonna buy
the full size but they were sold out so
my hair just would just give me a bunch
of the samples but this is the we dad
tres
effects styling gel and this is really
great for scrunching your hair so I'm
just going to put a little bit of this
in my hair as the last step and kind of
just use it to scrunch
and you can just see that it's giving me
some nice waves they're really natural
which I like they're not like crazy
curly how my hair used to be but I still
like how it looks okay so then what I
like to do is just keep scrunching my
hair until it's dry and this it'll
probably take me like a half an hour
hour for my hair to dry and I will come
back once it does so that's what I do
this all these products get rid of my
friends completely and I just really
like how my hair ends up looking so this
is what it looks like
currently and don't worry this isn't a
bra this is a band now hooba yeah so I
will come back once my hair's dry okay
so now my hair has pretty much dried it
might be a little bit more damp but I
still really want to film the end of
this video but this is what it looks
like as you saw from the beginning of
the video and yeah it's just kind of a
curly wavy some pieces are clear there
other others obviously but um no I don't
know I kind of like it I don't really
know let me know what you guys think
about it so I hope you guys enjoyed this
