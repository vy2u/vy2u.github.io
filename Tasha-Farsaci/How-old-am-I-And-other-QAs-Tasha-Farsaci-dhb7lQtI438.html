video asking you guys to ask me
questions because I was going to do a
question in answer video and it is here
um so this is just going to be questions
from ones that you guys have been asking
for a while like how old I am and stuff
to just like random questions I only
pick 10 this time because I didn't know
how long they were going to take me an
answer and I didn't want this video to
be too long so I'm gonna get right into
it okay so the first question that I'm
going to answer is how old I am
and what grade am in if I'm looking down
it's because I have a little notebook
right here with the questions I chose on
it and I don't know why I haven't told
you about this yet I was just kind of
waiting and waiting for the right time I
decided I would put it in this video I'm
15 and I'm in ninth grade so I'm a
freshman in high school I mean I think I
look 15 the braces make me look a little
bit younger and I'm really really short
so I think I look about 15 let me guys
let me know what you guys think but yeah
I'm in ninth grade but it's kind of
weird I'm not in the high school my
school district is really weird in the
high school is 10th 11th and 12th grade
like the kids in it but ninth grade is
still considered high school so I'm
stuck with the 8th graders in one school
and it's just it's really annoying I
wish I was in high school but yeah I'm
not high school I stuck in junior high
okay so the second question I chose was
how did you get started with YouTube and
I don't really know how I figured out
about the YouTube beauty community I
think I might have searched how to do a
fishtail braid or something and
someone's tutorial might have popped up
okay my hair is gonna like bother me
this whole video um yeah so I honestly
have no idea and then I might have just
kept watching them I'm pretty sure
that's what happened but after I was
subscribed to a bunch of people and I
was watching the videos I'm like okay
this is really cool I can probably do
this so then I did and Here I am so
that's kind of how I started out and
yeah number three is what is my favorite
spring fashion trend and I'm a bunch I
love spring and summer because I'm a
huge person of color like I don't like
browns and grays and blacks I watch I
love wearing tons of colors so spring
and summer fashion is like my favorite
some of my favorite trends are the
colored Jean trend I love the
I think it's super fun and there's so
many colors to choose from and I also
love neons my nails are like neon pink
right now but you're probably be able to
tell because my white is a blinding
right there
and then I have a little pink dog and my
sweatshirt that matches my nails but I
love neons I think they're so fun and
they make you look tanner so that's
always a plus
ok number four is do you have a
boyfriend if not do you want one or are
you happy being single ok I don't have a
boyfriend I'm gonna say that I've never
had a boyfriend
unless you count like six and seventh
grade you know I do not count that um
and it's not because I don't like guys I
like guys but I'm just really picky like
I'm not one of those girls that float to
the ton of guys and like likes a new bag
every week it takes me a long time to
find a guy I like and once I do I like
him for a long time but most of the guys
in my school and my grade or whatever
they're really immature so pretty much
all of them are ruled out and I don't
know I'm just I'm picky and I'm not just
going to date someone like anyone they
have to be someone I like so you know
I'd like a boyfriend but I'm fine
waiting you know okay number five is two
people from your school know about your
channel yes I'm pretty sure everyone in
my school knows about my channel like if
they don't they must be living under a
rock because everyone knows people from
the high school know like once again I
don't go to the high school but yeah
people from my high school know everyone
knows it's just crazy and it used to
bother me like last year I would get
like petrified of people knowing but now
I think it's kind of cool I mean it
doesn't bother me anymore and people
come up to me all the time and ask me
about it and I think it's cool like you
know it just gets me more views and
stuff so sorry my hair is gonna fall in
my face like tons of times this video
but yeah I'm perfectly fine with people
knowing about it and like everyone knows
number six is what is my favorite movie
okay hands down Mean Girls I think that
every teenage girl should watch Mean
Girls because it is just amazing I can
probably quote that whole movie and it
just never gets old it's one of those
movies that I could probably watch every
day for the rest of my life and laugh
every single time okay number seven is
what state do I live in I was kind of
debating on whether or not I should
answer this question but I think he
I don't really have any stalkers and if
I do they probably won't be able to rule
out where I live so I live in New York I
don't live in New York City I wish I did
but I live about six hours drive from
there and I don't really like it it's
always cold and rainy and nasty here but
yeah I live in New York
number eight is do I have a big family
with like brothers and sisters and stuff
and no I'm an only child and sometimes I
like that and sometimes I really don't
like that I like it you know because I'm
like the only ones my parents have to
pay attention to it's kind of like bad
reason but I'm not spoiled or anything
but you guys they like I'm like the only
one you know so I don't have to worry
about like being ignored um but I don't
like it when I'm on vacations and stuff
because it's just me and my parents and
a lot of times you see like kids your
age like hanging out and stuff and it's
like awkwardly there with your parents
and I love my parents don't get me wrong
but it would be nice to have someone
around my age so like I wasn't all alone
um but yeah it is what it is and I'm an
only child
okay number nine is what is my one of my
favorite beauty gurus on YouTube and um
I have a bunch I watch a ton of people
and I don't know it just kind of changes
all the time but I really like a rose
186 Sara Bell 93 X Megan Hart's makeup
peepee bunny 97 I like a lot of people
um so yeah if you have any
recommendations of who to watch leave
them down below because I love watching
everyone and yeah okay so the last
question I'm going to answer is do you
have a celeb crush if so who and I'm not
normally one of those girls that like
really gets into like all the
celebrities like I don't like Justin
Beiber I mean I don't have anything
against him and like big time or not big
time rush what am I saying
One Direction I mean I don't have
anything against them but I'm not like
super into them you know but there is
one exception to that rule and it is Zac
Efron he's a god I'm pretty sure he is a
perfect ten and oh my God he's so hot
like honestly look at my little notebook
thing like hsm days he has always been
beautiful
I saw the lucky one last night um yeah I
would be a lucky woman to be in that
movie he is like gorgeous so I guess
that would be my
celebrity crush and that would end up
this video or end this video I don't
know what I'm saying it's like really
late right now and I'm procrastinating
like crazy my homework so anyways um I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
want more of these tell me down below
because I think they're fun to film oh
my god my hair so once again hope you
guys like this and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
