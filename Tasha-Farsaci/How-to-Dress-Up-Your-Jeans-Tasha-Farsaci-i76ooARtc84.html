video that I hope will be really helpful
for you guys what I'm going to be doing
is showing you different ways to style
your jeans to make them look more
dressed up because I know a lot of the
times you want to look put together and
nice but you still want to wear jeans
and be kind of comfortable so in this
video I have a few ways to dress up your
jeans to make them look more fancy so
keep watching if you would like to know
how ok so this is how jeans can look for
I'm just taking a plain white t-shirt in
some dark wash jeans I suggest dark wash
jeans for this because they're more
dressy looking than white wash
heels and wedges are one of the best
ways to dress up your outfit here I'm
taking a pair of wedges from Steve
Madden and just putting them on even
with the white shirt you can just see
how that outfit looks more dressy
this white shirt has to go Hume is
adding a silky looking shirt the silk
material makes an outfit look way more
dressy I promise you and then adding a
belt also helps so I'm just putting on
this gold belt the match of the shoes
and voila
here just a few more examples of the
silky material shirts
I just love wearing them with jeans
because they just look so nice and
dressy
statement necklaces always make an alpha
look more dressy so here I'm taking a
colored shirt and I'm just putting a
statement necklace underneath the collar
as you can see the chains just add a lot
to the outfit and the smuggles make it
look a lot more dressed up
adding a blazer is probably one of the
easiest ways to make your outfit look
more polished and put together here I'm
just adding a blazer over top my white
t-shirt just to keep a little bit more
of a casual look
you can even try buttoning up your
blazer because you might like that look
as well
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
hope it helps you out if you have any
other ways to make your jeans a little
more fancy be sure to leave them down in

topi accom it's a super cool website and
