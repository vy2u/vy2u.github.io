routine video or how I do my nails
because I get this question all the time
and honestly I don't really do anything
major like I don't know I just I do them
myself I've never had acrylics or
anything like that so I don't know maybe
that's why they were like healthier
whatever this is what my nails look like
at the moment this is a handle that's
coming off case you guys are wondering
but yeah so this is what they look like
I'm just gonna kind of show you what I
do normally when I would doing my nails
um these are actually kind of long for
like normal normally they'll be a little
bit shorter but I was kind of healing on
long at the moment so yeah once again
this is kind of gonna be simple because
I don't do much my nails are kind of
like my hair it just they just grow fast
and they're strong but you know
something I looked kind of like a bum in
this I just got out of the shower and
I'm wearing like swipes but whatever
okay so the polishes that I used in this
video are first of all the one that I
recommend a lot if you have trouble
growing out your nails
it's the salon Sciences instant
artificials
and this is what the bottle looks like
up close I got this at Sally's Beauty
Supply but I know you can get this
online and what this does is I explained
this in the video but um basically it
when you put this on and make sure you
know it's really hard so that they don't
break and you can grow them longer this
doesn't like harden your nails once you
take it off it just kind of keeps them
hard while it's on so when you take this
off your nails aren't gonna be any
harder but actually I have find that my
nails I really hard even when I take it
off so maybe this helps with that and
then the nail polish I use in this video
is Sally Hansen hard as nails extreme
we're in Pacific blue I believe yeah
Pacific blue this is a really popular
color and you can get this in like any
drug store or Target or whatever and I
really enjoy it and I'm not even wearing
a topcoat with this and it's really
shiny so yeah I definitely recommend
this nail polish so if you want to learn
how I do
and get them like this and keep watching
okay so I'm gonna start off with just my
nails that have had no polish off them
for like a day or so and I am gonna warn
you they're a little bit yellowy just
because sometimes I'm Way too lazy to
use a base coat and one time I used like
green nail polish and that did not when
I took it off I'm also a ahem oh it's
like coming off over here so if you're
wondering what this is and that's that
but anyways these are my nails I have
pretty good nails in general so I mean I
think I'm pretty lucky with that but um
yeah so I'm just gonna show you what I
do to my nails and here we go I normally
would start off by clipping my nails I
kind of want mine long at the moment so
I'm probably not gonna clip them except
for my thumbnails because I really don't
like having long thumbnails so I'm not
gonna clip a ton off just kind of into
the shape that I want because then I
will just file the rest so as you can
see here I am just gonna clip my nail
just a little bit shorter into like the
shape that I want but I'm not gonna take
off a whole bunch I tend to go for not a
square shape but not rounded just
somewhere in between
yeah so I don't know once again just
getting the shape that I want like so
okay then what I like to do is file them
down this is just kind of what I do to
get them all the same shape in case some
of them aren't exactly how I wanted them
I just kind of go in the same direction
because that's what you want to do and I
just kind of tried to get it to that I
lean more towards the square shape but
not completely straight across just kind
of like this
okay so once I have filed my nails to
the shape that I like them I'm just
gonna take my nail clippers and clip off
any hang nails I have because they're
kind of ugly and they hurt too so I just
get all my thumbs so I just kind of clip
them off and that's about it so this is
what my nails look like right at the
moment before I'm gonna paint them okay
so I know a lot of people have trouble
but their nails breaking and I did too
until I started using this stuff so what
it is is the instant artificials and I
got this at Sally Beauty Supply and what
this is is a base coat that basically
when you put it on it makes your nails
really hard so that they are less prone
to breakage now this doesn't harden your
nails so like when you take this off
your nails aren't going to be harder but
well it's on your nails it strengthens
them so they are less prone to breaking
so I like to just use this as a base
coat the directions say you need to do
two coats bla bla bla but I basically
just do one coat use it as a base coat
and it works fine so I'll just show you
a good a bit of me putting it on I don't
put too much on just you know your
average coat this will also protect your
nails from getting yellow like mine are
sometimes I'm lazy and I don't use this
just because my nails are pretty hard in
general anyways but um yeah sometimes
I'm really lazy and I don't do a base
coat but you can tell because my nails
are yellow and they're gross but you
know it is what it is so yeah you can
get this I know they probably have some
only ones by Sally Hansen or something
so whatever works for you and this
doesn't take too long to drive pretty
much by the time I do my other hand this
hand will be dry and once I put that on
all my nails I'm actually gonna start
painting now and I don't have a whole
technique to painting my nails I used to
suck at it but with practice I've gotten
better so all I can really say is
practice practice practice and you will
get better so today I'm using Sally
Hansen's
Pacific blue this is a pretty popular
color anyways so you guys might have
heard of it you know whatever color
works I had a lot of nail polish but
this is what I was just feeling today
and now I just paint my nails it doesn't
really matter I usually start in the
middle and then go out to the sides
just take your time with this you know
if it's not perfect you can always go
back and fix it later with a q-tip and
yeah don't go over it too many times
because if it starts to dry you'll get
it all streaky and goopy and nobody
wants that so I'm just gonna show you
again once again I go down the middle
and then the sides
okay so now I finished painting my nails
I did two coats on each hand and they
look like this to be perfectly honest I
don't normally do a top cope just
because I'm Way too lazy so if you find
that you want your nails to be extra
shiny use a top coat but other than that
I mean I don't want to do anything else
I know this was really easy but to be
perfectly honest I don't do a ton yeah
so this is it I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you have any further
questions comment them down below and I
will try to answer them if you like this
video give it a thumbs up and yeah it'd
be really awesome if you could follow me
