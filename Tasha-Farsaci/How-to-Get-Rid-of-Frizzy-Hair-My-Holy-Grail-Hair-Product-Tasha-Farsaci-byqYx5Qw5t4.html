made an actual video in a while I made
an update video like a few days ago on
why that was happening but I didn't I
want to count that in actual video but I
will put a little annotation to it here
if you want to see it because I included
a really funny embarrassing moment that
had happened to me that day in it so
it'll be you know right in this area but
basically you know I was just doing the
finals and stuff but now that I am done
with finals
thank God um I decided I would do a
video and this isn't gonna be like the
most exciting video on the planet but
it's definitely an important one because
it is gonna be my Holy Grail hair
product meanwhile my hair is not looking
its finest I did get a haircut
um you guys probably will be able to
tell since my hair was down to like here
before I got like three inches off my
hair was so dead I hadn't cut it in like
a little under a year which was awful so
I needed a cut but I am doing a no heat
summer which is why my hair is not
looking you know all that great and I'm
kind of cheating the nogi summer I'm
letting myself use heat five times I'm
just in case you know if I want to go
somewhere nice or from going a
graduation or you know someone who might
want my hair to look better I'm gonna
use he then but other than that you know
I'm pretty much go in all natural like I
don't even know what kind of happened
this it was like braided and I just kind
of slept in it and then I took the
braids out and it's just I don't even
know what's going on but anyways um that
is that I'm gonna get into this because
I want this to be a pretty quick video
but I just needed to show you guys this
product okay so basically my hair is
always frizzy when it's natural like I
have tried so many hair products I
probably tried over ten in here products
just to try to my hair not frizzy and
like none of them have really done
anything I mean they've helped a little
bit but none of them have ever done you
know what I wanted them to it to make my
hair not frizzy like but even that fuzzy
now thanks to this product um but I have
tried so many things I've tried high-end
products
I've tried drugstore products I've tried
so many things and I mean nothing has
helped so when I found this product I
I'm like freaking out because it is
amazing what it is is this even allure
argan oil and you guys probably have
heard of Argan or
a Moroccan oil before probably by a lot
of people and that's because it is
amazing what I like to do with this is
when my hair is wet and I like sopping
wet but you know what you know what you
know I mean right when you get out of
the shower and dry it a little bit
you're gonna want to put this in I put a
tiny bit in and just rub it throughout
my whole head of hair and you really you
barely need any of this maybe like a
dime sized for your whole head and I
have a lot of hair so that is saying
something and my hair just dries with no
frizz and I don't even know how it
happens because that never happens to me
so this is great if you have frizzy hair
especially in the summertime because my
hair is even ten times prettier in the
summertime I definitely recommend this
because it's it's it's gods like this
stuff is God okay something great about
this is that this lasts forever
I have probably used this ten times
already and you can't even tell like
there is product still to the top so
this is gonna last me forever
the downside to this product is that
it's pretty expensive this bottle is $30
from edenal or calm which is a lot I
would normally never spend that much on
this but it is definitely worth it they
also have a one ounce this is the 2.2
ounce but they also have one ounce for
$18 so if you don't want to spend thirty
you can get the one ounce but this is
actually a better deal if you think
about it because this is 2.2 and it is
30 and they're the ones one and it's 18
but if you really don't want to spend 30
than the 18 ounce will probably do just
as fine especially if your hair is not
as long as mine because you will
probably not ever even use this much if
you're still gasping from the price I
also have another Moroccan argan oil
product but it really didn't work as
well for me so if your hair isn't really
frizzy I I don't necessarily recommend
this one but if your hair is just kind
of moderate and you want it to be softer
and silkier then this is good for you
this is the renewing Moroccan argan oil
from organics from the drugstore this is
only about eight or nine dollars which
is really great compared to the Eaton
allure Moroccan oil I found that this
doesn't eliminate my frizz it gets rid
of a lot of it but it's still kind of
there and it still makes my hair really
soft I like using this before I
straighten my hair
because then my members really soft so I
recommend this as well I mean I like the
other one better but if you want a
cheaper alternative that you would like
to try before that one you can get this
at a lot of times you can get this on
sale you can get like more than one
organics product and you can get like
buy one get one half off or something so
I would definitely recommend trying this
out if you want to try Moroccan oil
before you buy like the more expensive
one you guys know that I must love this
stuff because I never do videos I'm just
like one product but I I needed to show
you guys this so once again this is what
it looks like you can get it from Eden
alloy comm and I absolutely love it I'm
pretty sure you get like 15% off if
you're a new customer so that is a plus
if you want to try this out and I really
think you should because it is amazing I
know this is a super quick video but I
thought you guys should know this so I
hope you guys enjoyed this really quick
video I know it's not that interesting
but it was definitely something I want
to share with you guys because this is
my new favorite hair product I'm gonna
repurchase this if I ever have to I mean
I don't know if everybody right out of
this but honestly this is amazing and I
love it
since I don't know wife feel free to
comment video requests down below that
you would like to see from me probably
not a room tour I'm so sorry but I hate
my room like I don't like it I mean it's
I don't hate it but I just really I'm
not impressed by it like I wouldn't want
people to see it I just don't think it's
that nice umm and makeup collection I'm
really not I don't have that much makeup
like all I'm going right now is mascara
and that's basically all I wear in the
summer so probably not those two but
anything else I would definitely be open
to doing so yeah let me know that down
below once again I hope you enjoyed this
and yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
