to wear InStyle high waisted shorts
don't mind my hair by the way it's
natural because of my no needs summer
but anyways I did this video and I
included a few different ways to style
them because I know high waisted shorts
are a huge trend right now but a lot of
people probably don't know what to weigh
with them and I basically focused on
tops to wear with high waisted shorts I
didn't exactly include like shoes and
jewelry because I feel like those are
just more of personal style whereas top
people might not have any idea what kind
of tops to wear bitch Awards I know I
didn't for a while but now I have a few
ways that I really like you know to wear
my high waisted shorts so I included a
few ways in this video once again I
didn't really show my shoes but if you
honestly have no idea what shoes to wear
I prefer like two sandals like flat
sandals and stuff and Joey it doesn't
really matter I i'm not even stole a
person anyways some yeah but i hope this
is helpful for you guys i just put
together a few kind of short shirt
combinations and yeah this is my style
if you don't like it I'm sorry it
doesn't help you but if you do it might
give you ideas for what you could wear
so keep watching
the first thing that I like to wear with
my hair is did shorts or crop tops
that's because I feel like pop hops are
normally too short could just wear with
regular shorts but when you wear them
with high-waisted shorts
it kind of just levels out the stomach
amount that's shown as you can see this
shirt is really pretty in plural and it
has a bow detailing in the back which
also kind of shows off the high-waisted
cut of the shorts this sugar is another
example of how to wear crop top with
high-waisted shorts this one's not as
crap so you don't need stomach but I
love little elephant and I love how it
goes through the black shorts
the next way that I like to wear
high-waisted shorts is with another show
tucked into them which is pretty obvious
but I really like this striped shirt
because it's really conservative and I
feel like it just kind of levels out
with the total like ripped up shorts so
I really like this and I like long
sleeves with high-waisted shorts a lot
in this next outfit I'm just wearing the
zebra print shirt with zebras that match
the black shorts once then just showing
how you can tuck a shirt in the
high-waisted shorts which is pretty easy
and this is what I see done most often
this is probably one of my favorite
methods all you do is tie a knot in the
side of your shirt I love this butts
it's super unique but it looks really
cool and I love it so I'm going to show
you how to do it now
all you do is get a nice long kind of
Big Show and gather all the material to
one side and then just kind of tie your
Everth not so you'll see how I do that
now
in here I'm just did it with a tank top
so you can do this with any type of
shirt
okay so the last method is one that it's
like a lot of people overlook and it's
basically an open neck sweater this is
sweater with holes in it this is great
because you can see the shorts are
high-waisted through the holes I like
wearing a hot pink bando with this but
you do with any color I just feel like
neons and hot pinks I really into this
summer this is great because you don't
get too hot and it's another one of my
favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
