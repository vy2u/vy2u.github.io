anything um if you watched my last
couple videos I said I was going to
California for two weeks which I did and
um I said I was gonna film but I was so
busy I didn't have any time and the only
time I had was when I was dark and I got
back and then the quality was horrible
and so I did film one video but it's
really bad quality and I'm not gonna put
it up but anyways I bought a lot of
stuff and I don't feel whole as a ton
because I don't normally buy a lot of
stuff at one time I'll buy like one
thing and you know I'm sick by the way
that's why I sound like this but um yeah
so I asked my facebook page if you guys
wanted a haul the stuff I got at you all
said yes it is a lot of stuff so I'm
going to get right into it I'm just
gonna start off and when I was in San
Francisco I got this necklace I posted
out my facebook page too and it says my
name in Chinese letters and then on the
back it says love and beauty and the guy
that did it was so nice and yeah I got
that and then I also got this one I
don't know what store is from but I just
got this little heart pendant and it's
like aqua colored so yeah oh okay I'm
gonna start out with the boring stuff I
don't think it's boring but it's not
really very fashionable so I think
that's what I'm gonna start off with it
I'm obsessed with like College t-shirts
and like college watch shirts and stuff
so I went to this store and I want to go
to college in California which is a big
reason why once they're like I don't
know I wanted one college in California
so I got this first I got this shirt and
it's a USC shirt and it looks like this
it's still tagged on it's a small and it
says University of Southern California
and yeah I didn't visit there I was
going to but I didn't
yeah okay and then I got this Princeton
shirt which is in California but like
ever since I watched the Cinderella
Story movie and she went to Princeton I
wanted to go to Princeton which yeah so
it looks like this it's a Princeton
University it has like the tiger and
stuff so yeah I got that one okay and if
you guys have watched my videos for a
while you know that I want to go to
Stanford I want to go to Stanford like I
used to want to go to Princeton and
stuff but now I want to go to Stanford I
went to the University and I'm on the
campus and stuff but it's really really
nice so I wanted to get a sweatshirt
from there and I got one it's like this
nice hooded sweatshirt says Stanford
University on it and this is a medium
but it's in the women's and they're
women's kind of ones like small like
tight fitted so I got a medium because I
want it to be like big and stuff and I
got this home there storm like there
bookstore and stuff and yeah I love this
I want to go Stanford so yeah okay
now I'll move on to something really
quick I got from H&amp;amp;M I just got this
headband it's black and then it ties so
it has like the tails hanging down I got
I'm wearing one right now it has like
brown but I didn't want to confuse you
guys and what that was so I just put it
behind but I've wanted one of these for
a while and me and my friend tried to
make them I'm gonna technically look out
but yeah you tie it right here and then
the tails hanging down and I'm gonna
like braid this into my braids and stuff
and that would be folded scoot 18m I
don't work with the prices of these
things so I took a tags off a lot of
them okay now forever 21 okay so this is
not all in one trip I went back to like
three Forever 21's I think because I
went to a ton of places but okay I got
this headband and it's like black and
pink flowers
and then it has like a knot in the
middle which is kind of you'd see
there's a knot right there yeah and it
looks like this it's really pretty um I
really like the colors in it and it was
only like free ad so I got this it's
like stretching in the back okay then I
got this shirt this was like the first
thing I got on the whole trip and some
medium which I should have got a small
but they didn't have one and I really
liked it so it's like this it's like
this teal color it's a really deep V so
I'm obviously gonna wear a cami and it
goes down it's like lacy and teal and
then it goes down to here and then it
has a ton of buttons all the way to the
bottom and yeah I really like this it's
really pretty
um yeah I'm gonna wear this with like a
cami obviously and it's really soft so I
got this sorry then I got this time'll
kind of spot shared thing it's a small
and it's kind of wrinkly exciting wore
it and it looks like this it has this
really cool tribal pattern on it I'm
gonna like readjust myself it's like
this has all down arms and on the back
and I really really like the colors um
like teal and coral and dark blue and
stuff so I really like this and I think
there's just like $20 or something
okay then I got these high-waisted
shorts they look like this and they're
really dark and then they have like
really light stitching so it's like
contrast or something and they look
really really nice on and they go off
really high so I got those okay I'm
talking really fast
okay these are something that's kind of
crazy and they go with the nautical
trend um they look like this
I'm obsessed with a nautical nautical
trend and I love stripes and stuff so
he's just totally like I had to get them
and they look like this they're red and
navy stripe and then they have like
Gold's about ends with anchors on them I
don't know if you can see that but yeah
then they have a zipper in the back and
they're really tight fitted I got an
extra so much sugar on a small but yeah
I feel like my size and you say you want
to order these online or something
probably get a small because they're
really tight now they look like that so
that's what I got from forever 21 I'm
trying to go fast because there's a lot
of stuff left okay the rest of the stuff
I got I went to thrift stores which some
of you might be like youth 50 stores
that's gross but honestly I'm especially
in California they have really high-end
supplies like you guys might think of
like Goodwill Salvation Army when you
think of fifth stores which is like
really hard to find cute stuff but these
fifth stores like waste plan Buffalo
Exchange and crossbones trading I think
they have like high-end designers and
stuff so they are like really cheap but
they're not like crazy expensive so uh
yeah I love these places if you go to
California go to wasteland that is my
favorite place now I'm gonna start off
with what I got from there I went to a
two stores I went to the LA store and
the San Francisco store so yeah this
stuff still needs to be washed but I
wanted to put it in the video
so okay I got these high-waisted shorts
and I'm gonna wanting these kind of
shorts for a long time they're vintage
Levi's and this store had lots of like
vintage clothes and stuff and they look
like this they were old Levi's and
someone cut them and stuff and then they
have the pocket and like the really um
distressed Levi's low thumping II and
they're just really cute they're ripped
and everything and they go up really
high waisted these were $28 so you kinda
know what I mean like it's not very
cheap there but it is like really really
cool and they have like a lot of like
interesting pieces so yeah I got these
and they like cut off and I really like
these okay then I got this tank top I
believe this is like twenty dollars you
know
and it's brown and it has like these
purple flowers on it really pretty it
has like this kind of cool thing at the
top and then it has like these little
clasps that hold it together if you can
see that you can see if the inside looks
like that and then the back and then it
kind of cinches and then flows out at
the bottom and I really really like this
okay then I got this blazer and I love
this I haven't had a blazer before like
I have a black one but I don't really
like it and this is by Zara originally
okay it looks like this it's Navy and
white striped and then it has like maybe
piping's
I think that's what it's called I don't
know and then I have pockets and it's
cuffed and like this silky white with
like um maybe buttons and everything
I'll scooch back again
it looks like
and I love this this was like $35 so
once again you're not the cheapest store
but they have like amazing stuff so I
really like this okay then I got another
blazer II thing um it's like it's like
cottony though so I don't know this
looks like this it's black and white
stripes which I love black and white
stripes and it has like gold buttons on
it and they look like this they're like
nautical II but it's black and white so
it's not like not color you Philly I
don't know but it doesn't button close
which is actually kind of cool kind of
just hangs there and it's really nice I
actually had this in and out for the day
I filmed that video while I was there
but it was bad quality so I didn't put
it up
okay sorry my camera cut off but anyways
this is the laser thing and I really
like this obviously cuz I bought it okay
um I also got this tank top and it's
kind of tribal II it's grey and it has
like these die or diamond thingies going
down it I don't know how to describe
that down the middle all the way down
feel like pink orange and cream-colored
and it's really sheer in the front so
I'm gonna have to win something under it
because you can like see me through it
maybe maybe not I don't know but its
sheer and then I like how it goes down
in a v-neck that was something I really
like yeah so I got that the last thing I
got from wasteland were these shoes
these are Oxford's I've wanted Oxford's
forever and these were good dealer by
Steve Madden originally and they're
shiny they have like detailing and stuff
and they lace up and it looked like this
it's so cute
they look like they've barely been worn
and they were a good deal I think they
were willing like 22 dollars or
something so yeah they're really cute
and yeah okay the next place I went is
Buffalo Exchange they have a bunch of
those absolutely so go on their website
and you can check like what our store
locations are okay so I got three things
in there I think all right so the first
thing you got is this dress which I
don't really know what I'm gonna wear
this I think I'm gonna wear to a wedding
I don't know if it's even good for a
wedding it was by guests I'm like Emily
and it's the way it's black lace like
where the top is and then it goes down
in like a black bodice or bodice I don't
know how does the body of something it's
really thick material and it's really
tight so it's like a body contrast but
it has lace and then the back all the
way down to like here is lace so that's
the back and the front and it's really
really like I'm only tiny so it's really
hard to find things that fit me like
tight and this is like really tight but
it fits me perfectly and it was a really
nice dress so I got it and maybe to a
wedding I think I don't know but yeah I
got this then I got this skirt it's by

showed you as Brandis - it's like this
moon skirt it has like this black like
