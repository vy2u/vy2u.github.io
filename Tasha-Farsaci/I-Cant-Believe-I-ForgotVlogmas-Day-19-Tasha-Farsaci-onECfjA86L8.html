like a look around and then later today
and I'm going to dinner with some
friends so yeah
Jamison okay so we are back from the
mall now I'm so stupid and part of the
reason that I went is so I could use
these gift cards at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
and get some stuff for friends and for
the getaway and I brought the expired
coupons not the actual ones I got this
really cute bra let throw that I'm
wearing from Victoria's Secret and I got
some other stuff so I'll show you what I
got when I get back but I'm about to go
to dinner with two of my friends so we
will bring you a we will I will bring
you along we're wearing two
possibilities which is downtown and it's
really good you remember Tessa from a
vlog in the summer I will link it down
below and we have the bread and the
tomato oil I talked about this earlier

whenever I show food at restaurants I'm
just like that's so sad will you retake
that so we came to Starbucks
hey ladies would you like to say
anything to blog mass we were like
debating but it didn't happen I got okay
I got a green tea latte and likes
costume no like where's me okay okay
see I like green tea lattes but I feel
like the kana tastes like corn like like
oh my god I just pick up like sweet corn
kernels yeah I don't know I think it's
good but I also think it tastes like
corn so comment down below and let me
know what you think that's scary I don't
like guys can you see me I need to like
block my face I think okay we're going
to lights on the lake which is basically
lights next to a lake but they're
Christmas lights also Sonic and yeah so
I'll show you guys a little bit of it oh
yeah
okay guys we're about to enter the Land
of Oz here we go
okay what's your face Oh
magical oh it's like a club up in here
oh my god I feel like I'm at Bootsy
bellows man no one's gonna know
oh I like that I like the trees that are
like dripping over there
I should zoom maybe
I believe what about the lake oh yes and
over here to my left this black mass of
water is the most polluted lake in the
country beautiful on a dog a lake but
apparently you can swim in it now so if
anyone wants to take that up be my guest
and don't drink the water hey guys so I
just got back from dinner and stuff and
I really have to blog
I mean edit the blog from yesterday and
post a cuz it's like 9 p.m. and I stolen
posted it so I need to do that but
before I want to do that I wanted to
show you the stuff I got them all like I
said I would so yeah the first thing I
got is this bra that I'm wearing from
Victoria's Secret I just thought it was
really cute so how many out of breath
right now but I just thought it was like
really pretty and it would be cute for
stuff like this and then from morning
Taylor I got okay I got this three
people shirt because it was on sale it's
just like this blue and white kind of
like thermal material with a little like
babydoll bottom and then I had a little
coupon for like $10 off a $40 purchase
so I needed to buy something else so I
saw this bralette and I've actually been
wanting this for a while
just like a high-neck one with some like
crochet kind of stuff going on so I got
that it's free people as well and then
from Lululemon I went like a little
crazy because those leggings I was
wearing a few blogs back that I got in
Texas I really really like them they fit
me perfectly I think they're super
flattering because they're supposed to
be like 7/8 length but I'm really short
so they're like perfect and they're
tight all the way down sometimes when
there's 7/8 length they're like loose
and my ankles and I don't like that so
basically they had a bunch of them on
clearance in my size and I just I went a
little wild I got two pairs but like
there were only $39 which is good for
Lululemon leggings like yeah that's not
cheap but it's good considering they're
originally 98 so I just got them in
we'll call her you probably can't see
it's like dark and then they also had
them in this black and maroon tie-dye
like I said I don't know how well you
can see this at all but it's like black
and burgundy tie-dyed and then they also
had these shirts on sale the tech
swiftly tech shirts only it's like grey
but I thought grey was a great color to
have it's like super neutral so I got
that and then I got something from my
dad but he might watch this so I'm not
going to show it but yeah that's what I
got I went a little wild but everything
was on sale that I bought so I don't
feel horrible about it
I'm so they're gonna end off the vlog
here because I think I got a lot of
footage today so thank you guys so much
for watching I love you guys so much and
yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
