today I have another haul video for you
guys and I'm super excited because I'm
obsessed with everything in this haul
I've got some really cute pieces and I
know you guys love my hauls if you guys
hear any weird background noise and the
AC in my room is so loud it's so
annoying but I can't really fix it just
like how it is so if you hear that or
the washing machine that's on right now
try to ignore it but I don't think it
should be too loud really quickly before
I get on into the video if you guys are
not following me on social media and you
want to namely Instagram I'll put it on
the screen here as well as in the
description box I post on there all the
way all the way all the time and it's
like the best way to kind of see my more
personal life also I know many have
questions about what I'm wearing this
actually just came in the mail from
Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch how random but it's
so cute it's like this little cropped
sweatshirt Henley thing and it kind of
looks like it would be a boy's but I got
it in like this baby pink color and I
think it's so cute so I'll link it down
below I got it on sale bringing it back
to my Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch days anyway so
I'm gonna start off with the first store
in this haul video which is forever 21
one of my favorites of course I feel
like forever 21 is one of everyone's
favorites but I got a large box of items
so I'm gonna get it right on into it
okay I got some really random
accessories from forever 21 so I'm gonna
start off with those first of all I got
this little yellow
fluffy keychain and I got it
specifically to put on this bag because
this is the bag I used for game days if
you guys want to know where I got it I
got on Poshmark a lot of people are
selling it I think it was like an
effective fun box or something but it's
basically this clear red bag and then I
thought it would be cute for like school
colors I could a USC by the way I
thought it would be fun to put this
little puppy ball thing on here so yeah
I got this okay the next thing I thought
it's so random but I've been wanting
this for so long basically there's a
theme party every year at USC that's
like snow themes and for some reason I
go all out for like themed parties that
I already know about so I can like plan
in advance and I thought these cute
little headband puffy ears obviously
like I don't really know what these are
I don't know if they're supposed to be
ears or just like pom-poms but I thought
this would be cute too
to it so I got this super grand um I
also got the pair of earrings that I'm
wearing right now I'll like insert a
photo so you can see what they look like
because it's kind of hard to show you
like when they're in my ears but I think
they're really cute okay I'm gonna try
and start off with all the accessories
so let's see okay I got a body chain I
really like the look of this one I like
wearing it if I'm taking pictures on the
beach and whatnot I'll put a picture in
once again and what this is gonna look
like I'm not gonna like probably not try
this on but yeah okay and I think the
last accessory this is so random but I
got this phone case with cacti on it I'm
obsessed with cacti I think that's
probably a basic thing to be obsessed
with I don't know I love succulents and
everything and I saw this phone case and
it's so strange on so many levels
basically it's a clear phone case with
cactus saying hi ah
and they have like googly eyes but
actually like Google I don't really know
why why I got this but I think it's
funny okay moving on I wore this shirt
in one of the videos I filmed pretty
recently so you guys have probably seen
it you're all wondering where it's from
it's this really cute red gingham crop
top this looks like something you would
get at like LF so I'm really glad that I
found it at forever 21 it's so
affordable so cute you can wear this
with so many different things and I love
it I've already worn it twice okay I got
this denim overall dress which i think
is so cute these are one of my favorite
things to wear because they're
comfortable but they look so adorable so
it looks like this just denim it's
pretty oversized it's not tight or
anything the ones that I have are kind
of tight so this one's super convenient
that it's flowy ish and it has these
little pockets in the front how cute so
yeah I really like this I've already
worn it something else I've already worn
I might as well show you I definitely
expelled some liquid on this I wore it
out is what I'm saying
anyways it's like this acid wash kind of
looking crop top it has like a row aa
hem top and then it's off the shoulder
and it has long sleeves with like a raw
ham I think this is really cute I wore
it with some black skinny jeans and some
booties and it was a good time I feel
like I never buy basic pieces
I always end up buying things that are
not basic duh so I want to pick up a
basic kind of t-shirt it's just a white
crop top but it has like this little
knot in the front so it's a little bit
cooler than just like a white crop top
it has you know an extra detail so yeah
this is so affordable and I know I'm
gonna wear this all the time okay this
is slightly absurd so you guys if you
follow me on Instagram you know I go all
out for gameday apparel gameday clothes
like I make everything a look like I get
really excited about it so I really
wanted a yellow a denim skirt I have a
red denim skirt that I wore for game day
it looked bomb I loved it and I really
wanted a yellow one but I couldn't find
one anywhere that was a the right shade
of yellow because we're kind of like a
gold and this couldn't find one that
wasn't like really expensive because I'm
not down like I'm probably just gonna
work for game days so on a perfectly won
in the kids section
I found this skirt and I got it and I
think the biggest size and kids and it
fits me perfectly so it looks like this
it's just this yellowy gold denim skirt
this is perfect and it was so cheap 1290
guys come on
1290 it's perfect I can't wait to wear
this honestly I think it's cute I'll
probably wear this other than gameday as
well but this was a find okay this shirt
is so cute it's just a white t-shirt but
it has like watermelon and broidery on
the top and I think I'm gonna wear this
like tied up as a crop top with like
boyfriend jeans or a denim skirt I think
it would look really really cute but
this is just so fun and summery and it
was really really affordable ten-ninety
like come on it's cute guys okay I grab
another overall dress because like I
said I love them and this one's
different
it's a dark green corduroy which I
thought was really fun and then it also
has a good zipper down the front which I
haven't seen so I think that's really
cute and then it just goes down a little
bit more flowy once again it has some
pockets which is great and yeah I think
this color is really unique and it's
perfect for the fall and wintertime
in LA some very excited to wear this one
okay next I picked up this distressed
cropped black sweater just because I
thought it would go with so much the
neckline is just kind of distressed I
think you can probably see that and then
like I said it's cropped long-sleeve
it's just gonna go with everything so
yeah this was 1790 this next top is so
pretty I think you guys will love it
it's this white eyelet lace off the
shoulder top and then the sleeves are
big like this this is so cute it's so
classy it's just a great top so yeah
okay I got something else for game days
I know I'm really crazy it's just there
forever 21 is so affordable so it's like
the perfect place to kind of get cool
items so I grabbed this I'm gonna kind
of explain my vision to you guys let me
know what you think I grabbed this red
mesh top and I was thinking of wearing
like a USC Bindo tube top underneath I
have a black one I'm just wondering I
was planning on cutting this so it's
like really cropped like you know like
right under the bando or should I just
keep it full-length I don't know let me
know but this is funky I don't know if I
wear this normally but I think for games
it'll look really cool okay I'm a
sweater fiend I don't care that I live
in LA and that it doesn't get very cold
in the winter I love sweaters I will
continue buying sweaters and will wear
sweaters whenever I can wear sweaters so
this one is so fun it's just black and
white stripes oversized and then it has
some little some little distressing in
patches this is great this is everything
I look for in a sweater very oversized
quite neutral I can wear it with a lot I
mean not really neutral because there's
stripes but it's like neutral colors you
know what I'm saying so yeah love this
no I'm gonna wear this like everyday
okay I got another sweater this one I'm
not totally sure about the fit is
slightly weird I gotta add a medium
because I thought I wanted it a little
oversized but I think it's definitely
not supposed to be oversized so like I
don't know it's really cool it's just a
gray sweater and that has
Poole florally patches on it just fits
kind of odd
I mean I'll still wear it but you'll see
maybe what I mean but yeah it's still
really really cute it's kind of cropped
it's a good look okay the last thing
from forever21 I'm obsessed with but
there's an issue
it literally sheds I'll show you okay so
it's this amazing fuzzy blanket hoodie
thing let me just show you like this is
amazing it has a giant hood it's so cute
I don't know if you can see it but all
of this fuzzy stuff is shutting
everywhere it was all over the clothes
it's like the ends are raw like this so
they're just like little pieces are
flying all over they're all over me
right now
this is so amazingly soft I just don't
know what to do I don't know if I need
to like go outside and shake it a
million times but yeah this is amazingly
soft so I really really really want to
wear it but if there are fuzzies all
over me right now so let me know what
you guys think I should do okay guys and
the last thing from forever 21 is this a
little wall hanging decoration thing I
don't really know what you call these if
you guys know let me know but I think
it's super beachy and boho and it kind
of goes with the rest of my room so I
put it there for now let me know what
you think I think it's really cute and
it's fun goes with the vibe so yeah yeah
so that's everything from forever 21 I
will have all of those items linked down
below
everything is so cute so totally check
that out and next I have some items from
another one of my favorite stores it is
Stella calm they're basically an
Australian website Australian fashion is
my favorite ever it's so cute so I
grabbed some things from them you guys
are gonna love it and I will be linking
everything from steli down below as well
they literally have the cutest dresses
and robbers alright so the first one
might be a little hard to show it is
basically this dress but you just tie
these little things in the front so it's
like a tube top dress it's really cute I
got the size 8 normally I'm a size 6 and
your
pn6 ornate but the thing is I got eights
in which sold out in sixes and they
still fit so yeah I got this in an 8 so
pretty next I got this also in an 8 I
believe it's this olive green romper and
it's super cute it has like this
crossover tie thingymajig in the front
and then the back is all open with this
little bow so cute I'm obsessed with all
of this oh my gosh ok this one I was
able to get in a 6 it's the same color
as my sweatshirt my favorite color ever
this baby pink adorable little romper
come on guys this is so cute
I love it I love it they have this in
Brad and I wanted it too but I was like
no Tasha don't get it in two colors so I
opted for the pink this one I also
brought in an 8 it's this mustardy a
yellow colored dress I love this one so
much it just had a little lace up kind
of design that goes all the way down the
front and it's just like a shift dress
sort of thing
super comfortable this would look great
with jackets I grabbed this black romper
because I felt like it was a classic
piece and it would go with so much so
it's just a black rapper has this little
keyhole front and then goes down into
the flowy shorts this is literally gonna
match so much and I know I'm gonna get a
lot of wear out of this and this one I
did get in a 6 ok and my last item whose
belly is so cute I plan on wearing this
out it's just this white little burlap
crop cap thing sorry the tags in the way
but it's just really really pretty I
thought it'd look so pretty on the model
when I go out I love wearing cropped
tops with high-waisted pants or high
rested miniskirts so I thought this
would match everything and it was just
really pretty and then it's adjustable
in the back yes this everything in this

put any promo codes I find for you guys
