right now because I dyed my hair as you
can tell by the title and I want to make
like a dramatic entrance so yeah here we
go okay so as you can tell I want brown
I've been talking about it in some of my
more recent videos which I'm sorry that
haven't been that many of those because
I've been really busy I started indoor
track and school I have a lot of school
work this year so yeah and then on the
weekends I'm trying to spend time with
friends and stuff so it gets kind of
hard to make videos but I'm gonna try so
yeah I dyed my hair and it's brown as
you can tell but I went for some reddish
undertones because I didn't want just a
flat Brown I really wanted to keep like
warm tones into my hair and if you guys
if this is the first video you're
watching the mine I did have blonde hair
I've been blonde my whole life I was a
natural blonde but I really just needed
a change I was getting kind of sick of
it and my hair is lighter in the summer
so it was blonder and I was getting
darker roots so I just really didn't
look how it looked so I went dark and I
really do like it it's definitely a
change it's definitely different than
everything that I'm used to but you know
I really do like it and I really didn't
get that much hair cut off so that's not
different and but i don't know i like it
i think it suits my eyebrows and my eye
color better um see I have brown eyes
and brown eye brows my eyebrows were
really dark I guy filled them in but
they're really dark before that so maybe
I was meant to have brown hair but yeah
so I kind of just want to tell you guys
kind of the process that I went through
because I know maybe some of you who
have been thinking of doing this for a
while or maybe just want to dye your
hair completely different color and you
don't really know what to expect so I
did go to a salon I didn't die myself um
I mean I think that's perfectly fine my
mom just wouldn't let me my mom is like
really careful with my hair I don't know
she's kind of weird but she wouldn't let
me do it myself she made me go to like
this along that she goes to and the
ladies really really great so she does a
really great job so i went there and
face
what they did was she just kind of
turned my end a little bit just to get
off my dead ends which I really didn't
have that money and then she put like a
a base kind of thing on my hair so that
it'll just soak in the color more and
then she put in the eye and she mixed
like to die so that it would be like
this kind of reddish brown color and she
used the amount of dye that she would
normally use for poor people on my hair
because I have so much hair but yeah and
then I basically SAT with the dye in my
hair with like a little shower cap on I
looked really really stupid I'll insert
a picture here
yeah so I SAT like that for like an hour
maybe a little longer and then she took
it off and washed my hair and dried it
and straightened it and yeah that's what
happened and it was about $85 before the
tip so you know that's just what she
charged I mean I don't really know what
everyone else would charge but that's
how much I paid I didn't pay for it with
my own money so yeah so that's basically
what happened oh and then she gave me um
like two products actually no i bought
the products to use in my hair so i'll
show you though so she told me she used
a demo demi dive I guess and apparently
it'll fade a little bit so to keep it
from fading um I bought this stuff that
she recommended it's the bumble and
bumble like color support thing and it's
a conditioner and I actually got it for
red hair because as you can see I have
like the red hue in this and she said
the first thing to go would be that red
so on this will keep it from fading and
then I won't have to go back for a while
to get my roots touch up so yeah I
bought this and then she told me that I
needed a sulfate-free shampoo so I got
this this is the GK hair hair taming
system color protection yeah i really i
really don't know but she really
recommended this so i figured i would
get it so yeah that's really all I had
to say I kindest won't let you guys know
that I dyed it and I'm really excited so
please please it would mean so much to
me if you didn't comment that you didn't
like it I know some of you guys aren't
gonna like it I posted a picture on
Instagram and some people were saying
they didn't like it but I mean I
understand everyone is entitled to their
own opinion but it's not like i can just
snap my fingers and my hair will go back
to how it was like it's stuck like this
and i paid for it with my own money and
I really liked it so I mean for you guys
just comment like saying I look bad or
something like the home I feeling so if
you feel that way that's fine just keep
it to yourself because yeah that would
make me sad but if you like it please
tell me because that would make me happy
so yeah I'm sorry if I look really
flushed in this video it's kind of hot
in my room because i'm like freezing all
the time so i have like all the lights
on my electric blanket and I got trying
to see me so yeah but um yeah so that's
all I really want to show you guys I
guess I'll show you a little bit more
um yeah I really like it I'm really
excited it's definitely different like I
said but I think dog hair is good for
like the winter and stuff so yeah once
again let me know your opinions down
below try to be nice and I love you guys
i'm going to try to post more videos
soon i have tons of out for the weeks p
recorded so i'm gonna be blonde of those
so don't think i went back I didn't but
yeah I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
