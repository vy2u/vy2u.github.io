the I Heart fall tag i wasn't tagged big
surprise right I wasn't tagged because I
don't really have YouTube friends like
I'm doing it anyways so you know kudos
to me right so once again I was only
tagged I'm doing it anyways just because
I don't really do tags that often and I
wanted to do more tags because I feel
like you guys get to know me more and
yeah I'm looking pretty casual right now
I'm just being a sports bra and a
sweatshirt because I'm actually about to
go to my homecoming football game and I
was wearing a school squatcher but I
took it off for this video you know says
my school name on it so I just kind of
threw something on and I feel like it's
okay to be casual in a tag video so yeah
and also I'm wearing this twisty tie
people have been asked me where i get
these you can get them a target but this
girl she is so sweet she send me a few
of them she's a view of mine a
subscriber and she has an Etsy store and
she sent me some of these from etsy
store and they are so much cheaper
buying them from her than even going to
target or something so i will put her
little etsy name right here and i will
also put it down in the description so
please buy them how she's so sweet and I
know she has been a subscriber for a
long time because I've like recognized
her username and stuff yeah ok now I'm
going to get into the tent ok so the
first question is my favorite fall lip
product and ok I am I like I like makeup
and stuff don't get me wrong but certain
makeup items I do not wear like I really
don't wear fake makeup and lip products
I don't really wear and it's not because
I don't like how they look I love how
lip gloss and lipstick looks and
everything but I hate how it feels on my
lips so if I do wear something it's a
lip stain so I was up staying here I use
this once in a while but it really
drives my lips out because my lips are
constantly trapped I've never had non
chef lips but this is the Stila
pomegranate crush lip in cheek stain and
it looks like this it has like a little
brush thingy and you twist the bottom
and it comes up and it's just this
really pretty kind of berry color my
lips are already kind of dog begin with
this is like my natural lip color so um
I don't know I really do like this
though and if I want dunker lips one day
I will probably use this okay number two
is my favorite fall nail polish
and I couldn't pick one because I love
nail polish so much um two of these I
actually haven't won yet I don't know
why maybe because it's not really full
outfall yet yeah it is what am I talking
about okay well the first one I got like
a year to go it's kind of old but I'm
obsessed with it this is opie eyes meet
me on the Star Ferry and it looks like
this it's just this really pretty like I
don't even know it's kind of like a
popoli gold bronze color I've definitely
shown this and like a lot of videos
before but yeah so it is meet me on the
Star Ferry in case you couldn't hear me
saying that but yeah it's so pretty and
I love this especially for fall and then
the next to our se colors I have one
either of these yet but I will because
they're amazing the first one is dive
bar and it's this amazing dark teal with
like purple and green duochrome reflux
whatever you want to call it and the
writing is really tiny but dive bar and
I cannot wait to wear this and the next
one is SES Bahama Mama and it is just
this kind of like it's not showing up
right but it's like a pro Polly kind of
maroon color and that's one of my
favorite colors ever so yeah Bahama Mama
okay number three is my favorite
Starbucks fall drink and that is the
pumpkin spice latte like everyone is
saying but I love pumpkin flavored
things seriously pumpkin pie is amazing
pumpkin ice cream amazing pumpkin
anything amazing i just love pumpkin and
pumpkin spice lattes they're so good
okay number four is my favorite fall
candle okay this is why I don't do
beauty guru tags that often brace
yourself guys i do not own a bath and
Bodyworks candle
I know crazy I have tried to buy them
before but I could not justify twenty
dollars I know sometimes they're two for
20 so maybe I should take advantage of
that but i'm just going to show you the
one candle that i do burn okay so i
don't know what this thing is from it
was sitting in my friend's car like two
years ago and her mom didn't like the
stock of it so she gave it to me this is
what it looks like it says vanilla cream
and I forget burn this thing all the
time and it's still up to here so I
don't really firm handles that often the
other day I decided I wanted to get more
into the whole beauty guru candle
obsessed thing so I'm like thin more you
know so i decided that i would like this
thing and I'm not good with matches I'm
not coordinated I'm just a failure but
in chemistry today I had to he was a
Bunsen burner so i had to light a match
and I did it all by myself so I thought
I was all cool and I'd be able to light
this thing so i let my match and went to
put it in here and it burned my finger
nail and it burned like a chunk of my
fingernail off which was disgusting so
um I'm not laying this who by myself
anymore which might explain why I don't
really have that many candles but if I
did have a favorite candle because I
have smelled them before it would be the
pumpkin caramel latte candle from bath
and body works because I wanted to get
that but they didn't have a little small
one because I don't normally burn them
that often but that would be my favorite
ok number five is my favorites fall
scarf or accessory so I have a scarf and
accessory because I had to include more
than one since I kind of fill up a whole
candle thing um this is my favorite fall
scarf this is from H&amp;amp;M last year i
believe and I shows with my mom and it's
her favorite too so it's just black and
that has these kind of like purple and
brown and green and pink flowers and I
feel like it's just really pretty it
still incorporates like the kind of
earliness of like flowers and stuff but
it's a dog and it's kind of it's just
big and a warm and it's my favorite
scarf ever I love H&amp;amp;M scars because
they're so big and long I like long big
scarves um but yeah this is definitely
my favorite pop stuff ok my favorite
fall accessory I actually got this every
day but I'm in love with it I mean I
guess it's not really just for fall you
could wear this any season but I just
feel like the color of the necklace
itself is kind of follows it's like
punished ok so I've been wanting a
necklace with triangles on it for the
longest time and I was in urban
outfitters every day and I saw this one
and I like crap my pants because it's so
amazing so this is what it looks like it
just has five little triangles and the
one in the middle is silver and the
other ones are like bronzy there you go
now you can see it I don't know if we'll
have it at your urban outfitters but it
was eighteen dollars which is you know
not awful but I'm obsessed with this I
love this so much and I think it's
really nice for fall and winter and any
time because it's so pretty but I just
feel like it's more of a fall and winter
piece ok number six so I'm looking over
here my laptop's here number six is
haunted house haunted hayride or haunted
corn maze ok well I don't like it scared
when I go to those things just because
normally like the people that do it or
like teenagers so they just tried like
talk to talk to me and stuff like me and
all my friends just kind of talk to them
so it's not that scary but um I would
definitely want to do the haunted corn
maze I've done the haunted hayride yeah
and I've done a haunted house kind of
the ones that I go to the people aren't
allowed to talk to you so it's really
just people dressed up in like masks to
score in my room and like following you
around so that's not that scary I feel
like if they could grab you I get kind
of freaked out um I don't know but I
love corn mazes and stuff so I feel like
if it was scary I'd be even cooler so I
definitely want to do that ok number 7
is my favorite Halloween movie guys I
fail I am awful but I really don't watch
halloween movies I don't know I mean the
only one I've heard of is like Halloween
Town which I haven't watched but I guess
I'm just gonna say my favorite scary
movie and this movie isn't like all that
scary but I feel it it's just a classic
like it's like Mean Girls of the scary
movie well it's like I don't know I like
it's prom night and the newer one with
brittany snow me and my friend used to
watch that all the time and it's not
like the scariest movie in the world
like I guess it's only scary at night
maybe but I love it and it just it's
awesome so watch prom night I
really like that movie and it's really
fun to walk with your friends I'm great
is my favorite candy to eat on Halloween
that would either be crabby patty
gummies if you guys don't know what
those are just don't even talk to me and
then I also just like plain chocolate
bars I know that's really boring about
like who she bars yeah me and chocolate
or like this number nine is what am i
guessing up for Halloween as um okay my
mom told me that I am too old to go
trick-or-treating this year I know it's
really depressing and none of my friends
are having halloween parties so I I
don't know if I'm gonna be able to dress
up I'm really sad I really wanted to be
like a Greek goddess um lolufullyloaded
just did a video tutorial on that and
I've been wanting to do that for a while
but that just made me like really want
to do it um cuz i really want to wear
fake eyelashes i need an excuse to wear
them but i don't know maybe i'll just
dress up as that and answer the door
like that with other trick or treaters
we will see but that's what i want to be
okay and the last question is what is my
favorite thing about fall um I don't
know probably boots that's so boring but
i really love boots like combat boots
riding boots boots i love boots i also
like going this fall sports games to
like soccer and football and stuff i
really like going to I am some of you
probably ask I don't know Myra play
soccer I used to but I stopped playing I
don't know so I like going to watching
those games in football and all that
stuff so that's the end of this tag
video I hope it was somewhat interesting
I know I'm such a fail I couldn't even
hear some of these questions that's why
I never do tags because I never can
answer to them but um yeah so I'm gonna
tag all of you because I know I feel
like a loser when I don't get tags but
um yeah so I'm going to tag all of you
