I'm sorry my hair looks like a cat died
on my head I just really didn't feel
like doing my hair today
so disregard this so basically today
it's just a kind of update video as you
can tell by the title I did get a summer
internship which I'm really really
excited about so I kind of wanted to
share that with you guys I kind of
already have mentioned this a bit on my
other social media platforms so if you
end and not following me on Instagram or
Twitter totally follow me on those if
you want to keep up to my life more so
basically I am a creative content and
marketing intern for goat goat is an app
so I'll tell you a little bit about the
app I've mentioned that in numerous
videos but in case you haven't seen
those videos I'll talk about it more now
by the way they did not ask me to make
this video I'm just making it because I
know I do a lot of like college advice
videos and I feel like internships kind
of go hand in hand with College so I saw
this would be relevant to my channel and
to you guys anyways so go to the
shopping app and the cool thing about it
is it has tons of stores all on one app
and you can kind of shop all the stores
at once and you can shop right in the
app you never have to leave the app to
buy anything and you can kind of create
lists so you can create like wish lists
or you can create a list like things to
buy your friends or oh my gosh I need
these shoes you can create a bunch of
different lists within the app and they
save them and they notify you when
everything goes on sale if you guys do
you want to sign up for do't I will link
it down below and I had a code Tasha
so your first order on don't you get $5
toward it and free shipping which is
really great because a lot of the stores
on don't don't have free shipping and
less you spend a certain amount you know
so for $5.00 and free shipping is Dakota
I'll put all the info in the description
anyways so that is basically what goat
is and I'll play the story now kind of
how I got the internship so basically I
knew I wanted a part-time summer
internship this year and I applied to a
few through like USD jobs or USB career
whatever and I hadn't heard anything and
was kind of a bummer somebody came or
telling me oh how shall it just a mutual
ball summer like you only an internship
like you're so lucky you have your
YouTube channel but you know I've always
been yes I'm a youtuber but for me
there's a lot more than that
I know YouTube is not going to be
forever so I really did want some
experience in a different area um not
necessarily different field
I do love like fashion and social media
and stuff but I just wanted you know the
experience of a real job I haven't had
like a real job other than YouTube in a
while so I really did want something
else so I applied to a few internships
and I hadn't really heard anything so
that's pretty bummed and also in luring
the founder and CEO goat emailed me and
she basically told me she wanted me an
intern but the problem is that officers
are in San Francisco and I'm in LA and
when she asked me about this it was you
know pretty much the start of summer
like it was not it didn't give me like a
lot of time to figure things out so I
basically said I'm so sorry I can't I
have an apartment in LA I don't have
time to sublease I don't know how to
arrange all that stuff in time but thank
you so much for offering I was pretty
bummed because it sounded super cool but
it just wasn't I was not capable of
doing that and like the time period
subleasing in my apartment complex is
kind of for whole because so many people
are trying to sublease but like i would
have to cut down the price a lot people
to want my face okay so that's basically
a few weeks after that which is a few
weeks ago the CEO emailed me again and
she asked me if I would be interested in
doing the position from home which
obviously that sounded amazing to me so
if you guys don't know
Gretchen mom's beauty she's another
youtuber here and I love her my friend
really good friends for like four years
who met on YouTube and yeah I love her
and she's also worked with Joe and the
CEO is also talking to her about the
same thing so basically both Gretchen
and I are now in turn for do't and
we are both working from home so
Gretchen is living in New York City for
the summer
and I'm living in LA but everything we
do is basically online and stuff ok I'll
tell you more about what we're doing
so working around 30 hours a week from
our apartment it is a paid internship
which is so amazing those are so hard to
come by especially if you're like just
starting out in internship world so
recently a Russian and I are handling a
lot of like the social marketing things
in the app we are handling the Instagram
but we're not the only one paddling the
Instagram some people were DMing the
Instagram like asking it with regret to
memorize and it's not always us oh
please don't like DM the Instagram like
just trying to talk to us because like
we're not the only ones that you did but
anyways we are you learn the Instagram
we're doing a lot with push
notifications we're creating lists on
doubt if you go to like the trends tab
and don't there's a bunch of curated
lists so we're kind of making know
making it graphic for them adding the
items basically is offering them a lot
of our you know our knowledge of like
the social media world and our
demographic and how it can help their
out so it's just really nice it's just
people are hands-on and I feel so great
because they totally value our opinions
more exciting news they're actually
going to be bringing Gretchen LA to New
York
well dress in tarney's New York but the
bringing me to New York pretty soon and
then we're also going to the San
Francisco a few times or summer so we
can work from their offices so that is
going to be is so amazing
stay tuned for lots of content with
Gretchen and I'm just so excited and I
feel so grateful that I was able to get
such an amazing internship ok so here's
what I asked for you guys if you guys

internship or internships in general
