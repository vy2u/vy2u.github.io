little bit ago I slept in Lee again
today
myself - like at 11:15 yeah I look like
a boy currently or an egg or something
so today is Saturday which means I have
to pack and do laundry in order to pack
I need to do laundry and feed my room
because Sunday and Monday are designated
to studying Tuesday or my finals and
Wednesday I fly home and I'm a horrible
Packer I take so long to pack I'm so
indecisive and because it's so cold at
home I think it's like 20 degrees right
now I need to bring heavy clothes and
that's harder to pack you know because
they're obviously way more and they're
like bigger so it's harder to pack and
like I hate packing my mom used to do my
packing for me lately I'm getting so
many like comments on my I did my um
like High School vs College situations
video and like you know what okay you
guys probably don't know unless you're
youtuber when a video starts to get a
lot of views and aren't like your normal
viewers people start leaving like hey
comments it's like kind of funny because
they're like so ridiculous but
everyone's like giving me they're
like oh my god you're so rude to your
mom like dude obviously those are skits
like those are not like actually how we
are / like everything's exaggerated
whatever anyways people are probably to
get me but yeah my mom's packed for
me and do my laundry shadow mom you're
the real MVP um yes so today I'm gonna
struggle with that and then I'm after
hopefully that all gets done I'll still
have time I'm gonna try and go to USC
campus Ann Marie is there I didn't end
up studying her with her the other day
so maybe a little bit today I also want
to walk around campus and like find
where all my classes are because I like
you know knowing where my classes are I
don't like being that girl that gets
like super lost or whatever um ideally I
will go out tonight or do something I
wanted to go out last night
there's literally nothing going on
because it's finals and like USC kids
care about their grades um yeah so
that's the situation as of now I just
posted my video it's not a vlog from
yesterday I didn't vlog yesterday
because I knew I had a QA that I was
posting so I just posted QA if you guys
have not seen that but yeah so I'm just
gonna try and clean
 up do some laundry and make my face
not look like this okay guys so maybe
this is just me let me know but today
was the launch of the Kylie Jenner shop
and don't get me wrong I violate a Papa
filee I follow Kylie and stuff I think
she's like cool I guess you know
whatever but like why would I want to
buy a thong that says Kylie all over it
like what it like why would I want to
buy a phone case that says Kylie Jenner
lips on it like I'm sorry I don't know
if I'm gonna get like can I get
copyright of doing this probably not
whatever like I don't want to buy a
sweatshirt with a photo of Kylie and her
like tits out on it like I don't for $70
like what the heck like I could
literally go and buy a sweatshirt from
Walmart for like $10 and get an iron-on
thing and do this myself like I've never
been someone like fangirl over
celebrities or like get super into like
bands or like people like that anyway so
maybe that's why but I'm just so
confused like why this is a thing you
guys said you wanted more chester in the
vlogs and stuff just left so he
basically sprinted in here because he
was lonely chester say hi vlog mitch
loves you and you guys are asking like
what kind of dog chester is he's a mix
and my roommates adopted him so they
don't know exactly what mix he is but
they think he's like beagle german
shepherd I don't know comment down below
and tell me what you guys think he is
guys he's just so cute I'm like picky
about what dogs I think are cute too I
think he's so cute
loves to hold my hand like this video if
you think Chester is cute okay so I just
got ready and got dressed because I
realized I left my leftovers I wouldn't
do it last night in my friend Lauren I
think I told you this and I locked my
leftovers at her apartment and I really
want to eat them so I'm gonna like walk
over there so I thought I'd show you
guys what I decided to wear today cuz
you guys said you like my outfit clips
so first of all I want to show you the
earrings I'm wearing I got these in
Texas at gypsy wagon yeah I think that's
it and they're really cool there was
just these hoops with these cute little
like stone things at the ball
this is the progress of my piercing I
think it looks pretty good also this one
yes so just wearing like both of those
and yeah I'll go over to my new to show
you the recipe outfit but this is the
Brella I'm wearing it's from Free People
you guys always ask me about my bra lats
and they're like always from Free People
whenever they're like this it's like the
copper color and then I'm wearing this
little necklace that I wear a lot I
think I got this from a little boutique
in New Jersey don't mind the literally
disaster that my room is like as I said
I'm doing laundry and packing and stuff
so it's crazy
but I'm wearing this long sweater from
2020 AB it's really really cute it has
like a slit in the side here I'm just
wearing some jeans from Topshop and then
these boots from Steve Madden so yes
this is my outfit guys look how cute the
little tree wall thing he is in Laurens
apartment it's so cute
she wasn't to be shown right now because
she said she's not ready but I suppose
she's here and it's so cute and I want
one okay okay guys I should be doing
laundry but I couldn't turn down one
episode of Drake and Josh so this is
happening comment down below what's your
favorite episode of Drake &amp;amp; Josh is cuz
I think mine is the sushi episode you
probably know the one okay guys story
time so basically it's like a half-mile
maybe a little less for me to walk from
my apartment to my friend's apartment
and I always like just complaining about
it because if you guys are familiar with
USC it's in like South Central Los
Angeles which is like kind of a sketchy
area and like just walking from here to
there who's disgusting like I literally
wore headphones so I'd like wouldn't he
well people were like yelling like
catcalling why's there was this group of
four men probably like early 40s late
30s and they literally created a line on
the sidewalk so I could not pass them
and I had to go around them and walk on
the road in order to get around that and
they were like yelling stopping me
luckily that I couldn't hear it cuz I
had headphones in but it was so
disgusting so I was just complaining I'm
like oh my gosh that I hate South
Central LA like I hate living here I
hate that it's here or us he's here and
then on the way walking back I was like
I'm gonna get Starbucks like why not and
I was walking into Starbucks and this
guy is kind of like motioning to me and
like try and like like holding something
out and I was like oh my god this guy's
gonna
give me his mixtape and I like already
made eye contact so I kinda just like
took one headphone out and walked over
and he was like Merry Christmas any like
cannabis to me and I was just kind of
like what the heck is this and I was
like oh thanks and like walked away and
I looked it was a Starbucks gift card
and I was like what the heck so I was
like just walking into Starbucks I'm
like all right like I might as well use
it like there's probably nothing on it I
figured he just like had used it and
then like gave me like 30 cents or
something and I went up to use it and
there was $20 on it so this random guy
just gave me a $20 Starbucks gift card
so that's so nice so that like restored
my faith in South Central LA so yeah
that makes up for those guys literally
like cornering me that's disgusting but
yeah I got a spiced sweet cream cold
brew because I love the vanilla sweet
cream cold brew and they came out with
the spice one for the holidays and it's
really good I definitely recommend
recommend trying it so yeah I thought
that was just like super nice and like
that stuff doesn't happen very often so
that was cool
anyways yep gotta clean it really badly
so I'm actually gonna do it I promise
guys I'm facetiming now yep so if you
guys you guys probably remember Mel
unless you're like new to my channel but
she's gonna be in basically every day of
vlogmas when I get home hopefully not
looking like a boy do you have anything
to say okay well hi guys
so it's 6:40 now it's a little bit later
and I just wanted to update you my room
is looking a lot cleaner I actually did
a lot don't mind that that's like an
outfit I might wear later so that wasn't
there before but it's looking like
decently clean my suitcase is like kind
of pack I'm just having a problem
because since it's so cold at home it's
really supposed to be like 15 degrees
while I'm home
I can't pack a lot because everything
that I'm packing is like sweaters and
like thick things so like I don't want
to over the weight limit I'm bringing a
carry-on but like I haven't packed any
shoes yet and just because like hold on
let me show you it's already so full
with just like sweaters and stuff so I
don't know what I'm gonna do about that
but anyways I'm about to go get dinner
at tender greens with Ann Marie I
haven't seen her in so long and like I
could never have
