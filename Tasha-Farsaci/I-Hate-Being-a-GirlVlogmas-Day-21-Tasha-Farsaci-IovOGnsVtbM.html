basically I woke up with the worst
cramps of my entire life it's that time
of the month TMI sorry but it was like
excruciating like I used to have cramps
so bad that I got a prescription
medication for it
yeah so they're like so bad I woke up at
noon because I like took a bunch of
every pro fan and like slept so now I'm
about to go back to the mall because you
guys know if you watched my blog the
other day I forgot to bring the coupons
that I meant to bring for Bath and Body
Works so I think I'm gonna go back to
the mall I think Mel's gonna come we're
just going briefly yeah so I'm wearing
this stuff I got there the other day
this is the burlap from three people I
bought and then this is the thermal kind
of top thing but I bought I'm just
wearing some jeans with it okay so I'm
in the car sorry I'm vlogging on my
phone it's just because I needed my
camera to charge because it's been dead
really we're close to dead for a while
so anyways I just went to the mall I
didn't vlog so I was kind of in a rush
because mal had to babysit so I like
picked her up went to the mall went to
Bath and Body Works like I had to went
to all tie to get my mom a shampoo and
got Duncan I got a caramel swirl iced
coffee with cream and no sugar because
the sugar never melts and it just makes
it way too sweet cuz like the swirled
flavors are really sweet anyway so yeah
I did that I am going to target really
quick because I have to get some
toiletries and such I might go to TJ
Maxx just for fun
not that I need anything but yeah I'm
gonna try and figure out what I want for
dinner because my mom said she'd make
dinner and then I need to see if we need
any of the groceries and then I will get
them but yeah so that's what's happening
from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works I just got a
woman vanilla sugar the shower gel and
then I got some hand sanitizers I might
include some of those in the giveaway
what I'm doing but yeah okay I just
finished in TJ Maxx and Target but look
at the sky it's so pretty I love sunsets
that's literally
so so pretty okay hey guys so I have my
vlog camera like propped up on my laptop
so hopefully doesn't fall I just want to
show you guys a few things that I got
today I can't stop buying things it's
kind of an issue but I will show you
okay what - TJ Max and I got something
for the little giveaway I'm gonna do
hopefully I can post that like tomorrow
or the next day it's maybe a holiday
giveaway but it's not gonna be like
Christmasy stuff so I feel like it's
okay if you guys get it after Christmas
but I was in TJ Maxx and I was just kind
of like browsing and I found first of
all I found the Calvin Klein thongs set
in white and black I already have the
black one because I have one I can't I
really can't talk okay I have like the
bralette like the triangle style Brella
and then I got like a black thumb to
match so they had these and I really
like it I get the right size oh my god I
got the wrong size oh my gosh no oh I'm
gonna go have to return this or exchange
it I'm so stupid oh I didn't even look
okay well I got this but I'm gonna have
to go get the new size that's annoying
okay but I also got the bras because I
found a white one and a black one
and these were it was like 20 dollars
for both which was really good and this
was really good as well this was 8.9
dollars for both but I'm gonna have to
go return this hopefully they had I'm in
a small I'm not sure that's so annoying
I always do that okay okay and then I
went to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works like I said
because I act I had a coupon for a free
item with no purchase necessary so I
just got a warm vanilla sugar shower gel
because this is like a really really
good scent I love it
smell it probably like squirt it on
myself yeah it smells super good and
then I just got
a little okay stay I got three of the
little baby pocket back hand sanitizers
I might give one of these away in the
giveaway but I got these because I
always bring them with me to like class
and stuff like in my bag because I feel
like gross my hands and stuff so I got a
winter candy apple a warm vanilla sugar
and a peach Bellini comment down below
which one you would like to get them out
get to the most because that's probably
the one I'm gonna give away but these
are like my favorite and they smell good
like I hate the smell of a normal hand
sanitizer it literally smells like vodka
it grosses me out so I need to get like
good scented ones whenever I get them
okay this is not for me but I figured
I'd show you you guys always ask me
about my hair and what shampoo and stuff
I use and really my conditioner always
switches up with the shampoo I always
use is this Paul Mitchell platinum
blonde shampoo one it keeps my hair from
getting like brassy it keeps it like
bright I'm actually getting my hair done
tomorrow god Bless America because it
looks so bad I told you guys I hope I
did tell you guys but basically I got my
hair done in la la is so expensive for
everything especially hair I got my hair
done I got highlights it was they
charged me more than it said it was like
on their website and then on top of that
it didn't even look very different I
paid two hundred and fifty dollars I
think like around that for highlights
and I could you not say like I still had
roots and I didn't really noticed like
cuz it was dark in the store sorry
doesn't generally notice until I laughed
and I was like oh my god and I know I
should have said something like you guys
to public okay well you should have said
something or you should have said
something about the price but I'm like
really bad at that that's something I
need to work on is like not
confrontation well I'm bad at
confrontation but like in general if I'm
you know saying stuff like that you know
if there's something I don't know
do you guys know what I mean like if I'm
overcharged but like I was it was
probably cuz my hair was like long or
whatever but I'm like bad at like
speaking up with that kind of stuff
but I need to get better anyways long
story short my hair didn't even look
good when I got it done I didn't it was
like okay but I feel like they like
blended the roots more than like
actually highlighting the roots like I
normally got so now my hair is like more
much more like Rudy is that a word and I
think the root to a lot works and they
normally are because I didn't like get
it done how I normally do last time so
yeah I'm getting my hair done tomorrow I
was gonna wait until before I left but
the hairdresser I go to was completely
booked she just happen to have an
opening tomorrow so anyways what I was
saying is I use this I think I want to
go to the gym because I paid for like a
month and I want to get my money's worth
so I'm just gonna like lay in bed for a
little bit but then I'll probably change
and go work out oh my gosh guys I just
got a package from my favorite people
ever adore me I think I'm gonna put this
in like a Christmas haul video or
something cuz this is like a Christmas
gift from them kind of so yeah keep the
pillow pad but yeah I'm gonna open this
I'm excited you guys will have to wait
to see this in a Christmas haul oh wait
guys but I just opened the package a
little bit and look at what the stickers
say bras before Bros I love that okay so
my back to go to the gym I'm wearing my
new Lululemon swiftly top and I'm just
wearing some like black and blue
leggings from Under Armour I left these
at home and I really feel like wearing
any Lululemon's cuz I kind of like don't
like wearing the pants to the gym
because they pill a little bit so yeah
it's gonna be cold I'm kind of dreading
going but gotta do what you gotta do
hey guys okay literally whenever I vlog
here all I can't figure out where my
hand is oh all I'm looking at is my
webkinz I don't know why it's sitting
there but this was my favorite this is
my first webkinz ever her name was Emma
is Emma I was obsessed I was like always
super attached to stuffed animals and
like I still can't get rid of my
favorites anyways I just went to the gym
and I showered and sneak peek I'm
wearing one of the things I got from
adore me I actually
think I'm gonna put them in a hole I'm
filming tomorrow so you guys will see
them sooner but I got like a bunch of
really good stuff and I really like this
pajama set I'm wearing so yeah that's
nice now I think I'm finally going to
clean my room and put my clothes away
finally I mean it's taken me long enough
but I think now is the time it's
literally a disaster like that's
disgusting I hate looking at that so
yeah I think the time has come to do
that okay guys so I pretty much
successfully cleaned my room it's not
like really neat and tidy but I like
fixed up everything and like put stuff
away so I'll finish cleaning and making
it look kind of nice tomorrow I guess
and show you but basically I've just
been laying in bed and watching like
videos like vlog messes and I watched an
episode of the hills oh my god I
literally was watching the ten thousand
calorie challenges of people eating ten
thousand calories in a day and I could
never do it
I like food so much but I can't eat a
lot like I'm so small and I can like
never eat that much so yeah I was
watching that for a while cuz I was like
Billy I wasn't hungry but like I wanted
food I ate cheese it's also but I like
really wanted food so I was watching
like people eat like all this food and
just maybe made me want it even more but
yeah I'm gonna like try what about now
cuz it's like 2:13 a.m. I still haven't
adjusted to the time change I'm probably
not ever going to adjust to me like
whatever um yeah
so thank you guys so much for watching
thumbs up if you like my Pig sheets I
honestly might change them but yeah I
don't know thanks for watching guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
