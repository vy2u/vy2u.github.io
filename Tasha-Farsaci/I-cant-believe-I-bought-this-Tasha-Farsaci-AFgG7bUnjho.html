and piece of me so I should make a big
purchase when I'm with Gretchen so this
is my new little child this is the white
gold love with my band
oh yeah Gretchen is naked so I didn't
want to get to stick one because I have
really small hands and like fingers so
it just looks like a little bit big on
me so I just got the spinner one white
goal because I always wear this ring
that's also white gold and yeah I'm
really excited and it came with
beautiful bag so yeah I mean I don't
spend a lot of money on things a lot so
when I do I really want it so yeah
absolutely I want hit on me for getting
this I'm going to wear it literally
every single day actually I would have
grandma
Tasha's good with her money yeah I like
I really try to save my money like good
things you exceed about four and just
like an investment it's a good idea and
I just like I'm willy-nilly like some
impulse pending and you're not looking
impulsive

it when I spend money on things I try to
make them things that I can wear for
like long time like this jacket yeah I
like in wear this it's like a classic so
