crazy to me that we're already past the
single digits and vlogmas so I pretty
much just woke up and put some makeup on
I got dressed and I think today I'm
gonna go to campus get some studying
done like I said I'm not gonna study a
ton the only final I have left is a
class I'm taking pass no pass and I'm
pretty sure that I could basically not
take the final and pass I'm not gonna do
that obviously but yeah so I'm not too
concerned Oh classic Sirens classic USC
I'm not too concerned but I still want
to study a bit so yeah I just woke up
and brush my teeth and I actually am
working with a toothbrush company for
this video so I want to show you this
before you guys are like Tascha a
toothbrush company like it's actually
super cool so just a second okay so a
company called quip reached out and
asked me if I wanted to collab on a
video you know normally I like probably
wouldn't collab with a toothbrush
company just because that's not like my
main like focus of my videos but lately
I've kind of felt like I've been
neglecting my teeth I don't know like
I'll just come back I'll be too lazy to
brush my teeth brush my teeth so I won't
and then my gums started bleeding and it
was just all like really bad and I felt
bad for my teeth I've never had a cavity
and I don't want to start now so I
looked at the toothbrushes and they were
super cool in like bougie looking and
electric which I've never tried before
and I'm like okay honestly now's the
time like my teeth are probably not
doing too hot so I'm gonna try it out
okay so this is the toothbrush it's so
cute and it's rose gold you can get it
in a bunch of different colors but like
rose gold is so cute and it's just like
sleek looking and yeah it's really nice
it's super affordable it's one of the
most affordable electric toothbrushes on
the market I believe it starts at $25 it
came with a super convenient like cover
and you can like suction cup it to your
mirror as well sometimes I am like
really gross and I can't find a
toothbrush case for traveling it's why
you there like don't bring one and buy
one there or just kind of like put in a
plastic baggie which is super gross so
so this is gonna be really great because
I'll actually be like hygienic with my
toothbrush really it's like a super fan
I feel like all the electric
toothbrushes I've seen I like really
bulky and thick so this one is like
super super nice and like it's not gonna
take up space it's obviously like super
light you turn it on like this and it's
just like starts vibrating I don't even
know if you can hear that but it kind of
goes in like little increments like
it'll like stop to let you know it's
been 30 seconds and it does that for a
thing like two minutes yeah does that
for two minutes because that's how long
I supposed to brush your teeth for and
that's something I used to be really bad
at too it's like not knowing how long to
brush my teeth for and literally just
doing it for like 30 seconds so yeah
this is a super convenient I feel like
this is something that nobody knows that
they need but they really need do you
know what I mean so yeah I have a
specific length of the first 75 people
who order a quip tooth brush can get 15%
off so I will put that down below and if
you order before the 18th you should
give a toothbrush before the holidays so
that is perfect like I said the link
will be in the description okay so I'm
back to head to alpha Fe for lunch today
there are BLTs it's one of my favorites
they're so so good so I'm going to eat
those and then probably at work on
studying guys my current dilemma is that
I lock my bike right here but I can't
see the numbers on the walk from here so
I really like don't know how to unlock
this I'm trying to like reflective
numbers my my camera so I can see but I
can't I can't get in here cuz it's like
a fenced off someone else's house
so I'm like I don't know what to do okay
guys so I just got back from meeting at
Alfea and if you understood what I was
saying and that clip with my bike I'm so
Dom like I just didn't know how bike
locks work and I didn't even think of
when I locked it like that that I
wouldn't be able to see they're like
combination numbers and I think I'm
gonna have to hop a fence it's just like
really awkward because I don't even know
who lives there I think it's a really
really old lady but I haven't seen her
there in a while so I don't know and
their fence is locked I can't just walk
in and I can't knock on the door without
walking in sight honestly might have to
hop their friends which is super sketchy
but if I end up doing that I will be
sure to vlog it because content but yeah
I think I'm gonna open my gift now
boop boop okay please ignore my messy
room it's a disaster so this one feels
really light I think it's gonna be like
jewelry or accessories oh it's a bra lad
this is so cute I actually wanted this
this was in my list as well because I
always like wearing black lacy bra lats
and I just don't have enough J this is
so cute okay it looks like this where is
this from I think it's either from Rubin
or Brandi yes go
you're gonna kill yourself I'm real
worried oh no oh no oh no oh no
your butt's gonna don't it's got too
much jump jump - jump - jump you're fine
various how are you getting back over
though well after all that and I hop the
stupid fence I realized that the gate
literally had a latch I could have just
opened so moral of today is that I'm
stupid but at least I got my bike out
just lock on my bike and I'm about to do
some work on campus
hi guys so I just got back from studying
and I'm I am shook guys this whole time
I thought I was leaving for Paris on
Thursday but my flight is a Wednesday I
think I got confused because I'm getting
to Paris on Thursday so for some reason
I just assumed I guess that I was
leaving Thursday but the flights so long
that I leave Wednesday and I get there
Thursday oh my gosh even a good time
changing stuff so now I'm like oh God
basically I was just looking at the dope
gifts that I have for the rest of the
month until though cuz I got like five
of them sent home because I was planning
on bringing them to Paris but they're
kind of big so I think I'm just gonna
open them all right now and fill my
reactions to all of them and then just
put them in their designated days if
that makes sense because I like just
don't have room and I don't want to pass
the weight limit because I'm packing
those so yeah I'm just gonna like feel
mall I think and then put them in the
corresponding days but yeah Wow okay hey
guys so I'm currently doing laundry and
by doing laundry I mean I'm only
watching the underwear that I need to
pack as well as like the things I wear
all the time like my jeans and like
specific sweatshirts that I always like
wearing I'm washing DOS and then I can
pack for Paris because home girls going
in like a day
surprise um yeah so that's what I'm
doing I'm about to go eat dinner Alfie
obviously I'll put a photo in here
because I know you guys live for those
as do i and then I think I want to go to
the gym so I'm trying to decide if I
want to study then go to the gym and
study more or if I just want to go to
the gym and then come back and study so
yeah I'll figure it out I guess I'll
show you guys what I wore today it's
really not that cute um I don't know if
she was on right now but you guys say
you want to see and I'm it's like really
not cube like whatever so I'm wearing
this like grey little cropped
thing and then I just do on this flannel
recently because it's got kind of cold
out and then I'm wearing these jeans
they're from Zara everyone is asking me
about them because I put them on my
story and I wore my superb us but I'm
not wearing shoes right now
yeah these ones are but I got them a
while ago so I don't know if you could
get them anymore
but yeah it's really not that cute I
thrifted the flannel and the show I
think it's some example or something but
yeah currently on my way to the gym to
avoid studying so yeah I found the good
lighting right here when my gym clothes
people are looking at me weird okay the
hint is to just pretend that your face
timing so that's what I do
but yeah please would be a good workout
there's a lot of like vlogmas videos i
want to watch when i workout so yeah
guys i was literally at the gym for not
even five minutes and they said it
closed which I am like really shocked
because my roommates I was open 24 hours
so now I'm gonna try to go to the others
room that I try to avoid because I
always see people at it but I'm like
already ready to work out so hopefully
that one's open well guys literally both
gyms were closed they closed at 8:00 for
like finals or it was like the holiday
season but literally finals week is not
over for another like two days so that's
ridiculous
I was literally on the Stairmaster for
like three minutes so maybe this is a
sign I'm supposed to study or watch
youtube videos oh my god I just hiccup
okay so it's a bit later I didn't change
out of my gym clothes because I'm still
salty about the gym being closed
no actually I just was too lazy yeah
basically tonight I'm just gonna be
studying for my earthquakes final and I
need to take a shower
so they I'm gonna end off the vlog here
if you guys have any requests or not
requests any suggestions for what I
should do while I'm in Paris please let
me know I mean I know like the obvious
like Eiffel Tower and stuff but I really
don't know a lot of other things so if
any of you guys have been there or even
if you're like studying abroad there's
like restaurants or just anything that
you think I should go to please please
please comment them down below because
I'm sure Lucy will know some places but
I might always love to hear your
recommendations as well so yeah I'm so
excited to go just a little heads up
right now I don't think I'm gonna be
vlogging well I was gonna say I don't
think I'm gonna vlog the day I'm going
to the airport but I'm not going to the
airport until like 4:00 p.m. so we'll
see but if I don't move along from that
day that's why also I'll be in the air
for ten hours there's supposed to be
Wi-Fi but like who really knows about
plain Wi-Fi so anyways thank you guys so
