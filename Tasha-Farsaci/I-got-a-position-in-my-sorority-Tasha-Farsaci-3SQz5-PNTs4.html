nice gift for today this one it's like
pretty heavy so I'm excited let's see oh
my gosh it's a candle lavender yes I
knew I smelled lavender ok lavender is
literally one of my favorite scents this
is so funny because in the air B&amp;amp;B we
were just in they put like lavender
literally it was lavender like in the
rooms and I think they used like
lavender scented detergent and stuff
because it smells so good and I was
talking about how much I love lavender
oh my gosh in my blog yesterday I was
drinking a lavender latte and was saying
how much I love lavender guys this is
weird okay I'm so excited it's so so
good I want to bring this right now this
is just so pretty I think it's probably
a bath and Bodyworks oh thank you guys
I'm so excited
hi guys so I got back from my meeting a
while ago it went the full two hours but
I actually really really enjoy
well didn't like really really enjoy it
wasn't like the best thing I've ever
been to but basically we just kind of
talked about the goals for our positions
and I mean like the marketing sector so
everyone that is in the marketing
positions we all kind of just talked
about how we can work together and what
we want to change or just kind of like
grow for our chapter and it was really
really cool and like inspiring kind of
I'm super excited I've started thinking
about like designs and stuff because um
I don't know like I never really thought
about it but like the apparel and stuff
you wear like puts forth such an image
about the house and it just like makes
the whole sorority look like a lot more
not uniform but just like connect it and
like it shows that you have experienced
stuff and yeah we really just wanted
like a revamp a bunch of stuff so I'm
really really excited
yeah I'm really tired honestly I've just
been kind of chilling watching YouTube
videos I honestly think I'm probably
gonna post made some food I don't know
what I'm just letting myself have but a
lazy kind of rest of my day because my
weekend was so packed full of stuff but
yeah I'll update you guys once I decide
what I'm gonna eat I really want five
guys but I always get five guys and I
just feel like such a lump after that
and also I'm thinking about how I ate
that doughnut earlier and then I pasta
then I'm like I really need five guys I
really want chili or something but I
don't know would it be a Tasha vlog
without my nose turning that probably
not basically I just got so tired all of
a sudden it's not even late at what time
is it it's six twelve I got so tired but
I also post mated food and it should be
coming like any minute so I'm trying to
fall asleep I just ordered
I ordered a sausage and onion rings so
healthy I know from this place nearby
called dog house oh boy guys
I'm gonna feel so fat after this guy's
that food wasn't even good I ended up
like not even eating that much of it it
was pretty cold when I got here which is
annoying because I'm pretty sure post me
it's heart supposed to use like what's
the word I'm looking for anyways like
bags that keeping the heat I know it's
probably a better word for that but
anyways I know they're supposed to use
those and also the place I ordered from
is like right down the street I mean
like maybe like a mile away so I don't
know why it was cold but yeah I guess
it's good that I need that much because
it was like super crazy and like not
good for me when I eat things like that
it makes me want to eat healthier hey
guys so I'm back it's been a while
basically i body showered took off my
makeup did some work for dote and now
