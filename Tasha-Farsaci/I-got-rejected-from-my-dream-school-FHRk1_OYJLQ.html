take your new name Tasha
welcome so this video is super
spontaneous I literally thought about
this well I've been thinking about the
topic all weekend but I thought about
this idea of me actually filming a video
last night at like 3:30 a.m. when I
couldn't sleep if you guys have been
following me for a while you might
already know about what I'm gonna talk
about in this video but if you guys are
someone new to my channel you may not
know or if you have no idea who I am you
definitely won't know I still want to
make this because I really thought that
it could help some people so basically
the inspiration of this video was just
this weekend
USC released their admission decisions
for the 2022 graduating class I believe
and I know this because USC was posting
everywhere saying like oh this is the
most selective class yet like most
applicants ever basically like how it is
every year and I do attend the
University of Southern California in
case you guys don't know I saw people
that go here posting that their siblings
got in and they're like what not so I
knew that admission decisions had been
released so that made me think of when I
got my mission decision to USC
three years ago and but it's heard of
this video you may or may not know what
happened but you also might be confused
because I go to USC so I want to talk
about my experience getting rejected
from my dream school and I thought that
this could help you guys because I
actually posted an Instagram story this
weekend
I'll insert it here it was kind of like
funny joking but also I was like oh this
might you know make a few people smile
and I got so many gems from you guys
being like thank you so much for this
like this helped me so much and I'm like
oh my gosh if I can post one story and
help these people imagine if I just
posted a video so here we are yeah so
this video is not going to be all the
details of what went down
in my whole College Admission transfer
process I have videos about that that
are way more in-depth with a lots more
details so I will link them all down
below this is just going to be more of
like an inspirational like there's hope
video by the way if you guys don't
follow me on instagram you should if you
want to keep up with my life all right
so let's backtrack to me my freshman
year of high school I was already
looking into colleges because I grew up
in a small suburb of Syracuse New York
which is upstate New York about five
hours from New York City about five
hours from most major cities you know
Boston Toronto etc better in the area I
just didn't I didn't like it um I'd
always been a girl that loved the city
that loved you know when there was tons
to do and just like lots of people and
lots of things going on and for me I
just didn't get that in my hometown I
was so excited for college because for
me it meant that I could move somewhere
completely different from where I grew
up kind of just start fresh or just kind
of branch out and do new and different
things so when I was searching for
college I wanted to be in a big city
that was kind of far from where I was
better whether that brought me to LA but
I'd always worked super hard in school
my grades are really important to me and
I wanted to attend a university that was
rigorous and difficult to get into
because I still wanted to keep that
level of academic rigor so when I came
across USC I was like holy like
this is everything I've ever wanted in
the school so yeah at the time I think
USC accepted their acceptance rate was
around 18 percent now it's currently
twelve point nine percent but at the
time when I applied to USC as I got to
be like a senior in high school but not
my grades my test scores were all right
in there accepted range like if this was
their accepted range I was right in the
middle the average of all accepted
students so I was like all right I think
I'm chilling like I think I'll be fine
I had extracurriculars I can't even
sneak extracurriculars I still did
YouTube back in the day so I
my essay my common app essay gosh guys
it's been so long uh about my YouTube
channel and I just really thought I had
a good shot I didn't want to see a good
shot because I thought I was in I
thought I was fine and yeah I mean I
think you can be a little naive like
that and when you have your heart set on
something so much and that's all you
want it's like oh it's you know don't
even think about if you didn't get in
cuz you don't wanna be negative about it
you know I will never forget I had been
how was that website's name there was
like an online forum for like college
admissions I can't think of the name
right now but I'll figure it out I'll
put on the screen and I had been
stalking the USC admissions a little
like sub thread of that website from
once I was waiting for any update from
anyone then it finally got to the point
where people were like okay I think
admission decisions are coming out soon
I don't know if USC still does this they
probably do they send out acceptance
packets before they up the your
admission decision online so if you're
accepted you will get the packet before
you will get the online notification
sirens so this was torture for me
because I was expecting that acceptance
packet and I lived all the way across
the country so people were posting that
they were getting it in California and I
was like oh gosh where's mine
and then like a few days passed and I
still didn't get it in the mail and I
was kind of like alright this is kind of
weird I'll never forget I was walking to
my bus stop because I took the bus
senior year and I was like you know what
I'm just gonna check my USC portal why I
thought this was a good idea like I
don't know right before school but once
again I really thought I was getting in
anyways so I literally never forgot I
opened that portal and it was my
rejection letter and it was honestly
like I I couldn't even cry because I was
just like so shocked I was like am I
dreaming is this this has to be fake
like what's wrong and I remember my
parents wouldn't let me go home
Dave parents if you're watching this you
probably are thanks a lot because that
was the most painful day of my existence
but I went to school all day and
everyone was asking me like have you
heard back from USC I haven't heard back
and I just like I would like break down
crying in school and I hate crying in
front of people so that's when you know
I was really upset and it was just
honestly one of the worst days when
there's something that you've planned
for for so long
and to just have it be like taken away
from you like that
it's so insane so honestly for the next
like week two weeks I was just so like
shaken up and shocked and I felt so
empty inside because I just felt like
this is all I wanted and I just like
didn't have it so guys if you're going
through this right now which I ain't
know a lot of you probably are it's so
common to knock it into your dream
school schools are getting so so hard to
get into like I got rejected from USC
then I would have gotten like double
rejected if I tried to go now like it's
getting so hard and I'm sure that's the
same for all schools so anyways I know
how awful it is I know how much it sucks
watching your friends get into the
school you wanted to get into or getting
into their dating schools and being
super excited and you not knowing what
to do
not wanting to settle cut to the chase
so I ended up choosing Loyola Marymount
University I'm not going to talk about
this too much because I have videos like
all about this LMU is also in LA it's
about like 20 minutes from USC it's
actually a better part of LA so go LMU
but anyway like telling you my freshman
year going into it I didn't have the
intention of transferring because I
hasn't been sure a lot of you guys
probably feel I didn't want to transfer
I'm like I want to start now like I want
to have my college experience I want to
love it now I don't want to have to like
start over and transfer like I don't
want to do that so I was pushing and
pushing myself to love LMU you know I
was buying all the LMU apparel I like
decorated my grad cap I was super
excited
I like found my roommate online shoutout
Danielle hey
and yeah I was really you know putting
all the excitement that I could into all
of you
long story short I go to LMU I like it I
make some really good friends but still
not what I wanted I had visited some
people at USC and I was just like it's
like everything I had ever wanted was
still there so I made the decision to
apply to transfer I worked my ass off
okay I ended up with a 3.9 GPA at LMU
which I thought was good especially as a
freshman I didn't know what was going on
but I ended up with a 3.9 GPA applied to
transfer in February dig here back until
July so all that time the waiting I was
on that stupid college forum thing again
like like trying to see if anyone was
posting anything so I was it's probably
clear now I was accepted as a transfer
but it's a spring eminent transfer so I
couldn't start a USC until the sophomore
year no yes
second semester of my sophomore year now
I am a second semester junior so I have
been here a year honestly it's the best
decision I could have made I'm not gonna
lie to you and say that transferring was
easy it was so hard
however being here I haven't ever been
happier there's not one school I would
want to go to instead of being here and
I just want to let you guys know that if
you got rejected from your dream school
or you know anything in life anything
that you really really wanted and you
feel like great I can never have that I
guess it depends on the situation but in
terms of colleges you really should
never give up and if you want something
bad enough there is a good chance that
you can still get it I'm not gonna
guarantee that you will be able to
transfer into your dream school I
probably almost didn't get in
considering I was given spring admission
rather than fall but I did and even if I
hadn't gotten into USC I would not have
regretted trying because you never know
you know what I mean it's better to try
then you never try it all I feel like
that's the lamest generic
seriously though don't give up hope but
don't go into your freshman year at your
second choice or third choice or
whatever school just thinking oh I'm
gonna transfer because you never know
you might love that school you go to you
know you might end up transferring and
not like your dream school you know what
I need yeah so honestly what I want to
say is don't lose hope but also give
whatever you're doing a shot you know
give it all you've got
try your hardest to that if you know you
give it all you've got and you decide
you do want to try and transfer the
grades are there you know what I mean I
know you guys are probably gonna ask if
I recommend trying to go to a community
college rather than a four-year
university to make it easier to keep the
grades up to transfer and that's totally
up to you if you guys only think the
only school you're gonna want to go to
is the school you didn't get into then
maybe that's worth it for you but if you
want to test it out at maybe your second
or third choice school test it out you
know try your hardest see if you can
transfer like I'm not gonna tell you
guys what to do but I think you know how
badly you want something I believe in
you guys I know you guys are all smart
and talented and capable and you all
deserve to be happy and I think College
is amazing and you want to be somewhere
you love but don't put all of your eggs
in one basket and if things don't go
exactly away I just don't give up so I
think that's pretty much the gist of it
I hope you guys didn't hear all this
from me before hopefully some of you
guys are new to my channel or new to
this story like I said if you guys do
have questions about my experience make
sure you watch the videos I'm gonna link
down below but if they still haven't
answered your questions feel free to
leave them in the comments here and I
will try and answer or if you guys are
browsing the comments and you feel like
you can answer them totally do feel free
to just start like a big discussion in
my comment section like it's a community
here college admissions are so freakin
stressful this was just sitting on my
nightstand and I feel like I should put
this on for the remainder just cuz it's
accurate I'll give you guys I know how
it feels and I love you all right bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
