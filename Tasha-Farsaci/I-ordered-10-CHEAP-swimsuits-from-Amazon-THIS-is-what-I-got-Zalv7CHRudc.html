today I am doing a super fun video that
I've been really excited to do for a
while now so today I'm coming to you
with a little cheap Amazon swimsuit haul
I wanted to do a video like this for a
while and I figured I would do Amazon
because all the bathing suits that I
ordered are from Amazon Prime so I got
them all within one to two days which is
perfect because I know a lot of times
when you're shopping online for cheap
swimsuits the shipping can take weeks to
months and nobody wants that especially
now that it's swimsuit season so like I
said all those swimsuits that I chose
had prime available so they came to me
like I said in one or two days okay
before I get into showing you guys the
swimsuits if you are new to my channel
it would mean so much to me if you guys
would subscribe I do all types of videos
fashion beauty lifestyle all that kind
of stuff so if you're interested please
subscribe and if you guys really like me
and want to follow me on Instagram it's
a great place to keep up with my life
and see my outfits and my friends I'll
probably post some pics in these bikinis
if you guys are interested it's just at
Tasha I'll have it here on the screen as
well as my other handles down below in
the description okay so if you guys
don't know me you wouldn't know that I'm
obsessed with swimsuits probably my
guilty pleasure is buying swimsuits and
I normally do buy pricier swimsuits just
because I'm really picky about the
designs of swimsuits and once I started
getting more expensive ones I was kind
of like snobby toward material of
cheaper swimsuits but obviously
swimsuits aren't the most press
practical sorry practical thing to spend
money on for me I do live in Los Angeles
so I can kind of wear them year-round so
I kind of justify it that way but I know
for most people you don't want to be
spending a lot of money on swimsuits so
that's why I chose these ones from
Amazon they were all under $20 but what
I'm trying to get out of this is that
I'm really picky with swimsuits so what
I'm showing you these and what I'm
saying how I feel about them know that
I'm being honest and picky so if you
guys are also thinking about swim
so you kind of know what I'm going off
of I'm gonna start off with my favorite
suits I did open all of these I haven't
tried them on yet but I've looked at
them all so I'm gonna start with my
favorites just based on the quality and
the look okay so I think this swimsuit
might be my favorite I absolutely love
the color of it it looks like this it
has kind of like a smocked look to it
but I love this like burgundy raspberry
color and the quality on this is pretty
good for the price for sure it has
padding that you can remove I prefer
cheeky bottoms I think they are the most
flattering and a lot of the bottoms I
got are also high rise that's like the
trend right now so the bottoms are
cheeky high cut the quality on these is
not that great as you can see like I
don't know I feel like this looks a
little bit weird for the price I think
it's pretty cute so I like the top more
than the bottoms but I really like the
color and I think it's pretty trendy for
now okay this is what I'm actually
really impressed with I think it's super
cute so I've been loving like the bando
top style swimsuits I think they're
really cute and I have really small
boobs so I can kind of just get away
with wearing most styles of tops so this
one is kind of like a gingham looking
top it has a pass in it I might take
them out depending on how it looks on
and then the bottoms are just these
little tired string bottoms which I like
a lot so I do really like this one
actually it's like ruched as well okay
this is from sue that I've been seeing
around a lot it's that ribbed material
that I believe Franky's bikinis kind of
started with swimwear this photo also
came in like an orange and a yellow
color but I wanted to go for the white
just because I don't really have a lot
of white swimsuits so it looks like this
it's like a ribbed little top I think
this is actually really cute and the
quality is really nice for the price I
think you could even wear this as a
little top maybe with like a super
high-waisted skirt this could be cute
and then the bottoms look like this
they're also ribbed really cute
hopefully these don't go see-through in
water I'm unsure about that but I did
choose white so yeah these also seem to
be
pretty good quality once again for the
price like nothing is gonna be
spectacular quality but under $20 in
free shipping and superfast shipping
this is definitely good okay this next
one soon is another one that I've seen
around a lot and I am impressed with
this one as well so it's this tube top
and it has like this cheetah print
design going on it has some like loose
threading around the bottom but nothing
you can't just snip off this one also
has padding which i think is necessary
because this material is kind of thin
very nice high cut cheeky bottom and
they are double line so they just have
or their seamless if maybe that's the
way I'm looking for but they have the
same material on the inside and out
which I really like in a bathing suit I
think it makes it look more expensive
okay next suit is another Ramsey
material I really like the color of this
one it's just a classic triangle style
top I'm kind of confused about what's
going on here and she'll figure it out
I'm sure but I'll have to look at the
picture they have some like something
goes on in the back oh thank you but
it's a really pretty just baby blue
ribbed top the quality looks pretty good
the bottoms could be see-through in
water maybe but maybe not
I don't know but they look like this and
then this swimsuit I like it has these
like little beads on the end which I
feel like makes it look a little more
expensive okay this fin suit isn't a
style that I've wanted to try for a
while I didn't know if it would look
good on small boobs so I want to try it
out with an affordable option but it's
this super popular style top where it
has like the underwire that looks like
this I don't really know how to explain
it I think a quality on this is really
really nice I think it looks more
expensive than it is overall I tried
this top on I don't love how it fits but
I think that's just because of my body
type not because of the suit in general
but I think the quality is really good
and if you want to try out like a trendy
style swimsuit like this I would
recommend it for
I'm not as impressed with the bottoms as
I am at the top but they're not bad so
yeah okay now I'm gonna move in to these
swimsuits that aren't necessarily my
favorite but I don't hate them I'm gonna
start off with this yellow one I've
really been liking yellow but for some
this yellow is a bit too much for me I
don't know if they look the same online
I'm just like blind but it's a little
bit a little bit too much I don't know
the top looks like this I thought it
looked really pretty on the model it was
like a square neckline top it looked
really flattering but I think I might
have to small the chest for this to look
flattering I think it might look like a
sports bra but we'll see the quality is
not bad it's not a bad swimsuit and in
the bottoms these look like they're
gonna be really really big and long like
almost too high cut like I need a bikini
wax ASAP before I can wear this it looks
it looks like the picture it's not
horrible but I just I feel like this is
gonna be a weird fit for me okay next up
is another white swimsuit the quality on
this one is actually a nice but it's
kind of like the same as the last one
where I think the top is just gonna be
too big and unflattering on me it looks
like this it's kind of like that smock
material like others I've shown you and
then the bottom is once again they look
so long to me like I know it's supposed
to be high cut but I just I am nervous I
gotta know they're obnoxious yellow suit
yeah and I got this one because it
looked like a dupe of this blue life
suit I have I'll insert a picture of me
wearing it here it's really really cute
and flattering so I wanted to test out a
dupe I don't know you really can't even
see what it looks like
unless I'm trying it on but its
materials pretty pretty thin I feel like
it's gonna be really unflattering on my
butt but it's not horrible it's not
horrible and if it looks cute on it
might be cute for like photos you know
okay and the last suit I have to show
you I've wanted for a really long time I
believe the original is by
Mariya swimwear or something like that
but I never ordered it just because I
didn't know how would look on me so this
one had a lot of good reviews on Amazon
but for me it just doesn't look like
it's good quality at all so I'll insert
a photo of what it's supposed to look
like we probably seen this around so
first of all I got it in this blue color
and the material feels not like sweating
so much it really feels like a cotton
shirt almost but a little bit more silky
okay it's kind polyester and spandex
apparently the stitching is just not the
best it seems really really thin once
again this is just definitely a suit for
pictures if it looks good the back looks
kind of sloppily stitched but yeah this
had a good review so maybe it'll look
cool on yeah I don't know reviewers seem
to like this one so maybe I'm being too
picky um but yeah I would not recommend
wearing us in the water
who knows maybe it'll look great on ya
so those are all the swimsuits I ordered
from Amazon I'm actually pretty
impressed with them considering they're
all under $20 that's a really really
good price for swimsuits comment down
below and let me know what your favorite
swimsuit is and what your favorite
swimwear brands are because I'm always
looking to try new ones out as always
thank you guys so much for watching and
stay tuned for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
