face / my eyes if they're watering I
woke up a little bit ago um yeah no
makeup on so me with no makeup um I'm
gonna work out which is why I'm in
workout clothes but I just going to eat
some breakfast first
I think I'm gonna eat cereal comment
down below and tell me what your
favorite cereal is because I love cereal
like who doesn't like cereal if you
don't like cereal also comment down
below because I'm curious but today I
actually have a lot to do because I kept
forgetting okay wait my back track so I
told you I only have classes on Tuesday
Thursdays so normally I procrastinate
and leave most of my homework to Monday
and I just realized that bun day I have
USC orientation and for transfer
students or spring in bits spring
advance I don't know I get confused cuz
I'm both um yeah I keep forgetting so
like I better not forget to go to that
because that's where I scheduled my
classes and everything and that's like
an all-day occurrence oh I can't
procrastinate to ban so I need to do
work today I have an exam on Tuesday and
bio so I need to study for that and then
I have to finish my research paper that
I was supposed to finish the last time I
was at a coffee shop in a blog but I
didn't sighs I'm on chopping um I also
want to clean my room cuz it's like a
disaster um and then also my roommate
Emily and I want to go get piercings
later um I don't know I'm gonna actually
end up getting something just because
like I'm really I like doing what I want
to get and I like to kind of plan it out
and not just like go spontaneously do it
but we will see so that's at like 4:30
she wants to go so I need to like thank
you my out and like try and get
stuff done but I do really need to work
out because I haven't worked out in so
long and I like bathing suits and
bikinis too much to not work out if that
makes sense we I do want to show you the
new bathing suits that I got okay so I
just kind of like put them on my bed
these are both in Frankie's bikinis I've
mentioned before that's like my fate of
it favorite bathing suit brand so just
like pricey so when I saw the cyber
monday sales for these puppies I got so
excited okay so this is the piece this
is the pattern I got this one it's the
Marley top it's like high neck I'm like
not even putting this in the screen and
the back is super strappy and then I
like the bottoms on these they're like
cheeky but not not like song really
cheeky in my opinion some people might
think that song like so I got that one
and then I got this top it's like the
Harlow top the floral one it has like
you know the halter neck and then the
bottoms for these ones do you have a
little more coverage so if you're more
like into that um there's the bottoms
for these I love Frankie's so much I
want some from their new collection so
badly but my bathing suit drawer oh my
god let me show you guys um I have like
so many it's like it's bad yeah so I I
don't need any but I love them so much
I'll like try and like these down below
I feel like a lot of them are going to
be sold out just cuz there was such a
good sale for Cyber Monday but yeah I
brought my cereal in my room so I could
vlog without waking up any of my
roommates because the walls you're
literally so thin so I'm eating frosted
mini-wheats
to any of you guys like these I just
feel like this would be the cereal and
no one likes but for some reason I like
it but in order for me to eat it they
have to get really soggy like I feel
like that's super gross but that's the
only way I like them so I let them sit
in the milk for a while if you guys are
the same way let me know because I feel
like that's super weird of me so I just
got back from the gym and showered and
are about to clean my toilet and I've
never clean a toilet before so this will
be interesting
I would vlog that but that's probably
gross so I'm not going to but wish me
look I just made myself this wonderful
meal although I've never cooked chicken
before so if this is where I died thank
you for watching
okay so the Lighting's like really blue
I'm sorry I think I'm gonna go study now
um I'm wearing this outfit that I don't
really like but I don't know what else
to wear I'm just wearing this brown top
it was in my most recent haul video and
then these black boyfriend jeans from LF
the only thing is they got really big
and I don't know if I like lost weight
or what because these definitely like
used to fit and now they're like a
little bit too big so they're like
falling off me and I also don't really
know what shoes to wear with this outfit
so whatever I guess it doesn't
obviously going downstairs so one of the
study rooms to study hopefully they're
not too full because it's Sunday so they
might be really full but yeah I don't
know we shall see and then I'm
definitely going with Emily to get
piercings later who knows what I will
end up getting but I know I'm definitely
going with her so that will be fun
am I good am I in the middle yeah I
think you're good getting piercings
maybe possibly yeah probably
okay I wasn't hungry but I'd to get the
sweet potato fries came to a vegan
restaurant or any of us vegan know
hastin that was me I'm gonna do a nice
legs a slow zoom on it it looks pretty
good though I'll just leave and I'll try
to speed
right
good okay Wow word YUM oh yeah because
the way at the piercing place was like
45 minutes so we waiting
I never got ya
I feel like I decide I decided it hi
guys so I'm back I don't know why my
nose is so bad right now
sometimes only get like really warm my
nose just gets bright red but like this
is insane I also really hate my nose so
I hate when this happens to like draw
the tension to it but basically I got a
piercing I got three piercings like what
the heck because I've been wanting this
for a while and before I show you I kind
of want it I like how it turned out but
I kind of wish that the the stones were
a little bit smaller but I think he had
to pierce it the way he did just because
if you pierce with too small of a gem it
might like go right through so this is
what it looks like I don't know how well
you can see it but it's basically like
three right here I think once it heals
I'm gonna try and like move this one
down and this one down and then I get a
smaller one because it is a little bit
bigger like the stone do a little bit
bigger than I wanted but I still really
like how it turned out and I was really
nervous to get it cuz I didn't you know
it's like hard to align that oh my god I
keep looking my nose what the heck it's
like so warm so strange I just like hold
it anyways like I was just nervous that
it wouldn't be like aligned how I wanted
it or spaced how I wanted it but I'm
really happy with how that turned out um
I have so many piercings know I need to
stop but it's like so addicting like I
love them I don't get tattoos but I get
piercings so yeah I'm gonna end off the
blog my roommate Emily got her tragus
peers which is this little guy that I
have today and I'll put the name of the
place you went to here I don't exactly
remember it offhand but the guy who did
my piercing was named James and yeah so
that's going to end for this vlog this
thank you guys so much for watching I
love you guys so much and stay tuned for
tomorrow's longest vlog is what progress
