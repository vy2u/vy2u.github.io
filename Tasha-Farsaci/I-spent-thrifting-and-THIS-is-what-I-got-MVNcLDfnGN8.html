you guys can tell I am in my car which
means I am home in upstate New York and
my favorite videos to do when I'm home
is a thrifting video because I really
like surfing I'm home I feel like in LA
so many people thrift and they know what
to look for when thrifting so the stores
are really really picked over but here
in upstate New York I feel like not a
lot of people thrift or at least people
that aren't looking for the same things
that I am so I'm usually pretty
successful so I've already flipped it a
few times since I've been home and I
have some stuff to show you but I'm also
gifting again today with my best friend
Mel so I wanted to film with her with me
also I literally parked in a parking lot
by a park near my house because I was
trying to find a quiet place with good
lighting I'm still next to her hood so
some cars are still driving by but I
really wanted to film in my car for the
whole like car vlog feel anyways so I'm
about to go pick up Melanie and we will
vlog at the thrift store and show what
we got but I also have some clips from
when I've been 15 on my own since I've
been home so I'll be throwing those in
and then I'm also going to show you what
I got on my own as well at the end of
this video so stay tuned for that and
without further ado let's go hey guys
hey guys so I was really hungry because
I forgot to eat this morning and I was
like where can we go and there was only
one magical place that we could go
because they just put one in here oh my
god of course this car goes by
yes and goodwill is right across the
street so let's go make sure to get the
details
for trying the grilled nuggets for the
first time and then some regular Nuggets
Riggins
we tried the grilled one on camera
try dip it yeah
good okay so I got a frosted lemonade at
chick-fil-a cuz I wanted a milkshake but
then I walked in there and I saw
lemonade and I was like oh it would be
good and I thought of Frost if I might
would be like a lemonade slushy but this
is like a milkshake that's lemon
flavored and I don't know how I feel and
I also maybe they just gave you the
wrong thing no it's definitely like I
don't always weird to me that orders are
small I got a large charge a for a large
things are unwell I'm also getting sick
but it's good real-time so what are you
looking to find hmm I mean probably
genius as usual per usual
yeah but I'm looking well I told you
guys how I've been looking for cargo
pants in a little boy section so I'm
gonna continue with that and I'm also
I've always been open these people I
like what is she doing yeah I'm also
always looking for some nice some nice
sweatshirts to cut into crops so they're
probably the same all right let's go
mmm Nebraska whoo
I'm pretty sure I own this exact flannel
from thrifting
coincidence I think not actually didn't
find a lot only found these like two
things and then I found these two skinny
belt touch Oh cute there's like a snake
go on and I read one not really sure if
when I get these I'll probably try them
on and see but yeah slim pickins okay so
I think this is what it was really
really cute and it's only like two
dollars cause it's half off but I live
in LA so I don't really know if I need
this thing of a swagger also it's really
big on me so this is like a dress more
so I kind of think it's cute so it's
only two dollars I might just get it
okay these are the only cargo pants I
was able to find and they're so low-rise
I'm not a fan yeah this is what this
belt looks like I didn't put it through
the belt loops cuz I was been raised but
yeah I think it's really cute so just
tie it in the back and it's cute
yeah I slip on this beret which my
friend got me marine it's navy blue but
I think I can also wear the black a lot
but not trying that on for obvious
reasons okay so these are a little boy
shorts and obviously don't not have them
as Bermudas but I like them because
they're guests so they do get these I
would put them into your regular choice
but they're a little big but I do really
like the pocket I found these like a
boy's cargo pants I just wish that they
were like a little more craft like this
because I feel like they're swallowing
a bit but the idea is there so this top
is super pretty
as you can see it's all beaded I'm just
not like crazy about the fit it should
be like tighter up here I just don't
have it zipped up all the way but this
is only three dollars which is so easy
for this if it was like a cropped fit I
think I'd be really pretty but it's not
but I just wanted to show you anyway
okay guys so basically we went to one
other web store and I completely struck
out today like I just failed so luckily
I'm gonna be showing you the stuff I got
the other times I went but I could get
one thing I showed you it in the
dressing room I just got this little
snake print felt it was like $2 and I
thought it could be cute with some
counterfeit high-waisted bottoms and a
crop top or like a bodysuit so that's
all I got no no take over the floor hug
okay well as I showed in the dresser I
found just a plain black beret which
were like in style
since I'd be hearing look so bad in them
but I like them I really like that's a
thing and then I found this like large
acquainted square scarf yeah I plan on
wearing as like a top down scarf
dinah the other first one went to Tasha
from the Czar's
and then I got these like kind of like a
little bit of a wide leg pant so let us
know if you want us to do more video
I mean I guess I'm leaving in a week but
if you want us to vlog in New York City
comment down below and then thumbs up
people's comments about what you want us
to do in New York or what you want to
Sablan about and leave suggestions on
what we should do in New York we've been
there before nothing like anything okay
so now I want to show you guys the stuff
that I've kind of accumulated on my own
15 since I've been home so I'm just
gonna go right into it I guess I'll
start with flannels because you guys
know flannels are one of my favorite
things to get at their stores this is
where I get the majority of my flannels
because I like nice thick quality
flannels so the first one is this like
burgundy flannel I also really like this
one because it has some like ABS techy
patterns and I don't know if you can see
that but I just thought it was cool and
I really like the colors a lot so I
grabbed this one okay this flannel is a
lot brighter than I would normally go I
typically stick to more like muted
dark-colored flannels but this one was
such a thick warm material I couldn't
pass it up
it looks like this and yeah it's just a
flannel okay as you can tell by the
shirt I'm wearing which is also thrifted
I wore it and honored with this video I
really like getting soda shirts and
cutting that into crop tops or tying
them into crop tops or something like
that so I found two more or a few more
just like t-shirts that I like and I
think would be cute cut so first I found
this Dr Pepper shirt this one is by the
brand junk food which is a really nice
soft material and the back says I'm a
pepper which i think is kind of cute but
this one I think looks really cute tied
in a knot
I found another coca-cola shirt these
ones are my favorites and I love coke
so this one is gray I had to pick this
one up I'll probably cut this one as
well okay this is not a soda this is a
beer but you guys have probably seen
everyone rhinos Budweiser shirts I have
one I don't like beer personally
I think it's kind of a cute look so I
guess I'm a poser but I found this
Miller Lite
sure this is a 2x immense 2x so way too
big for me but I'm gonna cut it into
like a boxy crop top so I found this
okay and then this top I feel like is
going with the whole race car trend
theme that's been going on lately so
this is a Budweiser sponsored racing
shirt and I'm planning on cutting it
into a crop top right under the
Budweiser logo and these are all found
in the men's section I don't even look
in the women's very often because I
don't like it as much so I always look
in the men's okay ask for sweatshirts
this one is kind of dingy but it was
half off so it was only two dollars so I
got it I'm definitely gonna cut this
into a crop it's just a Dartmouth crew
neck like I said it's kind of pilled but
I really like the color but yeah I'm
gonna cut this into a nice cropped
hoodie or not hoodie crewneck these are
still wet
I told knowing I was coming and I've
been kind of drive around to find a
place to film for so long and she's
probably like Tasha what the heck are
you doing okay so something else I
really love is vintage college crew
necks I've found a few for USC not
thrifting I found them on like eBay or
Poshmark but somehow in my swifting
endeavors here in Syracuse I found to
Syracuse University vintage ones so yeah
I think they're super cool the first one
looks like this okay and the next one I
found is kind of similar but also kind
of different it looks like this this one
has like an embroidered on patch which i
think is really cute so yeah I wish
these were USC but gotta wrap the
hometown so these are really cool okay
this next thing is kind of funny but all
of my fellow I'm kind of sick
I thought it was pulling in heroes but
they had a cow so I've been going into
the little boy's pant section and I've
been looking at their cargo pants
because I've really wanted a pair of the
camo cargo pants that are trendy right
now but I'm too short for the women's to
fit me right and all the little boys
pants I feel weird saying little boys
but whatever all the pants fit me
high-rise which is what I want so I've
been kind of scoping out those sections
I haven't really found a perfect pair
yet but I did found these ones which are
more like a jogger guys these are
literally from the children's place
so don't discriminate based on tags
there are little voice in the children's
place honestly these are like slightly
tight in my butt but so they look like
this these aren't like cargo II like
they don't have pockets but they're
still like a little jogger so these fit
me like nice ankle pants and they have
little pockets in the back yeah I was
happy about this but I'm still looking
for a nice cargo pant also from the
little boy section I found this pair of
shorts now I'm not into the whole
Bermuda short trend so I am going to cut
these don't worry but I got these
because they are guests and they have
the cute little guest logo on the pocket
I really like that so I'm gonna cut
these like I said into some shorter
shorts okay and the last thing that I've
gotten on my own is a really really cool
find it's this big denim jacket and it
has some like House of Blues embroidery
on the back as well as on the front here
but this is really really big so it's
definitely really really oversized on me
but it's still like a really really cool
find and I think it's honestly like
really trendy for now I just said really
like 50 times but yeah yeah so that is
this video if you guys are interested in
any of these pieces I might be selling
some on my Poshmark I know a lot of
people think that's shady or sketchy
personally I don't think of it as being
weird
mainly because so many vintage stores
will go to thrift shops buy stuff for
cheap and then resell it from super
expensive and when I resell things I
don't resell them for really really
expensive
so I don't think it's weird Home Rule
has got to make money somehow
and I do keep a lot of things but if I'm
not gonna wear stuff and you guys are
interested I am selling some of my
Poshmark most likely so I will link my
Poshmark down below yeah so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video let me know if
you want more thrifting videos I will
definitely do them and I love you guys
so much thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
