new color um it's blogged again I know I
said I probably wasn't gonna go back
blonde for a while but I change mine not
because I didn't like the brown mostly
because I wanted to wait for the summer
and especially in the summer I wash my
hair like every single day because I get
really sweaty and if I had my hair dark
brown again it would fade out in like a
month so yeah I just went in got some
highlights got like four inches off just
because my hand was getting a little bit
too long so so basically I just got some
the highlights um I didn't want it super
blonde or anything I'm just kind of
natural so I left like my base of brown
and she just highlighted it um in like
it's not really highlight underneath see
this is like what was the stick my
natural hair color but I just got some
highlights through it I didn't want you
know really blonde or anything I got a
quite a bit of hair off it was down to
like here so yeah I mean I'm fine with
it though because it was really long and
I also besting like angles in the front
like shorter layers and stuff just to
give myself a little bit more something
I know I've been really slacking on
making videos I suck but I have been so
busy lately I just did my AP exam which
was AP World History bombat Wow any of
you guys took that I'm so sorry how did
you feel I felt pretty bad about that
but I suck at social studies in global
and everything like I didn't know where
Portugal was into like a week ago I'm
not stupid it's just when it comes to
that who I have like two weeks left of
school to real weeks and then after that
I have two more weeks of finals and
regents if you guys don't live in New
York you probably don't know what a
region says it's basically a final exam
that's administered by the state so they
really suck and I have a chemistry
Regents algebra two and trig regions and
a global history regents oh that one is
going to be hard of me to get a good
grade on but yeah I have three of those
and then I have a spanish final exam
but I have to go back for him so it's
gonna suck but yes I really didn't have
anything to say in this blog not that I
can think of um yeah I really don't know
