happy vlogmas day 16 basically the
reason I haven't done in Flores I didn't
stop doing it
but before I started vlog - I told you
guys I don't think I'm gonna vlog every
single day just because school stuff and
studying I might be like really busy
things might get boring and then I was
longing every day so I kind of thought
I'd be able to vlog every day and then I
just got like I got too busy with
studying and I just like stopped vlogmas
but now as you can probably tell by the
background and out my window I'm home
it's so cold and snowy I think it's like
15 degrees out right now I'm like happy
to be home but at the same time not so
happy to be home
but anyways look at my shirt I'm about
to film a video for society6 and I got
this from theirs you'll see it in there
but yeah today it's gonna be really
really chill I woke up at 2 p.m. because
of the time difference and like I got no
sleep the night before so it's already
like I don't even know it's already kind
of late see I need to film this video
and then I'm just gonna be like hanging
out I guess
so yeah welcome back to vlogmas ok so I
just filmed and edited my video and now
I'm gonna like try and upload it but
it's so dark out look at that it makes
me so depressed when the weather is like
cold and gray like this but it's okay so
I guess I'll time to kind of tell you
what like the airport yesterday I flew
in United and United just like is not my
favorite Airport airline I don't know I
like Delta Rochin and JetBlue the best I
just feel like United as crusty I don't
know like LAX the terminal is outside
because it's like under construction but
it's been like that for like over a year
I'm not even kidding just like all the
people were kind of rude to me I don't
know I just like not my favorite
Airlines whatever I was flying that and
then I was flying into Chicago V flowers
flying into Syracuse and my layover was
like not even 50 minutes like more like
40 minutes and my plane was a little bit
late and basically since Chicago was
such a big Airport I had to take a
shuttle from the terminal I was in to a
different terminal and like when I got
off the plane was when the other place
was boarding so I like barely made it so
that was a struggle but I'm here I'm
home now like I said this lager is
probably to be so boring cuz I'm little
just talking but I feel bad cuz you guys
were like asking me like where vlogmas
was and like I didn't think that many
people would like miss it you know what
I mean like I didn't think people would
really notice that I wasn't posting
because like so many people do blog miss
but you guys have been asking so that
makes me happy so I figured I would just
post this even if it's gonna be like a
really really short I still have to
unpack all my stuff but I literally hate
unpacking more than I hate packing which
is a lot cuz I hate that and don't mind
the fan my laptop is like exploring my
video so yeah oh my gosh guys look at
this
I always forget what my room looks like
when I come back and like look at my
Tamagotchi so why do I still have coming
down below if you guys like Tamagotchi
I know I was obsessed like come on guys
I literally had a lanyard for them
that's when you know but yeah I was
obsessed with these guys I apologize
that the entirety of this vlog is
probably gonna be in my room
because none of my friends are home yet
normally comes home until tomorrow so
yeah I'm not only doing anything my mom
is making dinner and I'm so happy that
my mom can make dinner again and my
dad's like grilling stuff because now I
don't have to cook my own food for this
month because I'm a spoiled brat I just
change my phone case out to this one
because I had left it at home
it's from society6 haha yeah I just
filmed a video we'll put them today but
it's not this this is just like cute
though I've had on this one for so long
and you guys always ask me where it's
from so I'll link it down below I got it
from Etsy like so long ago but it was
time for a change and I love this
pomegranate print I think it's so cute
so I changed it to this one my phone was
so dirty do you guys ever really take
off your phone case and it's so
disgustingly dirty underneath like mine
I'm not even kidding
mine had the alcohol in it I'm like game
day cuz like on game days I would put my
student ID in my phone case cuz you need
it to go to like games and there was
literally there was like sticky stuff in
my phone and I was like what the heck
and I smelled it I'm not kidding it was
like four loko hi guys sorry it's me in
my room again I really apologize this
vlog but like I haven't logged in so
long that I feel bad and I feel like I
should post this anyway even though it
sucks it's like
1 a.m. but I'm up because obviously I
still haven't adjusted focus
I haven't adjusted from the west coast
time change it's like three hours later
here so it's like 10 p.m. for me a skit
making sure I have the right
calculations you guys gonna be like oh
my gosh later so Dom um outfit of the
day I'm wearing the Pug shirt wearing my
new green leggings from the Lululemon I
don't think you can see my socks and
then I'm wearing Christmassy polkadot
socks I desperately need to go to
grocery store with my mom because there
was like no food in the house I'm gonna
go downstairs and see what I can find
so you can come with me ok there's
literally like no food so I'm looking in
the freezer and trying to see if there's
anything like interesting looking I do
see some ice cream my heart is telling
me yes my mind is telling me no ok so I
decided upon some rye bread toast
because a rye bread is like my favorite
and I also found these guys in the
cupboard so that's probably gonna happen
ok I thought I was done but then I found
these in the cupboard and I love cheese
it's so much comment down below if you
like the regular ones or the white
cheddar ones because we had both and I
didn't do so I decided to be a little
wild and go for the white cheddar ok
guys so this is my issue if I have
cheese in my teeth just disregard that
I'm sorry so basically ever since I
moved to LA the thing is sushi I've
never liked seafood I like kind of like
shrimp like I could eat certain types of
seafood but I don't really like it so
I've always been scared of sushi like
it's not really a big thing here so I've
never been like really exposed to it and
I tried it once in LA but just like one
type I don't even know what it was like
one piece and it was it like Katsuya or
something but literally everyone loves
sugar fish and all these places and they
always go but I'm scared to go and I
don't know what to try at all and I feel
like I must like it because everyone
likes it like everyone loves it I swear
like every single guy that I talked to
it's like obsessed with sushi and like
there
gonna want to ask me to go with them
because I don't even know if I like it
it's just frustrating so if you guys
have a recommendation for like a type of
sushi that like everyone likes let me
know I don't really know how the sushi
places are in Syracuse New York
probably questionable but if you guys
like from around here and you know I
need decent ones like let me know cuz I
really want to try sushi cuz I need to
start liking it so yeah let me know well
if you guys like similar to me and only
like seafood there any types you like
which I don't want to get like the
vegetarian rolls like I don't want to I
think that's cheating like I want to
actually get real sushi so I don't know
that's my dilemma such a problem I know
I was just on YouTube watching videos
and I saw a bunch of people commenting
out other people's videos about like
Trisha Paytas or blonde
Sun doll or whatever's like videos and
she's like going insane and I was like
what the heck oh you know I clicked on
them and like as much as I'm like feel
bad because there's clearly something
like wrong with her this might be one of
the funniest things I've seen so I'm
just gonna I'm just gonna show you like
yeah
a chicken nugget guys I don't know this
is fake but she has like a ton of videos
like really like closely time to this
one really really really something else
you know some days I do feel like a
chicken nugget like I love chicken
nuggets like not necessarily a bad thing
um yep with that I'm gonna end the walk
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
