on Instagram telling you guys that I am
transferring to USC the University of
Southern California and I realized that
a lot of you are probably very confused
because all year long I was telling you
how much I liked LMU and how college was
going great for me and I kind of wanted
to make this video to clear everything
up and tell you the whole backstory of
why I am transferring and I don't want
you guys to think that I've been lying
to you all you because I wasn't I really
did love LMU but I just think that USC
is the best fit for me so just in case
you did not see that Instagram post and
you are new to my channel my freshman
year of college I attended Loyola
Marymount University in Los Angeles and
LMU was a smaller school I think I was
around 6,000 undergraduate students and
I am transferring into USC the
University of Southern California which
is a much bigger school also in LA and I
got spring admission which means that I
was not admitted free fall when normal
College starts I was admitted for the
spring semester which I am still so
grateful for because I think USC only
accepts 30% of their transfer applicants
so that is great and I applied to the
communication school and I actually did
not get into the communication school I
got in as undeclared which is fine I can
totally transfer into it but yeah that's
just a little backstory of what is going
down okay so now I'm going to get into
some backstory so we can fast forward
now we can reverse like a year and a
half ago two years ago when I was first
starting to apply to colleges and figure
out what I wanted to apply I wanted to
go to Los Angeles for college or as long
as I can remember
I always loved LA I love the idea of it
and I wanted to get out of New York I'm
from Syracuse New York by the way in
case you don't know so I always just
kind of wanted to go to the west coast
and start fresh so USC was my dream
school since I think freshman year of
high school on I always wanted to go
there
I wanted a big school I wanted a real
college experience and I wanted a school
that was tougher to get into that had
strong academics so basically a USC was
the school for me I wanted to go there
so badly but obviously I wasn't just
going to apply to one school so I'm just
going to list all the schools I decided
to apply to so I applied to USC UCLA
Georgetown University Boston University
Syracuse University and then at the last
minute I was thinking to myself wait
shoot I should probably have a back-up
school in LA in case I don't get into
USC or UCLA so I was like I'm gonna
apply to LMU so the last minute I
decided to also apply to one of
miramount University I know a lot of you
guys are probably going to ask me about
my test scores and my GPA all that stuff
from high school so I'm going to tell
you just because it kind of explains why
I thought I was gonna get into USC I
think I'm not trying to brag I'm not
trying to be annoying about it but I
know you guys are probably curious so a
bit USC is very competitive I think they
except around 18% of freshman applicants
but I thought I had a good chance I
never had any older siblings that went
through the college admissions process
so I really didn't know how selective
schools actually are I was in the top 5%
of my high school class I think you had
455 students and I was number 22 I
believe my GPA was around in 97 or my
averages around a 97% and on the a CT I
got a 31 which is pretty good and I have
YouTube I played some sports throughout
high school
and I was involved in some
extracurriculars so I genuinely thought
I was getting into USC and
no I shouldn't have bought that I
shouldn't have been so confident but
it's what I had wanted my like entire
high school career and I just kind of
thought that's what was gonna happen for
me
I actually did mention that in some
videos a while back so some of you might
have known that USC was my top choice
but I did not get in I was denied
admission and I did not tell any of you
guys that because I was so devastated
and so crushed because literally
everything I had been planning since my
freshman year was just ripped out from
underneath me and I had no idea where I
wanted to go so I'm gonna tell you um
what happened with the other schools so
basically I was wait-listed at UCLA so
that kind of like wanted off the table
for me because I wouldn't hear back
until August and by the way ultimately
got rejected so whatever that's my rival
school now but I was wait-listed in UCLA
I was rejected at Georgetown which is
not surprised I got into Boston
University and I got a Syracuse
University and I got into 101 Marymount
University so I crossed Syracuse right
off my list just because that's where
I'm from and it was a point to me to get
away from my hometown for college so I
crossed off Syracuse it's a great school
but it just wasn't for me because
location and I was basically down to
Boston University and LMU and I was
almost 80% sure like almost positive I
was going to Boston University just
because like I said I've always wanted a
big school big name in a city and my
friend Gretchen Gretchen was beauty was
going there and I was like alright you
know I mean I'll I didn't work out for
me but then I kept thinking and I was
telling myself Tasha you've been wanting
to go to school in LA for the longest
time LM using LA so I started
researching I love you a lot more and
even though it was smaller than I wanted
it was in LA and that ultimately was my
goal and they had my major had
communications so I decided a nelmieux
in no way shape or form in my try
to bash LMU or say it's not a good
school because I loved LMU LMU it's a
great school and I don't regret choosing
LMU as my freshman year school at all I
bet the most amazing friends everyone
was so nice my classes were great it's
such a beautiful campus but for me it's
just a lot smaller than I wanted it's
you know not a big school they don't
have big football teams and think Greek
life and the economics are good they're
just not as rigorous as USC and you know
my friend Anne Murray and we chase
another youtuber goes to USC and I would
go to visit her or I'd go to parties at
USC and I would just still get that
feeling that that's where I wanted to be
that's where I was meant to be so I owe
a decision that I would try and to try
and transfer to USC so I applied to
transfer February first it was a little
bit before that because that was the
deadline so literally guys I have been
waiting since then to find out if I was
going to get accepted and I finally
found out today when I am filling this
then I got accepted I'm going to tell
you guys my GPA from college so you guys
can get a general idea basically my
first semester I had a 3.7 four and then
USC requested my spring grades which
makes sense because I only had one
semester grades and I want to see more
so my second semester I had a feeling
they were going to ask my grades so I
literally kicked myself in the ass and
tried so hard and I got a 3.87 so my
overall GPA was a 3.8 and their average
accepted transfer student is like a 3.7
for something like that or a 3.7 3 I
don't know somewhere in there so
basically I was a bob the average and I
was so proud of myself because I
literally tried so hard and yeah I got
accepted all of you guys are probably
wondering what I'm going to be doing
during the fall semester and I'm not
totally sure because today is the first
day obviously that I found out but what
I really wanted
doing what I think I'm gonna end up
doing is going to a community college in
LA for the fall and trying to live at
USC just so I can kind of meet people at
USC and still go to like the events and
the football games but I'm still taking
classes that will transfer to USC I
don't think I'm gonna try and go back to
LMU just because it's really expensive
when I know I'm not going to be going
there and I just feel like it'll be
weird because I'll be there but I'll
know that I'm gonna be at USC I just
feel like it wouldn't make sense for me
to go back to LMU for the Fall yeah so
that is basically what happened to me I
know I haven't told you guys anything
and I feel so bad because a lot of
people have been messaging me asking
about LMU and I have an answer because I
didn't want to answer them and tell them
oh my god yes please go there it's such
a great school and then them see that
I'm transferring and you like what the
heck so yeah I haven't even dressed it
but I do want to say that LMU is a great
school I loved it if you're looking for
the smaller school because it's
definitely a lot smaller than I would
like but if you do want that smaller
school it's really a great place if you
guys happen to go to USC and need a
roommate or have a single bedroom in
your apartment or wherever you're living
because I would love a single let me
know or if you know anyone as a single
it needs someone because I have no idea
where I'm gonna live guys I'm literally
at home in New York right now and I have
to figure out where I'm living and where
I'm going to school and it's so
stressful but I'm literally so excited
that I can't even think about this dress
fulness if you guys want to stay updated
with what I'm doing and what's going on
totally follow my social media accounts
my Instagram will probably posting a lot
as well as everything else to keep you
guys updated
but yeah I'm literally so excited I'm so
happy I can finally tell you guys about
it and make you even more college videos
so yeah thank you so much for watching I
hope this clears some things up and I
love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
