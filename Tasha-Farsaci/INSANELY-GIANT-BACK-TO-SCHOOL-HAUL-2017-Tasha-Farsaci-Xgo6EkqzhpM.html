today I have another large haul for you
guys I always say this in my hauls if
you don't like hauls I apologize you
don't have to watch it but I get so many
requests to do more hauls all the time
so here I am I just want to apologize
very quickly because this is not going
to be a try on haul I know all of my
trolls trolls all of my hauls are
normally Tryon but I am so so so so so
busy right now with school and the
sorority stuff and everything right now
that I have absolutely no time I
literally have to write a paper right
after I film this so I'm so sorry but I
will be linking everything down below so
if you want to go see what it looks like
on the model totally check down there
once again I'm really sorry and if you
guys want to follow me on social media
namely Instagram to see how I style
these things or if you just want to see
me on a more day-to-day basis it is
right here and I will put my other
handles down below okay so the first
story have things from I'm so excited
about it
subdued didn't say it yeah it doesn't
here on the bag so basically what
happened is I love this store subdued
and I went in I bought like a pair of
pants or something and I posted an
Instagram in them and like tagged them
and then they reached out and they were
like oh my gosh we saw your picture do
you want to do a little haul with us and
I'm so excited because it's one of my
favorite stores ever if you guys haven't
heard of subdued basically I believe
they're an Italian company and they have
one store in the US which is in Santa
Monica California so that is how I heard
about them I've gotten their store
before but they do have an online store
so you guys should totally chose what am
I saying
totally check them out like I said I'm
gonna be linking everything that I've
got from them okay the first thing I got
from subdued is this little sweatshirt
it's yellow and it just says Chow on it
I really like the yellow color yellow
has been one of my favorites lately it's
such a happy color and this is just so
so comfy I got this in a size medium so
it would be like hi oversized I wore
this last night I just think it's really
happy and comfy okay the next thing from
subdued is this little gingham miniskirt
you'll see in this haul I'm obsessed
with going on clearly I hope it doesn't
go out of style any time soon because I
love it it's just this little
miniskirt it's a little bit stretching
the back and has a zipper and I already
wore this once to class I'm obsessed
with it okay I got another hoodie from
subdued this one is a cropped hoodie but
I just loved the blush pink color it's
just like a little cut off crop zip up
Hoodie I want this to class the other
day when I just wanted to be comfy and I
loved it so much this color is
everything I got this in an extra small
and it's like a little bit oversized
kind of like a boxy fit which I really
love for hoodies so I think this is so
cute subdued has some of the best denim
pieces in my opinion so I picked up this
denim miniskirt I wore this to class the
other day and I got a bunch of
compliments on it it does have this
little hole by the book which I didn't
really notice until I was wearing it but
you can't really see your butt or
anything and I'm still kind of into it
so yeah I really like this - I love it
it's dressing on the front it fits great
and I definitely recommend their denim I
think it's amazing quality and it's
always super on-trend in hue this is one
of my favorite pieces I picked up from
subdued if you guys know me you know I
love denim jackets or seriously one of
my weaknesses and I've been loving light
pink so I saw that they had this light
baby pink oversized denim jacket I did
get this in a medium because I like to
layer with my jackets and I like them to
look a little bit more oversized why
don't I just drop yeah but I'm so
excited about this one I can't wait to
wear it I think it's just such a cute
color and it's like a great twist on
your casual casual your everyday denim
jacket okay lastly I got to a little top
smooth subdued this one is so cute it's
this little like eyelet lace to top a
sort of thing I'm loving tube tops
lately as you can tell I just think
they're so adorable and flattering and
comfy so this one is really cute it just
has some eyelash I guys I can't sneak
eyelash lace and then I got this other
little black top I think this would be
great for going out it's just like a
little crop top it's kind of smocked and
then the sleeves flare out a bit this
will go in so much and I see myself
wearing this a lot so really excited
about these and then I did get one
accessory from subdued it's just this
little layered star choker I don't know
if you
see but just have some two layers and
it's really cute I've been wearing this
a bunch and I've been getting lots of
compliments so yeah this is so
affordable and really cute so what is
super exciting is that if you guys want
any of this stuff or you just want to
check out subdued I have a 15% off
coupon code it's just Tasha 15 to use on
subdued some websites and I'll put all
the info for that down below guys you
need to check them out I love them so
much so thank you too subdued for
letting me shop in your store and
gifting me these items because I love
them okay next I have some pieces from
Nasty Gal so I'm going to get into those
the first thing I got I think they're
kind of funky I feel like you'll either
love them or hate them but lately I've
been loving platform espadrilles so I
saw that Nasty Gal have these cheetah
print ones I think they're so dope I
just love cheetah print with like a
basic outfit if I'm just wearing like
all black or white or whatnot I just
think these are really fun and these
types of shoes are so comfortable and
they give me like a little bit of an
extra height boost which is always nice
so yeah I really really like this I got
another pair of shoes from Nasty Gal I
actually wore these for sorority
recruitment they're kind of dirty but I
think they're so cute they're just these
black little mules these are so
comfortable and they're just easy to
like slide on and whatnot so I really
like these and I really like the mule
trend going on right now ok next thing
from Nasty Gal is this fun yellow tank
top it just has some layers and then I
love it has these little ties and the
tops of the straps really cute I
honestly might wear this today or
something because it's so hot and I need
all the flowy tank tops I can get next
from Nasty Gal I just got this cool
little striped wrap top sort of thing it
looks like this that has some like
quarter length sleeves and then it has
these ties in the front so you can wrap
it around wrap tops and wrap skirts and
wrap dresses and anything wrap right now
is some of my favorites so this is just
a really cute basic piece next from
master Yale I got this top that I think
will be great for going out it's just
this black top looks like this and then
it has these cute little sleevie things
going on really cute a little bit dressy
but I think you could kind of dress it
down with like jeans or something
as well so really cute next one asta gal
I got this floral romper it might be
kind of hard to show but this is the
pattern and then it's one of those
rompers that has like the two ties in
the front so you can kind of tie it in a
bow let me show you guys know what I'm
talking about but you can also like wrap
it around so it's kind of like a wear it
two ways sort of thing but I just really
like the pattern on this and I can never
have too many floral rompers alright
moving on to all the gingham stuff I got
I found this game top it has like a
ruffle and then these sleeves are a bit
crazy I don't know how I feel really
about the crazy sleeve trend but I want
to try it out so this will be fun just
some like black jeans or whatnot I'm not
sure how these pants are gonna fit I
haven't tried them on yet but there's
just these gingham trouser sort of
things I have them cuffed at the end
because I'm a midget but they have fake
back pockets just kind of a bummer but I
think these could be really really cute
with like a crop top so we will see this
top kind of reminds me of the gingham
one it's just this red and white striped
blouse it looks kind of crazy now but it
has these like fun funky sleeves and
then has like the same time in the front
that I think would be really cute like
wrapped around and tied so this could be
really fun as well it's like nice and
patriotic okay and the last thing from
masks to go just keeping my order I
didn't pick it out so I'm not like
obsessed with it let me know what you
guys think it's basically like an
oversized denim jacket but it's really
really long if you guys can tell it's
super long it's just like not really my
style but if you guys are into it let me
know ok guys so I also a promo code for
you for Nasty Gal
if you use the code magic 55 you can get
55 percent off everything what yeah I
know so I will have all the info for
that promo code down below as well ok
and the very last place I have things
from in this Hall is Romley and yeah I
got a lot of stuff from romwe I have
some hits have some misses so I wanted
to show you the first thing I think is
really really cute it's this white
blouse and then I just
this floral embroidery on it it's really
loose and it's a babydoll blouse which i
think is really cute and I think this
looks a lot more expensive than it is it
has all the nice embroidery and
stitching so I think this would be
really cute I'd probably wear this with
some skinny jeans next from romwe I got
this polka dot jumpsuit which I have
been loving jumpsuits and polka dots so
this is perfect it looks like this and
then it just goes down into some flared
legs I think this is a crop jumpsuit
it'll probably be full length on me
though because I'm really short and then
the back is super fun it's like all open
and then you just tie it with these
little ties so this is so adorable
I've been loving funky patterned pants
so I picked up these black striped
culottes they look like this and then
the cool thing is at the bottom you kind
of have this perpendicular striping
going on these are really cute and
cropped and comfy I picked up this
sweater which I'm not gonna lie isn't
the best quality in the world it's
pretty thin but I still think it's
really cute it's this blush pink colored
sweater it's pretty oversized and then I
thought was really cute is that the
sleeves have this like lace-up thing
going down them which I thought was just
a little bit different and this is one
of my favorite colors to wear so I
picked up this polkadot dress heavenly
try this on so hopefully it looks cute
it's this white dress and that has these
black polka dots embroidered into it and
it's kind of like a baby doll style and
then the back has the two little ties so
you can like tie a bow at the top and
make it as tight or loose as you want it
so yeah I think this is adorable okay I
also got the top that I'm wearing from
romwe and it came with this midi skirt I
don't really know if I'm gonna wear the
skirt I kind of got it just for the top
but it comes with a matching skirt so if
you like that look it comes with the
start but yeah I just really love the
top like I said earlier I've been loving
wrap dresses I think this one is really
cute the material is just super thin so
I might need to wear a slip under it but
it looks like this it's just this really
cute pretty floral pattern and it is a
wrap dress
so you guys get the deal I got another
pair of striped pants these ones are
super funky if it's like burgundy kind
of ivory and blue stripe I think I'm
showing you them backwards yeah they
have some pockets you in the front and
then they just going on in the pants
continuing on with the gingham trend I
grabbed this little two-piece set the
shorts look kind of weird they look a
little bit long but I feel like when
they're on they'll be cute they're just
like roughly shorts and then the top
looks like this I think it's really
adorable and then it also came with this
little tie I'd only remember when I'm
supposed to do a tease I think I might
tied it tie it on the shorts so yeah
I'll have to look look at the picture
online but it came with this little tie
next we're only is this adorable crop
top thing they have this in a bunch of
different colors I chose navy because I
have almost no Navy so it looks like
this
it's really cute and it's another one of
those tops that ties in the front so
this would be good over a bathing suit
or would like a really pretty bra that
or something there's nothing wrong with
this next dress I just think I would
look kind of frumpy in it like a frumpy
grandma maybe it's this red gingham
dress it's just like really boxy and
ruffly and I just don't think this would
be flattering on my like small petite
frame all right I got this romper
overall romper it's sort of thingamajig
it's this like light blue color it has
ties here and it looks like overalls but
I would wear this with like a white tube
top or like a white little cropped
t-shirt underneath I think it's really
cute it's super thin and lightweight
which is like good and bad it's good
it's not super hot but I thought it
would be a little bit thicker but it's
still really cute and I think yeah it
has pockets in the front okay this next
thing I'm not a huge fan of just because
the material is weird it's just this
like shirt dress sort of thing I saw one
like this in Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch that I
wanted but I never got it so I saw this
one on the runway that looked similar
it's just kind of over you're in
material it's not horrible I think I
could still wear it almost done guys I
got this sweatshirt and only know how I
feel not because it's not nice I just
don't know if it's my style it's black
but the sleeves are embroidered and
flared and then they're like raw em let
me know what you
I think I think it's kind of cool I got
this dress which i think is really cute
in theory I just don't know how I feel
about the colors it's very pink but it
looks like this and it has this cute
little ruffle and then it goes down like
this I just I don't know I feel like
online didn't move looked more like a
salmon pink and this is like very pink
but it's still pretty cute and I know
this came in like a bunch of different
colors okay something I don't like is
this bathing suit because the material
is very very thin
I loved it online supposed to be lace-up
on the sides but it didn't calm lace up
which like I know I could do it myself
and just like not crazy about it so it
looks like this it's a one-piece and
then like I said the sides they're
supposed to be laced up but like I still
have to do that not the best but I mean
I guess from how expensive it was it
kind of makes sense but yeah the
material is just really thin ok the last
few things from romwe are accessories
this I think is so cute but I don't know
how to work it I'll show you it's just a
little tiny yellow bag but what I'm
confused about is that a chain to put
around it's like a crossbody has these
like little things at the end so what
would make it seem like you would just
put them in here and they would extol
out because they're way smaller than
this so like I don't know how this is
supposed to work but if I figure it out
it's really cute and I love yellow right
now but yeah I don't know how it works I
got this really cute pair of shoes
they're like this terra cotta orange
color faux suede and then they have a
little bit of like espadrille on the
sides I think these are really really
cute and I'm excited to wear these and
then I also picked up these baby pink
furry slides Kalyani's isn't very good
at all there's like some weird like a
rubber chunks sticking out but I'd only
really wear these around the house so
I'm like kind of okay with it okay so
