road a little bit and I rode and you
will see but I guess was to talk we can
talk about whatever we're feeling yeah
I'm gonna start off with concealer I
just got this big pimple I woke up with
a knife below my face and I just popped
that's kinda nice to have a pop it
exactly it's nobody it's pretty gross so
I'm sorry but it's honestly so
satisfying oh my gosh remember my
friends are like
it is satisfying okay also I only can do
my makeup in the colony so I have this
giant near sitting like girl right here
if I'm looking over here
yeah I'm not about that much community
size or so LOL i'm using the benefit a
flawless 16 our primers normal yes chef
filled with Sarah Cox I just limit and
keep some like a bomb for like a million
hours boom yeah I would
I'm sorry for like more quiet or like
tired in this video but I really like
certain item knows now for sub-assembly
I know we were so early has really enjoy
and like TMI with my common ones and I
feel like like a walrus like like jumped
and like like hit my stomach columns I
doesn't make any sense in made more
sense of what I was going to say in my
head
yeah I really feel like I'm dying and
then my ibuprofen was in like this
little mesh bag and I have X with sink
and I'm gonna got water out there and
fully expanded like the size of Texas
man I like trying to swallow them and I
just just integrate in my mouth and you
guys know how bad something taste room
service that's room truth we have our
digital
oh yeah we really scare that what's
going to happen to be like ordered our
rooms originally specific our new
running ah
Clio Whelan foundation I yeah I just
like hate how foundation on because like
okay number one I have we pick for night
wrinkles you guys can help with you guys
and like it grosses me out so much when
I feel like foundations sitting in those
things like I don't want to that's like
I don't know what my skin's like top if
I want comp lifted it's just like one
big people and that's not the Vantage
it's a foundation for you know I think
our nation's and mores like you're good
you're not even beautiful yeah yeah like
I said just Alaska mirror I'd be
scarring and just a discoloration myself
though I just think you be exclusive to
them when I use the cream from a
cosmetic and shade medium
I was looking not talking us probably
show guys it's so good
you have anti-aging hydrating serum
color correcting it's like full coverage
udacity tea cream and I'll show it on
your skin and there's a 50 SPF so it's
just like super good I'm just setting my
concealer with this maybelline superstay
better skin powder Gretchen and I got
these at beautycon LA and we love them
and I'm going to use the two guys to do
the Bosnian haunted
what I'm going to say Japan Japan Japan
yeah like I should panel that was like
such a phrase YouTube see us today
alright next up is eyebrows I'm using
the Anastasia brow words and one depicts
filling in the inner part and then I
like to use my dip brow pomade do the
other half I'm using the ingredients and
age rewind concealer dislike frowns bags
like I use that beginning days of
YouTube but I love it and I use
literally the shade care because I
really like bright underarms so it's
like goes like this series you know
today question 9 well we're gonna stand
with this go for internship and today we
have to like pitching I'm so excited I
forgot the old like the company were
working for to like a venture capitalist
so like they're high schoolers yeah I
more protecting the vent of venture
capitalists because I was like what doe
and other startups have to do you know
if it's a pitch their product or their
fee or they're at whatever so that you
can try to get funding and the worst
thing one have a little practice pitch
to a be sign cooler that seem to have a
lot of knowledge like previously about
what magic has let's do everything and
then at the end we're going to have like
a task of how much funding you want and
then they're going to decide okay they
decide were to allocate money they
decide like how much we get it or really
bad so it's gonna be kind of cool and
exciting and I decided top cycle is
because I think it's going to be sort of
like we're like the speakers that come
any talk to them and I run like high
school like it's being so excited we
speakers are home
so interesting but you get to take a
break during the day I know it was
really like I'm in a field trip with oh
yeah so that's why I'm excited just
because like those really nice punish
times and I collect little cool secret
to come something we can be those people
I mean maybe maybe college either
maybe maybe they'll be like yawning like
falling asleep like we don't care about
this is not the case
yeah I think it's a program specifically
for this stuff so they should be
interested hmm look at I literally have
faced chocolate soleil from ninth grade
and I thought well at all collect I use
it for a while I think I stopped in here
for quality year - and now use an ax and
explode which is my favorite bra driver
like it's so dark insulted this is just
the original chocolate one and you can
tell how long that's have it just by
like little packaging without a
packaging is way different but now that
is milk chocolate and dark chocolate my
friends that are like lighter get like
most chocolate I probably music I just
like pretending that I'm working so
crazy I remember you to watch like
makeup like actual makeup makeup gurus
and like say would you do makeup like so
nicely and then it would turn out
Superbowl yeah like I think like candy
Johnson or something I remember she used
to like slap down there and like you
look so good
people like people that are really good
at makeup are interested for a while can
at least throw it on long like so quick
but it's like beautiful and listening to
drivers this looks like crap you keep
screwing on things okay oh also do you
see how all this sudden oh my gosh this
is not how this comes anymore just so we
all know everything can make it expire
with this is legit five years old but no
I did where I showed for the longest
time about if they don't wear it so much
because I just like being funny where I
know
but we're going to try it out with my
expired or you can't kind of ocean could
you not use it
I'm not this excited but like probably
everything that's for five years what
I'm good at is like do you like me
mascara because I know that's like a
safety hazard that's like the only make
up are run out of Bath yeah
and I love that so from - oh yeah yeah
I'm using mine me kit you're going to
keep basics is with the first little one
that came out I think now they have like
all the other ones like need you to like
oh I have the ultimate basically I saw
that I've never seen that in my life
about looking new um not really
I'm just like I used to be so into
makeup I knew every single collection on
the Mac would come out with it I knew
every single name and while the lipstick
on your eyeshadows like literally
everything canisters burn right there
okay yeah I've got in there yesterday
hey hi uh yeah now I just like don't
even know run because anyone just like
to be doing other real important things
with learning all of the matte
eyeshadows not putting myself that was
my freshman your high school

back peak so I know I only wanna oh my
god I need to buy Naked Lunch and all
that glitters yes okay I just took a big
chunk other dude yeah all that glitters
what was that other one that was kind of
totally shut until bento oh yeah my
resume not be even it's kind of hard and
I feel like I feel so bad when you're
filming your makeup it's always turns
out the words Oh a hundred percent but
when I tried to come on get ready with
me in New York this is a ultimate basic
and they're all matte which that's what
I've been doing lately I'm was like
Kasia you could to make up like how are
you doing it yeah this is how and I kind
of just like switch what colors I use
everyday but I always use like one of
these
like natural light ones all in the wind
I put something else in the crease so
today only I will see you I'm going to
do I'm kind of just been like that
literally like I didn't ask just like
bees are pretty much on that there's
like one shimmering limits as a
highlight and we're just doing that
everyday I said is really natural like
good looking and also when you eat when
we got our makeup to New York and Mac
and you have a bit Wiggly discolored
look on your lid which is kind of a
little bit lighter than your skin tone
like tan and I thought it looked so good
like this is probably the most noble
thing people
that was well I'm doing that everything
I just think it was I was not to make a
person but I say like blend and like
increase my stuff I feel so weird we
just cleaned all right just for you oh
my god Hannah was a census watching when
we were younger she took all die shadows
and palettes like it's for everybody
good like rub my head I'm like you are
just too much for me now I'm just going
to you it this little under browse to
called brow highlight

pimples that I didn't conceal oh I
didn't even put on concealer but that
one right there my concealer but
nobody's perfect
hi now that I work at your game again to
like it and if we have it up sometimes
nobody person okay
who knows if this looks good I sure as
hell don't know I can't tell really in
this mirror ladies quite dark so yeah
when I really know eyelashes left Wow oh
here oh nine zippy and I and I brought
all touches and eyelashes I got four in
New York the Robin here where and
yesterday I completely demolished one of
them trying to get it off because
there's no linking okay and the other
one I try to cop stand like these aren't
even cute edge through one oh my gosh
