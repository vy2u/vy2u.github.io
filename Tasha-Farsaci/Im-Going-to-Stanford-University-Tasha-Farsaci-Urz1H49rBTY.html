red because I just ate a bunch of red
starbursts so try to ignore that um but

confused about this title right now I
don't know if it's up or down um because
I've been telling you guys how excited I
am about us see how I wanted to go here

comment down below but yeah basically
usc's playing Stanford in football this
weekend and it's kind of like called The
Weekender game a bunch of students go up
north and either go to the game or just
tailgate and hang out in San Francisco
so yeah my good friend Ann Marie here

to go with her and some of her friends
so I'm going with her and her boyfriend
and then two other friends of hers that
I haven't met yet
so yeah that's gonna be fun and we're
leaving today around five it's Friday
now the games tomorrow on Saturday and
then we're hanging around a little bit
on Sunday and then coming back so I
figured I would just flog this for you
because you guys have been requesting
more vlogs and I thought this could be
fun so there's really more on school
than a family coat as you can tell hey I
think you can't you can't tell me you
can take my footage we got pulled over
yeah I'm freaking hot no.10 I bring how
do you feel I have literally never I was
like guys I don't I don't think we were
just talking about this and then we were
like oh like a busy traffic behind a car
that we thought was a car for a long
time and it wasn't and then we drove
half the car be like wait the light just
turned on really within 20 seconds so
your thing is you dizzy first time
holdovers okay plus the bad thing is
that he's really me yeah very angry

my hair is like on Gracie so I'm getting
kind of it doesn't matter my eyes are
watering too so we asked we made it to
the highway longer oh um this house is
like nicer than mine it's worth more
than my life by like yeah I'd show them
the view it's in Menlo Park yeah we had
no expectations but then it ended up
being like beautiful so we were excited
