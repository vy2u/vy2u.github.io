your eyes I know I haven't done one in
so long and that's totally out of
character for me so I have some stuff
here today I think I'm going to call
this an affordable phone call because
it's full and all this stuff is very
affordable but some of it isn't really
full weather appropriate because I live
in LA so it's never really super cold
here you know okay so all that stuff in
this haul is from is Apple calm and i
know i've done hauls with apple before
and some people get mad because they say
ZAF was like super sketchy and not a
good website or whatever but yeah as
Apple did offer to send me these items
and normally I'm like a like I only want
to work with sample but I'm gonna be
totally honest with you guys I needed
clothes for theme parties slash
Halloween and I'm news Apple would have
stopped that was like affordable that I
wouldn't mind if it got ruined so I was
like okay why not I also like doing
these videos because I know a lot of you
guys want to order from these websites
because everything is so cheap and
affordable but you kind of don't know
what you're gonna get or if you should
or if it's going to look like where does
on the website before I get into the
video if you're not following me on
social media that would be so awesome my
Instagram is very Akasha
I'm always closing stuff on there that's
like my personal life so if you want to
get to know me on a more like personal
basis you guys can totally go follow me
on there and then I have my snapchat my
Twitter but I also keep up on and just
like super personal what I do in my
day-to-day so if you guys could follow
me that'd be so awesome
also I'm going to link all this stuff in
the description as well as like what I'm
wearing in the description this bodysuit
might be sold out and this choker I
always get questions about it I actually
made this but I will link like a very
similar one in the description
in case you guys want to go back one
okay so what the first thing I got
thumbs Apple is this white dress there
is this party coming up at USC that's
like snow theme so I was like okay I'll
get this white dress like maybe I'll
wear there so it's basically this white
linen dress and I just really liked the
cut of it the top is like straight
across and then it kind of just like
flares out and it's like a white linen
dress it's very simple but for some
reason I really like it example is super
known for their bathing suits I think
like all those alcohols when I see I'm
mostly in bathing suits because they do
have a lot of like replicas of really
expensive or like trendy bathing suits
but I only got one because you guys know
me I have so many bathing suits the top
is a orange triangle top it's really
cute it just has my colorful stitching
on it and then the bottoms look like
this they're like pretty tiny and then
they have the stitching oh the top is
too big on me if it's like super
awkwardly I got a small and it also like
it looks like it does on the website but
the website makes it look like it's
Mormon neoprene material okay moving on
I got this white lacy crop top thing
this is another thing that I'm not like
super in love with it's not bad
but it just doesn't look good on it
looked a lot better on the website it's
just like when I put it on you can see
the lining kind of pop out okay this
next thing I've actually really really
like I've been really loving the denim
skirt trend I'm actually wearing one
right now like a black one I just like a
skirt miniskirt trend in general like I
really love it so I got this denim
miniskirt and I really liked it because
it's not like the cutoff one I do want
to cut off like Levi's one but this one
it's just if you want more of like a
classy look I guess and then I was like
this cute button and I'm like buttons
down kind of the only thing is this is a
little bit thing on me just like around
the waist I got a small I'm pretty sure
everything I got like a small or an
extra small okay for that same like snow
themed party I was telling you about I
got this vest and it's a white fur vest
I don't see myself wearing this
other than that party um from looks like
another themed party just cuz like it's
a little bit much for me but this is
like good quality like the furs nice
it's not like shedding or anything okay
moving on I got this skirt which I love
so much I've already worn this and it's
probably like my favorite thing that I
got just like no man wear it so much
this one is just a white denim miniskirt
and it has like some rips in it which I
really like this is actually a skort
so it has shorts on moving which is
actually really convenient because you
know it's not see-through that way okay
next time at is this long sleeve floral
dress it just doesn't it's too big on me
and the material is really like thin and
sheer into sig not the best quality but
it's still cute I think if you were
taller me or be cute on you it's just
this dress with these like flowy sleeves
and then it goes down like cinches like
I said it's just a little bit long and
big on me okay next I have this bathing
suit for a Halloween costume potentially
it is the classic red Baywatch one-piece
and this is definitely a copy of a
really expensive one because I saw I'm
like revolve or something but yeah it's
cute
it dips low in the back I think I'm
gonna be a lifeguard did I mention that
yeah for one night of Halloween I'll
have your lifeguard so that is why I got
this oh my gosh okay so this sweater is
a copy of of Free People sweater they
have a lot of copies of like Free People
items on their website and I really like
this sweater so excited and I got it and
it's cute but it shed everywhere I had a
little burgundy threads all over my
floor
I like shake it out with my shower like
shower was like cupboard it's like an
off-the-shoulder sweater and the bottom
is supposed to look like frayed but
because of that all these fall off and I
know if you three people one does it do
that
but this one these like all fall off so
much to the point where I don't know if
I can wear this okay moving on
I got this a really really cute skirt it
looks just like one that I have from
lose it's the same exact style same
material and everything it's just a
different print it's a maxi skirt and I
believe in liking maxi squeeze lately I
don't even know if they're back in style
but I like them so it looks like this I
like it because the top has like a
little side time I actually can get
supposed to be mini skirts but I'm five
foot one so really maxi on me like they
fit perfectly and then it just has this
cute like tribal pattern and it's like a
wrap skirt kind of thing and it's just
like girl oh me down okay the next thing
I got is actually also potentially for
that snow themed party I feel like I got
so many things potentially for that but
this one I actually think I'll wear and
the white line I feel like I'll wear
although than that but this one like I
probably won't wear other than that so
just like this silver slip dress these
are so popular right now and it's very
very silver um I like this it came with
a choker that I am NOT going to wear
because this is not good quality at all
like literally look at this the width is
different like the strings are going out
like the choker is not good at all but
this lip dress is pretty good okay one
of my other favorite things from this
haul is this dress I was wearing this in
my Q&amp;amp;A video a few videos back if you
saw that but it's just this burgundy
off-the-shoulder kind of like ruched top
dress it's like ruched the top and then
it goes out into you a normal dress I
think this is so cute this is like my
favorite color so I really love this and
I don't know completes okay this next
dress I was so excited for because I
think it is so cute
but I came it for it came and it's giant
like I got a size small and this is
massive like not just long like broad
and everything it has ties in the top
and like little floral embroidery and
then it has these layers but it's so
large and I'm really sad and I was
thinking like I could have the bottom
layer but then the layers won't be equal
so I was like that might look weird let
me know what you guys think is the
cutest thing ever if this was like
really short because it is kind of a
boxy if this fit me like really short or
be so cute but it's just giant so I'm
really upset
I'm sad about this I could probably crop
it and delay a crop top like that might
be cute
I don't really know so let me know what
you think about this okay this next
thing I got I'm really question myself I
do not know why I got this oh my gosh oh
if you guys couldn't tell this is a pink
baseball cap with the Doge on it do I
think I'm ever gonna wear this probably
not but for some reason I just thought I
needed it like I saw it and I was like
oh yep
Add to Cart okay the last two things in
this hall are both three people and oops
so this one um think it's inside out
okay it's just this off a shoulder top
and has like this floral embroidery I
thought this was really cute online and
then when I tried it on I kind of felt
like like a pinata let me know what you
think in the chai on if you think it's
cute I mean it's pretty good quality the
back looks like that it's just it's like
a little bit crazy okay the last thing I
got I'm pretty sure as a free people
dupe as well I definitely recognize this
from somewhere it's just this white
dress with these like reddish burgundy
floral embroidery thing image AIDS
the only thing is it has the slip off of
it that's really really short like is
this gonna even cover my butt like I
don't know like really really short but
the dress is really cute it was so
wrinkly when I got it so I had to steam
it and everything and then I almost
forgot to mention I just got this
burgundy colored floppy hat it's kind of
like crinkled from the packaging but
it's like nice quality I'd say sorry my
voice is really gone right now
top it looks like this and thank you
okay so that's my
from zackham let me know what you guys
think about sample or if you've ordered
from them before you know I like it I
like working with them because it's kind
of like you never know what you're going
to get it's very exciting to get the
package in the mail and I do get some
really cute things out of you know this
kind of stuff but like I said some stuff
is hurt or miss so yeah if you guys want
anything that I got I'm gonna link it
