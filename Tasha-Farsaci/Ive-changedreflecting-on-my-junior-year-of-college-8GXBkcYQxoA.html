you guys are new here and have no idea
who I am
my name is Tasha and this is my channel
if you guys like me in the slightest and
want to see more videos from me please
subscribe to my channel that would mean
so much to me
and if you really really like me and
want to keep up with me on a more
personal basis totally follow me on my
Instagram it's just at Tasha I'm posting
on there all the time just about my
daily life my friends and what I'm doing
so if you guys want to follow me on
there that'd be awesome and I will my
other channels like snapchat and Twitter
and the description in case you guys
really are obsessed with me and just
want to follow me on everything so as
you guys can tell by the title this
video is going to be a junior year
reflection and if you guys don't know
who I am this is a college reflection
I'm not in high school a junior of
college reflection video because believe
it or not I had my last class of junior
year last week it's currently finals
week here at USC we have two finals
weeks so I guess I can say it's finals
weeks so that's why I haven't been
posting a lot I've been so stressed and
doing all of like my final projects and
papers but I wanted to sit sit
set I want to set aside some time today
to kind of film a little reflection
about my junior year because I feel like
I changed so much as a person this year
yeah I also have a large band-aid on my
hand because I have eczema on my hair
and I like picked it and it got really
really gross so if you guys are looking
at this that's why okay so I basically
asked you guys to kind of ask me some
like guiding questions on Instagram
about my junior year so I'm kind of just
going to go off of those I really
haven't planned how I want to do this
video so kind of bear with me it might
be a little bit all over the place oh
yeah okay and if you guys don't know me
I am a junior communication major at USC
the University of Southern California so
I'm in the Annenberg School for
Communication and journalism and that's
been my major forever in college a lot
of you guys were asking me like how many
times I switch majors or if I ever want
to switch majors and know I've always
been contented my major and that's
always been it so yes okay so the first
question that I feel like I was getting
a lot of
what was it like joining a sorority
especially as a junior and kind of has
it been hard to balance everything okay
so I think this was one of the things
that really made me a different person
as your or just like change my
perspective on things this year if you
guys haven't seen my rush experience
video you guys should probably watch it
I will link it down below because the
beginning of the year because of what
happened to me during sorority
recruitment was really really tough for
me actually and in the beginning of the
year I was like pretty bummed and like
discouraged so yeah if you guys haven't
seen that video I'm not gonna explain
what happened here but like go watch it
I'll link it
so anyways in the man of the year I was
like pretty discouraged about the whole
thing and I didn't rush to the junior
and I joined Alpha Team and I will say
that rushing as a junior was I don't
regret it at all cuz I met amazing
friends this year and all the fee but it
was definitely harder because a lot of
the things that you do when you're a new
member are you know mixers with the
pledge classes of new fraternities and I
just didn't really want to go to things
that were like mixers with like freshmen
boys like I'm a junior and not that
anything against that but a lot of the
things I kind of felt were just geared
toward being a freshman which totally
makes sense like most people that join a
sorority are freshmen or maybe a
sophomore so it was kind of hard for me
to kind of I feel like I'm most myself
as a junior because I just fell a lot
older and a lot different than other
people in my pledge class so in terms of
like the social aspect and that kind of
stuff
rushing as a junior was and is in my
opinion a little more difficult because
I feel like every year I'm in college I
age like five years so I feel like how I
am as a junior and then even though the
freshman girls in my pledge class are so
sweet and amazing it's just like I feel
like I'm in just such a different like
headspace being a junior instead of a
freshman so yeah that was kinda it's
like different but anyway he's
I'm at like my best friend at school
Anna through my sorority she's a year
younger than me she's actually like one
of my bigs my other big book another one
of my really close friends so joining
her sorority was actually and is
actually really really great for me in
terms of meeting new people because I
feel like at USC especially since I was
a transfer and a spring admin and all of
that stuff many people is so so
difficult and you know people always are
like Oh meet people in your classes but
that's just so hard so yeah joining
Alfie
really really really helped me meet some
awesome girls and in terms of balancing
um I'm not the most active member ever
I'm not gonna lie I don't go to like
tons and tons of things just because I
do have other things I'm balancing I
have YouTube I have schoolwork I have
other friends and are in sororities and
I don't want to just like spend all of
my time doing Greek life things other
things are just as important to me so I
really I don't do like everything for
Alfie probably that I could but because
of that I don't find it hard to balance
I do what I want to do and what I feel
like I can put into it but I'm not just
doing like everything for that because
balance is really important to me
so yes reflecting on joining a sorority
I am very glad that I did it I met
awesome people I really like it I'm
continuing with it next year
but I don't think it's like the end-all
be-all that I thought it would be and if
you guys are considering joining a
sorority as a junior or as an
upperclassmen I definitely do recommend
it I've got a lot of questions about
that just know that it's probably not
going to be the exact same experience if
you were to join younger but I still
think it's awesome and I still think
it's worth a shot
so yeah that's my reflection on sorority
life okay so I was also getting just a
bunch of questions asking me what the
biggest difference for me was this year
compared to freshmen and sophomore year
and there was one big difference that
has really really changed this year for
me that is definitely the biggest factor
of what's different and I've talked
about this I talked about this in like a
vlog one time a while back like right
when this kind of changes happen
and now I can definitely say that it's
like fully changed so I can talk about
it more so basically this year I think I
like not completely but really kind of
got over the whole social party scene in
college at USC like I said not
completely like also go to like a party
here and there but my freshman and
sophomore year sophomore year especially
because I was here at USC I lived for
social like Greek life social like frat
parties like exchanges day - it's all
about like if there was a plan big party
I would have my outfit plan weeks in
advance I would get so excited if there
was like a big party one night like I
was gonna go like no doubt about it I
would have FOMO about them and I do you
feel like that's pretty common here
among at least especially like people in
Greek life or just anyone in college you
know when they first get to college
you're so excited about that stuff and I
don't know I this year I'm not sure what
it was but I just completely like lost
interest in that not because I think I'd
like to good for them or anything like
trust me that was my jam but I also
turned 21 this year so I go more to like
bars and that kind of stuff so I'm kind
of just over the whole like yeah like
frat party see think it's just kind of
like grimy to me and I'd much rather go
out to a bar and actually have
conversations with people that matter
rather than going to a frat party and
just like talking to guys that don't
care about you and won't remember you
the next day or people just like
throwing up everywhere like not really
my scene and by no means if you still
love your college properties and that
kind of stuff like I'm not trying to say
like that's immature or anything like
trust me I know exactly where you are
and I still love like game day game day
tailgates and all that stuff like I'm
still really excited about those but
it's just like the whole like college
party frat party thing then I was so
into last year and so like on top of the
schedule for like
serum just like I could care less pretty
much so that was really big change for
me and you guys have experiences as well
let me know because when I talked about
this in the first video I got so many
comments and people saying the same
things and even like my friends from
home watch my videos hiccup
texted me and they were like oh my gosh
like I thought I was the only one that
felt this way but yeah that's been a
really big change for me this year okay
a lot of you guys we're asking about my
classes I feel like I focused so much
I'm like the social scene of college and
obviously college is about classes and
academics but yeah this year I finished
up all of my like GE requirements so at
USC we have like GES general education
requirements so you know you have to
take like a philosophical reasoning a
social science a physical science
quantitative reasoning like all these
like specific classes you need to do a
certain number of each and I finally
finally finish up with those in the fall
semester and then this semester I
finished my language requirement I
finished up with Spanish adios espanol
so yeah now I'm basically done with all
of the requirements that don't have to
do in my major so next next semester
yeah next semester and next year I'm
just gonna be taking elective courses
for my major and then just elective
courses or anything that I want to take
so I'm probably gonna take a lot in the
business school just because I am
interested in business as well so I'm
really excited about that just being
able to kind of create a schedule that I
enjoy and I'm interested in and feel
like I can apply to my daily life and
then kind of going off of that a lot of
you guys we're asking me what my summer
plans are and then what my plans are
when I graduate which is crazy I don't
want to think about that but I guess
it's only a year away now so basically
my summer plans are so I originally
planned on not getting an internship for
this summer and really really focusing
on my youtube channel which I think us
would be happy about I've had
internships before so I didn't feel like
I really needed to get one but then
something did come up and a girl my
sorority recommended me for an
internship
and I think they like kind of offered me
it but they haven't believed in
following up too frequently so if I do
end up doing that that will only be like
two or three days a week so I'll be
doing an internship like part-time but
then also doing YouTube so it's gonna be
one of the two I'm still gonna be here
in Los Angeles but I'm going home for
two weeks once I do my last final so
I'll be home in New York for a bit but
yeah this summer I just really wanted to
focus on my channel because it's really
important to me and I really really
enjoy it I love making videos for you
guys and it's just so hard during the
school year because you know like I said
I'm balancing so much but during the
summer I feel like I can actually put
all my effort into videos and post so
much so I know like that's every
youtuber says but I really will so yeah
I'm really excited about that and then
if I do end up doing that internship
obviously I'll tell you guys more about
it but it's kind of like up in the air
right now so I'm not gonna really like
talk about it that much if you guys ask
me what I'm doing when I graduate I
genuinely don't know that's a year away
and I feel like so many things change in
one year and it's also the question that
no one wants to answer so yeah kind of
unsure about that
sirens classic yeah so I think that kind
of wraps up a lot of the questions that
I got for this video basically at this
year went by so fast yeah I still love
USC I love it here so much
I can't believe when I graduate in a
year I'm not ready to leave right now
I feel like in a year maybe I'll be
ready
but yeah it's like the best school ever
in my mind and I love it so much and
stuff on campus and I feel like so happy
every time but I'm really excited for
summer because I've had so much
schoolwork this semester and this year
that I can't wait to just relax and
chill and make videos for you guys so I
know this video focused on my school
year but I know you guys have a lot of
questions about my personal life and I
have been meaning to film a personal Q&amp;amp;A
so if you guys do have more personal
questions for me that you want to know
feel free to comment them down below
nope
I'll answer them but definitely comment
them and then thumbs up ones that you
want me to answer and if they get a lot
of likes and they're not too crazy yeah
I'll probably answer them in a video so
come with those down below also comment
anything else you want I love reading
your comments I try to read most of them
anyways I love you guys so much
once finals are done I swear I'm gonna
be posting a lot she's kind of like
Ferraz old right now so yeah I love you
guys so much as always thanks for
watching and stay tuned for my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
