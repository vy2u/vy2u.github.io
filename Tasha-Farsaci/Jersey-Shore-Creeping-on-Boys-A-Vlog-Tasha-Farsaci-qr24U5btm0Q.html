um it's the morning my eyes are watering
I'm sitting in bad as we can probably
tell this is not my normal room huh
basically I'm a New Jersey I'm at like
the Jersey Shore my dad's friend is
renting a house here and he said we
could stay here for a few days when he
wasn't here so we're here and I brought
my friend Melanie she's been in a vlog
before we actually got here yesterday
but I didn't vlog because we didn't
really have any solid plans of what we
were doing we actually ended up like
fishing for crabs off a little like back
deck here
I took like a little clip of us like
throwing them back because we weren't
going to keep them after this so I might
put this in here
there it goes yeah so today I think
we're just gonna be going to the beach
and the boardwalk and we might go to the
mall later because there's a mall here
kind of close that has Abercrombie kids
and if you guys have watched my videos
you know that's where I get my jeans
because I'm super like short and like
stick like mom and they closed mine in
my wall so yeah I might go there
yeah so I actually went to the beach and
the boardwalk where Jersey Shore was
filmed which is kind of cool I mean like
I'm not like a fan of Jersey Shore I
thought it was like super stupid but
like at the same time I think we were
all fans uh-huh but Mel's in the shower
right now I'm not gonna like do my
makeup for the beach or anything because
it's the beach and I'm gonna get like
really sweaty so yeah mmm nice yeah so I
just wanted to let you guys know where I
am and yeah okay I know I just ended
that clip but I had to throw this in
there so last night I went to Walmart at
like 9:00 p.m. because my mom got a
headache and she needed like medicine
this was super random I went in looking
like a homeless person I was wearing
like this basically without sweatpants
and I met two subscribers so a shout-out
to you guys Wow I was so embarrassed
like luckily I had makeup on because I
would have been a mess but yeah I
normally don't look so homeless when I
meet you guys so sorry about that but
thank you guys so much for coming up to
me that was so cute and like I love when
you guys come up to me like I tried like
a really nice person I think like maybe
I don't look at it look like it but if
you ever see me like definitely come up
to me because I love meeting you guys so
yeah I just wanted to like throw that in
there and yeah thank you guys so much
for coming up to me and saying hi so
yeah hey guys we're filming outfit of
the days for the beach so Mel when you
have to say for your weight
it's from really Collister right yes yes
Hollister and that my shorts are from
H&amp;amp;M okay and you've got you've got
trying to learn each as you can see oh
oh yeah alright my up my tank some
brandy
the Midori bikini I'm happy with shorts
that every single girl has yeah so we
just made it to the boardwalk and that
Jersey Shore was like my mom and milk
yeah hey guys so we made it to the beach
we are here still clothed I'm gonna do
like a little aerial view it's actually
really nice to be at an actual beach and
not the gross ones where we live so
gonna ten now okay so now we're just
walking on the boardwalk and we were
laying out and tanning for a while I
like didn't really get my hair wet it
was up but yes so now we're just walking
on the boardwalk I really want like a
frozen lemonade but I don't know if I'm
with your lady here maybe Oh fried Oreos
okay so yeah just walking around
like $5.00 and I got this coming
everything now we're just walking I kind
of walked through but I'm not so hungry
so I don't want to get something like
fried and gross but or just like people
watching because there's really really
like gross people not to be mean but
like you've got the stereotypical Jersey
people here this is actually fabulous I
shouldn't be talking I'm wearing a crop
top but you know whatever guys this is
me in the store like everything is so
boho so cute oh you guys just look at
this store
hey guys so it's actually the next
morning I really didn't vlog that much
yesterday because all we did was like
come home like order a pizza and kind of
chill plus I realized I kind of want to
put these vlogs like all together in one
big vlog so like I didn't want to vlog a
ton yesterday plus I didn't get ready
all day and I looked like a tow so I
didn't really want you guys to see me
like that all day but basically I got
ready Mel is in the bathroom again we
are going to a mall I think that's like
half hour away because I think I said in
a few long days ago that there's an
Abercrombie kids there and I don't have
mine in my mall anymore they like shut
it down so I like to go there to get
jeans and shorts and stuff and there's
also a cotton on so we're gonna go there
I think this even a chick-fil-a there
which is like crazy for us cuz in New
York there's none so we're gonna go
there and then I think we're gonna go
back to the beach again which is kind of
weird that I put makeup on but like I
didn't want to look a little mall and I
was like if I run into subscribers I
don't want to embarrass myself again so
yeah um I put makeup on I did not do my
hair as you can probably tell but yes so
I just want to update you guys it's next
morning now so Saturday morning and yeah
so the dresses she got the dress in the
same please Burlington and that's what I
found my great deal on shoes to
sunglasses oh yeah wicked girl
okay so now we're in the food court and
the sad news is I won't type of coffee
kids who didn't even get anything like I
tried on a pair of jeans and I went to
the cash
for some reason I thought they were $30
and then I looked at their 50 and I was
like no thanks
because I was kind of only buying them
because I had like came all the way here
to go to the mall
well I was gonna get sweat pants there
and all of them had like glitter on them
and like no thanks but the guy working
there was very high and attractive so
like if you're watching this hit me up I
didn't even get anything the kind on
either but we did go to chick-fil-a and
I'm gonna give you a live action shot of
us opening I just lay oh my legs pulling
out of the box
I got chicken strips so yeah oh I got
lemonade - what did you good
chick-fil-a sauce I've heard it's really
good so I just chose that yeah okay
going in hi guys so I'm currently in the
bathroom of the cutest coffee shop ever
it's called blahblah Java and I wanted a
blog but there's lots of people out
there so show you once I get my drink
but yeah even the bathroom is cute so
I'll show you mine during once I get it
okay so I because I suck it was actually
amazing but if you are in like yeah so
yeah we're just laying out okay guys oh
maybe not looking at she's totally in my
blog right now but I'm just trying to
get this guy he's going out lady is like
I'm trying to zoom on him but she she
she's getting like a very important text
right now I don't really know what's
going on all right well you can see the
boy in the background oh he's going for
it he is going for it
hey guys the sky not looking too bad he
they're the one eating this was really
creepy because you didn't totally see me
I'm lucky he's not looking right now oh
there
okay I'm gonna be done now so we're
keeping on that guy over there and he
walked behind us so malwan let me turn
around and look and all of a sudden the
sky swooped in from behind me and he
started talking to me but I thought it
was gonna be that guy oh oh it wasn't it
was this group of like three little boys
okay now it was a sixteen but I'm 18 so
they were like hey like shaking my hand
and all that stuff and I was just like
no we saw you pretty ladies sitting here
from behind so we thought we'd come
introduce ourselves like no you are a
baby you see so yeah not exciting um
striped shirts is still out there
surfing I'm still watching why do you
think I'm going to California guys oh
it's actually to watch boys surfing so
just thought I'd update you guys on this
unfortunate happening all right
cute boys over there leaving which is
also unfortunate that was so awkward I
shook his hand it was sandy I went over
I know we thought it was that guy I
would have been so excited why are they
leaving was the keys come talk to Tom I
know I wish good things to happen to me
like that okay bye all right guys he
found a new specimen indefinitely
awkward because his mom is the one
you go taking speech her thing was going
down earlier but you guys I've probably
couldn't get any see people like I
thought you guys
so they're currently in a restaurant
worst lighting I've ever seen in my life
but once again I was creeping on boys
not now because she's a boyfriend from
me that's all I do
and we found a babe oh gee babe and when
he comes out I'll show you guys oh my
god okay so we just got back from dinner
and it was really good
and if you saw we got creepy footage of
that busboy we're honestly this whole
vlog was us creeping on boys and
honestly it's mostly me quitting on boys
because Mel is a boyfriend so basically
what you guys have probably learned from
this is I'm creepy and probably meant to
be single because I creep on so many
boys so yeah tomorrow we're leaving and
we're leaving like kind of early so I
probably won't blow but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this vlog give it a thumbs
up and have anything you say oh I look
really ugly right now um follow me at
Instagram and Twitter I'm gonna put them
right here and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
