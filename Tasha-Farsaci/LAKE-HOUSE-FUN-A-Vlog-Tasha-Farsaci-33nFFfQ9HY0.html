like a bug bite somebody okay well I
wake up the next morning and if this is
my back this is what's on it it's like a
big lump and it wasn't a chi it just
like my whole entire back was aching so
then it progressively like it's worse
and so I'm putting like ointment on it
and I punch of a creams am i trying to
dry it up with alcohol and then it looks
like this by the end of this first day
so the next day after go to the doctors
and they're like oh well you got bit by
a spider or something and it has turned
into an infection with like a cyst under
