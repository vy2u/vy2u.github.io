you are new here my name is Tasha and on
this channel I do fashion beauty
lifestyle all that stuff so if you guys
are new it feel free to subscribe that
would be awesome so today I'm just
filming a little life update I've been
getting a lot of questions just about
things that have been going on in my
life or what I'm doing this summer and I
kind of just wanted to update you guys
and then also get some of your opinions
and feedback on some stuff so I just
decided I do it all in this video and I
figured if you are watching this video
you're probably one of my more loyal
subscribers so I would love your advice
and opinions so yes if you guys aren't
following me on Instagram already and
you want to keep up with my life on a
more personal basis I'm posting on there
all the time I post stories a lot I try
to post frequently on my feed as well so
if you guys want to follow me it's just
Tasha dug in the world to me okay I know
I'm gonna get a lot of questions
probably on this shirt I'm wearing it's
actually just a scarf that I have tied
and I got it for a vintage store in New
York City so I can't really help you on
that but you can find scarves like this
on Amazon you can find them thrifting
all over the place so I definitely
recommend them always sirens when I'm
filming okay I know I was gonna forget
what I'm talking about so I have a list
on my phone of just like the stuff I
wanted to kind of go over okay so a lot
of you guys have been asking me what I'm
doing this summer and I have pretty much
told you what I'm doing but I'll go more
into detail oh these sirens
okay so originally I just wanted to
focus on YouTube this summer and not get
an internship or anything because I have
done that in the past and it was fine
but I felt like I just really wanted to
focus on YouTube stuff this summer and
then a girl in my sorority actually
recommended me for an internship that
she had had the previous year so I ended
up going and interviewing with them I
had a phone interview and I also went
into their office and met with them and
they offered me the position so I was
really excited about it and they were
like okay we're gonna send you you know
all the information and the start dates
really soon yeah so they told me that
they were going to email me with all the
info for when I would start and stop and
then they just never did I thought it
was super weird that they didn't follow
up so I emailed them and then they still
didn't follow up again they didn't
answer so I emailed them one more time
before I ended up going home for two
weeks and I was like hey I haven't heard
back from you I just wanted to let you
guys know that I'm going home for two
weeks but when I get back I would still
love to work for you guys
let me know what you think just
something like that and they never
answered so I basically got ghosted and
it was like fine it was just a part-time
position and everything I would have had
to go to it so the money I'd be making
would kind of be a wash from the uber
money so it's really not a big deal I
just thought it'd be like fun and
something to put on my resume but
whatever I was ghosted so yeah I'm not
doing that I am just focusing on YouTube
so I'm really really trying to upload a
lot and I do want your opinion on what
you guys want me to film I'll get into
that a little more later on okay and
this is actually super exciting because
I don't have a typical job you know
where I have to work five days a week or
anything like that I have a lot of space
for traveling and somewhere I wanted to
go for as long as I can remember is
London and it didn't really ever work
out I wanted to study abroad there and I
ended up deciding against that just
because I wanted to spend as much time
at USC
I could because I was a transfer and all
this stuff I just really wanted to you
know spend time on the campus as a
student and I told myself that I would
travel afterward or when I have friends
there or whenever I get the chance
so my really good friend Nikki from high
school is actually studying in London
for a little over a month this summer
and she invited me to come visit her at
the same time my other friend Maddie is
visiting room so I'm gonna be in London
July 6th through I think the 13th or the
14th
if you guys have any recommendations for
where I should look for Airbnb s totally
let me know because I love looking for
Airbnb I love finding them but I've
never been to London before us so if you
guys have any recommendations for London
in general or where to stay please let
me know just like the areas that are
cool or you guys like I think I would
like I'm sure Nikki will have
suggestions once she's kind of been
there a while but I kind of want to book
things quick so if you guys have
recommendations for that let me know I'm
so excited it's gonna be so fun being
there with two of my great friends from
high school and yeah I'm just really
excited I've wanted to go there for so
long
so yeah I'm doing that in July oh and
then something else people were asking
me is if I'm living in this house next
year and praise the heavens I am NOT
don't get me wrong I love living with
anne-marie and my other roommates this
year we're super awesome but I am so
cramped in my room if you guys watched
my moving vlog for when I moved in here
in the beginning of the year you'll know
that my room is so tiny for the amount
of stuff that I have and it's also just
really hard for me to film videos in
here I finally got a ring light that's
why my lighting so I'm a lot better but
it's just really crammed it's almost
impossible for me to film try on clips
and that kind of stuff so for my senior
year I'm actually at getting my own
apartment I am so so excited it is still
by USC so it's right off of campus and I
cannot wait it's gonna be a 1-bedroom
apartment I'm so excited to decorate it
I've already started looking at really
cute decor so I'm really excited it's
gonna be great for filming it's just
going to be great to chill and have a
lot of my own space and
I feel super cramped and in we graduated
anyway so it wouldn't be like I'm
leaving her and not living with her so
yeah I'm so excited and stay tuned for
like moving apartment videos I'm so
excited about that so I can't move in
there until August 15th I'm hoping that
I can get in a little sooner than that
but yeah until then I will be here in my
current house okay so that's kind of
what's going on with me
my current summer situation I know I'm
so lucky to be able to do this that's
like the ideal situation so yeah I just
feel so grateful to be in the position
that I am and have my job be something
that's so fun and what I love doing so
going off of that because I do want to
post a lot this summer I kind of want to
experiment with the things that I'm
posting obviously I love the types of
videos I already do but I've kind of
thought of a new video idea and I can't
really decide how I want to put it
together or how I want to structure it
or do it so that's where I thought I
would ask you guys I really want this
channel to be not just you know fashion
and clothes and that kind of stuff but
also like a place where you come and
feel like you're talking to a friend you
know what I mean whenever I do videos
that are more personal or like Q&amp;amp;A vibes
people are always like I love these
videos I love feeling like we're hanging
out so I kind of had this idea and it
all sparked from when I was writing my
final paper for one of my classes at USC
there's a social media class and I was
basically writing a research paper on
how social media negatively affects
romantic relationships that was my topic
so pretty much I was writing the paper
and it was a long paper I think it was a
12 page paper or something like that and
I was only on page like 6 or 7 and I
just didn't love how it was going I
didn't have a ton of perspectives on you
know romantic relationships and how
social media affects them like I only
had what I knew or like what came to my
mind so I decided that I was just gonna
try and post my Instagram story and ask
if any of you guys and he of my
followers had any experiences with
social media negatively affecting they
were
relationships and I thought I was gonna
get like five max ten responses because
it's kind of like a personal thing and
also I don't get a ton of responses
normally but guys I got hundreds of
responses from you guys and it was such
a cool experience for me I learned so
much more I had so much fun writing my
paper and it was just crazy to me how I
had this platform where I could just
talk to so many about so many of you
guys about these topics that so many
people clearly face and just don't
really talk about a lot so basically as
I was you know getting these responses
and posting and being like thank you
guys so much a lot of people were
messaging me and were like hey I would
love for you to publish your paper this
is super interesting I would love to
learn about it and I wasn't obsessed
with my paper it was supposed to be like
a research style so it wasn't you know
like fun and casual how I would want to
kind of talk about the topic about talk
about the topic yeah so this kind of
sparked my creativity and I was like I
would love to do videos that could
incorporate all of your guys's
perspectives into the video about a
topic and I don't really know how I want
to do this I don't know if I want it to
be kind of like you guys send me your
experiences and questions and I talk
about it or I just don't know how I want
to do it I'm not picky about you know
the topics that I talk about I just
think it's cool to have you know videos
about things that everyone's
experiencing but like sometimes could
feel alone in because you just don't
know how many other people are feeling
the same way that's something that was
crazy to me as I was getting so many
responses but a lot of them a lot of the
experiences were the same with different
people and I feel like those people when
they were in those circumstances must
have felt so alone and isolated and not
knowing what to do but little did they
know so many other people are feeling
the same exact way so I just want to do
a video of some sort that could kind of
like bring all this together and just
talk to you guys and yeah I really don't
know how to do it I don't even know what
topics I want
do it on but if you guys have any
recommendations or any ideas advice for
any of it or topic so I'm gonna talk
about please comment them down below it
would mean so much and I think it could
be a really cool new element to my
channel so yeah from now I think that's
pretty much the update I'm just living
my best life I'm so happy right now
so excited for the summer it's gonna be
great and I can't wait to film lots of
videos for you guys because this is
seriously what I love doing and during
the school year it gets really really
hectic and hard but now it's literally
all I have on my plate so I'm really
excited I love you guys so much and yeah
as always stay tuned for my next video
