headband and so do I here are a few
pictures of Lauren wearing the headband
and here is my recreation I hope you
guys like this and keep watching hi guys
so today I have a super fun hair
tutorial for you it is going to be a
Lauren Conrad inspired braided headband
and you guys may or may not know about
Lauren Conrad I mean you guys probably
do I love her she's like my idol
last summer basically my life consisted
of watching the hills on Netflix because
I don't have a life during the summer so
that's what I did and basically I saw
Lauren Conrad's braided headband all the
time so I really wanted to recreate it
for you guys because it's actually
pretty easy to do and it looks really
really cute and you're gonna get a ton
of compliments on it so I only need to
know how to do for this hairstyle is a
French braid which I kind of explained
during this video but if you don't know
how to do it even after I explained it
you can be sure to search it up in the
little youtube search bar because I
promise you there are hundreds of
tutorials on how to do a French braid on
YouTube and you're also going to need
just a little elastic to tie off your
hair at the end of the braid which is
down here somewhere
I just tied it off a little bit at the
end so you're gonna need one of those
and then other than that I don't think
you're gonna need anything else so this
is what the braid looks like I tucked it
behind my ear you'll see why in the
tutorial but I think it looks a really
similar to Lauren's and all of that and
I really love this this is also great
for school or a dance or anything
because it keeps your hair out of your
face
but it still looks really really cute
and pretty if you want to learn how to
do this really cute braided headband
then keep watching okay so what you're
gonna do to start off this hairstyle is
part your hair really far onto one side
and this is just going to ensure the
braid has a little bit farther to go and
form and I put my hair on this side
anyways but I'm just gonna go a little
further under that side if you pause
your hair on the side just go a little
further under that side or if you party
over in the middle you can choose either
side it doesn't really matter so I'm
just gonna pull my hair a little deeper
on this side if you see me looking over
here that's because I have a mirror
right there and that's what I'm gonna be
seeing myself while I do this so I'm
just going to
hurt my hair all the way over here and
believe it or not I actually support my
hair like this so yeah okay so once you
do that you're gonna get ready to start
the braid you're going to pick out thick
you want your little headband to be it
doesn't matter you should probably just
you know do like two or three inches
back from where your hair line starts so
I'm gonna go back to like about here and
then I'm just gonna do a nice straight
line all the way to behind my ear I'm
just gonna grab that here and then take
the rest of the hair that's not in that
section and just kind of put it behind
my head and secure away from the other
hairs and now I look really really
pretty each like this is so sexy right
now but this is the hair we're gonna be
working with for the headband um you
might not use all of this I probably
won't but you might it doesn't really
matter depending on how much hair you
bring in while you're doing your French
braid I like to use smaller pieces so
that's why I normally don't use all the
hair if you don't know how to French
braid be sure to look it up up in the
little info bar you know where you can
search for videos because there are
probably hundreds to thousands of how to
French braid videos on YouTube and I'm
gonna kind of show you in this window
but it's not gonna be super in-depth so
if you really want to know how to do it
really well before you start this
tutorial then I suggest you search it up
there okay so we're gonna start off by
taking a really thin section from the
top of the piece that we suctioned off
so this would be like then you might not
be able to tell what it is and we're
just gonna start by separating it into
three sections and I'm gonna do one
normal braid first
okay so now we're going to start into
the French braid so basically a French
braid is just like a normal braid except
when you're crossing the pieces over you
add more hair into the pieces before you
do so so as you can see normally I would
cross this piece over the middle but
instead I'm going to add a little bit of
hair and then cross it over and then you
just do the same thing the whole time so
I'm taking this next piece and adding
hair from that side you want to make
sure you're adding hair from the same
side with the pieces on because you know
that's just how you do it
so you add hair to that side cross it
over and then you say the same thing and
a little bit and cross it over you want
to make sure you're keeping this very
tight so you don't get any annoying bump
so loops or anything like that because
of those bother me so much so once again
add a little piece of hair and then
cross it over I had a piece then cross
it over
this hairstyle is great because it gets
the hair out of your face which is
always a plus okay so once you get to
about here I might go one more time
alright so once you get to about here
you're just gonna braid down normally
all the way down your section of hair so
I'm gonna do that now and I'll be right
back
and once you go to the bottom you're
just gonna tie it off with an elastic
okay so this is what I look like and it
doesn't look very cute right now so
first I'm gonna take down the rest of my
hair and you can choose to leave the
braid out front like this but what
Lauren does is takes the braid and then
puts it behind her ear and then puts the
rest of the hair over top of it and
you're gonna see I have a little loop
right here so I'm just gonna kind of try
to fix that right now by just pushing it
into the braid and then attempting to
like pull it out a little bit okay so
this is the final look as you can see
it's just french braided and then behind
my ear and I pull the piece through or
whatever and this is definitely what I
see that Lauren wears a lot especially
on the hills when I used to watch that
show so this is the final look I hope
you guys enjoyed I probably should have
braided my hair down a little further
right here but oh well um if the braid
doesn't want to stay behind yet you know
you can always secure it with a bobby
pin
