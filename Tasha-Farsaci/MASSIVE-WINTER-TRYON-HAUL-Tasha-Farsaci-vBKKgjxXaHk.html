and cold outside and dark I filmed this

not the best really quickly before I get
into showing you the products if you

okay so the first place I have things
from is adore me
I apologize times I love them so so much
so I'll give you guys a little bit of
background on them in case you are new

so basically adore me is a website that
carries bras and underwear lingerie

underwear honestly they have so many
things all on that realm sort of realms
so you can sign up for adore me as a VIP

that or you can just go on as you know a
normal shopper and buy things one of the
time and not have to sign up or anything
okay so if you guys have never shopped

that's without the membership but if you
do want to get the membership you can
get your first set for only $15 which is
literally crazy I'm gonna put all the
links to sign up and all the information
in the description box but seriously
guys it's an amazing deal and I love
adore me so much I'm wearing adore me a
bra right now for me so yeah I recommend
it okay so first I'm going to show you
the bras that I got from adore me so
when you buy a bra you also get matching
underwear which is amazing I literally
feel so much better about myself
I'm wearing a matching bra and underwear
set so that's what I mean by set and
everything that you buy individually and
Rahmi is considered a sex so even if
it's just like a robe that would be a
set if that makes sense anyway so this
is the first bra I got this one is so
beautiful it is burgundy with some like
salmon pink detailing it has a little
bit of push up because my boobs are very
small and I need all the help I can get
so this one is really pretty I like
wearing thongs that's just me I don't
like underwear lines so I always get the
matching thong so this is the matching
thong to that okay moving on I got this
a push-up bra this one is like the add
two cups one I haven't sinned rad and I
really like it so I wanted it in black
as well it's super pretty and lacy
unfortunately this one did not come
along option so I just opted for the
bikini style that it came with so it
looks like this the next bar I got is so
pretty and this one is not push up it's
just like lightly lined and it's this
really pretty greyish purple color and
it kind of um it like goes up on the
side so it kind of looks like a bralette
except you have like the coverage of a
bra and then the back is like a bra but
this is just so pretty I love this and
then the phone came with this one looks
like this okay adore me also has bra
let's so if you're more of a bralette
girl then have no fear I got this really
pretty black roll I already have the
light pink one of this style and I
really liked it so I wanted the black
one it looks like this it's a deep v in
the front as well as the back and then
the underwear that it comes with are
awesome as well I just got the thong and
it has like a little key little bit
jeweled thing I'm good for hunt okay so
the last bra under our side I got from
adore me it's gonna be kind of hard to
show I'm gonna insert a photo of what it
looks like on the model because I was
not being trying these on I will not be
I will not be trying these on because
there's some weird people on the
internet but this one is so cool it's
just like a black super strappy bra let
it just has lace to line the boobs I'm
not sure if I'm showing you this right
way yeah I am anyway it's just like
really strappy and cool I wanted this
too
peak out of Phoenix and stuff like that
and then the underwear came with once
again did not have a thong option these
are crazy I don't even know how many
will show you they're basically like
regular underwear but they have all this
extracting stuff going on the front
you'll see in the photo in the butt is
like Shiro match super cool this set is
awesome okay moving on I got some
pajamas from adore me the first one I
got is this classic looking pajama set I
really like it it's just black with some
white detailing and it's a long-sleeved
like so and then the bottoms match
they're just black and then the bottoms
look like this this is so comfy I've
already won this too bad I really love
this I got an extra small and it fits me
perfectly so if you're short like me
I recommend the pattern on this next
pajama set was so cute I could not pass
it up so the top looks like this it's
just like a purpley color and then the
back has like a little lace thingymajig
but I love the pants so much they're
just this floral Paisley kind of pattern
and they're so soft guys I can't even
tell you
oops they're so soft and just long and
nice and I really love this in the last
thing I got from adore me is this black
robe
the only robe I have right now is a
fuzzy robe would Weiner dogs on it so I
figured I needed a more like classy robe
so this is just like a black silky short
robe like super sexy you feel great when
you wear this and I just thought it was
like really mature and something that I
wanted to add to my nightly wardrobe
morning wardrobe whatever yeah so I
seriously love adore me so much like I
said I'm gonna put all the information
as well as the links to the products
down below I totally totally recommend
them ok moving on the next place I have
things from is boohoo calm but who is so
affordable and they have so many
products on your website I promise you
guys will find something that you like
so I basically have a ton of stuff to
show you as well as a discount code so
the discount code that I have is only
for United States buyers and boo who
said this was because they already have
tons of codes available for their UK
market or other markets but for the US I
do have a code I'm gonna put
screen it's for half off everything like
that's crazy you half off so I'm gonna
put it on the screen as well as the
description and I totally take advantage
of bad because that makes everything
even more crazily affordable okay so the
first thing I got is just this black top
it's probably gonna be kind of difficult
to show so I will be doing Tryon Clips
like this video for me doing Tryon Clips
because this is a lot of stuff did you
try on Clips for anyways it's just this
black long sleep it crosses in the front
which I just thought was a cool detail
and then it kind of like comes to a
point in the front really cute the next
thing I got is actually from the
plus-size section it's just a t-shirt
and I wanted it to be oversized on me so
I got it in the plus size I think it was
only available in the plus-size section
which is fine so I really like how it
fits it's just this black top with these
Rose embroidered patches by like the
boobs rose embroidery is so trendy right
now and I just thought this was really
cool and it's super soft next I got this
denim skirt I absolutely love the denim
skirt trend and this one was different
than anyone I have it has a zipper going
on the front and then it's like a little
bit asymmetrical as you can see so I
just thought this was so cute next I got
this off the shoulder top it has black
and white vertical stripes on it and
then the sleeves kind of flare out this
is also a huge trend right now off the
shoulder as well as a vertical stripes
okay the next thing I got is this black
and white plaid skirt it's a little
bigger than I wanted you'll see I kind
of struggled with the sizing on the
skirts this woman is a little bit bigger
than I wanted but I still think I can
make it work I just thought it was
really cute and gave off like a
schoolgirl vibe okay this next skirt
like I said I I got them in the smallest
sizes that we're on the website but I'm
thinking they might have sold out with
the smallest ones and I just thought
these are the smallest ones cuz they
were like the smallest ones listed
because this is like a UK or us four and
I were on a zero so I think I can make
this one work it took a really tangle
right now or am i doing uh so basically
it's just this long piece of faux suede
fabric with these ties and you kind of
like wrap it around you so I'm sure I
can make this one work
it's really cute it's just like there's
camel color unfortunately this next one
is too big on me so I think I'm going to
give it to a friend but
so cute it says Burgundy faux suede
skirt and then I have these like ties on
the side uh I was just fit me because
I'm obsessed with it I think it's so
cute
I got another skirt this one is a faux
leather skirt this one is from the
petite line although I don't really
think it fits me super short so I really
know anyways it's faux leather and then
it kind of has an asymmetrical hem in
the front this will be really nice for
going out in I got this black bodysuit
this is also from the petite line this
just kind of like goes cross across in
the front and then it goes down into a
bodysuit
this next shirt I'm really confused
about because it just fits me very small
and it says it's a size us four so I
just don't only know about the fit on
this it's still cute it's just not what
I was expecting it's this kind of taupe
colored turtleneck sort of mock neck
thing and then it's just like a regular
shirt like I said this everything is
small the sleeves are kind of short I
still think it can be cute it's just not
what I was expecting out of it next I
got this giant beanie I haven't really
figured out how to wear this one just
because it's so giant maybe I'll fold it
over or something but this is super
super cozy and just warm and perfect for
New York where I am right now I'm
obsessed with flannels so I got this
cropped flannel because I don't have a
crop flannel yet and it's just this
really nice green black and blue print
and it's cropped I just think this would
be really cute with like a mini skirt or
just high-waisted pants cute and just
something I don't have this one is super
lightweight so it's not the best to keep
you warm next thing I got is one of my
favorites it's just a pair of dark wash
boyfriend jeans I like boyfriend jeans
because they can be too long I can just
cuff them so these ones are super ripped
I didn't have a pair of dark wash ripped
boyfriend jeans so I like these they're
a little bit big in the waist I got a
size us two but I could probably wash
them or just like you know just rock it
the next thing I got is a pink sweater
and this fits a little bit tighter than
I would like it's still really cute
though this is a size small medium it
has like a maken
and then it just goes down you know nice
normal knit sweater okay I got this
denim jacket the cool thing about it
though is that it has that same trendy
it rose embroidery on the arm this I got
a size medium because I wanted it to be
a little oversized and I'm glad I did so
this is really cute and trendy okay and
the very last thing I got from boohoo is
my favorite so I saved it for last I've
really been loving the faux suede vest
trend would like the fur on the inside
and I love this one so much it's this
super fuzzy kind of light tan taupe
color there's like a thread on the back
it looks like this and that has like
this faux fur fuzzy stuff on the inside
I just think this is so cute and I
cannot wait to bundle up and wear this
so why does everything from boohoo like
I said I will be linking all of it down
below as well as putting the discount
code down there guys totally take
advantage of that because there are so
many cute things on the site okay and
the last door I have things from is Gian
calm I love that I get stuff from them
all the time and I have a lot to show
you so I'm gonna hop right into that
before this video becomes 24 hours long
okay the first thing I got is this pair
of white fold other slide ons and I got
these solely for the purpose of wearing
to college parties if you guys follow me
on snapchat you would have seen my white
converse in numerous snaps because they
look like brown gray converse they're
disgusting because you really can't
clean them I put them in the washing
machine they just don't get clean so I
figured if I had a pair of like faux
leather I could easily just like wipe
the dirt off them and I mean perfect and
I think these are really really cute so
these are from Cheyenne if you guys need
shoes for college I totally recommend
these because your shoes will public
every wouldn't at parties and I like
white converse I think they're cute so I
don't want them to be ruined but these I
feel like I could easily work the dirt
off so yeah I'm excited to start wearing
these okay the next thing I got from she
and I was actually wearing my snapchat
last night I got this because I knew I
was going to be in New York for winter
break and I was gonna be so cold so it's
just this giant sweater coat thing like
I don't even know how to explain what it
is it has this like faux Sherpa
kind of material and
the sleeves are like sweater sleeves and
then the inside is the softest thing
I've ever felt oh my gosh I was
literally bundled up in this last night
it has like giant pockets maybe not the
most fashionable thing ever but this
like lounging around in the house it's
like so cozy oh my gosh it feels like I
have a sheep I'm just like hugging the
Sheep right now okay the next thing from
Cheyenne I really like it's just too big
on me it's just this it's this a lace-up
a black a faux suede skirt I really like
it the quality is amazing it's super
soft it just like I said is too big I
got a size too small everything I get is
like the smallest size on the website
unless I say otherwise and this was just
way too big well my favorite trends
slash things to wear when I don't know
what to wear is an overall dress I have
a bunch already so I thought that they
had a green that quarter I wanted which
I just thought was super unique and I
did not have so it looks like this this
was so affordable on the website I think
this was like ten dollars I'm not even
kidding the strap is kind of twisted
right now but it looks like this it has
a pocket in the front and then it has
some pockets in the back this is a
little bit thing on me but I think it
works I think it looks fine with the
whole life look at them going for the
next thing I got I'm totally obsessed
with it's gonna be kind of difficult to
show you off but it's this Mac Mac
waffle made sure it kind of like mmm it
crosses over in the front and then like
drapes down this is so cute with like
leggings and boots and it's just like
oversized okay next out of her jeans I
really know why I got these because I
have a pair that looks similar they're
just medium watch and then they have
holes up in these I wish these were
ankle jeans they fit me kind of long so
I might be cutting off the bottoms a
little bit but yeah these fit well
they're nice and tight how I like them
I'll probably just be cutting the
bottoms okay the next thing from
Cheyenne is my favorite thing that I got
this looks exactly like a Free People
item I was literally in Lord and Taylor
and I was looking at the Free People one
and then this came in the mail the same
day and they look the same so it's just
this army green jacket but the cool
thing about it is that the sleeve has
all this beading on it I don't know I
just think that's like a stupid cool
detail I really like it
and then the bottom is kind of like
distress it just it looks just like the
free people one I love it so much it's
like nice and heavy and I feel like I
can throw this on over anything another
one of my favorites with machine is this
sweater I was wearing this in an
Instagram post the other night and
enough lob and you guys were all asking
where it's from
it's just this sweater but the cool
thing about this sweater is that the top
is one of the tops that goes off the
shoulder and kind of like folds over
which I love love love that trend right
now so I really love this almost done
all right I got this jacket it needs to
be like ironed or skiing or something
because it's a little bit wrinkly it's
just this white wool kind of material
it's like a moto jacket and then it has
like some faux leather detailing which
is really cool and it has like also that
leather detailing on the sleeves a
little bit I just thought this would be
really cute for layering this was one of
the only items that disappointed me
because I thought the threading on this
was gonna be green and white but it's
green and silver which is kind of weird
also the neckline is kind of weird it's
kind of like wrinkly looking I don't
know this isn't awful but it's not what
I expected it to look like okay I was
really excited about this item because
it looks just like when I almost bought
at PacSun it is this adorable dusty pink
off-the-shoulder tie top sweater it's so
beautiful as you can see the bottoms
have like scalloping the only thing is
the sleeves are way too long for me on
this and you can't really cuff these
sleeves that just like wouldn't look
right I think you would need to be a lot
taller to wear this because as you will
see in the Tryon the sleeves are way too
long which was really sad okay and the
very last thing I got is the shirt I'm
wearing it's just this deep v ribbed
black crop top I just thought it was
going to be a super versatile and I
could wear it a ton of different places
I have a top like this that's like brown
and I've already worn it a lot so I saw
this and I figured it would be great and
I do really really like it it is nice
Wow so that was probably the longest
haul I've ever filmed hopefully I can
kind of cut this down and make it not
too unbearably long for you guys but if
you made it all the way through cover
down below and tell me you made it all
the way through because no kudos to you
