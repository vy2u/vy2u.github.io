good morning good morning how many hours
did you sleep for okay so like I have a
final tomorrow at 8 a.m. and I was like
really tired yesterday because I
couldn't go to sleep and I was like
Tasha should I just go sleep really
early today
and she was like she was leaning towards
no cuz I would have studied a little and
I was like but then I could wake up
really early tomorrow and I slept 12
hours and look at that time I was like
anyway you won't wake up early and she's
like yes I will and I'm like yep anyway
you asked me if I wanted pomegranate
seeds and in my dueling one would feel
what they taste like nothing like they
just taste like water to me really yeah

eat them and I just tell myself I like
them but they just taste like water like
kind of crunchy and like tangy nope okay

nothing in this color this is look at
these people oh that's so pretty red
lava and it's orange color looks so cute
on you hey thanks guys I really don't
have anything orange so this is perfect
I like this color that's a good sign oh
really nice yeah I think that's nice
it's like it's like you can be dressed
up I don't look classy too
yeah I feel like this would be really
nice for like work too because I never
really know I'd wear for work but this
is like literally what you would wear
for work that's a good color yeah thank
you I like it
yay long 55 that's adorable oh my gosh
yeah it's yours that's why I was calling
you oh my gosh I'm so cute literally
that fits you perfectly
yeah oh my gosh okay guys so I just
filmed my haul video he was like the
aftermath but I'm starving I'm about to
go to alpha P to get lunch because today
is chili day and I'm obsessed with their
chili it's so good I'll put a picture in
because you guys have been saying you
like when I put the pictures in so yeah
I'm excited
hey guys I'm about to leave to go take
some photos with LF I don't know how
much filming I will do I'm just really
not sure how it's like gonna go down but
I'll try to film the outfits at least
Hey
just because I only have time to I've
literally left my camera and my phone
and her car when she took the pictures
I'm just about to walk to Whole Foods
because it was pretty close and I'm
really really thirsty so I thought they
might have something and there's also a
Dunkin Donuts across the street it's
like one of two in LA so I kind of want
to go so it is this is like the
prettiest Whole Foods ever and then if I
remember right I feel like the Dunkin is
like somewhere around here as well
so I just got a smoothie from Whole
Foods and now I've been waiting for my
uber for like 10 minutes and it hasn't
moved
Presley concerned what
we just got a strawberry banana almond
milk hey guys so I've been back for a
while it's honestly so cold my room I'm
like bundled up but basically like I was
saying on the street I don't really blog
a lot I write at all when I was taking
pictures because it was literally I was
like changing in her car like I would
change into an outfit and then we'd go
back on the street and take pictures I'd
go back in like I didn't even have my
camera or my phone or anything so I
didn't vlog but I'll insert pictures of
like each outfit there were three
outfits um yeah I like I really like
shooting with Elif because I think their
clothes are really cute but they're
super like out of my comfort zone if you
guys know LF you'll know what I mean
I think like those summery stuff is
usually more like in my comfort zone but
um yeah there's stuff like super edgy so
like I like shooting with them cuz it's
like gives me outfit ideas so like I
normally wouldn't wear but anyways I did
that and got a smoothie at Whole Foods
which actually it was pretty affordable
like I thought that their smoothies
would be so expensive but I think it was
like five dollars which is kind of cheap
to me at least because literally the
place about USC sell smoothies for $12 I
don't know if there's something wrong
with me but like I just never feel the
urge to study like I'll study the day
before and I'll feel fine I don't know
if it's just the classes that I've
always taken but I don't know I've never
really been a huge stud here so I feel
like everyone is just like freaking out
with finals and stuff and I'm just kind
of like chillin but I think tomorrow I'm
gonna start um doing work because I have
a paper to write thinking of going to
get food at the sorority house because I
don't have any food here I'm not
starving but I feel like I should go
anyways okay guys this angle is really
unflattering okay I just got a package
from the girl in the water which is a
swimsuit kind of swimwear website and I
ordered this forever ago literally like
Cyber Monday and it was like coming from
California but for some reason the
shipment most like delayed or something
so I finally got it and I couldn't
include in my Black Friday haul so I
figured I would just open it here
so this is my favorite style of swimsuit
that I have it's by Frankie's bikinis I
have it in two colors so you guys a
couple a caution we need this which like
I know I didn't eat it but it was like
close to 70% off but I knew I would
never get it again
so our being able to get it again so
cheaper Oh
oh my gosh it's so pretty okay it's this
one-piece swimsuit and it's just really
pretty blue floral print and then it's
all crochet it along the stomach you
guys if you follow me on Instagram
you've probably seen me post and the
other ones I have I have it in black and
then like this um periwinkle blue color
it's just so flattering the sides like
lace up I don't know if you can see that
they like lace up all down and then it's
like cheeky but it's not like obscenely
cheeky like a lot of my stuff is um but
this is really cute because you can wear
these as like body suits with shorts and
stuff they're really cute for the summer
so that's why I justified it excited to
wear it in Mexico I'm going to Puerto
Verta for spring break so yeah now I
think I'm just gonna finally start
working on my paper okay guys so I
finished my little assignment a while
ago and I've just kind of been like
laying in bed chilling out I wanted to
thank you guys because yesterday I
talked about how I wanted a pair of
joggers from Lululemon and they were all
too long and one of you guys or maybe
more than one of you guys recommended
that I look at atleta
because they have petite sizes so I was
looking there and I think I'm gonna get
a pair from there so thank you to
whoever recommended that anyways um I
was laughing so hard because I posted
this picture on Instagram tail and said
it here and my caption was like
throwback to my wedding and I was joking
um basically at USC like every sorority
does this event called presents and all
the new members dress up in long white
dresses and I like presented to their
parents and parents weekend or whatever
it's just like a USC thing I don't know
explain it and everyone jokes about it
being like their wedding because you
look like you're getting married and
like numerous people commented and we
like Congrats like I know you were
married and like I guess if you like
didn't follow my life maybe you wouldn't
know that I'm not even close to ever
being married but I just thought that
was so funny so I like put a little
Asterix in my caption and was like this
is a joke I'm not actually married I
thought that was funny and then someone
also commented and asking like how I
have two bigs because I always get this
question as well people are like so
confused why I have two bigs basically
one of my bags is a senior and one is a
sophomore and I'm a junior so the they
both liked me and both wanted me as
their little and since Brooke the older
one is graduating and she didn't want me
to just have a big for one year so it
made sense for me to have two so once
she graduates I'll still have someone
else and my little once I take a little
will still have like a grand big which
is Anna the one younger than me so yeah
basically they both wanted me as their
little and they're really good friends
too so they just asked if they could
both have me and that's what happened so
yeah I've been getting questions about
that and if you guys have no idea what
I'm talking about I'm talking about my
sorority um yeah I think I'm just gonna
end off the vlog here I'm probably gonna
go to bed soon I'm like actually really
tired but thank you guys so much for
watching this vlog I hope this one
wasn't too boring
but yeah I love you guys so much and
stay tuned for my next vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
