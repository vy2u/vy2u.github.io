the lighting is really weird it's like a
weird time of day and I feel like I'm
looking kind of blue but I'll try and
correct it when I'm editing anyways so
this video is going to be a week in my
life
vlog for Thanksgiving break because if
you guys follow me on social media you
know that I'm going to Texas which is so
so random Oh
basically what happened is ever since I
graduated high school my parents have
wanted to move out of New York where I'm
from and they've been looking at a bunch
of different places they looked at
Florida for a while and they've always
thought they kind of wanted to look in
Texas like they've never been there I've
never been there and they have a friend
that lives there so I guess they decided
to look in Texas over Thanksgiving and
they asked me if I want to come so I was
like yeah so we're going to be in Austin
Texas and we're staying at the guest
house of their friends he like rented
out for Airbnb yeah so I'm really
excited to go to Austin I've never been
there before and I've heard some cool
things about it so yeah maybe after this
trip my family will end up moving to
Texas like who knows I mean it doesn't
really apply to me because I don't live
at home anymore I don't know how long
this vlog is going to be I really do
want to keep it in one video but if it
is too long I'll probably end up
splitting it okay guys that really hurt
my arm I'm gonna have to get used to
that but I'm gonna like sit down here
for right now so I can ask you guys what
I want to ask you so basically I really
really like vlogging I just don't do it
a lot which is why I don't have a vlog
channel and I was thinking what I really
wanted to vlog miss this year which if
you guys don't know what that is
basically means you vlog every day of
December up until Christmas and it's
really fun so I have like two questions
that I want to ask you guys about the
first one is would you guys mind if it's
just on this channel so I don't only
want to make a vlog channel just for
vlogmas because I feel like a lot of
people won't find the videos I don't
watch the videos and like outfits on my
main channel like more of you guys will
see it or more people will find them so
yeah would you guys mind if I'm posting
like every day on my main channel I'll
probably be posting other videos as well
obviously but without like annoy you
guys I just want to make sure you guys
are okay with that and then secondly
okay so I don't go home to New York for
my Christmas break until December 14th
and up until then in December I feel
like it's gonna be really boring like
I'm going to
you studying for finals all my friends
are going to be studying for finals
really going home so I don't know if I
want to vlog the first half of December
like well I'm still at school just
because like I said I go to Community
College ik that's not exciting and to
show you guys like I know I'm probably
not going to be doing a lot of I've been
studying so what do you guys think I
should do do you guys think I should
just love those days if they're really
boring and like the same thing every day
you guys don't mind or we should I just
start once I go home or should I just
blow the days I'm doing stuff here and
then vlog every day sigh in the 14th
yeah if that made sense I hope it did
but yeah let me know what you guys think
I should do I just don't want to be
posting boring vlogs because then people
won't want to watch the rest of loudness
and I have to leave for the airport in
like 10 minutes or so I have a direct
flight so that's nice okay so in case
you guys are curious about an airport
out for the day I have my hair up in
this bond it was literally a disaster
this morning I'm just wearing this
choker that I made and then I have this
USC like crewneck sweatshirt thing this
one's kind of weird it's like almost
tight get two really fitted and like
small but anyways yeah this I'm wearing
some Lululemon crowd wonder unders my
gray ones and then I'm just wearing my
adidas superstars so yeah really
comfortable and yeah hi guys so it's the
next day and I made it to Texas and
we're just going to the COS Deli cuz I
really want a sandwich so we're actually
by UT Austin campus I even realized
there's really like a sorority house
over there somewhere so yeah we're going
to steli i don't remember the name of it
exactly but once I'm in there I'll tell
you and I'll show you my sandwich and
stuff but yeah it's cool I don't know
what we're going to really do today I
probably just like explore a little bit
yeah
okay so we're going to friend condos
Delhi oh no what if it's not open it
better be open no guys no I'm so hungry
we came to pop belly sandwiches instead
so oh yeah
see my dad is five years old so he
decided he wanted a photo in between
these balls so yeah just let that sink
in nice okay so this was just a really
cute shop on South Congress it was
called the gypsy wagon I don't know one
of you guys told me I should go there so
I just kind of showed you guys around
the store it was really cute they had
kind of like souvenir gifts and stuff
and then there was some clothing I got
some earrings from here that were really
cute but yeah and then there were these
boyfriend candles and they smelled like
different types of men and I thought it
was the funniest thing ever so I wanted
to show you guys because you know anyone
else that's single AF like me haha lol
smiley face so you guys recommended
Joe's coffee so here I am
I got the classic turbo I think it's
like chocolatey coffee and espresso and
hazelnut and a bunch of fun stuff so
yeah I'm gonna try it
make me stuff okay so we just got back
to the house that we're staying at my
parents are like sitting out front and I
just got some stuff on South Congress
people told me to go to that Street and
I got like two things my parents got me
some things for Christmas just like your
eggs and socks I guess I'll show you and
then I bought a pair of Frye boots which
was not expected but they were at this
vintage shop and they were a lot cheaper
I think than they would be normally
maybe I'm wrong you guys can let me know
I'm sure you guys would know better than
me but I've been wanting a pair of Frye
boots for so long I just like I don't
wear a lot of tall I don't know I do
like I saw these and I hadn't seen
anything like these before and I thought
they were really cool so I will show you
okay so the vintage shop was called
prototype vintage design and this is
what they look like I didn't know if
they were to like Western II but I put a
picture on Twitter and you guys said no
they were cute so yeah I got these and I
think they'd be so cute with just some
like ankle jeans and a big chunky
sweater and these were 100 and I got
them for 108 plus tax which i think is
definitely a lot cheaper than you would
get them normally they're like super
lightly used like barely worn and I just
think they're really cool so I got these
and then I don't know if these are like
all wrapped okay the other things are
really wrapped and I don't want to
unwrap them because they're going to be
Christmas gifts but I just got a pair of
pug socks that I've been wanting for so
long and I almost ordered them online
once and then I never did cuz I don't
wanna pay shipping then they had them in
a store I'll put a picture like here and
then I got a pair of like you stud
earrings so yeah that's what I did today
I think we're just gonna like hang out
for a little bit and then probably go to
dinner or something so I'll finish
vlogging there yeah they came to
Torchy's tacos
and I got two tacos so we'll see if
they're good
hi guys happy Thanksgiving so it's the
next day now Thursday Thanksgiving and
basically we're just going to a
restaurant that's serving Thanksgiving
food since we like it not at home like
there's I guess a kitchen what we're
saying but there's not like cooking
supplies or anything like that so yeah
I'm fine with that we're just going to
some restaurant I don't over the name
but like once I get there I'll let you
know as long as they have mashed
potatoes I'm good with it
so yeah I'm wearing the six suede dress
that I got from the LF outlet I will
show you guys more later but basically
yeah there was an LF outlet on Melrose
in LA and this was like $20 as opposed
to I just looked at the tag 154 dollars
so hi guys okay so the Lighting's really
dark I don't know how to fix it but
anyways we try to go to the place that
we were getting Thanksgiving at and they
didn't take reservations and the wait
was four hours so we like put our name
down and I guess we're gonna go back in
four hours but I like hadn't eaten
anything today so you're trying to find
places that are open that I could just
get like a snack and the only thing open
is what a burger I've never been to one
I have only heard of it either so
um yeah I just my parents are gonna get
me like chicken strips I don't know if
they're gonna get something but yeah so
I guess we're just gonna like hang out
or drive around or something until we go
back there and I guess it'll be fine
because we're still gonna be eating at
like dinnertime instead of like
lunchtime so yeah that's what's
happening um kind of a mess but you know
it's okay oh boy
Thanksgiving so some of you guys
recommended coming to silver Park we
came here to kill some time and the
skylines really pretty there's some
really cute dogs so that's good
Punkie though and I want mashed potatoes
eventually well we finally made it in
and I was kind of confused because the
mashed potato bin was empty and we just
found out there is no more mashed
potatoes are you kidding me
not okay so I'm eating these right now
I'm pretty sad it's okay so we were
driving by and there was tons of people
standing we remembered they're supposed
to be bats but fly out of here so we're
going to wait and see there's any bats
we've been waiting for these stupid bats
for like 25 minutes and nothing's
happening so it's probably going to be
just like the mashed potato
we're just waiting and really looking
forward to it and they're just gone so
we'll see if not we'll have to like
insert a photo of what it's supposed to
look like but nothing yet
okay so I'm currently standing in the
bathroom and I just realized that I
actually had a lot of vlog footage from
yesterday and today and I didn't want to
do any longer because I don't want the
video to be too long I feel people will
get bored and just won't watch it so
thing that end off this vlog and if you
guys like this and want me to continue
vlogging throughout this trip comment
down below because I'm going to try and
post this tonight
so I'll be able to see her this feedback
and yeah if you guys want me to do a
second part to this I will but if you
guys don't I'm not gonna do it you know
what I mean so yeah basically we finally
got to eat at that place after like
waiting for hours and then we got there
and they were out of mashed potatoes and
I was so sad but yeah I hope you guys
