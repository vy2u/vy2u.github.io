don't know if there's something
yes so as you can probably tell I'm
standing in a nice beautiful location
that is my dorm room so pretty much ever
since I've uploaded my college moving
vlog you guys all like dorm to return to
her and I knew I want to do one I just
kind of kept putting it off for
different reasons
so basically I put it off until now and
my roommate is actually away for the
whole weekend so I figured now it even
time to do it I won't be bothering her I
won't be making her leave I won't be
like forcing her to clean her stuff like
she already cleaned her side she's gone
so I decided I would do what you want me
to wear for those of you who might be
new to my channel I go to Loyola
Marymount University it's in Los Angeles
California um it's a private school I'm
a freshman so I'm living in my normal
dorm with one roommate meal bathroom all
that stuff fun facts my dorm does not
have air conditioning so if I'm very
sweaty looking that's why I turn off the
fans because I don't want them to be
distracting in the back of this video so
I'm really really dying right now it's
84 in here and it's quite warm anyways
if you are looking to go to LMU I got
the newest dorms there's two buildings
for freshman housing that are the newest
they were built like maybe like five to
ten years ago and all the rest of the
dorms are pretty old so if you go here
you want one of the Del Rey's I am in a
Del Rey I'm not going to say which one
but yeah I'm gonna tell ray it's the
newer ones um they're a lot bigger as
you will see so yeah without further ado
I'm going to get right into my dorm tour
ok so I clearly do not have anyone to
film for me today so it's just gonna be
me behind the camera I hope that's okay
but when you first walk into the door
this is what it looks like and I guess
I'll kind of just give you like a
general overview from here we have like
some hooks on the actual dorm we have
this little chalkboard sign I wrote just
girly things on it hashtag just girly
things because my roommate Danielle and
I whenever something like stupid happens
would be like just girly things like I
don't know I guess you kind of had to be
there but there's our little evacuation
plan we've got our trash cans which I
just went and emptied just for the sake
of the video there's a water bottle in
there but whatever um this little hook
there's not really anything on there I'm
here me my hair
literally up right now is it so hot in
here but yeah so these are really
helpful they actually open we have like
tampons and stuff in there so I'm not
going to open that for you but yeah
these are really handy I'm not going to
show you like in depth of Danielle's
side but I figured I'd give you an
overview because her side is really cute
she has a full-length mirror here her
closet um closed
there's our fan it's just on her side
because she's not here but we honestly
just put it like wherever it will keep
us the coolest she has like some storage
units umm these storage unit things
these all come with the do I'm all like
the wooden stuff comes to the dorm so
she has that here's her bed we both
laughter our beds all the way up I know
everyone when I posted a picture on
Instagram was like oh my god that you're
gonna fall off like how do you get up
there you climb up on these you can step
on that like it's not the easiest thing
ever but it creates so much space and I
don't move when I sleep so like I'm not
gonna fall off but if you do look roll
around in your sleep I definitely
recommend not laughing your bed in
college but yeah so she has like all
this cute stuff under her desk this is
why we wanted to lock the beds because
we can just fit the desk and everything
underneath and it's like a little nook
um really cute she has pictures hanging
all around I love her comforter I know
it's a good duvet it's from urban
actually no it's a bed it's like a
snooze step so it is a comforter but
yeah that is like an overview of
Danielle sigh okay moving on to the
center of the room we have this room
here this was actually a recent purchase
umm it's looking a little off-white
right now it was white when we bought it
but you know it's gonna get dirty it's
College um we actually had a huge stain
in the middle of our rug when we moved
in I have a picture I'll put it like
here it was massive we don't know what
caused the stain we kind of like to joke
like someone fell off the bed and died
because it is massive um if you guys
know what causes stain you know let us
know but it was really gross and I
wanted to have something to cover it
especially when I made me to UM tour so
we finally bought this rug from Target
it's pretty big
um it shed too everywhere I literally
just like picked up a million fuzzies
before I filmed this but yeah it's not
bad
um it's a rug moving forward we have the
fridge and the microwave they came
with the dorm actually no we rented them
from the school they didn't come with it
but we went to them um yeah so I'm not
gonna show you the fridge right now
because it's kind of dirty and messy and
that's gross I'm about the microwave is
you know standard this is Danielle's
Keurig I use it as well sometimes and
then in this little bin we just have
like paper towels like forks and knives
and that kind of stuff you guys can see
my view is not the best we've got some
palm trees but honestly it's kind of
good because you can see the entrance to
my building so like you can totally see
when people are walking in oh that's
really creepy but like I can watch
people walk in yeah okay I'm really
that's like really creepy I shouldn't
have shared that but yeah it's still
really pretty out there as you can see
okay so moving on to my side I have
these hooks here danielle has Protel on
there I have my towel I have a green
jacket that I brought I brought so many
green jackets and honestly it's so hot
here I haven't been able to wear it I
have this lanyard from pink that I have
like my school ID on my bathrobe has
wiener dogs on it you guys help me know
I love pugs I also love wiener dogs and
then underneath I have my towel as you
can see I have a lot of like turquoise
things over here I have my mirror um
full-length mirror you know there's lots
of stains on the rug like honestly
they're not from aw stay were here and
we came so just disregard that here's my
closet um this little tee I actually
made I'm not gonna do which tutorial
I've talked about this before I talked
about in my dorm hall but it's actually
a video I watched up Cather outs I will
link it down below I actually had one
for Danielle but who randomly fell off
the wall one day and it broke so Ruth
isn't up there anymore but mine is still
intact I made it to like match my colors
I know a lot of you guys are probably
wondering about the closet situation and
you guys call me no I have a lot of
clothing I really didn't bring all my
clothing at all just because I didn't
bring sweaters and winter stuff here but
as you can see this is what the closet
looks like it's a pretty a good size
closet I mean especially for a dorm room
so I'll get a little closer I have my
massive suitcase up there have my camera
bag a box that I just put like food and
stuff in
I have all these hangers I got the felt
hangers because the stuff doesn't fall
off so that's really helpful I have like
more of my like not dressy things but
not like t-shirts and stuff there's my
laundry hamper I have some cokes and
sprite here in these little bins this is
actually a really really handy I have
like towels and then my mini steamer if
you can kind of see that and there I
have bras here I have two like little
mini crossbody bags my laundry bag I'm
like a beach bag and then a drawstring
that the school gave me there I have
underwear I believe in there I just have
jackets that I kind of just stuff in
there that I realize I'm probably never
gonna wear because it's a million
degrees and then down there I think I
have socks okay we had to do projects
about ourselves and as you can see I put
a pot on my poster fun fact I didn't
want to throw it out so I have like
water bottles way back in there they're
almost gone now that little drawstring
bag they gave to us like the first day I
have like receipts some stuff I bought
in there I like save my receipts and
then behind that I have like driver
cheats you won't be able to see dryer
sheet and little like laundry pods and
then I don't know if you can tell but I
have this other little hanging thing and
I have a ton of shoes in their sandals
sneakers flip-flops more sandals flats
booties so yeah there's another little
closet overview it's actually like a
pretty good sized closet once again
especially for a dorm room okay so
moving on from the closet I have this
little sign that's a son child it's from
brandy melville I think it's so cute and
then I have these little Polaroids
hanging um I really didn't fill them up
yet I keep forgetting to take Polaroids
while I'm here I was gonna take some
here and then fill it up but I keep
forgetting so I really need to take some
but I just kind of like strung them I
made these strings with my friend
Melanie back home and I hung them up
with the little clothespins moving down
I have this little cube storage thing I
got this from Target as well as the
cubes themselves and also the cubes
hanging in my closet are from Target if
I were to say where things are from like
comment down below and I'll try and
respond to your comments but I you ways
in the cubes up here I have all my
bathing suits which is a lot here I have
like the books and notebooks that I use
I really have like no textbooks up here
I have sunglasses
um in this cube it's just where I keep
this camera at my Polaroid camera this
cube is so messy I have like toiletries
hair brushes hair tools not even going
to go in there down here I have my two
larger nicer bags with my wallet that is
my food one as you can see like the
cheese it's down here I have my shower
caddy like my shower shoes all that
stuff guys if you're not in college
embrace having like your own bathroom at
home while you can because communal
bathrooms suck and then in here I just
have like charging cables for like my
phone and electronics okay moving on to
this wooden thing this is actually
two-sided so the back has more
compartments and I just have things in
there that I don't necessarily want to
be like out like I have more like
feminine products I have like cotton
balls like rubbing alcohol nail polish
remover like all that stuff it's just
not like cute to be shown it's just
behind there so it's like has wheels
basically so you can just like pull it
out when you want to get to the back but
I have more shoes in here so I have like
all my heels my booties and then I have
tall boots could not bring all my shoes
as I said about it but you know I did
bring a lot so moving on to on the desk
I have this adorable little elephant guy
I love elephants I saw this at HomeGoods
had to get it
I have hand sanitizer because everyone
is sick here I had strep throat like a
week ago which is why I didn't film the
dorm to me then it was horrible I have
this little baby I don't know just tray
I got it from Urban Outfitters I thought
it matched and I put bobby pins and hair
clips in there okay
this is really sad because when I bought
this it was really cute and like full
and nice but it's dying and I know you
guys were saying needs to be in the Sun
I do put it in the Sun like normally
every day and I water it like how it
said to water I'm a little card but it's
just dying so I wish this looked cute
for you it doesn't the little cactus guy
still looks cute but like the rest of it
is just really pathetic um I have this
mug over here that I was originally
gonna use for coffee but it was so cute
I wanted to display at my best friend
mal got it for me shout out to Mel she's
probably not watching this but if she is
hey I have like hair ties and then just
like a little lemon head been in there
but that's what I keep on here I'm down
here I'm
backpack it's just by O'Neal I got it
from Tilly's it's cute I like it um
Daniel II know where else to put it for
this video
moving up to my actual bed as you can
see my two hats where at the end such an
elegant like Dodgers hat and then I have
an LMU hat I think hats are really
really cute um I guess I'll show you my
bad from over here my comforter is also
from Urban Outfitters and my blanket is
the same as Danielle's it's from Bed
Bath and Beyond and then I have pillows
I have that like raspberry color one is
from Pier one that like teal one up
there is from Bed Bath and Beyond
that pillow case came with the comforter
and I have another like back pillow back
there also from actually from Target
okay as you can see above my bed I have
a sign that says beach a holic I got it
from this really cute shop in New Jersey
so I don't know how you can get that but
it's so so cute over here strong above
my bed I have these little teal
turquoise lights these are from Target
they're really really cute they're nice
to turn on at nighttime so yeah that's
my bed I would climb up there to show
you more about honestly you will
probably wouldn't really see much so
that's just an overview of my bed
haven't fallen off yet cross your
fingers that I won't fall off okay
moving on to my desk and my vanity and
all that stuff so basically I have my
vanity mirror it is from Costco I have
this really cute little glass thingy
that I put my brushes and I have this
organizer for my makeup I really didn't
bring a lot of makeup here which was
good just a few palettes my everyday
stuff I brought some nail polishes umm I
have a thing of ibuprofen um pencil
sharpener I pencil sharpener moving on
to my desk light this is really nice
because it has a USB so I can charge my
phone which is sitting there I have
medication in there because like I said
I had strep throat that was disgusting
especially in college when there's no
air conditioning and you have a fever
a mini stapler some staples that is that
over here oh my god guys once again the
elephant obsession is real this is also
from home goods
I just put my pens and like sharpies and
pencils in there I couldn't resist this
one is like the matching thing to it and
I just have more like hair clips and
stuff in there moving on I just have
like two perfumes I brought a rollerball
with me but I think it's like in my
purse or something it's people of juicy
and then the Hollister perfume I think
it's called like Malaya or something I
don't know I really like it over here
we've got another little elephant guy
like look how cute he is I just have
like all my bracelets in there I have a
lot shut out rope the moon I'm a brand
ambassador you guys should totally check
them out by the way
okay next to my little elephant I have
this like jewelry tree and I put like my
earrings in it um my long necklaces I
put some more earrings on the bottom and
then my watch so this is actually really
really handy because I'm pretty bad at
storing jewelry so this kind of forced
me to be like neat with it
okay next to my jewelry I have a box of
tissues some lotion up here at my
YouTube play button I don't know if this
is even gonna like focus because the
glare like you get it for 100,000
subscribers so obviously I had to put
that up there and then I have my grad
cap that I made at my school everyone
like decorates their graduation caps
with stuff most people put like the
college's are going to on there so I
decorated that and it was like my pride
and joy because it took me so long so it
was up there and randomly one night it
fell down and I couldn't get it up it
was a gonna frame the railing broke so
it's just chilling there for now I'm not
like technical enough to put it up as
far as this storage goes I'm really not
going to open it just cause like it's
kind of messy I guess I'll show you some
of it in here it's just like random
stuff honestly it's just like pens and
pencils and rulers and headphones and
all that stuff down here is a locked
compartment if I'm going anywhere for a
long period of time I like my laptop and
stuff in there it's unlocked right now
but here I have more clothes I guess
I'll show you some of it it's really not
very clean I apologize I have some
shorts and crop tops
in here so shorts crop tops in this next
drawer down I have jeans pants sweat
pants leggings workout leggings all
types of pants basically and then in the
bottom drawer I have like all t-shirts
like plain t-shirts workout t-shirts
sweatshirts mmm you sure it's really
like everything and this used to be
really organized it's not looking too
great right now but you know it fits
yeah so that is my dorm room I guess I'm
going to do another little overview
