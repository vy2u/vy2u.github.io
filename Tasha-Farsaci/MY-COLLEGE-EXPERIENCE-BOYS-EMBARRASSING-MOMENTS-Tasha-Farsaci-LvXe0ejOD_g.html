buzzing noise in the background
it's my mini-fridge it's loud it's
gurgling I can't control it I just like
karate chop kicked it and nothing
happened so I'm sorry second of all I am
sick um literally I could not read out
of my nose so I'm using a combination of
that bin combination of severe cold in
flu medicine that tastes like
horribleness and some severe nose spray
that is the only thing that is helping
me breathe out of my nostrils so if I
sound weird
that's why anyways today I am coming to
you with just a casual kind of college
like hey how's College going Tosh that
kind of thing because I haven't really
sat down and talked to you about college
like I've mentioned things here and
there but I really haven't like actually
talked to you like how is it um so yeah
I'm just gonna kind of cover a few
topics it's going to be kind of like
informative as well as just like me how
it's going so if you're newbie or if you
this is like your first video ever of
mine or like one of your first and you
don't know where I go to college I go to
LMU it's Loyola Marymount University
it's in Los Angeles California and I'm
from New York State so it was a very far
trip for me um but I love it I love it
in LA it's like the best city ever for
me so yeah I guess the first thing I'm
going to just talk about is how I'm
liking it like how I adjusted
um and pretty much I adjusted very
easily which is kind of odd I thought
for sure I would be homesick um and yeah
I do miss my parents I miss my friends I
miss my bed in my room but I've never
really been super upset about it I've
never like crying about it um I kind of
knew that I would I could do this like I
could move across the country and like
if I didn't think I could do it I
wouldn't have done it so this one's been
fine I've made great friends here
um I'm not really struggling with work
so as far as the Dust think it was easy
for me I know some people do have a
harder time adjusting but it just kind
of you know what you make of it um the
next thing I want to talk about is a
topic that I'm sure you guys would be
interested in because I know that I was
interested in it and I know that not all
girls like boys but a lot of people do
so I'm going to talk about boys college
boys um I think a lot of people going
into college think oh my god like I'm
gonna meet my soul mate in college like
I'm gonna go there there's gonna be so
many new cute guys like I'm gonna meet
one we're gonna be like day-day and it's
gonna be great
I'm like I'm not here to burst anyone's
bubble and I cannot speak for all guys
because I know a lot of guys aren't like
this um
and maybe I just like like look at the
wrong guy I don't know but from what I
have learned my freshman first semester
is that the majority of guys who are
also freshmen I'm not looking for
relationships most guys but I'm sure a
lot of girls honestly just want like
random hookups or consecutive hookups or
friends and benefits so if you're not
familiar with what those mean basically
like you're doing physical stuff with
the person but you're not dating you're
not like going on dates you're not like
oh this is my boyfriend you're not like
like actually liking each other you know
for me that's not what I'm into um I
know some people are I have no problem
people who are because like majority of
people here find that for me like if I'm
gonna be with someone like that like I I
need commitment I want
them to like me like I want to like them
so that's my kind of weird for me I've
definitely like had some guys where I
was like oh like wow like they liked me
and then I find out like ah no they
don't like just wanted things so I don't
know if you're cool that that's fine you
do you but if you're not I just want you
to know like do not change your
standards because that seems like the
normal thing to do like there's lots of
people who are not from hooking up with
random people or doing friends benefits
and I can tell you I'm not um and you
know just be stay true to yourself
don't change your morals because
everyone else's and that's just what
I've seen freshman year it's freshman
year first semester so I mean that's
kind of like what you'd expect
so yeah that's what I've learned about
college boys but honestly I know some
people were a freshman who just got in
relationships with freshmen so it's not
everyone people were asking me like Oh
what are the crazy stories are like
things like that and honestly what comes
to mind it's a pretty recent story it's
an embarrassing moment story um yeah I
don't ever have a lot of embarrassing
moments like people will ask me oh
what's the most embarrassing moment or
things like that and I just I can't like
think of one because I don't get
embarrassed too often I'm like I'm like
pretty like I'm like a confident ish
person so it's like oh how that happened
to me funny but this one you know this
one got me so the other night I was in
the shower I'm doing my thing was
probably like 9 o'clock
8:30 someone there p.m. just relaxed
saying I was almost dying I was like
conditioning my hair all of a sudden the
fire alarms just go off yep they go off
and I'm standing there and I'm like
alright so I can do one of two things
could stand here and hope that it's a
drill even though I know we already had
our drill and just hope that no one
comes in or I don't die or ship I can
put on my robe which is a wiener dog
robe by the way it has Weiner dogs for
all over it I know some of you guys
probably didn't believe me so this is
the room I love we know dogs like you
know I don't want everyone to see my
robe like it's just like cute and fuzzy
anyways I knew I could put on my robe
and evacuate with the rest of the
building so I was like all right
I'd rather evacuated my room and die so
I put on my robe
and i evacuated and my hair was soaking
wet conditioner still in it makeup
running all over my face naked except
for the robe and my shower shoes i
evacuated um my floor has oh no my
building has four floors or co-ed um so
as you can imagine you know it wasn't
ideal walking out of the building having
boys some cute boys laughing or seeing
me and I was just like ah so I stood
outside for a while and people just kept
coming and coming and looking at us oka
so I am I bolted it I ran to my friends
room in another building and I kind of
hid out there until the alarm stopped
going off I mean it ends up not being a
drill but I don't know if someone just
pulled it or if there was like an actual
incident but um yeah okay and lastly I'm
going to talk about like living in
college and work in college and just
like how it is so a lot of people were
like how is it sharing a bathroom how is
it sharing a room and for me I'm an only
child so I grew up not sharing anything
um so it's definitely weird for me but
it's not impossible
yeah sharing a bathroom does suck
especially like if you want privacy when
you go in the bathroom when you walk in
there and like oh it's the classic you
walk in there and someone's in there and
they go silent like an act like they're
not there but like you can see them and
then like they wait until you leave to
let I don't know you're in college you
probably know what I mean
but there's that I know there's like the
showering like you want the freedom to
be able to not worry shoes in the shower
and like take a long time in the shower
but then like there's other people and
you've got to walk down the hall and
then you'll be wearing your robe walking
down the hall and someone has like guys
in the hall and you're like ah hey
living with a roommate
um showers my roommate I'm filling up on
a permit by the way because I'd like
we're inviting by mine some hope that's
okay Levin roommate is like by I mean
I'd like my roommate but I definitely
it's definitely like an adjustment like
I'm used to having my own room being
able like do whatever but you have to
like be conscious of like their needs
and you know you can't just be like
sitting there like watching Netflix out
loud with no headphones like laughing
like crunching your popcorn like you
have to know that they're like doing
substitute as far as workload everyone
wants to know about the workload for me
personally I'm a Communication Studies
major it's known as the easy major I did
not take it for that I really my
workload I have some communication
classes that I had like a sociology
class I'm like an art class so honestly
like the class I'm in are not very
difficult for me those are like the
fields I'm best in so for me actually
college is easier than high school as of
now but I do know a lot of friends who
are in like math and history and
theology and philosophy and they're
struggling they have so much work so
right now with these classes it's easier
just because I have a lot more free time
to do work and nothing to do like the
next day it's always giving like a long
time in advance new of the due date so
if you can manage your time it's fine so
I think that's all I'm going to talk
about today I hope this was kind of fun
funny how about answered some of your
questions oh I love college it's so much
better than high school seriously please
please please follow me on social media
like I just want social media followers

know probably

college experiences down below any
embarrassing moments if you're not in
college
