do a little Q&amp;amp;A for you guys because
I've been getting a lot of questions
from you guys in general and I also
posted a photo on my Instagram asking
you guys to ask me questions for Q&amp;amp;A so
I'm gonna be answering those if you guys
don't already follow me on Instagram I'm
gonna put it right here you guys totally
shirts then you can participate in
things like this and you can see me more
often I promise it's not like a business
II structured in scram it's literally
just what I do in a day to day it's
super chill it's super personal in case
you guys are wondering where I got what
I'm wearing this choker I made but I
will link a similar one down below and I
will also link my shirt down below also
one more thing before I get with the
questions I am wearing colored contacts
in case you guys are wondering these are
my new favorites they're by desi oh lens
it's not it's not a sponsored thing at
all I literally bought these they're a
little more pricey than normal colored
contacts but I think they look the most
natural they're really comfortable
they're great quality so I will go ahead
and put the link down below I believe
these are the color desert dreams okay
so the first question I want to answer
it's kind of a conglomerate of questions
as always I got a lot of questions about
my diet and my fitness routine and
whether or not that has changed I really
haven't I kind of answered this in my
last Q&amp;amp;A and I will link it down below
but I have added one new thing to my
daily routines and I really look like 80
so I want to share that with you you
guys have probably heard of 50 it's all
those t-d toxins and stuff like that and
I never was super into that just because
I'm not a big tea drinker so when I saw
that 50 came out with fit coffee I got
so excited because it's something I like
trying I like trying like detox and RD
boosting stuff like that and the coffee
addict so I got so excited so this is
what the box looks like it just says fit
coffee and it comes with like a little
cups that you can use in a Keurig or any
other sort of thing that it takes these
little cups so it's super convenient
it's just like a one cup kind of thing
something I've noticed when drinking
this is that it's already very
sweet naturally so I don't feel the need
to add any sugars or any creamer or
syrup or anything because it's loaded
with so many antioxidants you feel super
energized is always great I like
jerkiness before class or if you gonna
go over try and work out of the gym this
is great it gives me a lot more energy
so fit coffee actually includes green
teas so if you guys like tea it tastes
like coffee and tea how to baby you know
what I mean it doesn't taste completely
like coffee it doesn't taste completely
like tea it's definitely a mix between
the two which is cool it's different
than what I'm used to drinking I'm
actually drinking some right now in my
cute little travel mug yeah so I just
found that drinking lafitte coffee just
really helps to get my metabolism moving
and I really been liking how it's been
working out I obviously haven't done the
full 14 day detox but you know I've been
drinking it for a few days now and I've
been really like you if you've ever
someone get your hands on some of this
fake coffee you can get it at your local
GMC or you can get it online at 15.com
so promotional considerations for this
video was provided by 15 but I honestly
love the fit coffee and it's something
that I would try on my own anyway so
totally being honest here no no secrets
no surprises okay so the rest of the
questions that I'm going to answer
I have screenshotted on my phone okay a
lot of people asked what my favorite
thing is about living in California or
living in LA or not living in New York
just like a variety of those things and
honestly I've loved California ever
since I visited it the first time I know
so many youtubers into California
because it's the place of opportunity or
whatever but I moved here because I
genuinely just love it as a place yeah
that works out that I do YouTube but I'm
also a college student so it's not like
I'm living and breathing YouTube while
I'm here you know I just wanted to come
to college somewhere that I genuinely
loved and wanted to move to because
honestly I feel like this is the only
part of my life where I can really
really choose where I want to live you
know after college a job may dictate
where I live so I just thought for
college I wanted to go somewhere
that I knew I would want to live in and
I just love California I love Los
Angeles and Southern California I also
love moving California I think it's so
beautiful all the beaches but there's
also so many stores and just things to
do and attractions and like I don't know
I love it I'm former West Coast girl I
think don't get me wrong I do like East
Coast Studies I like New York I like
Boston but I hate the cold weather so
honestly I just love California and LA I
get a lot of people that tell me that
they're considering moving to California
from the East Coast for school and they
ask me if it's different and it is very
different I really can't pinpoint it now
because I'm so used to living here but
you definitely have to I don't know how
to put it I just always see myself as
more of a West Coast kind of person like
whatever I tell people I'm from New York
they're like oh my gosh like I totally
would've thought you were from here I
don't know I think you should definitely
like do some research I think I have a
whole wisp in this video oh my gosh
do your research definitely come and
visit make sure that you really like it
here but I love it and I would recommend
it to anyone okay I had a few questions
along this line how do you swim in a
frat parties considering you not a
technically a USC student yet so
basically I'm not frat parties work at
other schools I need to do it some
schools but not all schools but
basically at USC if you're a girl you
can get into a frat party like you don't
have to go to USC you don't have to know
anyone in the house you don't have to be
an actress leave your model like
literally you just walk through the door
like it's not nothing like I came to USC
parties when I was at LMU last year like
honestly if you're a girl they don't
care if you're a guy you better know
someone yeah I know a lot of schools
literally charge people to get into
their parties which is so weird to me
because neither LMU or USC charge people
for parties it's kind of just like girls
get in guys that you know someone it
would be the friend okay a bunch of you
guys asked if I plan on rushing and yes
so Greek life is huge at USC it's kind
of like the thing to do I don't know
obviously not everyone does it but I
really want
I was pretty bummed because since I am a
spring admit and a brushes in the fall I
couldn't brush a lot of you guys were
telling me to do spring rush during
formal recruitment and USC doesn't
really have that I think maybe like one
house does but for me I really do want
to be able to experience like all the
houses and choose myself so I won't be
rushing until next fall so I'll be
rushing with a junior which is
definitely a bummer because I don't know
it just it's a bummer because like I
really did want to watch and be in a
sorority and I'm only gonna be in it now
for like two years but yeah whatever I'm
definitely gonna rush I don't know if I
should say like what sororities I'm
interested in so I think that might be
dirty brushing I'm not sure but yeah
Greek life is really big here at USC I
might have mentioned this before but my
best friend from LMU also transferred to
USC except she got full admission and I
got spring admission and she rushed and
she's been so happy and so busy all the
time it makes these sex I'm literally
never see her because she's so busy but
she's having the time of her life and it
makes me so happy and like I want that
to be me okay what is my favorite thing
to get if Taco Bell faxes to talk about
walking distance from my apartment
Oh dangerous so I always get a chicken
quesadilla I think they're so good
normally I'm like picky about chicken
like if it's even the slightest bit
rubbery or chewy I'm not down but for
some reason the chicken and talk about
chicken quesadillas it's always great
thank you guys might be commenting and
being like Pasha it's actually can eat
whatever I don't know but to me if he's
going I'm really picky also my candles
normally always lit when I film here
it's lit um but it went out I lit it and
I guess the the wick went a whole way
down and yeah no it's dark do people
recognize you from YouTube at college
parties is it awkward um yeah it's
happened to me a few times I honestly
just think it's because at parties a lot
of people are drinking or they're drunk
so like they're not as nervous to go say
things like say hi I need
whereas in public like people get
nervous um yeah sometimes it's like kind
of awkward at the same time like we're
both of the party so it's like whatever
like fight on wherever I was
asking me what are my plans for after
college do I still want to live in LA as
of now I do I would love to live in
Santa Monica or Venice so loud anyways
yeah but we live in Santa Monica out
where Venice just closer to the beach I
love that area of LA but obviously all
the pounds I'm like a job I get and all
that stuff and who knows maybe I'll hate
LA in two years okay I think the last
question I'm going to answer today is do
you ever miss your hometown slash people
you graduated with or are you happy to
get away from all of that okay so I
never miss my hometown at all at all
like never I miss a small amount of the
people that I graduated with obviously
like my best friend Melanie is still
back home and then I have other friends
that I still talk to that are back home
and yet my parents are back home so I
miss people but I do not like where I
grew up personally it's not for me I
hated high school literally hated it
it was just so constricting and just you
know so if you guys feel like you hate
your high school you hate your hometown
and you have the opportunity to move on
and move to a different state or move
across the country do it because
honestly it's the best decision I've
ever made in my life I know I've said
this in numerous videos but yeah
seriously if you guys feel like you can
and you do have the opportunity to do so
and move on and try something new and
totally do it because you feel let's go
back but you can't always you know try
something new yeah so I think those are
all the questions that I'm going to
answer in this Q&amp;amp;A video thank you guys
to everyone to do ask me questions and
thank you guys love and watching love
you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
