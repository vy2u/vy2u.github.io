video which I'm really excited about
because I've done one of these before
which was my foot fetish
stalker video and after I did that a lot
of you guys were asking me to do more
story times in case you haven't seen
that video I'm gonna link it down below
I had to disable comments because
eventually the only people that were
commenting with people that found it
that had foot fetishes and the comments
were either extremely rude or extremely
vulgar and I just really did not want to
read them anymore so I disabled comments
but the video is still up and I think
it's pretty entertaining if you want to
watch it anyway so like I said ever
since I posted that video you guys were
requesting more story times and I really
did want to do one but I didn't think I
had anything that was storytime worthy
so I was kind of like waiting for
something to happen and in the meantime
I was watching a lot of other story tiny
achievers and watching their videos and
one video that I really liked watching
is online stalker type videos I think
those are super entertaining probably
because I'm obsessed with the show
catfish and it's kind of similar so
anyways as I was watching those types of
videos I realized I do have a story I
remember one of my stories from a while
back and I think it's pretty weird so I
wanted to share with you guys by the way
before I get into the story I am home
I'm filming in my guest room because the
lighting is the best in here and yeah I
back home in New York if you guys are
new in my channel I just finished my
freshman year at LMU Loyola Marymount in
Los Angeles and now I'm back home for
the summer so yes I've got this nice
beautiful background I'm gonna work on a
better background but yeah okay so the
story starts with me I was just
finishing my freshman year of high
school so it was a summer before my
sophomore year of high school and set
the stage I was pretty awkward I had
never had a boyfriend I had basically no
experience with boys in general at all
and I was fairly naive I would say so at
this point I had just gotten my first
job I was going to be a cashier at a
grocery store near me Wegmans if you
guys live near me or live anywhere in
the Northeast you probably know of
Wegmans and you'll understand why I was
working there but all my friends in
college think it's so weird and I told
them I was a cashier at a grocery store
but basically Wegmans
is like the place to work if you're a
teenager in high school or in college
like everyone that works at the front
end is wrong basically so I don't know
if this is the case for all high schools
or most high schools but my high school
we had a rival high school that was like
pretty close to us and we just knew
people from it so we weren't necessarily
like friends with them but like we knew
people that were at that high school and
we would follow each other on social
media just that kind of thing like we
knew of them you know I'm sorry I keep
touching my hair it's really like
stressing me down I haven't straightened
my hair and so long anyway so I was
working at the Wegmans
in the neighboring school district
because it was newer and bigger and I
didn't really want to see a ton of
people I knew who so I was working at
like I said the grocery store that is in
the other school district so the
majority of the kids working there were
from the other school district so I
think it was probably my first or second
day of work honestly I remember I was
training and I saw this guy that was
also working there and I knew of him
because he went to that other high
school I didn't know him personally like
I hadn't talked to him before but I knew
who he was he was a year older than me
and I thought he was pretty cute I'm not
gonna use real names in this so we're
gonna call him Steve yeah so I saw Steve
working and I noticed he was looking at
me and you know little ninth grade me he
was like whoo he's lookin at me like all
excited or whatever so I honestly think
it was that night or maybe the next
night Steve followed me on Twitter and
mind you this is when I had two
Twitter's now I only have one but at the
time I had a personal Twitter that was
and the Twitter for YouTube so this was
my personally private Twitter so I guess
he requested to follow me or whatever
and I accept it and followed him back
and then ezm me go down in the field and
I remember clearly now what he said it
was hanging with a smiley face except it
was like the little colon like thingy I
don't even know if emojis were a thing
then yeah so he dammed me and I
remembered answering and then we started
texting I think we were probably texting
for maybe a day or two when the next
thing happened okay so at this time ask
fm was really popular if you don't know
what ask fm is basically it's the same
thing as formspring it's a website where
you can make an account and then other
people can ask you questions on it but
the hitch of the website is that people
are allowed to ask them anonymously so
they came like type of option and then
just select ask anonymously and you'll
never know who asked you the question so
when I said I had only been texting this
guy for one maybe two days I don't think
I told anyone about it I might have told
what am I like close friends so
obviously like they weren't gonna do
anything weird about it but no one
really knew this guy they just kind of
knew of him and I looked at my ass got
bad and I had started getting some
questions okay I wanted to make this
video as like real as possible because I
know sometimes these are hard to believe
so I went on a scoff em and I reset my
password and reactivated my account so I
could find all of these questions and
show them to you so the first question I
receive is are you talking to anyone and
that's like pretty common I mean
intimate for someone to ask I'm s kept
em at that time like who you talking to
anyone and I said not quite sure at the
moment this also gives us all a chance
to laugh at me and my answers because
they are so freshman year of me and then
sorry I'm sick by the way and then they
go if it's who I think it is run like
what how how would they know right
and then I'm excited by the way these
are all coming in like one after another
like they weren't waiting for me to
answer like they were just sending
and I said or they said guessing you
next in line he's hit us all up starts
out with a hey smiley face and at this
point I was like wait a minute like that
is exactly what he sent me like how do
they know exactly what he sent me this
is so weird
so then I was like who is this I won't
publish it because if you guys are
familiar with a Skype I mean you don't
have to publish the answers because if
you publish them everyone sees them but
you don't have to publish it or whatnot
okay so the next thing I said was you
don't have to post this just want you to
know ask around I speak the truth
I got a hey smiley face too and then
they go let's just leave it as I got the
hey smiley face then a little small talk
then why don't you text me followed by
his number which is like funny because
this is exactly what had happened to me
and they said I thought it was cute at
first and then I was telling her friend
and doesn't she told me she was texting
the same guy then I found out many more
by the way that's just within our school
can't imagine within the others and they
just keep coming and this was getting
kind of weird like why does this person
care so much I had been texting him for
literally a day like we hadn't hung out
it's not like we were married and then
they said don't post listen I know of
his ex sweetest most gorgeous girl ever
they dated for like two years and more
she recently broke up with him because
of his behavior he's just trying to get
back her look her up never heard a bad
word about group from anyone him on the
other hand dot dot yeah so at this point
I was very curious as to what the person
was gonna say and I was also pretty rude
about cuz I had no idea who this was
they Co she got a ask Rita it's all
about her and him and what he's been
doing and then they try to act like
there's someone else and they said just
read all this true true true lol someone
just pointed out the similarities for
the two of you size hair color clothing
styles weird replacement not a
coincidence
like what come on don't post I can anon
send you her info if you want to talk to
her cute crab would talk to you next
post I post just answer yes or no and I
can
for you and then I think I might have
said no or I didn't answer and they said
suit yourself but ask around her name is
blank go down her friends list and see
you and I have a lot of them in common
with her won't find a one saying a bad
word ask your friends about him he's
texted us all within the past two weeks
Jeff saw at this point I was really
confused why his person cared I was
thinking okay maybe it's the girlfriend
but how would she know that I was
texting him believe me you'll just live
you ask him and I know you will ask him
go down this following list see a
pattern all girls since she broke up
with him think about it why after two
plus years you think she left him ask
her she still loves him just couldn't
deal with it there was some more in
between this but this was like the main
ending they go not to get involved but I
think I know who that is and who she's
talking about she's right I got the same
story about him from thought that that
well we already follow each other all
dmu ninth one else goes all diem YouTube
I have no problem telling you exactly
what he said to me when he hit me up via
DM then gave me his number okay so you
don't have to be a rocket scientist to
realize that these are all the same
people and someone is just very
concerned about this guy and the girl
and me I was like okay well I've never
even gone on a date with this guy like I
have nothing to lose like I'm not gonna
listen to something like a random person
on ask fm
so even though I was like a little
suspicious like I said I didn't have
anything invested in this guy and he
eventually asked me to hang out so we
did it was Phi it was kind of awkward
but it wasn't bad he had to like meet my
parents cuz he picked me up so it seemed
like his intentions were fine he didn't
try to make a move on me or anything
like it went fairly well I guess other
than the kind of awkwardness and we had
made plans to hang out again so it
wasn't like it went really badly and
we're top after like we made plans to
hang out again I haven't heard anything
else from the weird ask FM stalker
person who seemed to know everything
about my DMS and texts so pretty much it
started to get weird when we were
supposed to hang out and he had not
answer to any of my texts and you
completely blew me off
and little freshmen me was so upset and
so sad I didn't know what happened so
this is a really weird part of this
story I remember getting a text message
and if you guys remember back in the day
you probably still can honestly you
could text someone from a yahoo email
account like weird but you could and I
got a text on my phone from a yahoo
email account I don't remember the name
it wasn't someone's actual account they
had made it to text me they texted me
and it was about this guy and I don't
remember the exact wording I couldn't
find this text message sadly but it was
like told you he'd get back with blank
blank like they were hanging out
yesterday they're together like he just
wanted to bed you I remember that
clearly cuz I was like Begbie what like
he just wanted to bed you like this same
person somehow got my number
yahoo mail texted me about this guy and
I'm almost positive I didn't answer I
really don't think I answered because I
was really feared about at this point I
don't know how this person got my number
knew what I was texting you like the
dm's knew when I hung out with this guy
I knew everything about everything that
was going on I don't think this guy
ended up getting back with his ex but I
don't really know what happened
he ended up dating someone else I didn't
care after like a week and I never found
out who this person was that basically
stalked my life and was obsessed about
it on ask fm and Yahoo Mail texting I
remember trying to figure out who it was
for the longest time because they said
we followed each other on Twitter but
since they never texted me or DM me like
they said they were going to I really
don't know if that's true and I have no
idea where this person is yeah who knows
super weird if you guys think you know
who it is totally leave a comment down
below or if you're watching this and
this was you let me know because you
know
to be solved and I'm not gonna get mad
at you at this point anyways I thought
