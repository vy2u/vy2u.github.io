for you and before you click on this
video or leave a mean comment I know
people don't love reviews all that much
but I don't do them that often
and I thought this was a really great
website and something that a lot of you
could take advantage of
so pretty much a little over a month ago
a website called talk about prom
contacted me
I'll put their website link right here
and I'll also put it in the down bar
basically the website contacted me and
they asked me if I would be interested
in getting a free prom dress from them
in order to talk about it in a video and
what girl in their right mind would not
want a free prom dress I mean maybe if
you're not gonna go to a prom but come
on guys you cannot say you would not say
yes to that so even better they said
they would size it for me so I gave them
my measurements and they sized it so I
thought this video would also be helpful
for you guys because I know a lot of the
times prom dresses are so hard to find
and you don't want to go to the stores
near you because you're really afraid
that other girls from your school will
go there and you'll have the same dress
because having the same dress sucks I
know that happened to my friend in my
last dance she had the same dress as
someone and that was really really
sucked for her but anyways something
great about talking about prom is that
their dresses they have tons of
different dresses but you can get them
in tons of different colors there are so
many color choices not only what's
pictured in the photo so it'll be even
harder for someone to get the same
dresses they have a ton of ranges of
dresses on their websites they have
short dresses long dresses strapless
poofy slim you know any type of dress
pretty much they have in shoes sizes
like two four six eight so on or you can
put in your personal measurements and
they'll make it for you a lot of people
want to know how long it will take
because you want to know how long it's
gonna take for your dressing up there
because a lot of people you know want it
to be there at a certain time obviously
so from me I got my dress personalized
for me and it took about 20 days to make
the dress which is quick seriously mine
is so much beading and stuff so that's
crazy and it took them like really quick
fast shipping like probably four or
three days shipping really fast
obviously if you don't put your
measurements in and you just get a size
it will be a lot quicker but you know if
you really wanted to fit nicely I
definitely recommend putting in your
size the prices really range on their
dresses I mean they can be under 100
- like 300 but if you think about it
that's actually really good or at least
standard for prom dresses because they
can get extremely pricey I know girls
that pay like over $500 so I know you
guys are probably all waiting to see the
dress that I chose and this is really
depressing but I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to wear it this year because I'm
a sophomore in high school and we don't
have a prom until junior year the only
way that I can go is if I get asked by a
junior so you know if you're a junior
out there that goes to my school or
around my area hit me up okay so now I'm
gonna show you the dress I got I'm also
going to show a few clips after I'm
talking to you hear of me wearing the
dress because I feel like that will be
more interesting but the dress that I
got is called purple beaded strapless
chiffon dress I guess and once again you
can get this in tons of different colors
I actually got it in the color that it
was pictured in just because I really
like the color but you know you can
choose any color I know right it's so
pretty so this is what the top of the
dress looks like it has so many sequins
it's so pretty it's like a nice bustier
kind of tight corset top and then it
kind of cinches at the waist here and
then it just flows down all the way to
the bottom something else that I love
about this dress is that there's detail
on the back as well because I hate when
you get dresses or shirts and the back
is boring and the Front's like amazing
so this is what the back looks like and
as you can see it's just really pretty
it has all the same beading in the back
and then a nice zipper so you can unzip
yourself there and it's honestly so
pretty you can see this dress is very
nicely lined it has tons of nice lining
and it has elastic right here so it's
little sketchier and it's just amazing
I'm obsessed with this dress I think
it's so pretty and I love this color I
don't know if it's the best color on me
but I love this color anyways so once
again this is the dress I got now I'm
gonna go to a few clips of me modeling
the dress that's gonna be pretty awkward
I'm the most awkward model ever but yeah
we go
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
