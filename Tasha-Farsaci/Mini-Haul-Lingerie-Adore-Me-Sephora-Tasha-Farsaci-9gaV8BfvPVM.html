haven't been posting but it's been
hectic for me lately I'm wrapping up
with my last few weeks of senior year of
high school it's been crazy so I'm sorry
I haven't filmed today I have a really
super mini haul and I know the last
video I did was a haul but since this
one is so many I'm kind of just like not
counting it as another whole this ones
are really small but I have lots more
videos planned actually my senior ball
is tomorrow so if you guys want me to
film myself getting ready let me know
down below because I'm gonna proposing
this tonight so hopefully I will see
your comments and know if I want to do
it or not so the main reason for this
haul is I have some stuff to show you
from adore me and basically adore me
you've probably heard of it because a
lot of people have been talking it
talking it they've been talking about it
they actually offered to send me these
things I'm not like influenced by that
at all like I'm giving you my own a
percent honest opinion like I always do
but basically there was a subscription
service for like robots and underwear
which some people might think it's weird
that I'm showing on here but I feel like
the majority of us are girls and like
that kind of stuff so I want to show you
the cool thing about our door me is that
it's like a subscription service but you
don't think it things every month you
can literally just go on there and link
here something and the cool thing also
is that it comes with a matching like
set so you get a matching bra with
underwear and I know like everyone feels
so much better about themselves when
they're matching and I have never had a
matching set before so that was really
cool for me you guys probably know that
I cannot have large boobs at all I'm
like a 32a so like the smallest size
there is basically so I did get mainly
like push-up bras and I'm going to let
you know how they like work for me once
I get into the stuff but their stuff
comes in a black box like this and I'm
just going to show you the stats that I
got I'm gonna start off with the biggest
push-up that they have
and then I got and it looks like this I
don't have them be the exact names but I
can try and put them on the bottom of
the screen this one is supposed to add
two cup sizes which would make me like I
see um I don't really know if it works
like that well but I did close the
picture on Instagram and you guys are
well like oh my god you have boobs and
like I don't it was this broad I was
wearing actually so I guess it does work
pretty well it has like a good improve
padding as you get to see it's like all
padding so it definitely has a lot of
padding and this will give you like a
lot of push-up and these are really cute
that's why I like that may look like a
Victoria's Secret bras and the quality
is awesome I mean I never really splurge
on bras because I don't have boobs that
I show off or anything so it's nice to
have some nice bras now and then I got
the thongs with the like bras because
I'm at bottom clerks and I don't like
underwear lines anything so this is what
the thong looks like for that it's
really cute they're really nice like
silky material it has like a little
jewel in the middle and it's really
really cute cute cute the next one I got
it's also push up but but it's not like
two cup sizes it's just like your normal
push-up that's why I have worn a few
times it gives me like I don't know I've
never had like a line of cleavage like
ever but it like definitely pushes up a
little bit it's like a hot pink with
orange really cute really like funny for
the summer has some like orange Lay's as
you can see
cute you can't like to see the padding
on this one but there's definitely
something there and then the underwear I
really like this underwear it's like the
orange and pink and the lace is on the
top I think they're really cute the
underwear is so sock I've never had like
such a soft underwear whoo so we don't
just have bras they have like bra last
two and I've been really into bra laps
and I saw this colored one and it was
really pretty - got it
it's like a purpley lilac color and then
with white and this is cute no padding
at all it's a bra that you've got like a
Razorback kind of thing going on I would
try these on for you if that wasn't
weird and there weren't like creepy guys
on the Internet
but yeah it just crosses in the front
it's really cute I enjoy it and then it
also came with underwear and they're
that same like style as the last ones
just wide with like the flowery lace leg
so so that is the stuff my door me I'm
gonna put all the links down below I
definitely recommend the fast excite
because everything is good quality
everything did push me up that was push
up and I really don't have boobs so I
don't know how to speak for like girls
with bigger boobs but I think it's
really cute and it's really nice to have
a few nice bra and underwear sets even
if like no one's seeing it I mean it's
still nice to feel good about yourself
and feel like pretty and moving on I
went to Sephora literally like 20
minutes ago because like I said my
senior ball is tomorrow and guys you
probably can't see it right now but I
sprouted because it I've ever had in my
entire life because I went camping last
weekend like my senior class went
camping it's like a tradition that we do
and my skin did not like it and I got a
huge to say it's one of those it's
that's like under your skin and it's
hard and it hurts really badly but it's
not like a white head.if this is
probably gross whatever so I was trying
to cover it up trying to cover it up
huge amount of my head and then today it
all of a sudden like turned into a huge
white head this is disgusting
but I like popped it I knew it was so
disgusting guys it was nasty anyways I
wanted to get the concealer to use for
tomorrows that's like why I went to
Sephora so I just got a few things I
never really do beauty hauls
I'd only buy a lot of makeup you know I
got the makeup forever
full cover concealer the supposed took
pricy that's what I hate about Sephora
like this was like $32 but it's awesome
it's designed to like cover up tattoos
even so it looks like this I'm pretty
tan right now so I have to color ten
yeah and I'm wearing it right now okay
this is massive I mean always come in a
little bit maybe I'm like sunburned you
don't mind this okay well this is on my
forehead so if you can see it right now
let me know but I mean I'm not really
seeing it and it's huge and Brad so this
stuff was probably worth the money I'll
definitely be using it for future
breakouts and definitely tomorrow when
I'm getting ready then I got okay I got
some fake eyelashes I'm actually going
to be using the smile but I can't put
them on myself because I sucked up going
back to Sephora and having them do it
I suck okay anyways so I got these one
there we go
I've never worn it fake eyelashes my
eyelashes are long so I've never felt
the need and I really don't like I can't
put them on to save my life I can do
like one of them so I got these I'm
gonna have them put them on for me my
last dance and why not go for it
so got those for the other thing
okay I got the Anastasia brow powder duo
because I have the dip brow and I've
been doing my eyebrows different lately
a lot of you guys said you like them a
lot better now not squared-off like
looking back at pictures of my eyebrows
squared off it was terrifying so thank
you guys for letting you know honestly
like some people might think that's like
rude to point out to someone but I
honestly thank you guys for because I
like my eyebrows a lot better now I
played they're a lot more natural so
I've been moving away from the dipbrow I
still use it better then I like to set
it with a powder so I got the Anastasia
brow powder and blonde I just use a
little bit of it too but alright here we
got to finally focus so it looks like
this if it's like a little bit of a
darker and then my lighter and I just
got the lightest because my hair is
getting like I always highlight it so it
gets later and later and I need like the
lightest shade that I can get so I got
that Anastasia is the best for eyebrows
stuff that I've tried everyone else
seems to agree and the last thing it's
actually my mom's I don't know why she
wanted this but I got it for her it's a
Sephora precision the pore cleansing pad
I really don't know why she got this pad
me get it for her but you know whatever
so that is my mini haul video once again

I have nothing else to do with my life
