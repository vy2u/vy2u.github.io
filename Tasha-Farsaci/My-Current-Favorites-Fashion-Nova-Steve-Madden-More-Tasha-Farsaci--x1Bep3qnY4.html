hey guys so today I'm going to be doing
a favorite / what I've been loving /
things that are a must have this video I
see other people doing these videos all
the time I don't know if monthly
favorites are still a thing people do
favorites videos all the time so I
decided why shouldn't I so I'm just
going to be showing you with some
websites and makeup and fashion pieces
that I've been loving let's go I've I'm
so staticy I'm so sick of this winter
crap like I this is sticking to me my
hair is staticy like this is not good
okay so my first favorite of the moment
is layering necklaces this has become
kind of trendy so I'm just going to show
you a few of the necklaces I've been
loving layering so I personally like
silver necklaces or at least I am at the
moment so I got to from an etsy shop
this is the name of the shop I can't
really pronounce I don't know if it's
true or true i I really don't know so
here is it they have really cute
hand-made necklaces so I got two of
those the first one looks like this it
just says dream on it and it's a little
pendant and it's just really cute and
simple I think it's pretty like bohemian
which is my favorite and please do not
mind my nails they're disgusting I
apologize i had acrylics and this
happened the next one I got from that
etsy shop looks like this and it's a
feather and this is super cute i know
i'm going to be wearing this a lot
especially layering like i said but it's
just really pretty and i really enjoy it
i'm going to put the link of that
website down below and i also have a
coupon code for you which is really
exciting so it's just tasha 20 i'll put
all this down below as well it's 20
another one of my favorite like layering
necklaces is this one from urban
outfitters and I boy in my last haul
video and I actually work today so
hopefully it's not tangle yeah so I can
show you but it's already pre layered as
you can see it looks like this so when
you wear it it's already in two layers
so it kind of saves you the time but
this is really cute once again I have
until oh just like and layer it with my
other necklaces but they had this in
gold when I got it too so yeah it's
really cute okay I'm gonna talk about
some websites that I've been liking like
clothing websites because you guys
always ask me where do you get your
clothes or where's your favorite place
to get close and obviously my favorite
places online shops because nothing
bothers me more than buying something
from the mall I've been going to school
and seeing like five girls wearing it
and I don't want to wear it and it's
really upsetting so I like finding like
lesser-known website or web sites and
labs will don't shop at that I know
online so i can have unique pieces
students probably know about necessary
clothing it's in New York City I go
there all the time so whenever I go to
New York City I always go in necessary
clothing and it's a must like that's one
of my favorite shores shores stores to
shop at in Soho so I don't know about
you guys but I just found out they have
an online stores so I don't have to go
to New York City to shop there and I had
no idea so I'm just gonna show you guys
some of the things i got i don't really
want to make this into a hole but i
figured i'd show you guys some of the
pieces because why not but the first
thing i got is this two-piece suit and
it's really cute it's just nude with
some white lace overlay and this is the
top the bottom looks like this and it
goes kind of high waisted and these look
really cute together so these are super
super cute i have this gorgeous skirt
and i honestly have no idea where I'm
going through where this but is
beautiful and I saw it I had to have it
so it's this all sequence like amazingly
beautiful little miniskirt kind of thing
and this is a little bit big on me I
think so I wear this kind of low guys
when I tried it on so it's really not
that short at all and it's absolutely
beautiful I think this was called like
The Great Gatsby skirt or something but
it's so pretty I can't wait so I go to
college so I can wait I would stop they
have great basics so I picked off this
when you kind of chiffon shirt it just
has some like find up sleeves and this
will be great for just any occasion and
then I got some gray leggings these are
so thick than well I can't you're a
little bit big on me so I'm hoping I can
shrink them in the wash but they're
really thick very stretchy these are
more pants and leggings I would say but
they look like leggings and they're
comfortable like leggings another
clothing website favor is called fashion
Nova I just got some things from them as
well so i'm going to show you those
really quick I've been saving this dress
everywhere I saw kylie jenner wearing it
I've just been seeing the style in a lot
of places so I just got this black and
white striped dress but it's the ones
that he'll like the envelope folds at
the bottom so I'm really excited to wear
this it's a little bit long on me but I
think I can make it work I got this
really really cute vest it looks like
this it's got some lining on the pockets
I thought the pattern of philly
interesting because it looks great from
afar but it looks like this once you get
up close and i also got just a nice
black blazer because the 1i had really
wasn't good quality at all and this one
is super great quality so it's just a
plain black blazer so i only got one
dress from fashion noble but they
honestly have so many i think they have
like 300 dresses on their website and
they're really good flick going out
dresses so if you're in college or if
you're looking for something kind of
fancy to go to these dresses are awesome
and you can also address them down so
honestly I definitely recommend checking
out the website if you're looking for
dresses I mean especially with
Valentine's Day around the corner like a
wink-wink guys you know if you have
special I a special I what your eye on
that special someone but you can see
they had really cute things that were
dress is also
I wrangled you guys a code because I
want to divide us to be able to try
these things out so it's XO Tasha for
fifteen percent off and yeah my next
fashion favorite I've been getting so
many questions about in my videos and it
is these so I honestly have gotten an
overwhelming amount of comments and
questions where I got these boots and
they're from steve madden unfortunately
i'm pretty sure the style is sold out
there the galaxy boots I got some around
Black Friday Cyber Monday time so they
were on like a sale and they sold out
really quickly so they don't have these
ones anymore I don't think what they
have really similar ones because people
were getting mine confused with the ones
called like the guilt boots they just
have a smaller heel so if you like these
they definitely still have the ones
that's molecule but these are the galaxy
ones i'm going to like put this on the
screen so you could see what i'm talking
about but they're in the taupe color and
they're amazing these are literally me
in a shoe and i'm obsessed with these
okay i have to beauty favorites first of
all I think I Ciara I've been using are
you seriously l'oreal voluminous million
lashes and that was like my go-to but
then i want to switch it up because i
love switching up mascaras so i got the
Loreal voluminous miss manga and this is
awesome i honestly just got it because i
had cute packaging but i really really
like it so I'm gonna like awkwardly show
it to you while you're seeing my
eyelashes because I wanted to show you
how it looks and I have pretty long
eyelashes this is so awkward I are
pretty long eyelashes to begin with but
this just makes them really long and oh
you can see I'm breaking out that's
really nice but yeah my last beauty
favorite is Dallas by benefit and it's a
blush kind of bronzer because this is a
bronzy blush shade I can't even call it
like a blush just because it's very
neutral so it looks like this and as you
can see it's just very
very neutral but it adds a nice bronze
and just a sheen to my face and I really
like this because i am so pill right now
and I really just need all the help I
can get so those are all my favorites
for now I know this was kind of just a
quick video but I wanted to let you guys
know what I've been loving so definitely
