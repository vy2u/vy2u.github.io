my everyday makeup routine it is really
early in the morning right now it's like
6ish so I'm sorry if I look really tired
during this but yeah this is basically
what I do every day or at least when I'm
going to school which I was today so um
yeah I hope you guys like this and I did
forget to fill my eyeliner but that's
pretty self-explanatory I just threw it
on the photo a bottom lash line um so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this I hope
maybe this kind of helps you out and um
yes so keep watching wrist i take my
erase paste by benefit and put this
under my eyes just to kind of get rid of
my dark circles in the morning and i
find this works okay for me it's not my
favorite but i still use it then I just
behind my eyes benefit stay don't stray
and I actually really like this primer I
like the consistency of it so I just rub
that all over my eyes and yeah
then I take wind kaze broke the in The
Naked 2 palette this isn't my new
favorite light color it's like a silvery
champagne color which I really like a
post just normal champagne and I really
like the look this game so I just put
that all over my lid and yeah I really
really love it and then I just kind of
blend it out which you will see in a
minute so yeah I just kind of blend it
out and i only use one lip color for
school I don't really do crease colors
or anything yeah so now I'm just
highlighting my brow bone with foxy we
became naked 2 palette and then I just
take 20 call and put this in my inner
corner is to kind of brighten up my eyes
next I take a clear brow gel and just
set my eyebrows with this so they stay
in place all day and live a little bit
neater and then I take Maybelline
falsies mascara I just started using
this so I'm kind of starting to get the
use or they get the hang of it so yeah I
put a lot on I don't really film all of
it in this clip but you get the point
and I forget to fill my eyeliner but I
will show that in a minute what I use I
use the Nick slide on glide on and then
I put some mascara on my lower lash line
and set my eyeliner with a brown powder
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this and
now my hair I put down and I'm done so
yea once again I hope you guys like this
