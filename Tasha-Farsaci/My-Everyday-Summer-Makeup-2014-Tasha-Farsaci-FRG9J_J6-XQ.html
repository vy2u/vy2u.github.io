summer makeup routine video and I'm
pretty sure this was requested or like
my getting ready video for somewhere but
I don't really do my hair in this number
so as you can tell so I didn't we
include that it's basically just me
doing my makeup but obviously my makeups
not exactly the same every day this is
just what I do the majority of the time
if I want to look like decent I won't
wear eyeliner everyday like lots of
times I just wear mascara but um I put
the eyeliner in this because you know if
I want to look alive if I wear it I
apologize my lighting I know I have
terrible lighting off the place where I
film my makeup if the Whiting's not as
good as like right here even if this
isn't great wedding so I apologize about
that but make sure you watch this video
in HD because I do have an HD camera and
people with my camera is terrible but
it's actually a key so if you change it
into HD you can do that on your phone as
well there's a little setting on the top
or if you're on your computer as a
setting at the bottom please watch in HD
because I upload an HD and I feel like a
lot people don't know that and it's a
lot better for videos like this so this
is my everyday makeup as you can see
this is what I do basically every day
and yeah I'm looking pretty tan right
now so I'm happy about that but if you
want to learn how I do my makeup like
this then keep on watching hey first
things first I'm just going to clip all
this hair back because I hate when I
gets in my face while I'm doing my
makeup then i'm taking my Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer and I'm
putting this under my eyes as well as on
any blemishes that I have and just
blending it in
I also like to put all my eyelids just
to get rid of any of the veins that you
can see there
then I'm taking my new favorite eyebrow
product it's the anastasia dipbrow
pomade and taking the Anastasia brush I
think it's thick number 12 or something
just combing through my eyebrows of the
spoolie end and then the other end I'm
just kind of putting it on my eyebrows
if you want a better eyebrow routine let
me know but I kind of just square off
the edge and fill in the rest how I like
it and this isn'ta blonde color if I
didn't already say that because I've
been getting my hair lighter and I've
been needing a good eyebrow color then
taking my NYX eyeliner I think it took a
slight on glide on one in brown
perfection I'm just lining my upper lash
line and it's really hard to get this on
camera so I did the best that I could I
tried guys that's what it looked like
when i was done and then i'm taking the
knicks moonbat eyeshadow in betrayal and
you can see I use this all the time and
I'm just setting my eyeliner with this
because it makes it look a little bit
more neat and tidy and it also just kind
of blends it out and fixes my mistakes
then taking the NYX jumbo eye shadow
pencil in milk and putting this under my
brow bone on both sides I should have
blended this a little bit better in this
video so I'm sorry don't comment that
and I'm also putting it on my inner
corners and blending it out with my
finger before I am going to set it
and then I'm taking max vapor I shadow
and putting this over the jambalaya
shadow and yeah I should have blended
that better I didn't really notice until
rewatching this just putting it in there
and then i'm taking my favorite mascara
ever l'oreal voluminous million lashes
and putting it on it's hard to fill
mascara as well so i didn't film me
doing all of it here and it's an awkward
angle but don't mind that and then I'm
also putting it on the bottom lashes
then taking my NARS Laguna bronzer I'm
just putting this on the apples of my
cheeks my temples a little bit down my
nose I believe and then blending it into
my neck and after that I am all done and
I take my crazy hair down and that was
about it so here's some awkward modeling
and I hope you guys enjoyed this bye
