my everyday summer makeup routine this
one is some requested on previous videos
so I thought I would do it for you guys
just a little disclaimer because it is
this summer I'm definitely not wearing
this much makeup every single day a lot
of times I don't want makeup at all or
I'll just for a little bit of mascara
but for the days where I like to wear a
little bit more makeup or if I'm filming
or if I'm going somewhere this is most
likely the makeup look that I'll be
wearing before I get into the makeup if
you guys aren't subscribed to my channel
please subscribe to me it would mean the
world and it's just one little click and
if you guys aren't following me on
social media and you want to keep up
with my life that's a great place to
find me I'm just gonna put them right
here and I'll put them down in the
description box as well yeah so here's
just a better look at the makeup I think
it's really natural and pretty and it's
definitely something that I think
everyone can pull off and it'll look
good on a lot of different ages so if
you want to learn how I do my makeup
everyday then keep watching hey guys so
here I am with no makeup and in the
summer my skin is pretty nice actually I
don't really get that many breakouts cuz
I'm in this a lot and I'm actually
pretty lucky to have good skin I don't
really get acne or anything so for me I
don't use any foundation I just go right
to concealer but you know if you need
foundations feel free I just don't use
it so if I look over here it's because
that's where my mirror is and I kind of
had this weird setup I know I know how
it's gonna film this but the concealer
uses the Maybelline instant age rewind
and this is way too light for me I
bought the wrong shade and then I was
way too lazy to go return it and get a
new one so this is in neutralizer I
don't even know what that means but yeah
it's way too light for me clearly but I
still use it I need to get a new one
and then just taking a little beauty
blender I kind of just like to blend it
out underneath my eyes once I've done
that I also like to put a little bit of
concealer on my eyelids it's just to
kind of cover up the veins obviously
depending on where I have breakouts or
how my skin is I put a more or less
concealer on but that's just kind of
what I felt like doing today next thing
I do is I set my concealer with this
Rimmel stay matte powder I love this
stuff and I think this is a little bit
closer to my skin tone so it kind of
helps the really light concealer okay
next up our eyebrows so I've gone
through so many horrible eyebrows stages
I went through the plucked two barely
nothing stage and but filling in and
like squaring them off into bricks stage
so now I think I'm at a pretty good
stage you can let me know girls are
pretty sparse though I just don't have a
lot of eyebrow hair I've never found
them done I just pluck them you know
once in a while so I definitely do have
to fill them in to get them how I want
so by far my favorite products to use
for eyebrows are Anastasia anastacio
whatever you want to say they're my
favorites I'm gonna use a combination of
two today one is their brow ways in
taupe and then one is the dip brow
pomade in blonde so I'm just using a
little spooley side of the brow is to
kind of brush through my brows and get
them ready to be filled in okay so I
need to get close up to my new for this
so I don't know how well you're gonna be
able to see it but basically what I like
to do is just take those brows and kind
of line the bottom part of my eyebrows
so you I get kind of like a line
underneath and then I fill the rest of
my eyebrow in with the pomade
okay so this is my a grouse after I've
killed the man as you can see I kind of
lined this part with the brow is and
then I just filled in the rest of kind
of expose areas with the dip brow pomade
okay so what I like to do next is kind
of set my eyebrows with an eyebrow gel
and I actually don't use an eyebrow gel
I use this Maybelline clear mascara and
it's really gross looking now but please
yeah you can see it because he like gets
my eyebrow powder and stuff on it
but I like this a lot it's really cheap
and I view this I've used this for a
long time and it works really well so I
like to kind of wipe the excess product
off the little brush and then I just
kind of start from the end and brush my
eyebrows kind of just like into the
place that I want them to be in and then
I like to brush the front hairs up and
then kind of fly them down and just once
again get them into the place that I
want them okay so once my eyebrows are
done I like to move on to eyeshadow now
my eyeshadow kind of varies every day
depends on what I'm feeling what I'm
wearing but for the most part I like to
wear a kind of pinky champagne shimmery
colors so I'm going into my Mac palette
tonight and I'm going to be using Naked
Lunch and all that glitters so I'm just
putting naked lunch all over my lid
and then recently I've been taking kind
of a little bit of a darker pinky
champagne color today I'm doing all that
glitters by Mac and just on my fluffy
kind of blending crease brush I just put
this into the crease and it just adds a
tiny bit of dimension but not too much
and you don't have to be too neat with
it okay the next thing I'm doing is
lining my upper lash line I don't do
this all the time but sometimes and I
guess on my eyes to pop a little more I
do this and for the summer I like to use
a brown I feel like black is kind of
harsh I'll do that if I'm wearing a lot
of black or if I'm going out to
something more fancy but for the
everyday kind of day I'm just using
brown and this is the Loreal extra
intense liquid pencil eyeliner I used to
use the NYX slide on glide on but I like
this one even more it goes on literally
like a liquid and it's amazing so I have
this in brown and black but today like I
said I'm using the brown like I said
it's really hard for me to get this on
camera so I'm gonna do this off-camera
but I'll show you what it looks like
when I come back okay so now that I'm
done with the eyeliner you can see I
just kind of did like a medium line on
top okay so once I've done the eyeliner
on top I like to do my highlights for my
eye makeup I'm just taking max vapor
from my matte palette once again it's
kind of just like a light shimmery ish
color and I put this underneath my brow
bone as well as on my inner corners
okay so once I'm done with all the eye
shadow I like to apply mascara I use
different mascara all the time I don't
really have one that I stick to so right
now I'm just using this little baby
Smashbox full exposure mascara and I
like to put mascara on both my upper and
lower lashes okay so once I'm done with
my mascara I like to put on some blush
my favorite one right now is NARS orgasm
I like it because it's kind of warm and
shimmery and I just feel like it looks
like over the tan okay then the final
step that I do sometimes is add a little
highlighter this is the Becca
highlighter in opal and I just put a
little bit of this on my cheekbones just
to add a little bit of shimmer
whack-whack whack-whack whack-whack -
Samia be aware okay so that was the
video I hope this was helpful for you

makeup if you like this video please

awesome and also please leave any
comments down below I love reading
comments I read all of them and I'll try
to respond to as many as I can I'm sorry
that my nails were so gross in this
video I didn't have time to paint them
and I literally had gel nails on and I
like ripped the gel off so they're
really gross right now so if you noticed
that I'm sorry anyways it's like 90
degrees in the closet I'm filming in so
