everyday summer makeup routine I don't
really do a whole lot this summer I
pretty much skip out on I'd shadows and
that kind of stuff but I do like it to
be kind of bronzy so I add a little bit
of a shimmery bronzer and I just thought
this would be a fun video to you guys
the makeup that I wear so obviously I
don't want this every day the summer
this is only if I'm gonna be going
somewhere most the time I really don't
have makeup on but if I am merely going
somewhere or doing something where I
want to look better then this is the
makeup that I would most likely be
wearing I think all these products are
drugstores so that should be helpful for
you guys this is the more close up up of
look I hope you guys enjoy this video
and if you want to learn how I do this
then keep watching okay so what I do is
just clip my hair back so it doesn't get
in my face while I'm doing my makeup
then I'm going to take my eyebrow pencil
and fill in my eyebrows I have a whole
video on this so I will put a little
annotation right here if you want to go
watch it but basically I just kind of
square them on the edges and then fill
them in just to make them a little more
defined then I'm going to set them with
a clear eye brow gel mine's kind of
running out but this is a clear mascara
and it works just the same and it keeps
my eyebrows from moving all around
during the day
next I'm taking my brown pencil eyeliner
this one is great and I'm just lining my
upper lash line don't tell me this is
gonna cause wrinkles I know someone's
gonna say it I'm sorry I know but this
is the only way I can put eyeliner on so
I'm just gonna do this to both eyes and
then I'm gonna set it with this matte
brown eyeshadow also from NYX because
this keeps it on all day and I like to
make it look a little bit smudgy so as
you can see I kind of messily it fill it
in because I don't like it to look like
a harsh line that's another reason I use
pencil I just like it to look kind of
smudgy and I'm done next I'm taking my
L'Oreal voluminous million lashes
mascara this is really great and I'm
putting it on I don't film all of it
here because I put on somewhere to
mascara but you guys get the point if
you want a mascara routine let me know
and then I'm just putting a little bit
on my bottom lashes as well because I
like the look bags
now I'm taking my ELF of golden bronzer
this stuff is really nice and it was
only like three dollars and I used this
more of a highlighter and not a bronzer
and I just put this on my cheekbones
almost like you would have blushed I'm
not really into contouring and
everything so I just like how this looks
then I'm taking the lightest shade and
putting it in my inner corners as well
as my brow bone then I'm taking my
Burt's Bees and pomegranate and putting
this on my lips gives a nice little tint
and keeps them moisturized so I hope you
guys enjoyed this and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
