requested video I'm doing my hair care
routine today and how I got my hair long
and all that stuff because it's been
super requested from you guys so if you
knew my channel this is my hair I wore
it natural today just so you can see my
natural hair this is with some like
styling products I'll get to those later
on in the video but basically my hair is
fairly thick and wavy and long um maybe
some of you don't think it's thick you
don't think it's wavy you don't think
it's long but you know I think the most
majority of people would agree that my
hair is fairly thick long and wavy so
yeah that's what my hair looks like in
case you're not familiar with it also my
hair is slightly damp right now I took a
shower a few hours ago and it takes a
long time to dry so it's a little bit
damp but I wanted to film also if you're
not following me on social media you
guys totally should I post a lot about
with my personal life and what I'm doing
on the day to day so I'm going to put
those right around in this general area
I'll also put them in the description
box for those of you asking where I got
what I'm wearing I'm going to put
everything in the description I only
know how I want to format this video so
I think I'm just gonna kind of talk and
we'll see how that goes but I think the
main disclaimer I want to say for this
video is my hair I think is how it is
partly because genetics my mom had very
long hair so I just think some people
you know have the genes to grow longer
hair than others but I'm going to tell
you what I do and who knows maybe it'll
work for you as well so I do have color
treated hair I get highlights of every
three months or so and then I always get
like a haircut or a trend kind of
depends on how long my hair is sometimes
I get three inches off sometimes I get
one inch off it really depends on how
damaged my hair seems or you know
what I'm looking for but yeah I do get
blonde highlights and then I will get a
little bit of hair cut off each time I
go I don't normally do drastic cuts but
I will cut off like you know four inches
sometimes if I just feel like it's
really long when I go to the hairdresser
I just kind of ask for cool toned blonde
highlights I don't really have anything
other than that but I ask for sometimes
I'll bring in photos to kind of show
them like what I want okay so I think my
biggest tip for growing your hair longer
or why my hair is healthy and why it's
gotten as long as it has is because I
try not to use heat on my hair a lot now
I do use heat on my hair like probably
once a week but I think it's super
important to learn to kind of love your
natural hair or just be able to work
with it because that's saved my hair I
used to straighten my hair like all the
time but now I really kind of just like
gotten used to my natural hair and I
kind of figured out how I like to tame a
or products I like to use you guys
always ask me what shampoo and
conditioner I use and my conditioner
really does switch up all the time but
the shampoo I always use is this Paul
Mitchell blonde platinum blonde shampoo
and the reason I use this is that it
keeps my highlights from getting brassy
and I've found this makes my highlights
laughs and look better longer so I use
this all the time it's purple shampoo
you guys may or may not have heard of
that if you do have blonde hair um yeah
it's just the one that my hairdresser
from home recommended and I've been
using it ever since it's just like a
really dark liberal color you might be
able to see on the top there but yeah
it's simple it does a job I feel like my
highlights don't get brassy or anything
and they last a lot longer when I use
this and I just really like this in
terms of conditioners I really do switch
up all the time but I found that I tend
to use more of deep conditioning
treatments or masks as a conditioner as
opposed to regular conditioner because I
do have so much hair that it just it
needs the moisture you know so right now
I'm using um hair mask as my conditioner
iris got this one at beautycon LA
hey this is the shea moisture fruit
fusion coconut water weightless hair
mask deep condition and protect this one
is fine I haven't you know notice
anything miraculously different from
what I'm using this but you know I do
try to use a thicker deep conditioning
treatment I use the what's the brand
I've used the macadamia one that one's
really great I like that one a lot and
then if you're looking for a cheaper
alternative
I love the Aussie 3 minute miracle I
used to use that all the time I haven't
used it in so long because I've been
trying to use their products I've gotten
from like beautycon and stuff but I'll
put a little picture of it here if you
guys have been watching me for a long
time I used to talk about this stuff all
the time but the Aussie treatment of
miracle is literally like three dollars
at the drugstore and I would just use
that as a conditioner so with my hair
because it is wavy it does tend to get
frizzy and when I get out of the shower
it's impossible to comb it if I don't
put product in my hair after the shower
it's literally a train wreck guys so I'm
going to show you kind of some of the
things that I use so like I said my hair
is so tangling when I go to the shower
so I always use a detangler I love the
kids detangle order but this is just the
swab kids detangling spray it's like two
dollars and it does the trick it smells
like apples I always use this stuff so
yeah I recommend it and if I didn't use
a detangler after the shower I would not
be able to brush through my hair at all
and I know some people are going to say
you're not supposed to brush your hair
and it's wet but if I don't it's
actually I'm not for like a nest I don't
know it I have to
okay so depending on what I want to do
in my ear is kind of what I'll put in it
but it's just gonna be like a variety of
these kinds of things like today I just
used a leave-in conditioner this is the
frizzies daily nourishment leave-in
conditioner and then I also use this
Herbal Essences mousse this stuff's
great I've used this for years so this
just adds like a little bit of extra
texture and get rid of the frizzy my
hair it's the totally twisted Crow
boosting moves from Herbal Essences and
then sometimes I will also use an argan
oil
Moroccan oil honestly that's pretty much
all I do to my hair like I said I think
I'm just lucky to have good genes to
have hair that grows fast and is healthy
but you know I do use a lot of products
I do take care of my hair and I do be my
haircut seriously guys you have to get
your haircut I know you don't want to if
you're trying to grow your hair out but
it'll just get dead just look bad and
your hair is going to be way healthier
if you're just going to trim every you
know a couple months or so so I think
that's what my biggest tips like I said
and then also you know try not to use
heat all the time yes so if you guys
have any more questions about my hair
leave them in the comment section below
and I'll try to answer them they're not

again like I said in the beginning of
the video if you're not following me on
social media I'm going to put those in
the description box okay thank you guys
