want to say I'm sorry that I haven't
been making videos I do have a good
reason I started school September 7th
and I'm taking a lot of advanced classes
this year I'm actually taking one
college level class and I'm in high
school so that's definitely hard it's
tough took me two hours I'm one homework
worksheet last night two hours so I've
definitely been studying a lot too I've
already had like lots of quizzes and
stuff so definitely difficult if you
guys want like a school vlog so far let
me know and maybe I'll do that but
that's that and also I did get my
haircut which kind of might make you
guys hate me um you guys seem to love my
hair I mean I like my hair but I don't
really see that much special about it as
you can see it goes to like here one
side does up longer than the other one
camera but I promise it's not and my
hair was like to my belt before so I got
like three inches off and don't hate me
for this guys um I asked for two they
always cut off more you know so um my
head goes back really fast and I hadn't
got in here cut in seven months so I
decided that I needed one in and it's
still pretty long I guess I mean I don't
know tell me what you guys think about
that um I actually talked about it on my
Facebook page so if you haven't liked it
already go like it down below
yeah so basically this video is going to
be my hair care routine so many people
have requested this and I hope you still
want to watch it I mean I still did the
same thing in my hair and I did when it
was longer um you know some people might
expect that I have like a huge elaborate
hair care routine but really I don't do
much I mean this is gonna be my routine
my straighten my hair so if you wanted
my hair looks like when I'm doing this
or how I do it or whatever I'm gonna
show you that like if I wear it natural
I really don't do anything at all much
but this stuff is kind of just gonna
show you the products I use because I
get so many questions on what shampoo
and conditioner use so that's what I'm
gonna start off with okay so I don't
really ever use the same shampoo and
conditioner I mean when I run out I just
switch off to a new one my mommy
spies whatever I never really go and
pick something out which I know is kind
of weird I'm like a beauty guru and I
don't really pick out my own shampoo and
conditioner but I did this one time and
I've been using this for a while I don't
even really know if this works um I took
the John Frieda go blonder and this is
my natural hair color it's kind of just
like a dark blonde with like streaks of
lighter blonde in it sorry guys my phone
is ringing I had to go into it but yeah
basically I don't really know if this
works this is my natural hair color just
kind of dirty blonde I mean I have some
like streaks from like the Sun but I've
never highlighted highlighted it who
dyed it so I'm going using this for
about a month I mean I don't really know
if it's been doing anything but um it
makes it doesn't it makes my hair soft I
guess I need my hair soft now so um I'm
just using this okay my phone is ringing
again
it's my house phone cuz I'm a new hold
on I'm gonna answer this okay that was
my mom she interrupted my video bad mom
okay so yeah I've been using this for
like a month I mean it's fine they smell
really good um so this is what I use I
mean you can try it out I'm not
necessarily suggesting it cuz I don't
know if my hair is blonder but yeah so
this is what I use before this I'm
pretty sure I use herbal essences um the
blue one and I think it's hello
hydration and I ran out of the
conditioner so I was just using some
Tresemme moisturizing conditioner so you
know nothing really fancy I just kind of
use whatever umm but yeah I've been
using this for a while and some people
say this like you would take their scalp
or I've heard like bad things about this
but it doesn't do anything to my scalp
I'm fine my scalp is fine okay
I don't know what I'm talking about okay
so anyways I will put the shampoo in my
hair rinse it out and then I'll put the
conditioner from like here down so I my
get all crazy up there and then if I'm
going to be straightening my hair I will
also put in the Aussie 3 minute miracle
and this is probably the best smelling
hair product I've ever ever had it
smells like coconut like tropical mess
like there's definitely a lot of coconut
and I think there might be like
pineapple but this is only three dollars
it's like from two to four dollars I
know at like a drugstore and this stuff
doesn't necessarily do much to my hair
if I don't straighten it but if I use
this and then I straighten right my hair
is so soft inside shiny shiny as you
could might not be able to tell that
when my hair is pretty shiny and it's
really soft and silky and that is
because I used this I put this in from
like here down once again I leave it in
for three minutes so you can like shave
or something while you're doing this and
then you rinse it out and oh my god I
love this stuff and then your hair
smells like it like my hair still smells
like this and it's just amazing and I
definitely recommend this especially
when you're gonna straighten your hair
heat style and afterwards because it
works a lot better when you do that
something I do is I never ever blow dry
my hair like the only time I've ever
like blow-dried my hair is when my
hairdresser does it at my hair salon so
I did a good today when she like caught
my hair whatever but other than that I
never do it basically my hair takes so
long it took the hairdresser like a half
an hour to dry my hair and she's like a
professional so me it would take me
forever I don't know why my hair's
really think you can't really tell but
there's a lot more back here and it just
takes a long time so I never blow dry my
hair and I guess that's a good thing
because you're not using as much heat so
I love my hair air dry because then I'm
cutting back on the heat since I'm going
to straighten it you know and then once
it's air dried I spray in my he
protected because I'm gonna be
straightening my hair with heat
obviously I mean I use the Tresemme heat
tamer spray
okay the cap is all uneven and don't
mind that but basically it looks like
this
smells decent I guess I mean it's fine
um you can get this at the drugstore for
like four dollars I'm thinking for 450
somewhere in there um and this is my
second bottle so I obviously like it I
mean I don't really know if it works I
mean I'm guessing he looks you know cuz
like there's no really way to know if
it's protecting your hair but my hair is
pretty good I don't really get split
ends even after seven months of not
getting it cut so I guess this works so
I spray this on my hair especially on my
ends because that's where they get the
driest and let that dry and then I
straighten my hair with this baby
I've had this for probably about a year
now
year and a half year and a half I'm
thinking um this is my Chi it's just the
original cheap as you can see I had Chi
see nevermind I'm really weird right now
okay so basically this is the original
teeth before I had this I have had three
other hair straighteners and they worked
like horrible they pulled my hair and
they didn't work at all and each one got
progressively better but this one is
amazing um I love this it gets my hair
really straight this is after all day of
school too so if it's not perfectly
straight you know that's why this gets
my hair perfectly straight I do have
naturally wavy hair so it's not like my
hair straight naturally mist like it
makes my hair so soft and shiny and it
doesn't pull on my hair at all so this
is a great straightener and I'm pretty
sure I got some phallic or calm a while
back I'm not sponsored by them didn't
send me this I bought this so yeah I
love this straightener and it has a
really long cord so oh my god Wow okay
it has a really long cord so you can
like stretch it across the room missed
off and yeah so this is what I do I
shaved my hair with this I have a video
on how I straighten my hair it's really
old one of my first videos but I'll put
that down below in case you're
interested I still do it the same way um
my editing was horrible but you know
don't mind that one of my first videos
but then I strained my hair and I'm done
um
I've straightened my hair at night I do
all this at night and then I just
touched my hair up in the morning and
that's all I do basically that's my hair
routine and I don't have to wash my hair
for like four days but you know it's
gross but my hair is don't get greasy as
I've mentioned in other videos so I'll
like take showers every day but I'll put
my hair and like a shower cap or
whatever and then the next week I'll
repeat the process
so yeah that's fine your care routine if
you guys have any other questions put
them down below and I have been filming
every day this week and out for the day
so I'm gonna put them into an outfit of
the week at the end of the week
so I have been filming I just haven't
been uploading but yeah so if you guys
have any more questions with my hair
hair care routine you know down below
and also tell me if you out like a
school blog in what I've been doing so
far and yeah so I hope you guys like
this video and yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
