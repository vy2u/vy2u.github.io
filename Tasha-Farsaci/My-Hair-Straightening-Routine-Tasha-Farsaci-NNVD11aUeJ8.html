straightened my hair and I did one of
these videos a while back like one of my
first videos and it is just really
embarrassing um I say that all the time
but a lot of my old videos are awful and
I feel really bad that people watch them
because I still get a lot of views on
that so I figured I would do an updated
one my hair looks like this if you don't
already know it's pretty long and I like
to stay in it just because it's quicker
than curling it and I just like how it
looks better when I straighten it and I
leave it natural so yeah I basically
show you all the products I use and what
I do and stuff and yeah so if you guys
enjoy this and I'm going to take a
shower now or I own again this is
actually the next day but I'm gonna take
a shower and you'll see you in my hair
wet and then I will show you what I do
so yeah keep watching
okay so I just got out of the shower
which is why my hair is pretty wet it's
actually just kind of a damp now um but
basically what I did in the shower was
just washed my hair regularly with
shampoo and conditioner it really
doesn't matter which one I use I kind of
just use whatever I have and at the
moment I have the Aussie moistu um who
and conditioner I just love the way
these smell that's why I buy them but
they just look like this if you're
interested and they smell like coconuts
and stuff and they smell so good so I
get these for the smell so that's what I
did when I washed my hair and then after
I used those products I just put in my
Aussie 3 minute miracle which is just a
deep conditioner and I use this whenever
I'm going to straighten my hair because
I find that it makes it really really
soft and silky and shiny so then I got
out and left my hair in my towel for
about five minutes and then I just
brushed it out or combed it out with
this comb thing and I powdered it with
my normal part so now what I'm going to
do is spray the products that I use
before I straighten my hair the first
product that I like to use is the Aussie
hair insurance you probably realize by
now that I like Aussie a lot and that's
just because of the smell Plus these
things work really well so I just like
to spray this all throughout my hair and
especially focus it on my ends because
they're kind of dead at the moment I
just kind of spray it in my hand first
and then kind of just will get through
my hair
okay so after I do that I like to use my
renewing Moroccan oil from organics it
looks like this and you didn't want to
use a lot of this a little bit goes a
long way and I like to focus it from my
ears down and then mostly on my tips
because this makes my hair really soft
as well so I just got a tiny bit on my
hand rub it together and then just kind
of work it throughout my hair on my ends
and just kind of evenly distribute it
okay so after I put those in my hair I
like to let my hair air dry it takes me
like two or three hours for my hair to
fully dry which is a long time but it's
pretty long and thick as you might be
little so I don't blow dry my hair I
feel like I just opened a huge poodle
when I do that
like my hair legit is out to here so I
just like to let it air dry and once I'm
done with the air drying I would come
back so yeah keep watching okay so my
hair is dry now this is my natural hair
it's just like awkwardly kind of waving
a little bit frizzy and yeah so I let it
completely dry and I also put a little
bit of mascara on so I look more
presentable and yeah so what I'm going
to start off with is Frankie protectant
into my hair the means are my voice is
craft or something but just spraying a
little bit of heat protectant into my
hair I like to use the Tresemme one and
I'm like almost out of this so yeah I'm
just going to spray this all throughout
my hair and then I'm just gonna kind of
brush through my hair with this little
brush comb thing I don't even know what
a brush and a comb differences I mean I
don't know which ones which
so yeah I'm just gonna kind of evenly
distribute the product to all my hair
and then I like to clip up my hair half
a path down I'm doing this just so that
I can do it half and half so it's like
easier I don't know that's just what I
do so I'm gonna clip my hair up okay so
this is what it look like once I clip it
up I like to leave more hair on the
bottom of the top so I guess this is
like 3/4 and this is like a quarter I
don't know maybe not but I like to do
that just because I do so yeah I'm gonna
spray a little bit more heat protectant
just in case I didn't you know get
enough before okay and I'm gonna start
straightening my hair I kind of take it
off in little sections and pieces and I
use the Chi original straightener and it
works amazing I love this I've had it
for so long
and I just kind of know straighten my
hair this parts pretty self-explanatory
um but yes so I'm going to do that a
little bit more
I like to brush my hair out before
straighten it just so that it's not
Almaty once I'm going down it and I just
want my straightener down the piece a
few times until it gets as straight as
I'd like it so I'm going to finish this
side and I'll be back
okay so I finished with the side and
then I'm just going to show you the side
of one last time so once again I'm just
brushing it out and then I like to
suction it a little bit but not as much
and then I did strainer
you
okay so now that I'm done that I'm going
to let down this hair in the back and
then I'm just going to kind of flip my
hair around and then put it how I
normally part it so I normally part my
hair on the side over here and then I
pull it to the front brush it out and
then kind of fix up the pieces you see
there's like a little wave here that I
must have missed and I just go for that
and then I just do the same with the
other side and that is it that is how I
straighten my hair once again it takes
me about 15 minutes you know when I'm
not filming it probably took me longer
today but I love my straightener it
looks awesome and I just really like how
straight hair looks especially since my
hair is so long I like to kind of make
it look longer by straightening it and
it just makes my hair not frizzy and
super silky and shiny as you can
probably see here so yeah um hope you
guys enjoyed this video I hope it was
helpful I don't know if it was but I
definitely recommend all the products I
use because my hair is not how to cut
for a while now and it doesn't look
really damaged at all so I definitely
like the products that I use and yes so
once again I hope you guys enjoyed this
