collection video in case you aren't
familiar with Lululemon it's basically
like a yoga workout clothing store I
never really used to have a lot of it
because I didn't really work out but now
that I've been in college and you get
like a gym membership to the gym here
three as a student oh I've been going to
the gym a lot more so because of that
I've been really into workout clothes
and Lululemon's workout clothes are such
good quality and they're so nice and
cute so it's kind of hard to not buy
them gulaman can be a bit of an
investment so I thought it would be cool
to show you guys the pieces I have and
the things I like and don't like so you
guys can be kind of more familiar with
the products in case you want to buy
some I got in fighting through this
video from my really good YouTube friend
Gretchen loves beauty she has so much
Lululemon probably like five times what
I have and I think I have a pretty good
amount so she is crazy obsessed with
Lulu so I thought would be fun to show
you guys the eleven pieces that I have
and if you guys have things that I don't
have and you want to recommend them to
me just totally let me know in the
comments down below anyways first thing
I'm gonna start off with is like
headbands and I have two from Lulu I
don't believe our headbands a lot unless
I'm working out just because I feel like
my head looks like an egg when I wear
that but Lulu's are really good because
they have like a rubbery part on the
inside so it really likes doesn't like
slide back and it sticks to where you
put it so I have this like medium with
grey one it just has like a little logo
and then I also have a thicker black
line and I sweat a lot so these are good
because my hair is literally dropping
when I'm done in the gym so I like the
headbands um once again I only wear them
when I'm working out because I look like
an egg but I do recommend the headbands
moving on I'm going to talk about sports
bras and I apologize I do not know the
names for all of the things I have um I
wish I did but if I do know them I'll
totally let you know so I do know that
this sports bra is the free to be wild
sports bra and this is like probably
their most popular one it's just the one
that's like super strappy in the back
this is so cute if you're wearing like a
tank top with an open back or just like
a back you can see um yeah so I just
have the black one
and then the next sports bra I got is
very like funky but I got it on sale so
I didn't feel like bad about buying it
but basically it's this really cool like
kind of pixelated floral pattern um but
I got it because the back is so cool
once again it strappy I have a thing for
like strappy back things so I wear this
one with a tank I have that the back is
like super low I have a one pair of
shorts cool lemon um I'm not really wear
workout shorts that often I'm more of
like a cropped legging type of person
but these ones are really cute and
really flattering so I think these are
the swiftly shorts I'm not completely
sure but they look like this they are
very short so if you have like really
long legs but you're really tall these
might not be the best for you but they
basically have like kind of a spandexy
waistband and then it's more of like an
athletic material short it's really nice
they have like a zipper on the back I
love with lemons things and zippers on
the back I think it looks cute and it's
functional okay next I'm going to go
into crop leggings so I like crops the
most when I'm working out if I wear
full-length leggings I get way too
sweaty so just this like little inch of
skin that is like left from crops I feel
like makes a big difference I don't know
so I do have one pair of the wonder
under cropped but I lost them like I
have no idea where they are I'm play
upset because those are my plain black
ones I don't know where they are I hope
I didn't like accidentally throw them
out or something because I searched my
entire dorm room and I can't find them
so that's upsetting but I'm gonna show
you my other crops okay so the first one
is I have these are kind of an odd
material but there's some of my
favorites they're not really black
they're not really grey they're not
really Navy I'm not totally sure what
color they are but they look the closest
tube laughs at anything else
um this look like this they're like very
weird material I don't know how to
explain it
he's like a better look at the material
it's very thick very stretchy um
I don't know what to explain it but I
really love this material it really like
sucks you in
it has like a high waistband and then
the logo is just down here the next pair
of crops I
have is that same material but this is
the in the flow crop and basically they
look super weird off because they like
curl up but when you wear them they look
normal they just have like bruising on
the side so this is a burgundy pair I
also got these on sale these ones are
very flattering the logo is like right
under your butt so it looks like really
flattering I don't know but I really
like these ones as well okay so my last
pair of crops I really love these ones
they're so cool I don't know the style
these I got these on eBay actually um I
just thought they were so cool but
they're more like a spandex eworkgroup
material so they feel more like your
typical workout material I don't know
how to explain it but yeah they're
basically navy blue and then they have
this really really cool floral print and
then at the bottom it goes into like
this Navy kind of heather print and then
some Navy mesh so these are really funky
and really cool okay moving on to
full-length pants the first ones I'm
going to show you are the groove pants I
think they're basically your classic
like Flair of yoga pants um these ones
already wonder under material so like
they are pilling I'll kind of get up
close to show you what I mean yeah so I
don't know how well you can see that but
as you can see they do pill on the butt
a little bit which like is quite
annoying because you are paying a lot
for them but Lululemon basically has
this return policy whereas if like your
pants pill or whatever and you can like
send them a photo don't get you they'll
give you like an e gift card so you can
like return them and get a new pair
which I take an advantage of with my
pants that are this material because
they do pill even when you do follow
like the washing instructions so
although this is their mostly popular
material I don't know if I really
recommend it because they pill but at
the same time you can get a new pair of
pants so it's like yeah anyway so these
are just black like flared yoga pants I
don't know where these ones that often
they have a little logo there the good
thing about Lululemon is if you are
short like me they will have your pair
certain like shirts and anything for
free when you buy them so that's really
good I had to have like so much off
these pants because laboux pants run
very long I have another pair of pants
in that style these are literally my
favorite ones are just plain black
leggings these are the High Times pant I
did have the wonder under but I like
these ones more because they're
high-waisted and they're seven eight
seven eighths length so if you're sure
like me the seven eighths line is like
perfect it goes burnt linked to your
ankle so if you're sure definitely keep
that in mind but I've only had these for
like a month and they're already pilling
and I really have washed them according
to instructions so that's super annoying
the next two I have also 7/8 length but
once again they're full length on me so
these are the Nspire crop now inspired
tight I think I could be wrong but I
really love these I have two pairs of
these so the first one is this crazy
pattern I really tried these on as a
joke because I was trying on a black top
and I ended up really liking them and
they were on sale so they're this crazy
black white and gray pattern they have
like some mesh up here and then they go
down and then as you can see this flat
part right here is matched and I cut off
like right at the angle these are so
flattering the material is once again
that like classic workout material and
something else I love about them is that
they have zippers right here I don't
know if you can tell but I think this is
just like a really cute detail and it's
functional because you can feel like
keys and cards and to like ease and
stuff like that in them so these ones
are so cute and then I also have them in
this gray color
I think grey colored leggings are so
flattering they make your butt look so
good so I just have them in gray in
black you can kind of see the difference
what you can see the zippers better on
this one and then they go down and they
have this little mesh peep at the bottom
okay so I almost forgot I have one more
pair of crops they were just in the
laundry so these are the Wonder under
crops once again except they're in grade
so you can't really see pilling I don't
really notice it as much as I would on
the black ones at all and I've had these
for a good amount of time but I love
gray leggings
I said they're so cute and these ones
are really comfy so wonder under-cooks
okay so those are all the pants that I
have so I'm going to move into
short-sleeved shirts now I have two and
these are probably my favorite material
of shirts that Lulu has so I think these
are the swiftly T or swiftly I really
can't talk to swiftly tech T or
something like that you'll definitely be
able to find them on the website but
it's this really cool material I'm sure
you've seen it before so this is what it
looks like I really don't know how to
explain it but it's so cool and
comfortable and really flattering so I
have one of these shirts in this kind of
heathered teal color and then I have one
in this like light burgundy berry color
which is really cute as well and these
are some of my favorites they're so
flattering and I love them I have a tank
in that same style so it's just this
thing is called black berry Rumble or
something I don't really know but it's a
tank top the same material I really like
the tank tops because like I said I get
so sweaty when I work out so sometimes
the short sleeve shirts or like even too
much so I really love this tank a lot
and it's such a pretty color okay the
next thing I have is the Y tank
something like that anyways it's a
classic style I have the same kind of
like heathered purpley color you're
going to see I really like like goes
purpley colors but yeah really cute I
have like a built-in bra such a classic
and I really like this one okay I think
this is called the wild tank it's very
similar to that one bra because the back
the bras like built-in and it's all
strappy which is really nice because you
don't have to worry about wearing a
sports bra with it it has been built in
and then it's just kind of like drapey I
don't know if you can see but this one's
like navy blue okay this next thing I
have
I'd only know I got it it was on sale
I'm not really a fan but it's just this
bright purpley color it's like a normal
time
and then the back has like a little mesh
segment and then it's like a y in the
back yeah I'm not a huge fan of this one
but I mean I still wear it I just don't
think it's like the cutest one ever the
last tank I have is called the happy
strappy tank
I remember that one because of the name
um so basically it's just a black tank
in the front pretty normal and the back
is really cute which is why I got it and
I'm pretty sure I got this one on sale
too I really try to get Lulu on sale as
it is pretty pricey but as you can see
it has some straps and X and then like
three more little straps okay lastly I'm
going to talk about my jackets so I have
three kind of jacket things from will be
the first one I'm really never wear I
honestly might be selling this on
Poshmark or more card pretty soon so I'm
going to put my usernames and my invite
codes to those down below those are
basically like after you can sell your
clothes so if you're interested in this
or any other things I have for sale
definitely check it out but I just I
mean this stuff it's really huge like a
really nice berry color for just a
little bit long for my liking um it's
quite quite long has a nice collar
really cute but I just wouldn't wear it
as if because I feel like it's too long
on me to be zipped I have one like half
zip kind of thing I can get it situated
this one's kind of like a sweater II
material I don't know if you can tell
but it's really soft just a little half
zip and then the bottoms have like some
black got on sale I get lots of things
on sale Hulu so this one's cute nice
just lounge around in okay last thing in
the hall probably one of my favorite
Lulu items if you have to get one thing
okay I would say like leggings but if
you want to get a jacket definitely get
this jacket it's the define jacket it's
so flattering you've probably seen
people wearing it honestly it's pretty
popular hopefully I can kind of show you
so I just have a black one it's
basically it's like pretty short it's
not Rachel along with the
other one it just like is really really
flattering kind of hugs your curves
you'll see it better in the Tryon but I
also really like the back of it looks
like that okay so hopefully this video
