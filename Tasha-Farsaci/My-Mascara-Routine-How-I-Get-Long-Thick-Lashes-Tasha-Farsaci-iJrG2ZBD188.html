routine this was super requested so I
decided I would do it for you guys
before you watch this it's pretty
obvious but i figured i would say it
that obviously this is probably not
going to turn out the same on you as it
does on me unless we have the same exact
eyelash but we probably all have the
same eyelashes and mine tend to be very
long already and pretty curly so if you
have really short eyelashes obviously
it's not going to look the same as it
does on me over the years though i've
kind of picked up on a few tips and
tricks to getting my eyelashes to look
how I like them so I think that they
will work on most people even if we
don't have the same eyelashes and i
decided i would share those tips with
you so i'm going to show you what my
eyelashes look like now so as you can
see they're pretty long and i like them
to be almost clumpy i mean i know
they're not super clumpy but they're not
really separated and I kind of like them
to look like that I know some people
might not but that's just my personal
preference so i'm going to show you you
know how i get them like this
mascara that I'm going to be using is
one of my all-time favorites and it's
drug store so I thought it would be the
perfect one to use in this video know if
this is super popular but it's the
Loreal voluminous million lashes mascara
and it looks like this I love L'Oreal
mascaras I feeling Maybelline mascaras
get all the hype but really L'Oreal is
probably my favorite so once again if
you want to learn how I put on mascara
and all my tips and tricks for getting
my eyelashes as long and thick as
possible then keep watching okay the
first thing I do is kind of weird i
actually tug on my eyelashes you want to
do this very lightly so that it doesn't
really like pulled them out I know this
might not be a super good for you but it
kind of helps me to get them into the
shape that I like my next tip is to coat
the backs of your lashes first I don't
really know why but somehow this kind of
helps them in the long run and makes
them look better
next thing I do is just apply a normal
coat to the front
this is going to look kind of creepy but
I like to kind of blink really fast with
the base of the wand at the base of my
lashes and this creates a lot of volume
this is the most important tip so I put
it really slow you want to put the wand
behind you lashes and kind of twist it
and curl it towards your eye and slowly
like pull away and this creates so much
volume and this makes a huge difference
at least my eyelashes and use it in kind
of normal speed and you can see just the
volume of ads and then here's me doing
it again on this I it's kind of hard to
not get the mascara on your lid but
after a while you kind of get used to it
I also like to take something like an
end of a brush and kind of separately
lashes and get them more into the place
that I like them I find that this brush
works nicely and it helps me kind of
give them the more flared and separated
look and that's it it's all I do and I
know it's kind of long I don't do all
this every day but I figured these tips
would help you and I hope they do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
