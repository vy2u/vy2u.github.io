I killed you so you'd stay
cuz you would not be
hi guys so today I'm doing a very very
requested video I'm doing my morning
routine for summer and honestly this is
not what I do every day for summer like
I'm gonna address in this video and a
lot of the times in the summer I either
don't leave my house and wear pajamas
all day or I don't wear a dress but I
wanted to dress cute for this video and
I do wear dresses a lot of the time if
I'm going somewhere just because they're
like comfy and breezy so that's that and
also I do go to Starbucks for breakfast
in this video and I definitely do not do
that any day or every day about any
means like I will probably make
breakfast but I thought it would be more
fun for the video and I do go to
Starbucks a lot so I thought it would be
fun to throw in here but I just want you
guys to know that I definitely do not do
that every day and I don't recommend
that because that would be pretty
expensive so we're just stop blabbing
now and just get onto the video okay so
since it's summer I basically get to
sleep in as long as I want
so I normally wake up I like 1011
somewhere in there today I woke up early
so I could film this video but basically
it roll out of bed next thing I do is
open my blinds because my room is really
really dark when they're closed and I
had like my closet door open so it
wasn't super dark but I open them up to
kind of wake me up and make me feel like
it's absolutely daytime
next I like to go on instagram my
instagram is free see Tasha in case you
want to follow me but I pulled out my
feed and kind of see what I missed from
the night before and then I go back to
my profile kind of check it out does
anyone else creep on themselves because
I do but I go on my most recent picture
and I normally check and see if I missed
any comments whatever
once I'm done checking my phone I get
out of bed try to decide if I'm gonna
make my bed and that's normally uh no
because no one's gonna be seeing it then
I go to my bathroom and begin to put my
hair up and kind of put a headband on so
my hair is out of my face I get a dip
washcloth and kind of just rub it over
my face and I make sure the washcloth is
feeding by the way I'm taking my brewery
blemish fighting ice cleanser and I just
kind of washed my face with this this
also helps to wake you up in the morning
because I literally don't sleep I stay
up till like 3:00 a.m. so I'm still
tired even if I sleep in then I just
rinse it off with the water
now it's on the makeup I'm just kind of
concealing my undereyes and then any
little like blemishes I have with my
Maybelline concealer then it's time for
eyebrows first of all I brushed them out
with a little spoolie and then I'm using
anastasia dipbrow pomade and starting to
fill them in a little bit and then after
that I use Anastasia it's like brow
powder and I fill them in a little bit
more then I just take a clear brow gel
and I kind of set them so they don't
move around because my eyebrow hairs are
a little bit long
next I'm taking a champagne colored
eyeshadow base I'm just putting this all
over my lid I think it's benefit RSVP
and then I'm taking Urban Decay sin and
I'm just putting this all over my lid
this is like my go-to color when I don't
really want to do a ton of eyeshadow but
just a little bit so I put this all over
the lid blend it out and then I'm taking
a highlight color I want to say it's max
vapor and I'm just highlighting under my
brows and in my inner corners next I'm
just lining my upper lash line with a
black pencil liner I didn't really do
too much on camera because it's kind of
hard for me without being up close but I
did as much as I could and then after
that I'm just putting on mascara I don't
really know what to 1 this is I took a
new one I got it's a Maybelline one but
I put some on my top and my bottom
lashes and then I'm taking benefit
Dallas and I'm putting this on my cheeks
and and I'm taking NARS Laguna bronzer
and I'm just putting this on my face a
little bit more just to kind of add a
glow and that is the finished makeup
this is what I normally do sometimes I
use brown liner but you know most of the
time then my hair was actually
straighten from the day before I shower
at night but I don't always wash my hair
like use a shower cap which is what I
did and I'm just kind of fixing up my
hair like giving it a little bit
straighter and clearly these is my use
in my clothing for bedtime so I need to
change out of that
ha I love this dress and some ever
combien Fitch and I actually work there
in case you guys don't know but it's
really cute I'm putting on some earrings
then I'm trying to decide what bag to
use and my ex-boyfriend got me that one
so probably not we're gonna use my
burgundy Rebecca Minkoff minimap it
matches the dress kind of I think the
other one would have matched better but
you know so here's a better look at the
outfit once again the dress is for
Abercrombie and Fitch the sandals are
from ever coming to beg Rebecca Minkoff
your ratings target then I'm just
brushing my teeth gotta do this I want
my retainer to but I didn't want to show
you guys me taking that out because that
would be kind of disgusting but yeah
just brushing my teeth
after that I will leave my bathroom
and then I'm texting my friend Melanie
and asking her if she wants to get
breakfast
Starbucks as you can see here and what
do you think she says
yeah so I get in the car I like to call
this the swag mobile it's um yeah has
lots of swag oh yeah drive it away you
go to Starbucks together shout out to
Mel's boyfriend for filming this and
then we get our food
I got a lemon like pound cake thing I
normally get the pumpkin bread but they
didn't have it and I got an iced vanilla
soy latte so good I definitely recommend
trying it but that is it oh wait I got
an action shot I'm Mel eating so I hope
