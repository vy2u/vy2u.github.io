walk over into my bathroom again put my
hair up so I can start washing my face
putting my makeup on all that jazz so
I'm using the Biore blemish fighting ice
cleanser I really like this in the
morning because it really freshens up
your face and it's kind of minty feeling
I don't know if something can feel minty
but that's what it feels like to me so I
put this all over my face and kind of
what my face beforehand just rub it all
over because my skin's been breaking out
lately and then I just rub it off with a
damp washcloth
moving on to makeup I'm starting off
from Maybelline semi foundation I
normally don't wear a foundation but
lately my skin has been breaking out a
lot you can only tell you but it
honestly has and it's really weird for
me because I'm not used to wearing
foundation so I'm applying this with
little sponge it's like a beauty blunder
except it was like $4 at my local
grocery store so you know check that out
if you don't want to spend however much
it is on the Beauty Blender I'm taking
my favorite Maybelline concealer and I'm
just putting this under my eyes and on
the spots that I'm breaking out just for
a little extra coverage and then I once
again I'm blending it in would be fake
one of the day blender then I'm taking
the Rimmel stay matte matte powder
what the Rimmel stay matte powder and
I'm putting this all over my face just
to set everything then I'm taking my
favorite eyebrow product the anastasia
dipbrow pomade and I'm filling my
eyebrows in with this as you can tell in
a minute I like the square mine off and
it takes me a while so that's why I do
it if you don't like it I'm sorry that's
just quite like my eyebrows I know a lot
of people don't like it then I'm just
using my favorite eyeshadow mattes Naked
Lunch and putting this all over my lids
then taking NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk
I'm putting this on the inner corners of
my eyes and just blending this out I
really like how it looks when I
highlight the inner corner of my eyes
I'm taking my MAC eyeshadow in the Vapor
putting this underneath my brows and
then I'm just going to the settings the
milk pencil that I put on my inner
corners
then I'm aligning my upper lashline with
my NYX light on pencil in black and this
is my favorite eyeliner ever I
definitely recommend it it's kind of
hard for me to get this on camera but I
did the best that I could and after that
I just like to set it with a black eye
shadow because that helps it stay better
and this fixes it up if it's not perfect
after that I'm applying my favorite
mascara of the moment it's the L'Oreal
miss manga mascara I really like it I do
have long eyelashes to begin with though
so I don't know how it's gonna work on
everyone but I just put that on my top
and bottom lashes then I take my Delos
blush and I just put this on the apples
of my cheeks and kind of rub it up to my
temples a little bit and then my NARS
Laguna bronzer I just put this on my
temples and
little bit on my neck and that's it for
the makeup
okay so this is the cooling iron and
we're gonna be using this video it's
what I've been using a lot lately so
it's the new me
titan-3 and it's super awesome because
as you can tell it comes with three
interchangeable barrels so if you're
appealing the circle which is what I do
in this video you can use the largest
barrel but if you're feeling a little
bit of tighter girls you can use either
of the other two I feel you can even
switch them up you know depending what
you're feeling but it's really awesome
it comes with a glove and I have 40% off
for you so you can get 40% off the
entire website with the code Kasia
fierce and you also get free shipping
with that so I have this down below here
so you can see it but it's awesome I
also love their argan oil which you can
see there and it's just awesome I
definitely recommend it for a gift or
for yourself and that's what I'm using
in this video ok first thing I do when I
start doing my hair is brush it out
because it can get pretty tangling
especially when I'm sleeping on it by
the way I get shower before this I
shower at night but I clip off half of
my hair on top of my head like so and
then starting from the bottom I just
take about one inch sections and wrap
them around the barrel and once again
this is the largest size barrel and I do
it away from my face
it's pretty easy I honestly don't think
it's very hard to catch on but I do that
all over my head and then just once
again I'm the last two and it's pretty
easy
and they're young
just shoot for the stars all right now
it's time for my outfit so I don't
normally throw my clothes before like
that but my showed some Hollister it's
really pretty in bohemian which is my
favorite type of shirt too as you can
see here and I just think it's super
pretty and I'm wearing it with some dark
wash jeans from Abercrombie and my new
favorite boots from Steve Madden guys I
love them
alright then I walk downstairs it's time
for breakfast because I'm a hungry girl
you know I'm growing I need my breakfast
I go right to the fridge as you can see
and what do you think I'm gonna eat oh
it's gonna be a surprise oh oh oh oh
toaster waffles so nutritious yeah guys
I'm really not that healthy so like I
like to toaster waffles and here I'm
eating too a lot of the times I eat
three sometimes even four but I'm
popping them into the toaster yeah and
you know just buttering them up really
healthy really healthy is putting them
you know nice nice nice and some syrup
Here I am
eating cake eating really unattractive
sorry
after I'm done eating I go back upstairs
and brush my teeth
you guys should always brush your teeth
honestly because it's kind of gross if
you don't but anyways yes just brushing
my teeth after that I go back downstairs
and put my shoes on for the day once
again these ones are from Steve Madden
and I am obsessed then I grab my
backpack which is from James Boyd as you
can tell put it on my shoulders and then
I am done I walk out the door and go to
school or the boss or my ride so I hope
you guys enjoyed this I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
