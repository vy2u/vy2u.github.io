my phone and I normally go on Instagram
because that is my favorite and you guys
should definitely follow me it's Lucy
Tasha but I can just look through all my
stuff and waste time once I finally
managed to get myself out of bed I go to
take a shower after the shower I put my
hair up in a towel and let it dry and
once it's kind of a little bit dried I'm
putting in a detangler I'll throw out my
hair because my hair is literally unknot
you guys have no idea like oh it's so
bad so I just kind of brush it out as
best as I can and then I'm taking a
mousse mozzie and I put a little bit
into my hand and scrunch my hair a lot
because my hair's pretty wavy but this
just adds a little bit more wave and
gets rid of frizz and then I'm taking my
machi mothers each base cream and I'm
putting mix into my hair as well and
also just the sea salt spray from the
same brand and I'm spraying this all up
in my hair and it's pinching once again
then it's moving on to the makeup I want
my they're dry I'm taking my Maybelline
concealer and I'm just putting this
underneath my eyes to my dark circles
are very bad and just like on any
blemishes that I have I've been breaking
out Whaley's so much and then I'm just
rubbing that in and then I'm also
putting on my eyelids because I have
super veiny eyelids and it's kind of
weird so I just kind of covered those up
when I'm not wearing eye shadow like
today I was not wearing eyeshadow
then I'm keying my eyebrows with just
Milani brow kit and I mix these two
colors to get my perfect shade and then
I kind of square them off and fill them
in yeah I'm kind of eyebrow obsessed so
I do this for a while and I'm taking a
brown eyeliner and just lining my upper
lash line with it
and I always set my eyeliner and just
because and make it say all day and it's
kind of stick with it if it looks
finally uneven and messed up
then I'm taking my favorite mascara and
I'm just putting this on my upper lashes
as well of my bottom lashes
this time of year I am super tasty so I
take my knives with with a bronzer and I
put this like on my cheeks and holes and
stuff I don't know it's pretty shimmery
but I actually like that so yes okay so
then I will change out of my bathroom
into whatever I'm wearing that day which
will most likely be this out there
because I've been wearing this wig every
single day lately it's a warm and comfy
and if I was a good youtuber ever
totally have clips of me eating and
brushing my teeth but I didn't have
enough time to go to work and I'm really
sorry but just just imagine it okay then
I will grab my backpack that is from
PacSun by the way and I will walk out
the door so I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
