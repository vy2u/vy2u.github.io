get your hair frizzy and sexy like mine
mmm seductive
hey guys so I hope you know i was just
kidding um honestly I do not find this
very attractive um yeah um this is going
to be a video on my natural hair I'm not
doing this because I think it's pretty
or that I think that you guys would want
this I'm doing this because I get a lot
of questions on my natural hair and this
might seem kind of like a pointless
video you guys but I do get a lot of
questions and I kind of want to address
them in this video this is my natural
hair as of now december two thousand
eleven all you know my change is done
that in the past and before you guys
come down below my gosh it used to be so
curly um i'm just going to kind of get
that of the way i just want to like kind
of explain why it's not and my little
video is um when i first started making
videos it was over the summer and i was
doing a no heat summer and i would
scrunch my hair every day so that was
not my natural hair you know just let it
dry that's what it was like I could
scrunch it I used products to get it
curlier I mean it was cooler than this
like I could let it dry and I still have
some ringlets but it wasn't like how it
was in my videos so just putting that
out there and also I wasn't using heat
over the summer and when I don't use
heat my hair is curlier and I this has
happened to other people that I know so
I think this is why my hair straighter I
straighten my hair every week I won't
straighten it everyday but you know
every week I straighten my hair once and
if you straighten your hair a lot and
your hair is naturally like wavy or
curly it will straighten it out
obviously not perfectly um ice love some
waves in here but it is a lot straighter
than it was um over the summer so
putting that out there that is why it's
not as curl anymore and then also leads
to why I don't win my hair naturally or
scrunch it anymore um
it doesn't get the count used to be and
I mean I can still scrunch it now and
it'll be wavy it just won't be as coolly
it just won't be as curly as it used to
be i mean i think i'm gonna start
scrunching it more now because I've done
it recently and it doesn't look that bad
so I'm just going to try that but I'm
just kind of had to go through my hair
like whicli for you so you guys kind of
understand where I'm coming from so I've
got these side bang things um they're
not side bangs I went to that like thing
in fifth grade I'm like a while ago with
side bangs were like the thing to have
like nothing to have like it was a while
ago fifth grade um everyone was getting
them and they all look so great out all
of them so I decided to get them even
though I really didn't know what they
were and um no they didn't work out on
me I mean they always do a lot shorter
but um I don't know why I kept getting
them cut and now they're just at this
weird like that I can't really explain
um sexy the outside isn't that bad
except like the frizz on top which you
might not be catching but um trust me
it's a ver um it's not even that wavy on
the top it's not that bad but once you
get underneath is where we get into like
the meat of it um it's basically a bulk
of frizz and that goes away as soon as I
straighten it but of course it will not
dry for his free I think if my hair was
like not frizzy I could actually wear it
out but um you know
it's not very cute so that is my actual
hair I was kind of wanting to put that
out there I mean obviously I'm not a
huge fan of it but I am grateful that I
have my hair because I know a lot of
people would kill to have my hair so
hope you guys like this I hope I kind of
cleared the air clear things up you know
why I don't want my hair natural anyone
i think i'm going to start scrunching it
so if you see my hair scrunch and videos
in the future let me know how you like
it so yeah hi guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
