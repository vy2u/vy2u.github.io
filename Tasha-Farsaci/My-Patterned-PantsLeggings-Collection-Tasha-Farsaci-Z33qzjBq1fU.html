hey so today I'm going to be doing a
collection video but don't get too
excited it's not a makeup collection
sorry I feel so mean depriving you guys
on makeup collection but honestly I
really don't have any much makeup so
that's the only reason for that one yeah
sorry but I am doing a pattern pants
leggings collection so maybe that will
fuel your want to need for collection
videos I've been seeing people lately do
like legging collections and my pattern
blogging collections and stuff but I
really have more patterned pants than
leggings and as I was looking through my
closet lately I noticed that I've kind
of accumulated quite a good amount of
pattern pants slash leggings oh by the
way sorry if I look weird
I literally just came home from track
practice and like pulled my hair down
and put a shirt on like I'm wearing
track legs leggings right now uh-huh
so don't be fooled okay so I'm gonna
start off with leggings I only have one
pair that I actually like the other two
are weird and I got these like years ago
so I don't even know these count the
first pair are these fabulous cheetah
leggings I actually got these like a few
years ago when I was a cheetah for
Halloween so I don't know if these count
exactly but I mean now that I'm looking
at them they're kind of cute so maybe I
could wear these do you think these
would be acceptable like a black sweater
or long shirt or something neither from
forever21
and they're actually pretty soft and
stuff so next pair I have I thought
would cute at the time and then now I
don't know what I was thinking so I
ordered these on eBay for like five
dollars and I definitely got what I paid
for so they're these um they are aisle
leggings I don't know guys
they're like plasticy they are the worst
quality things that are found my wife
and I've never worn these I don't know
why I bought them I thought they were
cute and they're really not I mean if
you like them honestly uh yeah but I got
these on eBay and not really feeling
them last pair of patterned leggings I
have are a recent purchase and I'm
literally obsessed with these you can
still get them I'm pretty
positive they are from Urban Outfitters
and they look like this they're really
really crazy
I waited for these things forever on
backorder and Mayer finally back in
stock so if you're interested get them
but I love elephants and these have like
Paisley and elephants and more elephants
and more Paisley and they're really cool
definitely good size up or two in these
though because I'm pretty small I'm
normally an extra small and those that
were way too tight on me
so I got a small and they're still tight
so you know they won't be like awkwardly
bunchy if you go a size up but I love
these ones okay now moving on to the
pattern pants I'll start with this first
pair because the first pair I ever got
when the trend was like starting to
emerge they are these white floral print
floral print ones and I got these from a
store in Soho in New York you could
basically get them like anywhere on the
strip in Soho but I'm pretty sure it was
called like Amsterdam boutique or
something but I really like these
they're really cute
yeah next pair I'm really sad about
because I've never worn them because
they're too big but I ordered them
online so you know that's what I got and
they're from ASOS or a sauce or whatever
and they look like this they're so cute
but the sizing was weird and I thought
since that's like UK it would be like
here to fit me but it doesn't and yeah
and I don't know what to do I've had my
mom wash them like a bunch of times but
they still really ought to be saggy so
yeah I don't really know but these are
so cute okay next I have this pair from
Oban and I'm not really patterned by it
they're kind of artists so I figured I'd
with bogeys in here once again these
don't even fit me that well like what
the heck I always order these online and
then they never fit me that's why I like
after this pair I have more expensive
ones and I'm gonna show you and they
offer me perfectly of course but these
ones I got on sale so you know whatever
it's kind of okay they're black kind of
high-waisted and then on the side they
have this cool tribal print like I love
these so much they're so cool there's
kind of sagging like the crotchal region
like okay I have four more pairs to show
you these ones are more expensive but I
have found that they fit me so much
better and
yeah that kind of sucks of course that's
the way it goes um this parrot is by
sanctuaries and I got these at Lord and
Taylor I don't know if you don't have a
low in Taylor it's like equivalent to
like an orange um you know yeah they
look like this they're so cool they're
like black and gray and white like
formal kind of sweater I think is going
on and they are so sick I love them and
these ones are so cute I think these
ones are really easy to wear so I enjoy
these next pair I love so much
these are by Hudson and I actually got
these at a Saks off the fifth so I mean
they probably have them in sacks if you
go there or any other place that carries
like Hudson denim anyways so that's what
these look like and they are snake print
as you can probably tell and they are
sick I love these so much these are like
my first expensive ish ones and yeah
there are burn Hudson as you can see
there and I love snake print it's
probably with my favorite print animal
print and then these next two I buy the
brand Joe's Jeans which is my favorite
of all time I have two pairs now and
honestly it they're my favorite jeans
ever they fit me like a glove and I love
them so much so I got this pair recently
and I what we're doing today actually so
this is what they look like they're kind
of like an I don't even know like a
tie-dyed ombre kind of thing I don't
even really know what color it is it's
like a dusty blue and like on greenish
maybe gray I'm not really sure but these
are so cute these ones are from Lord and
Taylor as well um I love wooden Taylor
definitely go in there because the
junior section is so cute it's kind of
expensive but if you shop the sale racks
like I got these on sale you'll
definitely find some good stuff so oh
yeah I want these okay my final pair of
pants I'm like my pride and joy honestly
these are probably my favorite clothing
item I have ever and you guys have
probably seen these and my offer two
week but my aunt got these for me a
shout
- antenna like seriously she picks the
best stuff ever and she got these for me
either what kind of fuel by I want more
Jose to use oh I love them so much here

these are the most flawlessly fitting
pair of pants I've ever had in my life
and they're just beautiful like look at
this like watercolor II flower print
like let's be real like these are
amazing
i-i these are my babies like i love him
so much
and yeah so i'm pretty sure you got
these at macy's my macy's and my mouse
socks like honestly it doesn't have like
any of these brands or anything it's
really bad but i mean yours paui is
awesome because you don't live right
here which is kind of sucky like let's
take a look at the weather right now I

glare right now but you guys want to
