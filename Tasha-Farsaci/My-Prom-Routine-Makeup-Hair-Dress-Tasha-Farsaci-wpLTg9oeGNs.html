guys so today I'm doing a really fun
video so I know from season is
approaching my senior ball is not until
May but my prom in my school for juniors
isn't March so I decided I would put
together a little problem here makeup
and dress video so this is the hair and
makeup I did in this video
obviously the year is just curled nice
and naturally but the makeup I did a
little bit extra so if you guys want to
find out how I did that or the hair this
video will help you out you're also
seeing a little sneak peek up a dress
that I'm wearing in the video I
mentioned this later on but it's from
light in the box and the awesome shoes I
was wearing are also from lighten box so
I'm gonna link them and this dress down
below I hope this video helps you out
and I hope you guys are as excited for
prom
Inbal as I am without further ado I'm
gonna get right into the video okay so
the first thing I'm going to be starting
off with boy this problem look is my
makeup I'm gonna be doing a makeup look
that I think a lot of people will like
and can kind of twist and turn around to
make it their preference first thing I'm
gonna start off with his face makeup so
this is my actual problem day I would be
using more heavy foundation and doing
the whole shebang but so my skin is
actually been pretty good after I got
back to Hawaii the Sun really cleared it
up so I don't want to put on a ton of
face makeup right now and kind of
confuse my skin so I'm just going to
keep it light for today so the first
thing I'm gonna do is just take some
concealer and kind of conceal the areas
that aren't perfect about my skin
okay so after I can see all my scan as
much as I want to I'm just gonna set it
with a pressed powder
okay so the next thing I'm going to do
is fill in my eyebrows because as you
can tell when they're not filled in
they're a lot worse than they are when I
do fill them in so I'm gonna start doing
that now
okay so I went off camera to do my
eyebrows because I'm kind of picky of
how I like them and as you can tell I
like them to be squared off in pretty
filled-in obviously my natural eyebrows
are not squared off so if you guys know
how to get your eyebrows to like go up
in the front let me know I don't know if
I need to go to someone who dreads
eyebrows or what but let me know about
that so now I'm going to move on to the
eyes and probably the most important
step or the most important tips that I
have picked up on or what I'm doing
smokey eyes or more fancy eyes is using
tape so what the tape does is it just
creates a nice hard edge and I'm not
really great at getting a hard edge
without tape so that's why I use
whatever I do you promise or smokey eyes
or anything like that so I'm just gonna
take about this much of tape and what I
do is I line it up under my lower lash
line and straight up in a diagonal like
this the first thing I'm gonna do is
start out with a base just so I shadow
the last longer I'm using a nice
champagne one and I'm putting this all
in ruins after that I'm taking Urban
Decay's sand which is my favorite
eyeshadow in general it's the perfect
champagne color and I'm just gonna put
this all over my lid just for like a
kind of base color
so after that I'm taking the Maybelline
natural smoke spot I'm gonna be taking
the color that starts lid and I'm gonna
put this all over the outer half of my
lip
then I'm gonna go in with T's from my
naked 2 palette and I'm gonna start
working that into my crease and outer
corner
okay so after that I'm gonna be taking
the next darkest color in the natural
smoke squad I am taking the one that
says paste and I'm just going to once
again work that into the keys and my
outer corner
okay so after I do that I'm taking the
darkest color in the palette and then
I'm only working this into the outer
corners of my eyes next thing I'm gonna
do is peel off the tape to reveal the
line I now write the moment you've all
been waiting for so as you can see it
creates a really nice line now I'm the
type of person that kind of likes a
little bit more of a smoky look so I'm
gonna do is blend it out with my
blending brush so once I've blended I'm
going to take a little bit more of the
color labeled lid from the smokes
palette and I'm just gonna kind of drag
it under my lower lash line just to add
a little bit more to the look last step
to the eyeliner look is to apply a
highlight so I'm taking the lightest
color in this little pod and I'm just
gonna put that under my brows as well as
a mannered corner
okay so once I'm done that it's time to
apply eyeliner because I look kind of
scary wait my eyeshadow a hold on and no
eyeliner eyeliner I'm gonna use a black
pencil and it's almost gone sadly but
you can use liquid or any color that you
want I just feel like black from from
just makes your eyes pop a little more
I'm gonna apply this off-camera because
if I try to apply it on camera it will
be a huge mess I promise you okay so
after i line my top lash line with just
a medium sized line of black I'm gonna
take a little bit of best same eyeliner
and brown and I'm gonna put a little bit
on the outer corner of my lower lashes
after that it's time to apply mascara so
I'm using my favorite mascara of the
moment which is L'Oreal voluminous manga
black magic and I'm just gonna put a ton
of this all over my eyelashes so I would
be playing fake eyelashes for this video
but I can't do it to save my life my guy
honestly need to practice guys because
it's pretty pretty bad and I try it's
not I'm gonna do is just add some color
to my face I'm gonna be taking my
favorite bronzer which is Dallas by
benefit I'm not really one to wear
lipstick but I'm just gonna put on this
light pink shades just because it's prom
okay so this is the final makeup look
and I think it's really pretty this is
definitely similar but I'm gonna be
wearing for my senior ball so clearly my
hair is not looking from ready so I'm
gonna be doing that next for you okay as
far as hair goes I will normally get it
done when it's a bigger bat like from a
ball but in case you didn't have the
money to do that where you just wanted
to do it yourself I'm gonna show you how
I curl my hair because I feel like well
your hair is just the thing that you do
for common ball so I kind of show you
how I cut my hair in depth and my
getting ready routine video I'm gonna
put that down below and I'll also put a
little annotation here if you want to go
watch that but basically I use this
culling LAN from nume this is the
biggest barrel that it comes with it
comes with three interchangeable barrels
so I'm using the biggest one today
because I like my curls to be a little
bit more loose and natural-looking
rather than little ringlets so pretty
much what I do is just separate my hair
on two sides and then do happen time so
what are you to comb my hair is simply
take a piece about this big about an
inch section and just wrap it away from
my face around the barrel once I feel up
the hair is hot around the barrel I know
it's ready so I just kind of drop it
into my palm and kind of hold it there
while it cooled down as you can see it
creates really pretty girls I think
these are perfect for prom and balla
because they're natural looking a little
bit extra than just your everyday
natural hair or straight hair or
whatever you do and I just think they're
really pretty and they go with probably
every dress
okay so I just finished on the hair and
as you can see it's just really nice and
it's like it's natural but it still
looks like you're put together and you
try and if you don't want to pay to get
your hair done I think this is a perfect
option because it just looks great and
it'll go with any dress so now the only
thing missing is the dress but just I'm
gonna be wearing as well as the shoes
are from Leighton box calm you might put
all the info up light in the Box in the
downbar I'll try and link the dress and
do all that stuff for you basically this
isn't the dress I'm going to be wearing
to my actual ball but I love this dress
because it's very different so I know
some of you guys I'm gonna like it but I
think it's a very cool personally and
without further ado I'm gonna show you
the dress
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
