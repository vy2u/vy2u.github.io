showing you how I get my hair like this
or basically my summer girl care routine
because this is what I do my hair pretty
much every day in the summer or at least
when I'm watching my hair it's just
basically a natural hair scrunched up a
little bit with a bunch of products but
I was getting lots of requests on my
hair care routine and it changes all the
time just because obviously during the
school year I'm using more heat so I do
different things and I do in a summer
when I'm not really thinking out my hair
I figured that some of you guys would
want to know the products I'm using and
even though it might not turn out
exactly the same on you as it turns out
on me you can still use the products for
yourself and try them out because
they're all drugstore and they're pretty
inexpensive so before I do all these
things I shower and I figured I'd show
you the shampoo conditioner I'm using at
the moment it really doesn't matter to
me what shampoo and conditioner I use I
kind of switched off and on a lot but I
figured I would still show you because I
guess I like the ones I'm using right
now my current shampoo is the organics
coconut milk shampoo and these ones I'm
pretty sure my mom got at BJ's because
they're bigger but you can get these
anywhere really Target Walmart you know
drugstore Walgreens etc and it smells
just like coconuts and it's supposed to
be a really nourishing invar conditioner
I'm using the organics Moroccan argan
oil conditioner and I don't know why my
mom got to turpentine just what she did
so I just kind of use them together and
this one is just supposed to be Billy
strengthening and it stopped because
that's what Oregon oil in Moroccan oil
does and this one smells like
so these are what I use in the shower
you know if you have any recommendations
for shampoo and conditioner let me know
but I just tend to stick to drugstore
because honestly I okay so now I'm going
to get into the rest of the video okay
so I just got out of the shower
and taking my hair down for a muddy
towel and I'm gonna stop by brushing it
out my hair is really tangley so I like
to use these suave kids detangling spray
I like to use the kids because it smells
good and it works really well so what I
do is it just kind of spray this all
throughout my hair because my hair gets
super naughty
especially when I'm wearing it natural
like this cake it's really really
thankfully so next I like to take my
little comb like this and I brush on my
hair so you want to start from the
bottom of your hair and you want to work
your way up
okay once my hair is mostly brushed out
what I'm gonna do is part it so when I
prep my hair I'm only put in a sidecar
on this side so I'm just going to do
that now
and then I'm just going to split my hair
like so and I'm going to continue
getting the tangles out okay so it
doesn't have to be perfect because I'm
gonna be scrunching my hair but you know
you want it to be mostly brushed out
once I've done that I'm going to use a
little bit of my Aussie hair insurance
and this stuff is really nice it kind of
just prepares your hair and keeps it
healthy so I'm just gonna spray that
just mostly throughout the bottom of my
hair
I don't put a product in the top of my
hair just because that can come
sometimes cause it to look greasy so I
just spray this once again about the
bottom section of my hair after I do
that I'm going to take my Aussie scrunch
scrunching mousse and this is a flexible
hold so this really doesn't scrunch your
hair too much but I find that it gives
me a nice wave and it makes my hair
really really soft this hip is awesome
for making your hair soft because it
doubles as a leave-in conditioner so I
like to clip my hair all to one side and
then just put your mousse in my hand and
start scrunching it through my hair
the final step I don't do all the time
what I'm going to today's is the Herbal
Essences totally twisted curls solving
gel and I like to put a little bit of
this into my hair as well because this
just kind of keeps the waves and helps
me to scrunch a little bit more so
taking about this much I'm just going to
scrunch it into my hair this is
basically all I do I just continue to
kind of scrunch you once in a while
until it's dry and now I'm just gonna go
put some makeup on and then I will be
back once this is dry to show you the
final result okay so now I'm gonna my
makeup and stuff and I put my hair dry
pretty much all the way it's still a
little bit damp but you know whatever
I don't scrunch it constantly just every
few minutes when I remember and I do it
until it's dry I don't use a hair dryer
or diffuser or anything I find that this
works fine and it's best to use as
little eat as possible you guys can also
follow me on Instagram and Twitter at
fiercely Tasha just like my username be
sure to leave any comments or video
requests down in the comments and I love
you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
