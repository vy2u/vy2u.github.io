because I messed up the first time and
it's really hot here so if I start
dripping that's why so today I am doing
the very requested updated swimsuit
collection video for 2016
I've done one of these videos for the
past two years so I have one from last
year in the year previous to that so I'm
not including every single swimsuit that
I own in this video because there are
sanda and I included in those videos
that I don't wear a ton anymore so if
you want to see my entire collection
that I've had for the three years I'm
going to link the other videos down
below so I want to address a few things
before I get into the video the first
thing is if you are not subscribed to my
channel please subscribe it would
seriously mean the world to me and it
just takes one little pic on that little
red button down there the second thing I
want to address is why I have so many
bathing suits because I have a lot and
that's because on my Instagram account I
tend to post a lot of beachy like
bohemian type pictures just because
that's like my style
I like that I love going to the beach so
a lot of swimwear companies have reached
out to me or I've reached out to them
and I've been able to collab with them
so I haven't you know bought all these
myself a lot of them more for Instagram
collabs so shameless promo if you want
to follow me if you like those types of
pictures its fiercely kasha I'll put it
right here but yeah I have not bought
all of these that being said I have
bought a lot of them the next thing that
I want to address I talked about in my
last year's video and it's basically
like this is Tryon video and you may
think oh it's just flying out you're
obviously so comfortable with your body
and I'm not I actually have scoliosis
which if you don't know what that is it
basically means that my spine instead of
being a straight spine is like curved in
some sort of way so because of that my
hips are asymmetrical they're uneven and
I am so lucky that you know my scoliosis
hasn't caused me pain and I haven't had
to wear a brace and I know it could be
so much worse so I'm not trying to
complain but I am self-conscious about
it you know so if you do notice that
that you know that's why it looks like
that okay I'm going to sit over here for
the video because I'm going to try and
do like a split screen for the Tryon so
the first brand I want to talk to you
about is triangle swimmer you guys have
probably heard about them they're very
popular they are the neoprene bikinis so
the first one I have is this newer style
it's bright blue I love this color kind
of just like a triangle style top and
then the bottom is that it comes with
are these floral ones I got the cheeky
ones because as you will see I prefer
cheeky bottoms and I really like the
cheeky bottoms I'm not a huge fan of
triangles full coverage bottoms but I
really like these ones my next feeding
suit from a triangle is this one it's
definitely one of their like older
styles but I certainly like it this
really pretty coral and bright blue
color and then the bottoms are the ones
I was talking about before they are more
full coverage and I know a lot of people
don't like these because they kinda look
like a diaper but I don't know they kind
of hold everything in and it's nice if
you don't want you know a really
scandalous bottom so I like these for
size offerings for triangle bikinis I am
an extra small top and an extra smooth
bottom okay so I was a brand
representative for Midori bikinis which
if you haven't heard about them you are
going to love them they're probably one
of my favorite brands so basically I
worked with them for about six months
and I would post for them about once a
week so I have a good amount of debating
suits and I really love them there's all
my favorites so the first one I have is
the Cosabella top I think that's how
it's pronounced and it's in this dragon
fruit print so it's basically just kind
of a triangle top and then the back
looks like this Midori bikinis are
Brazilian style so the bottoms are all
pretty cheeky this is the fullest
coverage bottoms that they offer
it's the seamless braids in style and I
really like these
my next bathing suit from Midori is so
cute it's the peony print and then I
love this style top it has like three
little thingies in the front
and then the back has three little
straps as well and then I just have the
same braid and seamless bottoms for this
bikini as well I have that same style
top in black this is one of my favorite
tops you know it's just so versatile and
once again it has like a three strappy
backs and then I have those same bottoms
that I've been showing you in just plain
black I believe this style of top is
called look for way to top it looks like
this in the front and then it has those
three strings in the back as well and
then I have the same seamless braid in
the bottoms in mint green I have that
Pro aja top in this olive green color
and then the bottoms that I like to wear
with it are these ones are really really
cheeky these ones are things like the
whale tail bottom I could be wrong but
they're a lot cheekier and they're this
really pretty tropical print I think
it's called Lahaina so I wear those a
lot and then also in that same print I
have another one of the Casabella
Cosabella pops that looks like this with
a little like tee back and then I have a
pair of the braided style bottoms in
that same print and for size reference
for Midori bikinis I am an extra small
top and an extra small bottom okay so
the next brand I want to talk about is
Frankie's bikinis I hope obsessed with
Frankie's bikinis they're super popular
in Southern California because that's
where they originated the only thing is
they're really expensive I follow these
myself I have not worked with them but
they're so cute guys honestly you're
going to look at them and want them so
first one is my favorite maybe one of my
favorite paintings is that I own it's
this really pretty high neck um kind of
tribal pattern pop but the best part is
they back it's really strappy which I
love
and then the bottoms are really cheeky
just string bottoms with the same print
my necks bikini from Frankie's my friend
mal actually got from me it's this
really pretty peony pink print and this
one's a triangle style bikini with some
like roughly kind of stuff going on on
the cups pads and then the bottoms for
that one are adorable they look like
this and they have like braided little
side straps that kind of cross over each
other and these are cheeky but not too
cheeky my last item from Frankie's is
only a top I don't have a bottom for
this but I read this a lot with the
tribal pattern bottom and it's this hot
pink color and the straps are braided as
well as like along here on the front is
braided and then it has that same really
strappy back detailing moving on to
Italy one of my favorite brands I feel
like I'm going to say that about every
single brand but it's else face swimwear
so the first bikini is one of my
favorites going to be really hard to
show you off but you'll see it on I
posted so many pictures in this one so
it's a high neck top with this super
cool pattern and then the back is
strappy and it like crosses and then
there's just matching bottoms to that
one once again not super cheeky but a
little bit cheeky next I have this top
it's a really pretty kind of dusty
purple pink top and then it's reversible
as you can see the underside is pink
like this and then the back is cool and
strappy the bottoms look like this
they're also reversible but I tend to
just stick with the purple side my last
two items from Elle space are only
topped because I already had bottoms
that I knew would match them so the
first one is gonna be really hard to
show off but it's one of those wrap tops
if you know what I'm talking about you
kind of put it on and wrap it in front
of you and this one's really cool
because it has a tribal pattern on one
side but then the other side is just
black and it's reversible so that's
really cool I love this top okay and my
last top from Elle space is awesome it's
this dusty purple color and then it just
has this cage detailing in the front
love this one it's just kind of leaves
some weird tan lines I have two bikinis
from arc swimwear these
are pretty tiny but I think these are
the softest bikinis I own honestly and
if a sing style so I'm only going to be
trying on one because they look the same
so the top looks like this it's like a
blue and purple tie but I think it's
probably reversible I'd only know for
sure because I always write on this side
but it's so hue this one's actually
pretty fluttering and then the bottoms
are tiny these are the tiniest bottoms I
have by far they look like this and
these are definitely reversible for just
like a dark purple but these are so
comfortable and they're great for
tanning and then I have that very same
bikini in this neon orange color which
is normally not something that I would
go for but it looks so good with the tan
so looks like that and then the bottoms
once again look like this
these next two bikinis I actually just
got in the mail today they're from a
website called the call of summer and
what's really cool about them is that
they cater to girls with small boobs so
there's only one size top and it's for
an A or B cup so homegirls with no boobs
like me this is great and you can get
the bottoms in any size so they're super
sweet there and the first hop that I got
is just black really cute and classic
and then the back is really cool like
laces up your back and on the bottoms
that I got to match with that one are
these green leafy bottoms really cool
and then the butt is all ruched so
that's really flattering and then the
next one I got from the call of summer
is this really fun colorful top it's
basically a triangle top with these
little hole details and then the bottoms
that came with our full coverage which
although I do prefer cheeky bottoms it's
good to have some there full coverage
you know if there's people I'm going to
be around or just days when I don't want
my butt cheeks out so these are really
good to have I have one bikini from Kong
boone swimwear so it looks like this
it's basically white and then it has
some blue and purple flowers with the
front that's laced up that's super
flattering by the way and the back is
cool it looks like this
and the bottoms are really fun they have
these little strappy line details and
they're really cheeky and flattering on
the booty okay this next bikini I have
is from JK knees which is actually an
Etsy shop and the owner is so sweet she
makes them all by hand and they're all
custom and it's so cool so I got this
bikini and it's probably hard to show
but it's one of those tops that has like
the four little straps with the triangle
top and then the bottoms are so cool
some people might not think they match
but I think they look really good
together they're just like this banana
leaf print like cheeky bottoms and then
they have little straps on the side I
really love these and these are so so
soft I have one bikini from LC swimwear
so it's basically this olive green color
which is one of my favorite colors and
it just has like a ladder up the front
really cool and it's one of those high
neck bikinis that's super popular right
now and the bottoms that it came with I
were seriously all the time they look
like this and there's just like three
little straps and they're the same in
the front in the back so yeah I have to
crochet bikinis from soul bikini.com and
I haven't tried these out in the water
yet so I don't know how they would do in
the water because they're crochet but I
think they probably fine so I have this
really cute black one with some shells
across the front you can't really tell
ah as Michelle's across the front and
then the bottoms are the same black
crochet with the shells and then I have
that exact same bikini in white because
I couldn't resist the super cute crochet
in the shells together so yeah as you
can see it's the same I'm not going to
try this one on because like I said it's
the same so if you want one of these
crochet bikinis I actually have a coupon
code for I believe $10 off I'm going to
put on the screen I'll also put all the
information and the brand's down below
but yeah if you want $10 off that's a
great deal and I totally recommend it
okay so finally I have some
miscellaneous bottoms that I want to
show you so sometimes I buy cute bottoms
that I know I have tops to match and I'm
not going to try these ones on just
because I feel like bottoms are pretty
self-explanatory so I'm just going to go
through these the first one I have is
from PacSun it's one of those like
really cute scrunchie bottoms and it's
pretty cheeky just has this really cute
tribal pattern I'm sure I said really
cute at least 300 times in this video so
I apologize for that but these ones are
very pretty I got these bottoms from
Billabong they have a paisley pattern on
them some scrunching on the butt and
they say Billabong I have these bottoms
from a Victoria's Secret I tend to stay
away from Victoria Sivir bathing suits
just because everyone has them but I
really liked this pattern and they're
pretty full coverage so that's cool
these next bottoms are from the Volcom I
got them just for tanning pretty much as
you can see they're really tiny they
just have one tiny like strap on the
sides they're really soft and really
cheeky and perfect for tanning ok these
last bottoms I have I actually do have a
top - this is from Silver Lining bikinis
and I have a fourth of July top that
goes with them but it's in the wash
right now I'm gonna post a photo here
because I posted I'm wearing it but I
really love these bottoms they're super
cool with the little try straps and yeah
ok so that was my swimsuit collection if
you made it through the entire thing
kudos to you because clearly I have way
too many bikinis I think the scariest
part about all this is that I will
continue to get more because it's just
one of those things that I want all the
time I feel like everyone has that one
item that they cannot stop buying or
getting and for me it's bikinis anyways
