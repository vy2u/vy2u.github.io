my updated swimsuit collection bikini
collection video I actually did a
swimsuit collection last summer and I
wasn't really really into bikinis last
summer like I was kind of just like
normal had a normal amount but somehow
in last year I've grown this odd
obsession with buying bikinis and its
really really bad but then again like
you guys get to see this video so it's
kind of good
in my defense I can't moving to Los
Angeles so I will be using these bikinis
a lot more than I would be here in New
York so I don't really think that's an
excuse but yeah I'm not going to be
showing you all the bikinis because like
I said I did a video last year I'm not
going to include all of the bikinis from
that video only the ones that I still
really like and wear so if you want to
see my total huge bikini collection I'm
gonna link the one from last summer down
below so you can go watch that if you
want I wasn't going to make this a try
on umm I'm not like super secure with my
body and I know you guys are going to be
like oh my god like you're totally like
fishing for compliments like you're so
skinny like it's not that if you guys
can do my channel you probably don't
know that I have scoliosis if you don't
know what scoliosis is basically instead
of having a perfectly straight spine
like most people your spine is curved
I'm so grateful that my scoliosis is not
severe enough that I would need a brace
or surgery or anything so I really like
can't complain it doesn't really hinder
my daily life at all however a side
effect to scoliosis is you do like
uneven shoulders or uneven hips and I
happen to have uneven hips a lot of
people say like they don't even notice
my hips being uneven but you know
obviously me being me were so critical
of ourselves and I notice a lot so I
really didn't know if I wanted her to
try on but I knew if I didn't a lot of
you guys I'd be like oh I wish is for
Tryon I want to see these on so I just
wanted to put that out there like if you
were going to comment oh like what's
wrong with your hips or like what's
what's up with that like I just wanted
to let you guys know in advance also as
far as sizing goes I am
a petite person I'm not saying this to
brag in any way like I'm really small
I've always been like super small as far
as like tops bra size goes I'm like a 34
a could be a 32 a you know like pretty
flat and then pant sizes I'm like a 24
inch or like zero double zero like
somewhere in there so yeah I'm that's
like the size reference so when I'm
telling you the sizes of these bikinis
you will kind of be able to go off of my
sizes okay so the first two bikinis I'm
going to show you are from Midori
bikinis or Midori swimwear and if you
guys haven't heard of them they're like
my favorite bikinis ever I like stocked
their Instagram account for months
before getting these and I'm absolutely
in love with them if you're not familiar
with the dory they are like Brazilian
inspired bikinis
so the bottoms are a little bit
itsy-bitsy I don't have many cheeky
bottoms now um but I feel like it's more
acceptable in Los Angeles so I'm
probably to be wearing these there but
I'm going to show you anyways so the
first top looks like this it's like mint
green super super cute and then there's
like three little stripes in the back
and the lining to these bikinis are
pineapples like how cute is that
and these bikinis are such good quality
they're so soft so I got this top and
then these are the really tiny bottoms
the other ones aren't so bad but these
ones look like this they're like a
really cool tropical print and like as
you can see they're really really cheeky
but these will be good to tan your butt
because I want you but I have a super
white butt so um yeah might be not why
knees and found my parents in front of
like family members but um I still love
this bikini and then my second Midori
bikini is this beautiful printed one I
think it's called it the peony print and
this one has like some little like
cutouts in the front and then like the
other one it has like three little
stripes in the back and then it ties
once again extremely amazing quality the
bottom said these ones are like less
cheeky but they're super thick um really
thick and the backs look like this
there's like ruching and down like the
butt crack and maybe a ball
really good so yeah this is my second
one I've all the size chart on Midori's
website and I got extra small tops and
bottoms so the bottoms are a little bit
tight on me but I don't think I would
have wanted to get a small just because
I'd rather have tight bottoms than loose
bottoms you know but the TAS fit me
perfectly next bikini I want to show you
is probably like one of my favorites and
actually just came in the mail today
it's from Tilly's calm and I got this on
super clearance I got the whole thing
for $20 which was great so this one is
really cute it's a halter style top
looks like this I'm in love it has like
coral and like two different patterns
like I cut out in the front you can see
me and then the back is really cool
you'll see a better in the Tryon but
it's basically like crosses in the back
kind of thingy and on the bottoms look
like this they're like you normal
bottoms I love the color I'm honestly
obsessed with this bathing suit and the
fact that I got it for twenty dollars
makes it so much better and the top and
the bottom of both extra soles I have
one bikini from triangle and I showed
this in another haul video so if you saw
that you know what it is but basically
it's the poppy style and I think it's
like bubblegum or calm candy or
something but it's just the one with
like neon coral and then like bright
blue and I love this bikini so so much
the top looks like this the bottoms I
look like this and I am an extra-small
the top and the bottom so I love this
one it's so great okay the next bikini
I've gotten so so so many comments about
Instagram because I posted a picture it
everyone is asking me and okay this is
kind of my secret find that's why I
didn't answer where it's from but it
looks like this oh my gosh this bikini
is life so it's like a bandeau style and
it has like a tropical print with like
some birds and then like all these lines
in the front the back of the top is like
just as amazing as the front it's all of
these like strappy lines and then the
bottoms are like the perfect amount of
cheeky I think well they look like they
look like this as you can see the sides
are strappy once again they're cheeky
but not like song
they got this invented which is like
where people sell their clothes um it
was brand new and it was like this
random account that I found that was
just selling like brand new bathing
suits and I found that one don't only
know the name of the pout but I am in
love with that bathing suit I mean the
next bikini stole the tags on it I have
never worn it um I have to get around to
wearing it but it's from to-die-for
bikinis pretty much it's like the
classic style their bikinis are like
lacy
they kind of like underway which i think
is why I haven't really worn this yet um
I'll wear it I promise but basically I
got like the floral printed one and it
just has lace on the top it's your
regular triangle style bathing suit and
the bottoms look like this as you can
see there's lace on the top which kind
of makes look like underwear but like
it's bikini um
not stupid cheeky but like a little bit
this is actually really comfortable I
really need to wear it because it's
really cute and comfy I'm pretty sure
with this one I'm an extra-small top and
bottom as well okay this bikini is from
Victoria's Secret I got this when all
the swimwear was like 30% off or
something I don't normally get paintings
from there because they're pretty pricey
and like a lot of people tend to have
them but this one was like I said 30%
off and I really liked it so it's this
really pretty print it's like purple and
blue and this is the like halter push-up
style um definitely pushed me up too
much because I don't only have boobs but
it's like that really like padded style
um looks like this on the top and then I
just got the matching bottoms that are
like the ruched side bottoms they're
really popular and actually for this
size the top is a 34 a and the bottom is
a small 9 extra small extra small was a
little bit too small on my butt this
bathing suit I got off vintage and I
really don't like it too much on me and
I'm kind of annoyed because the girl
said there was like it looked brand-new
unvented and I got it and like the butt
is kind of worn you know bathing suits
get with like the but kind of like bells
a little bit so I was kind of annoyed
with that but it's a really cute bathing
suit my friend Melanie has it just
better on her because she has boobs to
fill it out so it looks a little funky
on me um I don't know basically it's
this burgundy bathing suit it has like
these really cool cutouts on it and then
it has like a turquoise bead in the
middle it's a really cool bathing suit
when I'm showing it to you backwards
awkward so there you go you can kind of
see there and then the bottoms are just
plain burgundy like side tie bottoms
like I said um there like one looking I
haven't won this one I don't know might
like resell it I do really like the top
but I don't know I'm putting to the top
in the bottom or both a small okay I did
show the rest of the bathing suits that
I'm going to show in my last video but
there's still some of my favorites so I
wanted to include them in this one if
you're new my channel so this first
bathing suit is from PacSun I got it
last year I love this one as you can see
this cutouts in the middle it has like a
medallion print these come with straps
but when I get Bandos I always take the
straps off because I don't like tan
lines I just prefer them to be like
straight across this one is so cute it
ties in the back what size this is a
small on top and then I just have the
matching bottoms they're like the
Victoria's Secret kind of like move side
ones and these are small as well so
they're just matching bottoms I love
this bathing suit I might get
compliments on it and I'm pretty sure I
remember getting this one on sale too I
really usually will only buy meetings
it's on sale okay this next one is by
Roxy so it looks like this it's kind of
like a cup style bando once again has
straps I took them off really cute like
tropical print I believe the top isn't a
small the bottoms look like this um just
matching normal these I got a medium I'm
pretty sure all they have as a medium
but I tried them on and they were like
tight and kind of cheeky so like I'm
glad they didn't have like only a small
because these are medium I don't really
see the tag on here but I remember them
being a medium okay the last one I'm
gonna show you is like top and bottom
from two different places but I wear
them together so the top is from
Victoria's Secret
this it's an extra small so it just got
white one of those little tops that had
like the ruffle over it the bottoms I
like to wear with it I remember I got
super super sale at PAX on there like
the cheekiest bottoms that I had last
year but now I have those like the ones
they're really cute they have like this
kind of timely print with like black and
neon pink and then purple they're like
really like scrunched looking which I
like and they have that same like
ruching up the butt really cute with the
tie side I love these with the white top
and yeah these pads on bottoms are a
small by the way that is my updated
