swimsuit collection and this was a
pretty requested video so I decided I
would do it I don't have a ton of
swimsuits but I have a good amount I'm
not like one of those people that has
like 20 minutes long web video with his
from the series but you know I have a
pretty decent amount and I bought some
new ones this summer so I figured I
would do the video for you I'm fully
outside because I got a comment on my
last video just a constructive comment
telling me that I need to put more
effort into my videos and maybe film
outside um are you trying my videos I
don't know like how to edit in cooler
ways and that's why I don't people must
have different software than me um I
don't know if you know what I'm talking
about like who edits like really cool
I don't know when people have like stuff
like pop up and no video is like I don't
know how to do that so if any of you
guys know like the software for that
because I really do want to try harder
in my videos and I do try it's just hard
when you don't have you know the
software you don't know how to do it so
just let me know about that and I know
my camera might not be like amazing
quality but it's kind of scary for me to
like drop a thousand dollars on a camera
that I don't know how to use when mine
is HD already so I'm trying guys and if
you have any like other ideas and
hounding my videos better and how to
like improve my editing let me know
because I really do want to make my
videos better for you okay so going into
the swimsuits I'm gonna start off with
the swimsuits that I like the most and
then I have like actual matching this
with because some of them are just
random so the first one is dirty because
I went swimming in a disgusting green
like seaweed II like the other day and
it hasn't been washed yet but it's this
one and it's from Roxy all my bathing
suits are bikinis by the way I'm not a
one-piece tankini person and they're
mostly Bandos so this one in the bando
and it's one of the cup style bikinis
which kind of scared me because if you
guys haven't noticed I literally don't
have any blue
no boobage like it nothing at all so
this is kind of like kind of scary for
me because like I can't even really feel
this and I don't know I'm really
self-conscious about my chest because
it's really small and like if there's
one thing I'm self-conscious about
that's it um so yes it has like a nice
Hawaiian print on it um I tend to stick
to Bandos because I feel like no one
really has boobs in Bandos but once you
get to like the triangle like you you
sense my flatness bottoms look like this
and I don't know if I already said this
is from Roxanne you but it's a little
bit cheeky these are mediums and they
fit me you like tight so yes all the
tops are smalls or excess walls because
once again you know bottoms I will
either get a small or medium depending
because I don't like what my bathing
suits are really tight on the bottom
okay my next on the suit is pop my
favorite and I just got this recently so
they should still have it
it's from PacSun and it looks like this
it's just a bando once again but I
really like it because it has like three
ties in the middle so it looks really
cool when you wear it and this one has
extra EPS on it that I take off
sometimes but this one is really pretty
I love the colors and the pattern of it
and then the bottoms just look like this
they're a lot like the ones from
Victoria's Secret that have like the
mousse sides and they're really
comfortable next one is from Victoria's
Secret and it's just so plain like tie
band Oh thing where it has like a little
tie in the middle and it's a royal blue
color because if you guys have watched
my videos for a while you know I went
through an obsession with royal blue
like I was literally obsessed so yeah I
still really like the color I think it's
really pretty for a summer and then for
the bottom is I just have matching
Victoria's Secret royal blue like double
strap type things
bottoms next is from American Eagle
think I actually got it from like TJ
Maxx though some yes the top is really
pretty it's a bright cool color it's not
really showing up as bright as it is it
has like a triangle in the middle which
is really cool and then
so little ties here that I take off a
lot but this one is really pretty I also
love the bottom - these they're white
but they have some floral on the front
and then the ties or the coral color
with like sand beads and these are
really cute and this whole bathing suit
in general makes you look super tan next
bathing suit is one that I recently went
got sent to me it's gonna be in another
video as well but it's from lovely
wholesale and it's kind of like a
Victoria's Secret copy grab a ting suit
because the pictures on the website were
Victoria's Secret bathing suits which is
kind of funky but anyways it looks like
this it's way too big for me um this is
supposed to be as small and I definitely
do not feel this even though there's
push up in it so I'm probably gonna give
it to one of my um boss to your friends
but it has like this kind of paisley
pattern on it it's definitely very
similar to one of the Victoria's Secret
ones from the bottom so this are tiny I
definitely wish I could have gotten like
a medium in the bottle because they're
literally so small like they're really
cute but these are tiny okay this one is
also from Victoria's Secret I'm not a
huge fan of it anymore because it's
cheetah print
I'm not a big cheetah print person
anymore especially because this one's
like hot pink cheetah print but um I
don't even know if this is the right way
nope the pettings all messed up in this
one so probably looks kind of weird but
it's good for tanning that's when I
normally will wear it now but it's just
black and hot pink cheetah print and the
bottoms are just matching side time.she
different
okay next bathing suit I have is super
popular I guarantee like half of you
will have this bathing suit it is
retarget and it's just a floral kind of
push up doesn't do anything for me in
the push-up area obviously but it's a
really pretty floral pattern it twists
in the middle and then it has some ties
and honestly like I don't wear this one
that much because if I go somewhere
someone else will be wearing it and it's
always a little awkward
bottoms look like this and sometimes I
wear these with the royal blue top or
vice versa because those match really
well okay I think the last bathing suit
that I have matching pieces too is this
one
from Old Navy I really don't wear this
one anymore because it's triangle but it
looks like this it's black with some
like neon --is-- flowers I suppose and
the bottoms are just matching their side
tie and yeah okay moving on to the non
matching pieces that I kind of just pair
together I have this plain black bandeau
top from H&amp;amp;M which I love I wear this
all the time because it's so plain and
it goes with everything
it also has straps you know just in case
you want it but it kind of twists in the
middle and I can wear that one with a
lot of my bottoms but I will normally
wear it with these ones from forever 21
and they just have a really cute
sunflower pattern on them with a little
ruffle and these are a little bit cheeky
not really it's a cheeky on the label
but they're pretty normal I think and
they're just really cute okay next one I
haven't going to show you the bottoms
first because I really like the bottoms
I just got them from PacSun like they're
brand new I haven't worn them yet
because I don't have a top to wear with
them I really want to get a white top
but I can't find one really so I don't
know what I'm gonna wear with these but
they're really pretty they're like
roughly and they have like a ruched down
the butt crack makes your butt look
great I promise home but they're really
pretty they have like a neon tribal
pattern if I was gonna wear on top of
these I would wear this one except is a
triangle top so I probably will not wear
it
um but it's neon pink and I think this
is from Walmart I got it for like three
dollars once yeah I feel like if I
really wanna wear these I can wear the
triangle top but triangle tops tricked
me out
okay next top I have is also from Roxy
but it's a triangle top why did I do
this uh-huh it's totally cute it's black
and floral and I have some like funky
triangle straps here um I do actually
wear this one sometimes when I'm like
feeling risky I guess but it's really
cute and I normally wear with black
bottoms from Target but I thought they
were in here but it's just the black
sportswear also got a fine nose but
they're just plain black bottoms from
Target and may have a little braids on
the side so that's what I will wear with
this almost done I have this top I think
it's an arrow pastel of Aeropostale
whatever you want to call it
and it's a triangle top I haven't won
this one in a long time it is basically
so blue color and it has some like
tribal stitching in the front so it's
cute as you can see the pads are all
messed up
and if I was going to wear that I'd wear
these clean kind of turquoise bottoms
with it but these make my butt look
really saggy so not a huge fan okay and
my last bathing suit is just a top and
it's some Hollister and it's really tiny
like this is even too tiny for me
because like it it's nothing like it's
not even there um I will only wear this
when I'm tanning and if I do wear it if
I wanted to wear it out I would wear
with this these bottoms but um this
thing in the middle got messed up as
well this is like a really old one so
