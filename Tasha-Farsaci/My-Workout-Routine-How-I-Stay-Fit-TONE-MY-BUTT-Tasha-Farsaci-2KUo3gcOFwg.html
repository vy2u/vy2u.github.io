filming a video that you guys have
requested for so so long I'm finally
sitting down to do it for you guys as
you can tell by the title this is going
to be my fitness routine my workout
routine how I stay fit when I do at the
gym anything along those lines
before I get into the video and tell you
guys about how I workout if you guys are
not following me on social media you
totally should it's a super personal
outlet for me and if you want to see me
more than just on YouTube it's a great
place so my Instagram is fierce etosha
and then I will put my Twitter and my
snapchat here as well you guys can
follow me that would seriously mean so
much okay so one more thing before I get
into the video I am NOT fully happy with
where my body is at this is not like
okay I'm in my perfect spot right now
this is how I want to look like wherever
obviously I'm not I'm not like
completely satisfied with where I'm at
so I am trying to always add new things
to my fitness routine or try new things
or workout more but you know I have been
liking what I've been doing so I figured
I would share with you guys what I have
been doing because it was requested but
by no means am I at like my goal body or
whatever okay so the first thing that I
do want to talk about is a new app that
I've kind of found that I've been using
a little bit at the gym this is very new
but I have been liking it a lot and I
think it's a great option for people
that like doing workout classes but
don't necessarily like being with a
bunch of people and having people like
watch you okay so the app is called
active and basically it's an app where
you can go on and get a bunch of fitness
workouts right on your phone they will
play them for you so you don't have to
be in a class with a bunch of people and
get like embarrassed like from me I
never want to do classes because I'm
like okay well what if I I can't do this
well enough or if I go to Tyre didn't
want to leave everyone's gonna be
watching me and I just never do classes
for that reason but this app like
totally fixes that problem because
you're doing a class right on your phone
you have the instructors voice you have
a bunch of different options so it's
basically like being in the class except
you're on your phone and I mean I guess
you're still two gyms people could see
you but you're not like competing
against every
you know what I mean okay so before I
show you an example of the classes and
options on active I do wanna let you
know the active is not a free app okay
there are a few options it's either
$9.99 a month where you can get a free
7-day trial you can pay $24.99 for three
months or you can pay $49.99 for the
entire year I am going to put a coupon
code and a link to download the app down
below but if you guys think about it
this is a way cheaper than a class if
you think about like some classes it can
be like $30 a class so you're really
paying that for three months with like
unlimited stuff so if you think about it
and you think you are going to use their
lives definitely worth it
okay so this is what the app looks like
as you can see there's a bunch of
different options so I'm just going to
show you a few of them something that's
super popular right now is cycling so
you can do this and there's tons of
different classes you can take with the
different times and then this color on
the side kind of shows you the
difficulty of the classes so those are
super cool something else I really like
about the classes as they play music for
you so the music kind of go to the
workouts they have yoga they have
running they have treadmill so literally
anything you're doing at the gym or
outside like outdoor running there's
something for it something that I've
really been liking is the strength
training and I really like the ab
workouts I've never really been
comfortable with how my stomach looks on
my ABS look so this is a great one for
me obviously for the sake of the video I
stopped it but as you can see once you
stop it you can rate the instructor it
tells you how long you did it for and
how many calories you burn something
else I really like about the app is that
you have the ability to do some of the
things at home so like the strength
training section the abrogate I was
showing you a lot of the times I can
just do it at home like I am here in my
living room I thought I'd show you guys
my Christmas tree a little bit but this
is me just doing a few of the exercises
from that workout and yeah it's really
convenient to be able to do them in your
own home so like I said I am going to
have a link down below in order to
download the app and I will have a
coupon code down there for you okay so
now I'm going to get into what I
normally do at the gym before I found
the app and now if I don't know what to
do if I don't feel like doing a class
like that
this is what I will do a lot of you guys
ask me how often I workout it honestly
it depends on how much time I have
obviously being a student and sometimes
hard to find time to work out but I try
to work out at least three times a week
at least you know sometimes I work out
like three days in a row and then I'll
work out like a few days later so it
could be anywhere from like three to
five days a week I definitely don't work
out every single day I'm someone that
doesn't like having to get all sweaty
and wash my hair and like read my air I
know that sounds so I maintenance but
yeah obviously it's never like a set
kind of schedule I kind of work out at
different times jeno probably isn't the
best thing ever I should really have
more scheduled but honestly I just work
out when I have time and when it fits in
my schedule because I'm busy in school
and that's how it works for me
I'm not someone that likes running I ran
track in high school I run check until
like 10th grade I don't know how I did
it because personally I am NOT a runner
I don't enjoy running but cardio it is
necessary by far my favorite cardio
machine at the gym is the Stairmaster
the stepper climber or whatever you want
to call it basically the machine that
has the stairs on it that move I like
this because I don't have to move super
fast you don't need like I'm not running
I'm not going fast on the elliptical I'm
just walking but it still is such a
workout oh my gosh not only does it tone
my legs and my butt a lot of you guys
asked me about how I toned my butt or
whatever literally the Stairmaster and
I've been kidding so what I normally do
I don't know every machine is different
but I'm normally doing around 85 steps
per minute I don't know what level that
is but that's basically what I do it's
not super fast but it's definitely fast
enough that I go for around a half hour
and I'm really sweaty and tired by the
end yeah so normally I go for around
thirty minutes it depends sometimes I
get super tired and I go for twenty
minutes sometimes I'm feeling great and
I go for forty minutes so it really
depends something I like doing one I'm
on the Stairmaster is watching YouTube
videos because it kind of distracts me I
mean if I listen to music sometimes I'm
like always looking at the time and
whatever how long I've been doing
it but I like to watch YouTube videos
because I kind of get like engaged in
the video and those are normally a lot
longer than songs so before I know it
the 30 minutes is up that's normally the
only cardio I really do sometimes I will
go on the treadmill afterward and put
the incline all the way up and walk on
level 4 I don't know if that's 4 miles
per hour or if it's just level 4
honestly I feel really stupid right now
but I'll put it on like level 3 point 8
or 4 whatever it is and I'll just walk
it at the incline for around 10 minutes
it's kind of a cool down for me if I'm
really sweaty this kind of helps me like
dry off but it's still toning my legs
and my butt and whatnot
okay how I should have gone over this
before I talked about the cardio and
stuff but pretty much before cardio you
can do it after but I like doing it
before so I'm stretching and stuff
before I will do stretches and add
workouts and some like butt workouts so
the first thing I like to do is just
stretch I'm not very flexible I'm a lot
more flexible on my right side than my
left as you can see I'm really trying to
work out in but I'll just stretch out
and make sure I'm you know fairly
stretched before I start I honestly
don't do a ton of ab workouts which I
definitely should because like I said
that's probably my weakest area but I
will take a medicine ball I've been
working on getting more weight recently
I used to do 10 pounds now moving up to
12 and I will just do a little thing I
don't know all the terminology for it
but I will extend on my butt and then
move the medicine ball like side to side
and my legs up hopefully I have a clip
right here showing you how I do it
I honestly don't have a certain number
of reps when I do that for I honestly do
that a bunch of times like I'll just
first step throughout the other workouts
I'm doing and I'll just kind of do it
until my abs feel like they're tired
something else I usually do is a plank
on my way to do a plank for around a
minute sometimes I like move my legs
around while I do applying I don't
really know if this is like extra or
look good but I sometimes do that I also
like to do this by exercise where I go
on all fours and then raise my leg and I
agree angle to the side of me this one
really hurts and I normally do like
three on each leg then I will do a squat
honestly I think this is super important
in toning your butt but make sure you do
squats with weight so once again I
usually use the 12 pound medicine ball
and I squat with weight I do like
20 of these honestly like I said it
depends on how I'm feeling yeah so
honestly that's what I do I am NOT a
fitness expert I don't know much about
famous I've kind of just done that and I
have seen progress and how I look and
this was super requested by you guys so
hopefully this helps you guys out I
don't know if it will like I said I do
have a very fast metabolism so I'm prone
to be skinny naturally but I do feel
like these things have toned me up a lot
I don't look just as like Stickley
skinny you know I feel like I look a
little bit taller okay in terms of my
diet people will ask me about my diet
and be perfectly honest with you like I
said I do for fast metabolism I don't
eat super healthy I mean I will eat Taco
Bell and like get out and chick-fil-a
and stuff like that but not all the time
and I honestly I'm a pretty small person
I'm like five foot one just a petite
person so I can't eat a lot anyway so
honestly if I eat like chick-fil-a I am
done for the day I don't eat a ton but I
do try to you know eat a lot of fruits
and vegetables and cook my own
vegetables and stuff at home when I can
one of my best tips about eating and
like dieting or whatever is buy your own
groceries and do not buy anything that's
unhealthy because if you don't have
anything unhealthy in your house you're
probably not gonna eat unhealthily so
try to buy healthy snacks and healthy
foods that you can make yourself because
you don't have you know the chips and
the ice cream and stuff and you're not
going to eat them so that's how me a
good tip I try to buy healthy things
when I go to the grocery store because
then I'm eating healthy yeah so from now
I'm honestly pretty lucky with the whole
eating thing I can kind of eat what I
want because I don't need a ton and
workout and I'm like fine I'm sure some
day it'll catch up to me and I'll be
like 500 pounds when I wake up one day
but uh for now it's working out anyways
I hope this video was kind of helpful
for you guys I really don't know how
helpful it was but if you liked it

suggestions for workout so if you guys
want to add anything to this video
