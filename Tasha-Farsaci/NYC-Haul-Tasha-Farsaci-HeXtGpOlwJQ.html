area today just because I wanted better
lighting and yeah so yesterday I did
that like text on my video and I was it
was um just asking you what kind of
videos you wanted and I told you one for
New York City yesterday and if you guys
wanted to haul and you guys all said
yeah and I just want to tell you that
New York City is probably my favorite
place in the whole entire world
you know I just know I'm gonna live
there like it's one of the things that
I'm sure about I know I want to live
there and yeah I just love it
um yeah so I'm saying in front of my
window I hope the Lighting's better
Danny normally is kind of just I wanted
to show you like the true colors of the
stuff I bought so pretty much I was only
there for a day less than a day actually
the kind of one for my birthday my
birthday was in February but really more
than anything I just wanted to go to New
York to go shopping and yeah so we took
a coach bus because it's really
expensive to park you know and this was
just like easier and yeah so we had to
get back at a certain time and oh my
gosh the coach bus broke down on the way
back home and I didn't get home until
5:30 in the morning um anyways I'll get
right into the hall I just want to tell
you guys that I did not buy all the
stuff myself
my mom did buy a lot for me I don't want
you to think oh my god she's so spoiled
because this was technically for my
birthday so I didn't buy a few things
but you know I'm really grateful for
what my mom got me and I'm really
grateful for you know what I have so I
don't want you guys to like totally
think I'm a spoiled brat you know but if
you don't want to watch this or you plan
on leaving like mean comments you can
just X out because yeah I'm not gonna
lie I didn't I all this stuff my own
money so I guess I'll start off with
forever 21
I went to the one in Times Square voice
um you know I wasn't that impressed with
it personally like I don't know I
thought it was gonna be great but I got
lost so many times and I don't know it
was just the people that I really really
mean like the people working in the
dressing room they really really mean
but anyways I only got three things
which is kind of rude it's my favorite
store you know okay so the first thing I
got was just this sweatshirt I really
don't know what drew me to this
sweatshirt like I was just like I love
baggy sweatshirts like this and this
just totally made me really excited um I
guess I really like it's kind of money
like a boyfriend sweater and it's just
really big and cute and it has like
stripes all over it
I'll kind of like sit up whatever and
it's just big it has stripes all over it
it has like a little triangle thing
right there I don't know if you can see
it but I thought this would look really
really cute if I like move up the
sleeves because they have like this has
like this in the inside I don't know
it's still like stripes and everything
that I've been really cute and it's so
comfortable I don't I got it in a medium
well first of all it's like all they had
and I like them fake anyway so this was
only fourteen eighty this is one of the
most favorite things I got I explained
to you before that I bought it to make
it for 21 as a dress because I'm so sure
I'm only five foot one so they're tunics
or dresses and I'm really been into a
tribal print so I saw this and I like
freaked out so it looks like this
it's like this tribally pranit says it's
a tunic but I'm me it's dressed you know
all right so I'll try to like sit back
here this is what it looks like it kind
of like cinches in the waist right here
and yeah like it's simple but I'm
totally in love with it and sorry I'm
not looking at my camera I'm looking
like I'm you behind my spit but oh my
god I I saw this and I just had to get
it but what I was thinking is if I
forgot like a red belt and I put it
around the waist here that would look
totally amazing because like red with
black and white would just be like I
don't know but this was only 1580 and
then lastly I got an accessory all right
this was only a dollar 50 and it kind of
just spoke to me okay it's this hard
ring and it has like this really light
pink it's like this really light pink
color which hi I love hearts and I love
light pink so it's just kind of like you
know I had to get it um yeah I don't
know if you can really tell but it's
light pink and then it has like these
just like silver bumps around it I have
earrings like this I kind of whore I
wouldn't the other day they look like
this only they're black of the middle
and yeah so this would match those this
is only a dollar 50 I don't know 30s at
that but yeah why not I really liked it
next I went to Mac my bags like really
scrunched up because I had to like stuff
everything in my purse but yeah I went
to math and I got four eyeshadows and I
got them in like a little little quad
singing I'll go through the colors
Bellini was really nice and she helped
me like pick some out
okay so pretty much I really well this
is like okay I really wanted all that
glitters so I got all that glitters
which is right there I'm using a nice
highlight that is vapor burnt they're
sandpaper okay maybe you got a bit of
this no I don't even know paper then I
got set in taupe which is right there
you guys have probably all seen these
these are pretty popular colors I mean I
don't know about vapor and then the last
one but all the clothes in sentence help
what you're right there I just really
popular and then last thing I got tracks
which tracks is people but it has tons
of gold shimmer it's like the prettiest
thing ever so this would be really good
I'm going to California this summer I
really wanted just like a quad that I
could bring instead of bring the wait
for eyeshadows and just like humming him
everywhere this is something good
because you see like everyday colors I
guess I'll do H&amp;amp;M next I didn't get
anything for me I actually bought a
birthday present for my friend Maddie so
Maddie if you're watching this turn this
off because I'm just like I don't know
if script for like I don't know turn it
off I just don't watch this because I
don't want you to see this but I still
wanted to like show it in my haul and if
you guys don't know who Maddie is she's
a new best friend and I've done blog
peonies with her so if you've watched my
blog TVs you've seen her and yeah so her
birthday is April 22nd so say happy
birthday to her and this just really
reminded me of her yeah I don't know if
she really liked stuff like this I hope
he likes it it's like this tank top and
it has like a bunch of different prints
on it
if you can see this and it has like all
these different prints and then it has
like a Razorback with like straps are
all braided
and yeah so this really reminded me of
her and I was looking for something to
get her anyways so I got this I'll show
you the pattern more time yes I hope you
like this I don't know and then earlier
we were talking one time and she was
talking about how she wanted like a
thick black headband so they had these
there so I just got her a thick black
headband Maddy okay okay then I went to
Soho which Soho look I didn't have for
like any time New York really it was
porn it was seriously like a hurricane
any of you were there oh my god it was
horrible
I had an umbrella and a cold a flipped
inside out and like all the metal parts
like snapped and it broke it was still a
need it was pouring and oh my god it was
so bad but I'm probably gonna go this
summer and kind of spend more time in
Soho because I loved all the little
boutiques there and I went to this one
and it was called brandy Melville you
can see that it really reminded me of
Urban Outfitters like just the kind of
stuff they had I got this tank up it
wasn't too expensive there but it wasn't
like cheap you know and because this
tank top was $24 which it's kind of a
lot for a tank top not really but kind
of and it's just inside out but this is
kind of an interesting tank top like
different than I would normally get I
don't think I can wear this to school
but anyways it looks like this and it's
pretty much a crop tank top but the
sides are like long yeah he'll see like
looks like that and this part think it's
high and it's like showing my
bellybutton
which kind of seems like weird but it's
actually really really cute yeah I don't
know but anyways looks like this and the
pattern is just really pretty it's black
and then it has all these like flowers
on it they look like they're like
painting you know looks like that and
yeah really just reminded me of Urban
Outfitters okay my camera randomly cut
off that I don't know why but yeah so I
got this tank top for $24 and yeah I
thought it was really different and it
was just really cute so if you're in
Soho I really recommend this storm
Brandi and Mel bill it's really really
cute and stuff was just everything was
really soft I don't know how to describe
it but it was it was crazy so no bags
really cutest little bamboo bags with it
so I went there okay and then I went for
two more places and so how this one was
misty
miss Pete yeah have I got a t-shirt
there it was on sale for $10 so I got it
and then I went to the register it was
only seven so I don't know but really it
reminded me of me once again the holy
thing okay so it looks like this it's
just like a plain v-neck when I go out
pocket and then it has those sleeves are
like half lace as you can tell so it
looks really cute and then from the back
it's like exposed lace for a while I
like my hand up to it you can see the
laziness yeah so it's baggy but it is
extremely soft like I don't know Hawaii
it is so soft
I don't know what it's made out of
doesn't feel like a regular shirt I can
even find like a tag in here
I don't know
oh wait
ninety-six percent rate line / yawn and
4% spandex that makes sense because it
is extremely extremely soft and this
just I thought this would look really
cute with my guys I wasted I have my
high-waisted black shorts so I think
that would look cute and I don't know I
just loved this top yeah so I got that
from Mesquite it looks like the other
one foot WWWE 5:47 calm okay then these
things are probably my favorite clothing
items I got I tried the stuff on and I
actually took a picture so I'll probably
put it after I show you guys what it is
okay so I tried to step on I didn't mean
for it to go together but I kind of
think it did I'll just show you the belt
first so you know how earlier I was
talking about how if I had a red belt
I'd cinch the black and white dress for
a prefer xx ones waist so I got this red
belt and it's just like it's real
weather and it's just shiny and rad
amazing this is actually meant for like
you know will your pants
so I'm gonna have to punch an extra hole
to make it a waist belt but I just
thought this was really cute and it's
only seven dollars all these places are
pretty cheap so yeah just a nice red
belt I think everyone should have one of
these okay and then these two things are
probably some of the favorite things I
got okay I didn't didn't button this up
so bear with me this is just like a
button up top but it is it extremely
soft like all this stuff we're really
really soft and like nice quality
I don't know oh this place was called
necessary clothing yeah all right so I'm
not gonna button it because I really
just don't feel like it but it is this
black and white striped button up top
and it's loose it's not like tight on
you but it's just it's like I don't know
I really liked it and that smells good
this store smells like heaven I don't
even know it was amazing but yeah but as
you can see it's like really really
really soft it's not it's a stretchy I
don't know I'm gonna check the material
on this - okay rayon polyester spandex
see all this stuff is like the same
stuff and it's really really soft so my
mom actually like wanted this which was
really disturbing because I cannot see
my mom wearing something like this like
oh oh God
thank God she didn't get it I think she
would have gotten one if it wasn't like
crazy stripes because she just won
because it was like really comfy feeling
like maybe it was a solid color but yeah
I don't know this was only twenty
dollars which I thought was really good
for what it is
okay and then when I tried it on with it
was the skirt and I've been wanting like
a floral pencil skirt for a long time
and I like love this one so it has this
really pretty floral pattern on it it's
a pencil skirt so I I tried it on with
this shirt and normally like you would
think you what the heck are you doing it
actually looked to go ahead like I came
out of the dressing room and everyone
was like and I don't know I look it
looked really good um yeah I'll put a
picture like when I'm done showing you
this stuff because I took a picture in
the dressing room I know weird but
anyways it's so cute and this was only
fourteen dollars so yeah real each
inexpensive and really nice quality and
prettiness and yeah so that's what I got
from necessary clothing they have to
Minnesota 442 Broadway and 443 Broadway
don't quote me but yeah so do you go
there I would definitely for this store
because it was really cool and it was
really inexpensive so I really liked it
okay before I forget I got this scarf
because I didn't bring a scarf and this
was just from a street vendor it's kind
of like imitation Burberry I wish it was
real Burberry but I'm not gonna spend
$300 on a scarf huh um yeah this was
only $5 so you know why not
and it's like soft it's like cashmere at
least but that's the lady told me so I
don't know but I got this scarf and I
really liked it and yeah I got that I
don't lastly like I feel like there's a
lot of stuff for me but it's not really
a lot of stuff like I don't know but
this was my my biggest my big trip okay
so basically I am obsessed with Sperrys
and I have this thing where I really
really want to start a trend
I don't know cuz I like I didn't even go
into Hollister and anything like
everyone in my school is like obsessed
with Hollister and that's like all they
wear but really I don't like it anymore
it's just too like overdone and I don't
like dressing like everyone else you
know so these are something that like
only I've seen two other people in my
school have and one of them is one of my
good friends because we both like them
and these are Sperrys you guys may or
may not know what these are I learned
about them from Beauty xyx goddess so
thank you to her because these things
are my you love and my mom thinks these
are hideous so I'm surprised she got
them for me because she absolutely
despises these things um yeah so
basically me and my friend Liz we really
like these and we got them and then this
one over on my school I saw I had
something that looked like them and
they're coming in style now which I'm
kind of disappointed about because I
like having things that people don't
have but yes I kind of just wanted to
like wear something a no one had and
these are Sperrys they look like these
little folks use and these were like $80
so they're pretty expensive so like I
mean unless you love them I wouldn't get
them because they are kind of pricey
you look like this I got them in the
Navy
and their actual real leather and
they're extremely comfortable so it
looked like you know your dad's slippers
like something your dad would wear but
so not and I got these from David Z's
they have a lot of cute shoes there
so anyways they look like this I'm just
really preppy looking like I love them
okay and is it just me or would they
look extremely amazing with this shirt I
got like I got this before I got the
Sperrys and I think that would look
pretty great like I would look so crappy
like if I roll up these sleeves and then
like cuffed my jeans and go my Sperrys
yeah I don't know I think that's pretty
amazing this but these things are like
so comfortable it's crazy yeah I don't
know I'm so happy I got these
I wouldn't recommend order he's like
online or anything because I'm normally
a seven seven and a half and I had to
get these into six and a half yeah I'm
really happy that I got these fairies
because I wanted some fairly long time
and that's what I got I probably would
have gotten a lot more if I could have
been in New York longer I didn't even go
to open up fitters I didn't go to a ton
of places that I wanted to go to pretty
much because it was so disgusting out at
the end because you didn't have a lot of
time you only like eight hours in the
city which might seem like a lot but we
took subways places so that took up a
lot of our time because we only got lost
and didn't get off on the stuff we were
supposed to get off on and yeah that
Center a while but I'm probably gonna go
this summer we might spend the night my
mom kind of just want to like get her
bearings in the city or whatever just to
make sure she knew her way around so I
might be going this summer maybe
meet up maybe but I know I'm going to
California this summer too so maybe I'll
do meet up there I don't know
do any of you guys live in New York City
or California yeah I don't know today my
camera keeps cutting me off it's really
making me mad but this is I got not a
ton but it's good for me I'm so happy I
got a ton of stuff I wanted so yeah tell
me what you guys think of this stuff I
hope you guys liked this video I love
giving hauls I think it's fun I hope you
guys don't think I'm like bragging
anything but yeah so if you have any
questions about New York
the stores I went to or you know just
want to talk feel free to message me or
comment or whatever I'll reply so yeah
once again I hope you guys like this
I hope the lighting is okay yeah so
that's what I got and I don't know how
to end this video so it's really really
awkward but it's gonna be really long
and I'm sorry but yeah so bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
