city sledge imats hall I had so much fun
in New York and I'm at it was really
like just a cool experience especially
IMATS because I met viewable from
YouTube that was like I don't know it
was just so cool i met my friend
Gretchen there from YouTube she makes
videos seriously I'm gonna put a link
down below pause this video and you'll
subscribe or I'm honestly judging you
i'm at her sister Lucy and her friend
Marissa and they were seriously so
awesome it was so fun hanging out with
them and I met some subscribers at imats
and that was awesome and it was really
just a cool experience um unfortunately
I didn't really get much from IMATS just
a few things so I'm going to kind of
throw them in this whole video with the
clothing I got because I'm thursday and
friday i just did some shopping with my
mom which was fun because New York City
is literally the best place to shop
don't mind my hair I'm really not sure
what's going on right now um I killed it
yesterday and then I took a bus back
home yeah and then I slept on this and
then I don't know what happened so let's
just not look at it in my outfit like
basically I just threw on something from
my closet because i was wearing pajamas
all day so yeah okay i'm gonna start off
with the stuff I got from I'm at first
of all I got this fabulous bag uh-huh
yeah and then I only bought nail polish
what a surprise right because I totally
need nail polish not I have to wake
money but it was China Glaze 5 for 15
which is amazing because that's three
dollars each and they're normally like
seven or eight so yeah I got this nice
little disposable China Glaze bag holler
so first I gosh custom kicks whoo
hashtag shoe game I megistias teal color
with some shimmer they're not exactly
showing up true to color this is more
like a teal green but uh yeah then I got
this really cool blue called frostbite
it's super shimmery I don't have a
shimmery dark blue actually I probably
do knows but I really like this one it's
really pretty and megusta I got this
Louie undertone purple thing called
tantalize me so doctor um yep I got this
plain hot pan
just because I really don't have a good
one and I enjoyed this a lot called
fuchsia phonetic and lastly I got this
dark purple blue shimmery thing called
Tempest so that's what I got from I'm
ass I was really planning on buying more
makeup but it was really more of a thing
for makeup artists I would have to say
it was more costumey makeup and the
Stila booth which I was gonna buy stuff
from the line was literally wrapped
around so many times and I would have
waited in lines like an hour so I really
just didn't think I needed any a bath
this I went to get her shoes I really
want to get vans this trip I want to get
maroon bands but they didn't have them
any of the store so I'm gonna have to
order them for some reason whenever I go
to New York abaya pair of shoes I think
it's just because they have awesome shoe
stores um David zis is probably my
favorite the way we have the best
friends well I wanted to steve madden
and I really wasn't planning on buying
anything but I've wanted the trooper
boots in stone mother for the longest
time and they don't have them anywhere
where i live at they don't sell the
stolen other ones so i just never got
them and i saw them the store and it's
no tax there so i kind of just went for
it so they look like this they're like
the really popular cuba boots i haven't
been black so i know i like them but
they're just this really cool kind of
like topi grayish brown color and
they're just really distressed looking
which I love and I don't know I think
I'm gonna eat a lot of use out of these
because I feel like I'll wear these with
skirts and dresses more and I think they
are nice and cute and these were ninety
nine dollars which is a lot and I know
but um no tax and the real leather and I
were comment was all the time so I love
these okay I got one thing from forever
21 I really didn't go shopping in there
too much because I have a massive one
where I live but I was looking for this
one best I really want a vast that's
like a car bomb like army green jacket
only a vest and I there was one to
forever 21 that I wanted and mine and
they never had my size so I was looking
for it there and they never had it but I
just got this tank top and it's white
and it's like Oh shade up here and then
has little ruffle at the bottom with
some more like details or whatever I'm
kind of leaning more into like bohemian
kind of
pletely at least my style is maybe not I
don't really know but I thought this was
really cute and it would be look really
nice in the summer with a tan this was
kind of similar but I don't let her wear
this um so yeah I really like this and
it was 1580 next I went to zara because
I don't have I saw what I live and one
thing I wanted to find in New York was a
pair of light yellow jeans because I
love color jeans I honestly don't wear
regular jeans anymore i only wear
colored jeans I mean I do wear jeans
once in a while but mostly I would color
jeans I really wanted to let yellow care
I'm kind of into yellow all of a sudden
I don't know why but I saw this parasara
and they were decently priced and they
fit so I got them and they're just like
yellow Keynes they were oh I don't know
what's in euro was like 25 euros I don't
know what that converts to but it wasn't
awful so I got them next I went to
necessary clothing and I got two things
the other thing I was looking forward to
your form in green jeans because I
wanted them for the longest time and I
just never found the right ones these
ones were absolutely perfect hold on my
alarm is going off anyways these zones
are absolutely perfect they're kind of
expensive but you know whatever they're
from the black wood from the blown there
from the brand flying monkey which I've
only ever seen when I go to like New
York or California but they're really
nice quality jeans and they're just this
perfect mint green color like these are
the perfect pants that I've been looking
for um yeah these were 42 99 which were
kind of pricey but I figured since I've
been looking for them for so long I
might as well just get him and the next
thing the last thing I got from
necessary clothing was a sweatshirt
thing and I actually saw this online at
Toby I believe and I really wanted it
but they ran on my size and it was like
forty dollars so i wasn't gonna like
knocked at my size and it and i found it
unnecessary clothing for twenty dollars
so far again and it's like this kind of
a weird greenish gray colored sweater
with skulls on it with like flowers and
I know I'm kind of getting out of the
skull
and what I still really like this and I
actually have a scarf the kind of
matches it not that I'd wear them
together I'll show you it's just
chilling here but see it has like skulls
on it and I just really like that
pattern i wear that scarf all the time
so I figured this would be really cute
with like black leggings and my black
combat boots and this is so soft so I
figured it was a good deal and I would
get it okay then I meant urban
outfitters I was looking for this
specific tank top because alexandra XO I
think showing it into a haul video and I
really liked it so this is what it looks
like it's like this tyagi kind of
pattern thing and then it has a rose
gold zipper in the front and it kind of
like is like a shark bite kind of thing
in the front which is really cute and
its really soft and I think it's nice
and this was my hair is literally a mess
this was twenty-nine dollars I mean
whatever I think it's really cute as i
was browsing urban outfitters I found
these ear cuffs just chillin um and I
really like them it's a set of three
year coughs it was sixteen dollars which
isn't completely awful but I don't know
how to put them on like okay this is
what they look like there's this one has
like a orange and teal stone this one of
the little five I was just probably my
favorite and then this one would like
this cool design thing and like I tried
to put it on it would just fall off my
ear so I don't know if I'm gonna have to
return these or feels like a certain way
to put them on let me know because they
were just like flop off and it didn't
look like you okay the last place I went
was brandy melville because that was my
most exciting place to go to because I
love brandy melville once again it has
it that bohemian kind of feel and that's
really what I like lately um and I was
really looking forward to it so first
thing i got was just they gave me this
little thing with my purchase I don't
really know what it is like a little
coin purse thing and it came with like
stickers in it or something I don't know
why they gave it to me did I give it to
everyone knows but it has some stickers
this this says beware of dumb beezys I
don't know what that means I feel like I
should I feel like it's something like
trendy and cool and I'm just not trying
to your pool so I'm not really sure this
one has the Infinity love sign and this
one says Boston just New York and then
they give me some little card thing so
yeah I don't really know maybe I'll
stick me somewhere but the coin foot the
coin purse is cute I'm so awkward okay
first I got this taupe kind of corrupt
tank top thing and they had it on the
mannequin with a bralette under it it
looked adorable and then of course they
didn't have the girl let selling anymore
but i'll probably get that event to me
and it's just a really cute kind of crap
taupe tank top I loved hope next I got
one of the pair of their little ruffle
shorts that I should fall on or not
chiffon but this material and some
people liking these are really ugly or
really short but I actually am kind of
like them I have another pair of those
it'll show you in a minute but I think
these are kind of cute this tank top so
yeah we'll see these the only thing is
they go kind of high on the side so
they're kind of short on sides but these
were only ten dollars so that's a steal
by the way this was like 17 I think um
yeah so I got these the reason i got
those is because i actually got another
pair from pacsun before when and packs
on cells brandy melville like since when
i went in there and they had these
shorts I didn't get these in New York
but I figured I'd just show the many
ways they're like the same style only
have little daisies on them and their
brandy melville from tax on except there
were seventeen dollars there in 10 at
brandy melville so whoops um yeah
they're really cute and try your packs
on if you want Bertie Melville stuff
there wasn't like a huge selection but
it was still like cute stuff some okay
and then I got like the sweater that I
think everyone in their mother was from
brandy melville because I wanted to wear
2 i'm at my war really cute dressed
iran's with this sweater and I thought
it would match because it was cold in
New York oh well and it's just this
oversized quite large baggy oatmeal
color Twitter it's really soft and comfy
and I love it brandy sweaters are kind
of expensive though this was 52 dollars
but you know it's really cute and I love
it it smells pretty good too so yeah
the final thing I got from brandy it was
this headband and it has this floral
pattern on it like so and it's really
cute like know what am i doing no okay
whatever I'll probably buy this with a
bond because sexy um yeah I'll probably
this with a bun and I just think it's
cute with a little bow so yeah that was
my new york city / I rental I got a
pretty good amount of stuff I'm really
happy with everything I got I brought
everything with my own money I promise
you and yeah do you guys want to see
what I offer Easter oh I got the dolphin
pillow pet literally best Easter present
my whole entire life like it is so cute
and then when you want to do it just so
fat huh a little bit I don't know why I
threw this in here he was just kind of
sitting on my bed all lonely so yeah
okay I love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
