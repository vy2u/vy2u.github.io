City in my hotel room sorry I was a
liteon kind of sucks i didn't really
know where to film this but basically
i've been here for three days this is my
third day here and yeah I filled my
outfits every single day I was too
nervous through them outside in front of
people so I filmed them in this room I
hope you guys don't mind but I'm just
doing a little intro for this i figured
i would tell you guys my outfits because
i know you guys love my offer the weeks
but I really don't dress too nice in the
summer so that's why I haven't been
doing them but I figured this was kind
of like a mini outfit of the week and I
thought you guys might like it so yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this let me know if
you want to haul because I did get a few
things while I was here and yeah so keep
watching ok so in this first outfit I'm
just wearing this really pretty sure I
really liked it I haven't talked into
these high waisted denim with shorts
during a nude bandeau underneath and
here's another look at the links it's
really pretty and as you can see I cut
it into the shorts and put a brown belt
on which I really like the look of here
is just more of the outfit I'm going
three bracelets these first two are from
brandy melville in the last one I got in
Florida so I don't know if we can get
that one but I really like those and
then I'm just wearing some Brown stuffy
sandals that my friend say your Jesus
sandals but whatever I still like them
ok so I actually love this outfit I'm
wearing this really pretty striped dress
it kind of flows out at the bottom I
think it's like an a-line kind of style
I put on a foil scar for this because I
love mixing florals with stripes it's
one of my favorite things to do and i
also put on the same brown belt that I
won't day before
I love how this looks I'm definitely
gonna wear this more often and I just
really like this I'm setting the same
bracelets as I was the day before and I
wearing the earrings that I always wear
and then as you will see our moving the
same shoes because i only bought one
pair with me and I just kind of wanted
to bring a pair that I thought pretty
much matched all the outfits that I
brought so yeah that is that outfit and
keep watching ok so this last outfit is
probably my least favorite but I still
wanted to show it to you guys I'm
wearing this really cool orange lace
shirt which I'm normally not orange
person but I still like it because it
has this really cool purple detailing on
it and I'm wearing the same nude and oh
I'm wearing these cutoff jean shorts
which I know we're really short you
don't have to tell me that but then as
you can see I added more bracelets
because i had bought more so once again
let me know if you want a haul video and
those are some street vendors in New
York so yeah I'm going the same earrings
and that's my outfit once again I know
the shortest show please don't comment
on that but wearing the same sandals and
yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
