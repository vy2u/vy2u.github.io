tutorial it's just this it's the perfect
perfect I make up for back to school
just for natural everyday school where
anyways it's just really pretty it's
super natural looking and I think that's
really flattering for everyone you don't
need to use the same products as me
anything similar will work and yes I
hope you guys enjoy this and stay tuned
okay so I'm putting to the I that's
already done and the first thing I'm
going to do is fill in my eyebrows i'm
using these two colors on the van de
palette by wet and wild and I'm just
filling the main nice and lightly to
kind of make them more defined and they
really help shape your face now i'm
picking benefits of a space and just
putting this under my eyes to kind of
conceal my dark circles just using a
little bit now i'm picking an urban
decay primer potion and i'm just priming
my eyes with this so my shadow lasts all
day and doesn't please
now i'm picking still as eyeshadow and
kitten and I'm bring this all over the
lid this is my favorite eyeshadow and I
really love it it's a perfect color so
I'm just packing it on with my elf I
shower brush and just I'm bringing it
all the way up a little bit under my
brow bone but I'm still bringing it into
the crease because i'm just using one
colors my lip I feel like that's the
natural way to go to school
now I'm taking max Colo and vapor and
I'm putting this on my brow bone to
highlight this is a really pretty color
and I really like it now i'm taking
maybelline's line stiletto liquid liner
and i'm just putting this really thinly
on my top lash line and its really hurts
me to get this on camera but i tried as
best as i could this really opens up
your eyes and makes you less lashes look
a lot thicker now i'm curling my lashes
and apply mascara mascara i'm using is
one by one by maybelline
now i'm just adding some blush i know
this is an eye look but i wanted to add
some and it's just a Maybelline New
squash and yeah this isn't soft plum by
the way I'm just putting this on on the
apples of my cheeks that's a really nice
glow and it's really easy to blend so
that's the look I hope you liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
