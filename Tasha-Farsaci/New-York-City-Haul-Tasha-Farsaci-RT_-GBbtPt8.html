a haul and I went to New York City
February 19th you may or may not know I
talked about it in a video or two but
you know you guys might not know and
that was basically because my birthday
was the 17th and New York City is like
my favorite place so that was kind of
just like a birthday present for me and
we went for three days but two of them
were kind of like half of days you know
cause we had to drive there and then um
drive back so I was only there for about
two days and I was there mainly for
shopping um because I love shopping and
it was kind of like my birthday and you
know all that stuff um but I really
didn't get that much considering that we
were there for shopping but yeah I
really wanted to do a haul on this and I
know that a lot of the things that I got
are from places that I could get like
here but I feel weird kind of spending a
lot of money when I live here when I'm
here but when I want vacations or like I
go to New York do stuff then I would
like buy more from there so that's why I
didn't really get stopped from a lot of
like different stores but I still want
to do this haul video and yeah so I'm
gonna get right into it okay so the
first store I'm gonna do I only got one
thing from along with the second store
which are stores that I have only seen
in New York one of them I've seen in
California but I'm pretty sure they
don't have them that many places and
this first one is called necessary
clothing this is what the bag looks like
yeah I'm really trying not to touch my
nail like a 50 times in this video it's
just my bangs I behind my head and
they're really short like they're not
short but they're shorter and they kind
of like try to come in my face but
anyways so this is a really trendy store
and this stuff is fairly inexpensive and
it's always packed but I got this really
cute shirt that I really like the style
oh okay so I got this coral top and it's
basically just like a loose big top but
what I really loved about it was the
sleeves they have like these um slits or
like cutouts as you can see and I just
think that's really cute so like you
know obviously be able to see my skin
through it and then it just has a pocket
over here and it's just oversized and
it's really pretty and I love this
bright coral color especially for summer
and yeah so they have a bunch of
different brands in this store but this
one is from the brand
watch I guess so I don't know if that
means anything you guys but um it was
$23.99 so yeah that's all I got from
necessary clothing but I I really love
this
the next place I went was called
crossroads trading and basically they
have youth and new clothing the thing I
got happened to be new but um a lot of
this stuff most of the store is used
clothing and before I show you this in
other things in this haul video you need
to know that I have an extremely
unhealthy obsession with like royal blue
or cobalt blue um I have you heard
people call them different things as you
can probably see my coat back there I
have a real blue coat and I'm just
obsessed with royal blue I love the
color and so I saw this shirt and I
really wanted to get it some it's just
this royal blue top and it looks pretty
normal and telling it to the bottom and
you can see it has one of those like
little loop holes with a tie which is
really the end for this season I think
this would be really really really cute
over the summer you know just like
hanging out by the beach here on the
pool and yeah it's really really cute so
I got this and this was really
inexpensive this is only thirteen fifty
so um yeah and this is from the brand
860 so if that means anything you guys
um but yeah okay the next place I went
was forever free one and I went to a few
of them I went to the one in Times
Square and I went to the one in Soho and
I got most of the stuff in Times Square
I don't believe I got one of the things
no I'm Adam in Union Square I got this
scarf so basically it's just like a
peach colored scarf and then it has gray
and white cheetah print all over it and
I really wanted a cheetah print scarf
and I saw this one and I thought it was
really interesting just because it's not
like your normal cheetah print colors
with like brown and stuff and I thought
it was really cute and then it just has
these little tassels on the bottom and I
really like this and I believe this was
1080 I also got another scarf and I
absolutely love all the scarves they
have now I'm liking scarf girl so um
yeah but this one is just like magenta
taupe and like black and it's like a
really pretty tribal pattern it's
another one of like the square scarves
so I like to fold it in half to make it
a triangle and then kind of wear it how
I wore this one started putting my hair
but I really like this and this is gonna
be very versatile and it's just really
pretty and this was 880 so I love this
okay the next thing I got was a pair of
earrings and I don't really know if
other earrings are gonna be in for this
spring this summer but they had a ton of
them there so I saw these and I wasn't
gonna get them my mom convinced me
otherwise thanks mom um but they're
really really pretty and I love them so
they're just like these neon magenta
like really long feather earrings but I
think I can kind of pull them off
because I really long hair um but as you
can see that is what they look like and
they're really only neon you probably
can't they're not showing up in camera
as neon as they are they just have gold
chains going down them and these are the
super super cute and I think something
really cute with that blue shirt so I
was just picturing them with this shirt
and I think they would look like amazing
I love like the contrast of the colors
with like ripped jeans shorts I think
that looks super super cute for the
summer so I am really excited to wear
this stuff together and these earrings
were 680 okay and then I got two shirts
from forever 21 the same color which is
kind of weird but yeah so the first top
I never thought that I would get into
this kind of style or trend I guess and
it's when the shirts have like holes in
them which I kind of like kind of don't
like but I actually really liked it in
this top so um yeah basically it's this
light pinky peach color and then it just
has holes ripped into it and they're in
the places so that you can still wear
like a bra with this and it won't show
and they're just like really like
natural-looking like holes and I don't
know why but I love this and they just
go all the way down and they're not on
the back so that's good um and this was
only ten eighty so I mean that's
probably all I would spit into fresh
shirt with holes ripped into it anyways
but maybe I'll do a DIY on how to wick
your own shirts so let me know if you
want to see that but yeah I really like
this and then like I said the other
shirt was the same color and there's
kind of like a funny story behind this
shirt so I didn't know if I wanted it
and it's not because I don't like it
it's just like I wasn't sure and it was
like I just didn't really know so I put
it back on the hanger actually and um so
it was just sitting
hanger and all of a sudden like
instantly go walk by say oh my god
that's so cute and she's like picked it
up and was looking at it and I was like
and she was holding it for a minute then
she was like oh whatever and so she just
put it back and I was like oh crap now I
have to get it so I got it and I really
really liked it and glad I got it so
basically it's that same nudey pink
color but it's like a chiffon blouse and
it has a bow down the front
with like a pleat under the bow as you
can probably see there and it goes down
it has kind of like an uneven hemline at
the bottom and then the sleeves just
kind of cinch they're 3/4 and it's
totally like loose and flowy and I
actually like it so I'm glad that I got
this okay in the final store that I got
things word from was Urban Outfitters
which I do have I could not fit as near
me but it is my favorite store and it's
really expensive
I think they overpriced a lot of their
items so normally I only bought things
that are on sale but um a few things I
got from normal price and I didn't feel
as bad buying a lot of things in there
um because you know I was in New York so
yeah I'm gonna show you what I got and
the first thing is probably my favorite
purchase that I made the whole trip I am
obsessed with it and there's kind of a
funny story behind it so basically what
it is is this crossbody bag and it's
royal blue um and it's just leather it
has like fringes here and then right
here on the zipper and then it can also
be like a clutch if you could take the
chain off the strap is actually chains
so they're just like silvery chains and
then it comes back together on the top
with a little bit more of that royal
blue and I just was obsessed with this
okay so the funny story behind this was
that I saw it where I lived and I wanted
it but I didn't get it because it was
$40 and I think that's kind of a lot to
spend on something like this so I didn't
get it and then I had a dream about it
which is just a weird um come on when
you give a dream about a purse that's
just strange so when I saw it in the
store in New York I was like okay I
gotta get it so I got it and once again
this was $40 in the last shirt with the
bow I forgot to mention was 1780 but
yeah so this was like $40 but it was
definitely worth it and I'm obsessed
with it they also had it in black and
gray but of course I got the royal blue
okay the next thing I got was just a
plain black cardigan you guys may have
known that I was just wandering a new
black cardigan so I just got this one
and it fits
quickly it's really really cute it's
really nice quality and this was on sale
for $30 all their cardigans were $30
instead of 40 so I figured I would just
pick one up because it was a nice
quality and I really needed one so yeah
next I got this topi lace top and don't
mind this like hanger strap here I have
to cut it off still but it's just like a
nice topi lace and it's pretty tight it
goes all the way down and the sleeves
are like 3/4 length and there's what the
lace looks like the cool thing about
this shirt was the back it kind of dips
further in the back so it looks really
pretty from behind and I would run nude
cami under this and I'm absolutely in
love with it it's really cute and the
Sun sale for $30 okay and the final two
things I didn't get while I was in New
York I actually just ordered them online
on the day after I came back but I was
going to order them before I went to New
York but my mom told me that I should
probably just look in there in the
stores to see if I was on there so I
looked and I couldn't find either of
these things one of the main things that
I wanted and come to find out it was
only online only which makes sense now
but um anyways this shirt is probably
the maximum I would spend on a shirt it
was $40 and it's a tank top which I
would normally never spend but um I'm
obsessed with it like it might be one of
my favorite shirts now um I just really
love it so yeah I'm gonna show you that
now okay so it has like this sweetheart
neckline and it's cheetah print it's a
tank top and then it has cutouts on the
sides which I'm obsessed with especially
for the summer and stuff and then it
kind of has like a band around it and
then it flows out and it's kind of hard
to see how cute it is on screen so I'm
gonna post a picture right now of the
model wearing it
so yeah that's what it looks like I'm
hearing it's really cute and then on the
back it just has a zipper going all the
way down so yeah I'm obsessed with this
and it might not have been worth $40 but
I'm really glad that I have it okay and
the final shoot that I got is a flannel
I love flannels they're so comfortable
and they're really cute as well and on
Fridays me and my friends a lot of the
Fridays we wear flannels and we call it
flannel Friday I don't know something
funny we do so I always like to have
flannels this was a boyfriend style
flannel I guess according to Urban
Outfitters um but yeah so I got it in
extra small um and it just was really
pretty colors in it so this is what it
looks like it has one pocket there it
just buttons all the way down and I love
the colors in it here's a better look at
the color so just really bright like
Purple's Reds greens blues and I just
think it's really really pretty so
that's everything I got I hope you guys
