tutorial for you it's no heat and I
think it's so so pretty so yeah I don't
know how I came up with this honestly I
was just sitting in my bed watching the
Olympics because I don't have a life and
I just thought of it I was like wow
there'd be a really cool hairstyle I
mean I'm not saying I made this up or
anything I mean people have probably
done it before there's probably other
videos on it but I haven't seen any and
yeah you guys are always asking me for
hair tutorials so I figured I would film
it and this is really easy all you need
to know how to do for this is a Dutch
braid and like I say in a lot of my
videos because I incorporate Dutch
braids into lots of my hair tutorials
I'm going to kind of explain it in this
video but I'm not gonna go super
in-depth so if you still don't
understand it after watching my video be
sure to search it up in little search
bar because there's probably tons of
videos on how to do a Dutch braid maybe
I'll make one let me know down below if
you want me to make one but I think that
if you're good at braids you should be
able to figure it out by what I tell you
in this video and that's all you're
gonna really need to know how to do I
put in mouth explain everything else and
you're gonna need a few bobby pins I
like using these big ones because I have
pretty thick hair so you're gonna need a
few of those and then just a regular
kind of small bobby pin but small bobby
pins will work just as fine so yeah I
really love this hairstyle basically
what it is is a Dutch braid up here all
the way to the back and then it has a
bun and the braid actually wraps around
the bun so I'll show you that now so
yeah I love this hairstyle it takes me
like five minutes when I'm not filming
it probably took me longer today but
it's super great I think this will be
great for like everyday wear because
it's like nice and casual and pretty but
it's also great for like dances and
stuff because if you're taking pictures
from the side or even like those
pictures from the back would be nice and
obviously front on its go as well so
yeah I hope you guys in like this video
if you want to see how to do this keep
watching okay so you want to start off
this
style but just having your hair natural
and brushed out and then put it to the
side so I've done all that this is just
where I normally put my hair and yeah so
my hair is natural and a brushed out
then we're going to move on to the Dutch
braid portion of this bun hairstyle and
if you don't know how to Dutch braid I
do show you in this video but if you
still don't get it after I show you
because I'm kind of gonna be a little
brief I'm not gonna go really in depth
be sure to just search it up in the
little search box because there are
probably tons of videos and how-to
doctor braid on YouTube and then you can
do this hairstyle okay so if I'm looking
over here during this video that's
because I have a mirror there and this
is hair sales kind of how to do with a
me without a mirror so yeah that's why
I'm looking over here so you're just
gonna grab a little section of hair from
the top part of your head not too big
just like this and I'm using it on the
side that has the most hair and you're
going to separate it into three equal
sections so once you're on that you're
gonna start your Dutch braid you're not
gonna add in any hair yet but you're
going to take your outside section and
bring it under the middle section where
is it a regular braid you bring in the
outside sections over it this is going
to create the Dutch braid effect so once
again you take that outside section and
bring it under the middle you're gonna
want to do this really really tightly
and now you're going to start adding in
here so you're gonna take this next
section on the outside add a little bit
of hair from that same side and then
bring it under that middle section I
want mine to go kind of up and back so
you're going to kind of guide it that
way with your hands so then once again
your with an outside section you grab a
little bit of hair from there and then
bring that under the middle section grab
some hair bring it under the middle
grab some hair add it and bring it under
so I'm gonna keep doing this till about
hmm
kind of like a top back of my head and
then I'll be right back okay so as you
can see I have gotten pretty far down
the braid and now we're just gonna braid
it down kind of normally you're still
bringing the pieces under one another
but you're not gonna be adding in any
hair so yeah just braid down all the way
down the rest of your hair you want to
make sure you go all the way down
because you're gonna need this whole
length of hair okay so once I'm to the
bottom I'm just going to tie it off with
my little elastic you want to do a
little one so it's not as noticeable but
if you don't have one any hair type will
work just fine okay so now we've got
this braid and I actually really like
how this looks I wear my hair just like
this sometimes I mean I probably usually
straighten it but I really like this
because it gets all your hair out of
your face so there's another hairstyle
for you but today we're gonna be doing a
bun so you're gonna want to take all the
rest of the hair that you have left and
that's what we're gonna be making the
bun with so I'm gonna turn around and do
this right now I'm gonna have to voice
it over because you probably won't
people hear me
so yeah start off by just brushing out
my hair so there's no tangles and then
I'm gonna bring it back into kind of
like a ponytail so like I'm back to a
ponytail and this is the part where if
you have shorter hair than me make sure
you bring your ponytail up higher so
that the braid won't have to reach
because my hair is just long enough with
this length of the bun so pull your hair
up higher if it's shorter and then I'm
just twisting the hair so it'll like
loop itself into a bun and that's how I
like to do my buns because it's really
easy and yeah so I'm just kind of
twisting it around itself and then I'm
going to secure it with my big bobby
pins as you can see I have some pieces
hanging out but I wanted a messy look if
you want this more polished you can kind
of bobby pin those pieces in
okay so now I'm taking my brain and I'm
wrapping it starting from under all the
way around the bond and with my little
tail end you see I'm just gonna kind of
try and tuck it under my braid but you
end up still seeing it and you end up
still seeing my hair tie which really
made me bad but I wasn't gonna refilm
that so yeah that's all I do
and then I'm just continuing to bobby
pin this or do whatever I'm doing I
honestly have no idea yeah I think I'm
still Bobby pinning my tail
even though I still see it but yeah okay
so now that's the final product okay so
as you can see I just wrapped it around
the bun and I really like how it looks
so what I'm going to kind of do is just
pull some pieces out and kind of just
you know fix it up a little bit I like
to kind of pull the outside edges of
this braid just like the team tee hairs
on the outside of it because it kind of
just makes it bigger and prettier in my
opinion so yeah I like to kind of just
loosen this up if you don't like that
you definitely don't have to but I
really love this hairstyle and I hope
you guys do too so thanks for watching
and leave comments down below if there's
any other hair tutorials that you want
me to specifically do or anything like
that because I'm always open for new
ideas so yeah thanks guys for watching I
hope you liked it and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
