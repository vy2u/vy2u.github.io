so basically I woke up and got ready and
then just filmed a haul video yes I'm
wearing my Guzzi oh contacts right now
focus there we go yeah I'm just really
like how they look I like wearing them
to film and I also took a selfie in this
beanie because I'm like kind of working
with slash spreading awareness for love
your melon which is a company whose
products 50% of the sales go to help
fight pediatric cancers so yeah I think
their beanies are so frigging cute so
anyways I was taking a picture to post
on Instagram and the beanie and I was
like hey like contacts might make you
look cuter so yeah I am just wearing the
contacts film the video okay
I needed the Tryon portion but why is it
like not focusing my face there you go I
need you to try on portion but I don't
really feel like doing that today so I
might do that tomorrow
ah yeah and then I'm about to go get I'm
not about to and a little bit I'm gonna
go downtown with some of my friends
Marjorie and Marie to get some early
dinner and stuff so it'll be fun and
I'll bring you along with me of course
so yeah I back to the house to myself
right now
should probably try and be productive oh
my gosh guys so I just put on the bah
humbug sweater and look how cute it is
like this is so freakin cute
I'm obsessed with it I don't want to
take it off I want to wear this every
day for the rest of my life oh my gosh
okay so I took my contacts out because I
was done filming and they were starting
to hurt focus on my face please okay
some of you guys are commenting like oh
those are gonna damage your eyes like
blah blah blah like why would you wear
contacts like your eyes natural eyes are
pretty like embrace your natural self
like okay like yes obviously I'm fine
with my natural self but it's just fun
to switch things up when it's in a while
like people dye their hair or all the
time it's like the same thing and I
don't wear them all day like I just wear
them you know once in a while from
filming or taking photos and if I'm
blonde
and because of it like okay that's my
own fault I like how they look oh yeah I
don't want any comments about them
damaging my eyes I appreciate that you
guys are looking out for me but I'm
gonna continue to wear them once in a
while so I need to edit my vlogmas from
yesterday I'm debating I'm going to get
a nice coffee from Duncan so I can sit
down and drink a nice coffee and edit
but it's currently snowing a lot so I
don't know if I really want to go
outside and drive there it's weird
because I never really like Duncan I
used to only go to Starbucks but now
that I live in LA and it was only like I
think there was a - Dunkin Donuts in LA
and I like can never have it I always
want it so like now that I've been home
I've been getting Dunkin a lot even
though the og is McDonald's iced coffee
it's my favorite I love it okay so I'm
about to go to an early dinner with some
friends I figured I'd show you what I'm
wearing I changed out of my pugs sweater
just because I wanted to look a little
bit a little bit cuter you know so I'm
wearing the beanie the love your melon
beanie that I showed you and then I'm
wearing just this black throw mole top
from Free People it's their venture a
thermal I'm wearing this long fuzzy faux
suede vest from boohoo it will be in the
hall that I film today I'm just wearing
some Lululemon leggings and don't mind
my fuzzy socks I'm gonna wear I think
hunter boots because it's like snowing
and slushy out but yeah I'm wearing my
choker that I made and then yeah so I
think it's pretty cute it's pretty snowy

original green we have introduced
ourselves
