voice might sound kinda weird literally
my chin in my nose are like flaking off
dry skin because I was blowing my nose

didn't have a voice for a few days I
couldn't really film which is why I
haven't had a video but I did start
filming my office like the first and
second week of school so my view of my
office to put together in your eyes for
