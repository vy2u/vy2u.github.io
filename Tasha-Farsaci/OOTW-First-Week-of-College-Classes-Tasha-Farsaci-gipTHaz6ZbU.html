so first of all I apologize for this
super strange angle of my room right now
the lighting in my room is so
unbelievably horrendous I cannot wait to
move out of this place and I just have
nowhere to film so I'm gonna be standing
right now but anyways I'm so sorry I
haven't posted a video in forever
basically I had the flu for like two
weeks and I was on my deathbed so I
didn't have time to film anything put
alone like get out of my bed like I just
cut in and then I just started classes
again so I've been super super busy with
that but I did film my outfits this week
sorry my voice is like still kind of
messed up anyways as I was saying I did
fill my outfits this week I didn't film
them on the first day because my flight
was actually cancelled so I had to miss
my first day of classes so I added an
outfit that I actually wore out last
night so I still have five outfits for
you eyes but one of them is like a going
out outfit you guys requested that I do
more outfit of the weeks and as you will
see it's kind of hard for me to find
places to film them like I said my room
is very cramped I can't wait to move out
so I can get somewhere better for
filming but from now I kind of did what
I could hopefully you guys can see the
clothes okay and I will be linking
everything that I can find down below in
the description that I'm wearing if you
guys want to check it out and maybe get
it for yourself and if something is sold
out I will try and link similar items oh
and really really quickly before I get
into the video if you guys don't follow
me on Instagram and you want to keep up
with my life on a more personal like
day-to-day basis I post more outfit
photos on there as well just like
college lifestyle photos I will put it
here on the screen if you guys want to
follow me that would be awesome okay I
feel like I haven't filmed a video in so
long so I feel super weird talking but
without further ado let's get right into
