my normal setup at all I'm actually in
my dorm room this is my desk
um I know this is not the cutest
background afro but honestly this is the
first video I've filmed in my dorm so
I'm still kind of trying to figure out
where I'm gonna want to film videos but
right now there's like light coming in
from the windows right there so I
figured for this intro this would be
fine
so pretty much I know I haven't been
posting a lot of videos but I did film a
few outfits from the first week that I
wanted to put together in and out for
the week because you guys know you guys
probably like my outfit weeks I do them
like all the time like I did it
throughout high school so I figured I
should do one for college not gonna lie
it's been kind of hard to think about
YouTube just because you know it's a
huge adjustment for me especially going
across the country and I've been trying
to like meet people and do as much as I
can with the adjustment and YouTube is
kind of been on the back burner for me
but I want you guys to know I did not
forget about you I'm still gonna do
video is but it's just gonna be like at
least for this time period it's not
gonna be like steady uploading because I
do have class I am trying to meet people
make new friends and just and still hang
out with people at the same time but I
did put together this little outfit of
the week once again as far as filming
location I might try and do it outside
sometimes but for this video it was just
in the dorm room I hope that's okay
it's been super hot here in college does
not have a dress code so yeah I probably
been wearing some things I'd break like
all of your dress codes but College is
awesome no dress code it's really hot
it's like 90 degrees in the room right
now but yeah so I'm gonna get right onto
the video hope you guys enjoyed it and I
love you okay for Monday I'm on this

cute and comfy since it's so hot outside
