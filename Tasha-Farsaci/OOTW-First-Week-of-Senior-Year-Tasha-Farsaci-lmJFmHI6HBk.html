slightly curled my hair and did some
pretty normal makeup I'm wearing my Alex
and unease and then I'm wearing this
really pretty Laurel and lace Whomper
with a cute kind of cloud again with
some lace panels both from Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch and then I'm just wearing some
purple flip-flops to kind of match the
purple in the rubber this is Thursday
because as you probably noticed I have
started school on a Wednesday so I'm
going this really pretty O'Neil high-low
dress and I'm normally not a fan of
high-low but I really love the pattern
on this one and I just really liked how
it look so I'm wearing that with my
favorite earrings that I wear like every
day yeah just some Brown of braided
sandals
on Friday it was supposed to be a
million degrees so I won't my hair up
with some red lipstick and winged
eyeliner and then I just wore this black
and white striped t-shirt dress just so
I'd be kind of cool in school because it
was literally 5 million degrees then I'm
just wearing some ankle booties from
Steve Madden I love those and I just
really like this outfit and it was just
really comfortable
whether you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
