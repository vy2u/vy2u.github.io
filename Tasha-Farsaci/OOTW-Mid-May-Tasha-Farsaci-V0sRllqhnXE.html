week video hi I'm back at home so it's
back in my backyard for the off of the
weeks if you're wondering why I look
homeless or my hair looks like this it's
because I don't really do my hair in the
summer so yeah get used to this anyways
this out for the week it's a little bit
different because almost everything in
this video is from Tsavo skirt Savo
skirt is a super cute website I'm
obsessed with it they have a lot of
clothing that is their own brand so some
skirt brand and yeah I'm wearing it and
pretty much every outfit I think one
outfit I'm actually just wearing jeans
from Topshop with a sophmore skirt top
so I'm gonna put all of the outfits in
the description and say where
everything's from in the description so
in case you're wondering that's what
it's gonna be I'm not gonna lie to you
guys I'm filming some of these outfits
on the same days I cheated I know but I
have worn these it's just the now that
I'm back home and Lava cheese it's super
rainy and I just can't feel my outfit
outside and I like it being outside
because it's prettier so I thought some
of them today on the same day so you
know not trying to fool you guys
the outfit I'm wearing right now is not
this video but I actually encrypted this
flannel from Salvation Army and I'm just
wearing like a plain black long-sleeve
so in case you're wondering that's where
this is from anyways I'm gonna stop
blabbing now and get right into the
video
okay for this first outfit I'm wearing a
really cute dress from the szabo skirt
this gold necklace from forever 21 that
I pretty much wear all week but
basically it's a white and gray tropical
leaf pattern and I really like it
because of the triangle cutouts all
throughout the middle section and I'm
wearing my favorite black movies from
Steve Madden
in this second outfit my hair is up in a
topknot and it's a really cute mom /
once again through szabo skirt the right
side is kind of like tucked up there but
you guys get the point it's off the
shoulder it looks so good with a tan
that I unfortunately do not have right
now but I'm wearing it with these really
cute brown sandals from Steve Madden
okay for this outfit I'm wearing a white
lace sprawl out from Free People
and all of my favorite bracelets from
rope the moon jewelry and my ring and my
necklace and the romper I'm wearing is a
super cute orange romper where they kind
of live a little cutout thing going on
in the middle as you will see in a
moment
it's really cute it kinda looks like a
dress but it's not and the whole back is
open too so I think that's really
flattering in just a really pretty
detail and I'm wearing it with those
same Brown sandals that I wore before
okay for this outfit I was struggling to
fill them a little bit because I didn't
have a tripod but the top of the dress
is really cute crocheted with some
off-the-shoulder little ruffles and a
little people in the front super cute
super delicate and dainty and then the
back is all open it just kind of crosses
with the main shops that are in the
front and I'm just wearing the same
brown sandals with it and then for the
last outfit I'm wearing the same
necklace and then his top it was kind of
hard to see but it's basically just so
she fought on top with her knot and a
zipper in the back
and my favorite pop shop jeans and some
black booties with my believe booties
okay so that was my outfit of the week
