really know I think it's either six or
seven I really want to say it's six no
seven seven okay seven basically I woke
up I frantically packed up some Poshmark
orders because I took way too long to
ship some I mean not way too long but I
just like to ship them like really
quickly took me longer than normal so I
pack those up I biked them to campus
because I have my bike now and so you
can see that was life-changing like it
happened so much quicker than it would
have if I walked drop those off made
some coffee
and now now you guys will be excited
because I'm going to lunch to alpha P
which means I will be inserting a photo
of my food which you guys apparently
love and today they have a good Greek
bar I'm gonna sound really stupid but do
you pronounce them heroes gyros or euros
not euros don't think it's euros that is
currency but whatever it's those and you
can get them chicken or falafel I think
I'm gonna get falafel and they always
have pita and hummus and it's so good so
I'm going there and then today is the
day I actually have to study because my
midterm is tomorrow but now I'm entering
my final yeah one of my finals is
tomorrow so I think I'm gonna go to the
same coffee shop but I went to yesterday
and I'm either gonna bring Andrea with
me maybe Leia will come again
or I'll just go alone but yeah I'm also
using my vlogmas mug that I got
yesterday and how cute is it and we used
it too and she also thinks it's adorable
so okay guys I'm about to open my
vlogmas
don't gift for day 7 I'm intrigued I
don't know what this could be so let's
go for it
huh it's so cute
it's a flamingo neon sign I literally
have wanted this I think it's so cute
and this is gonna go in my room sits
like pink and teal kind of yay what do
you think
try it
yeah
I got a charcoal watch a so I'm excited
oh my gosh guys
hey guys so I feel like I literally
haven't vlogged like at all today
I was just doing a lot of homework
obviously and kind of some studying like
I said I'm really not a huge studier I
think a lot of communication in classes
that I've taken are just pretty
common-sense material so once I read it
over a few times I kind of feel
comfortable with it but I wanted to have
a little bit more footage so I just
tweet it out and had you guys tweet me
some questions so I guess I'm just gonna
answer the first ones that come up and
also my nose is red again one of you
guys commented saying that maybe it's
because I like rub my nose and it like
rubs the makeup off but I don't really
put a lot of makeup on my nose and in
the morning my nose isn't red so I don't
really know also to anyone asking me if
I'm safe because of the LA fires yeah
absolutely I'm safe luckily USC is far
enough away from where the fires are
that I'm okay well it's really really
scary and I just hope that if any of you
guys are affected by them that you guys
are safe and you're okay
I know UCLA has already canceled classes
and they might be doing evacuation stuff
soon so yeah it's just really scary but
like I said there was no effect really
of it here this guy was a little bit
smokey last night but nothing crazy so
anyways um I just ate some dinner Alfie
but I forgot to take a picture also it
wasn't very good so it wouldn't have
been worthy it was like a burger bar and
I got the veggie burger but I really
didn't like it on this ate some ice
cream which I definitely did not need
okay so I'm gonna answer some of the
questions now so Rose Lawrence I'm just
gonna read your names that are like on
your Twitter's so hopefully they were
your names asked me how am i doing and
what am I done with the school so yeah
I'm doing okay like I said I really
don't stress out very much around finals
time but other people are really
stressed out so it just kind of makes me
feel guilty that I'm not stressing out
and then I feel like I should be
stressed and also I'm going to Paris
soon so I need to figure out how to pack
for all of that so I'm doing okay but
it's not only a fun time just because no
one is interested in doing anything
which like I guess makes
obviously because they're busy studying
but yeah so on my last final is Tuesday
next Tuesday and then I fly to Paris
that Thursday so I have a day gap in
between to kind of like get all my stuff
together pack probably get my nails done
and yeah then I'm off to Paris let's see
what else do I want to answer
Ashley Allen asked me how am I like in
the Vampire Diaries um one of my vlogs a
while back I was talking about how I
just started watching it and I kind of
stopped watching it I don't not
completely like I'm sure I'll start
watching it again but I got to the part
I don't want to spoil it for anyone
maybe skip through this if you like
haven't seen it yet and think you want
to see it but oh so I got to the part
where Elena is like with Damon or
whatever and I'm team Stefan so she was
just kind of bothering me and she was
being super annoying so I kind of
stopped watching it also I've been busy
with other things but I definitely I'm
gonna keep watching it just because you
know probably when I'm on the plane I
might you know maybe get some Wi-Fi i
watch the episodes you all download some
episodes but yeah oh my gosh I just
completely messed up my laptop okay and
I think the last one I'm gonna answer is
from a Tori Cardin Cardin and she asked
what's my favorite thing about
California well California is a super
big state so I can only generalize for
the whole state but I guess since I live
in LA right now I'll say my favorite
thing about LA well it's definitely the
weather but it's like the combination of
the weather and it being a big city
because I do really love like big cities
that have like a lot to do but I just
hate the cold weather so if I weren't in
LA like I could see myself maybe in New
York but I just can't because of the
weather so I think my favorite part is
the weather it's always nice out so yeah
so anyways I'm just chilling right now
okay guys so we're about to well I was
gonna say decorate the tree but it's
really mini but it's currently sitting
on this box that I got in the mail a few
days ago and I know it's in it but you
guys don't know what's in it so I'm
calling it a mystery box just so I can
make this video clickbait I'm sorry but
it's so big I think I'm gonna I can
probably fit in it after
this is my Christmas present for my
parents so if you watch this this is
like all I'm gonna get might in my what
I got for Christmas video but yeah let's
open it it's marble luggage it's the
marble luggage set that everyone has
that I've always wanted so I'm gonna
take it out and then I'll show you guys
here she is so cute I don't have one
that's hard and I'm pretty sure it has
the smaller carry-on size inside of it
so yeah I'm gonna use this for Paris
that's why I got it early guys so I
thought I should try and light up my
little gift for today and it's so cute
it's kind of like not showing up like
colorful on the screen but it's pink and
blue and I think it's so cute I think
I'm probably gonna get batteries for it
just so doesn't have to be plugged into
something but yay thanks doh okay guys
so I think this is going to be my last
clip of vlogmas for today I kind of just
want to end off the end off this vlog
