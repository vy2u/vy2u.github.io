this gold kind of just detailing on them
my hair is straight um like always um
and now i will show you my outfit okay
so on top I wearing this lacy kind of
shirt and it's kind of baggy so I'm
wearing off the shoulder and it has like
a built-in t-shirt so you can't really
see through it in like this area but on
their sleeves it is see-through and I
really just like it off the shoulder I
like the vibe against and I think it's
super cute I have it just talked into
jeans and I have my little brown belt on
I wear this thing like constantly and
smile it's really simple to say but I
really like it
and then here's just a better look at
the padding on the top its kind of lacy
I don't really know what it is but yeah
then for shoes you probably guessed it
um wearing my combat boots and I'm
obsessed with these things I really want
black ones with like lots of buckles and
stuff so I'm probably going to be
looking on the lookout for those I'm
going New York City and like November
some time so I'll probably look for some
bigger but um yeah I'm just wearing my
brown ones with this today they go with
my belt and I really like brown with
light cream colors so yeah that's what
I'm wearing today I hope you guys like
this and keep watching hey guys so
today's Wednesday um first thing I'm
wearing is these gold earrings I also
wore them one day these are like my new
favorite earrings to wear um I'm really
getting into any more like edgy kind of
stuff um you probably won't be able to
tell but I want to start getting like
more I don't know kind of edgy things
and I think these earrings are kind of
like that because they like spiked I
don't know maybe not but yeah um some
wearing knows I'm just when we're down
like normal instead when Broner liner on
the waterline i'm wearing black only
like halfway i don't know if you can
tell but I am just kind of go with the
shoot more I don't know but now i will
show you my outfit ok so on top i'm
wearing this black v-neck and then over
my name is kind
it's like a cotton material but it's
striped black-and-white and then it has
gold buttons three on each time to go
down the front it doesn't close it just
kind of hangs there it's like three
quarter length please which is actually
really cute yeah so it's really cute has
like this neckline right here and then
my jeans I have like holes around and
you can kind of since this is kind of
like formal I wanted to make it kind of
like dress it down so jeans would like
the holes I thought kind of like
accomplished that I don't know but yeah
sorry like this top
okay and for shoes I really don't have
like any black shoot which is really
weird I have like tons of brown shoes
but i'm going to blacks you so my only
black shoes that i actually like are my
oxfords that's why when where Oxford's
again today I'm kind of starting to
break them in they don't really give me
in bed of blisters now so yeah I'm going
to eat and I love these they're so cute
it needs are from steve madden so i
don't know if they still have them you
can probably find some that are really
simple like so yeah that was today and
if you guys are wondering I went through
with it honest and it did not take them
along but they redid the change out the
wire and then I have like a chain
rubberband across my whole top and it
hurts so bad bump yeah if you guys who
are wondering that I don't know why I
said that but whenever I'm yeah so keep
watching for tomorrow hey guys today's
Thursday and yeah I'm wearing something
kind of different but especially for me
but I really like the trend and I got
this leg last year so I just kind of
wander where you'll see what it isn't
I'm not wearing any like accessories or
anything on them I might put my pearls
but I don't know but yeah so I'm not
really we're going to do a special like
that but i'll show you the outfit now
okay so obviously i'm wearing a leather
jacket and it's just kind of like out of
my comfort zone like I can rejoice I can
work anything to school but worry with
leather jacket is like scary for me but
yeah so I'm wearing that and I don't
I'm going this really producing my
favorite shirt it's just a light pink
tank top with like ruffles and I kind of
wanted to make something really soft and
girly with something like more edgy so
that's why would this top of this I'm
not I'm just wearing some jeans and i
really like this outfit it's actually
pretty warm and you know this is full of
hair by the way and yeah i got it last
you but this is like a good style now
like motorcycle trend so you can
definitely find one that similar yes'm
this is what the top looks like it has a
guy at the top you can't see this one
but it's a really cute then it cinches I
will this and then just I really like it
with a jacket stone
the only thing i don't like about this
jacket is the fact it's like moist right
here and that bothers me so much but
other than that I really like this and
it wasn't too expensive so yeah
okay and for shoes I'm wearing these
lace flats um I know I don't know if
they really match but whatever they're
just lazy and then they have a pet and
tip with like a little velvety bow and
yeah I love these and I so comfortable
and they don't give me blisters at all
so I'm wearing those with this and um
yeah so I hope you guys like this outfit
and keep watching for friday hey guys
such fan running really late so I'm
gonna go really fast but just a really
casual outfit anyways just wearing my
ring I found it i'm so happy but um yeah
so that's what i'm wearing my history it
needs to be washed so if it's greasy
don't mind that um now i'll show the
outfit I'm wearing this tribal kind of
sweatshirt thing it's almost so ugly
that it's like pretty um it's just like
sweatshirt material and then it has like
a bunch of cool zigzaggy like tribal
pattern stripes um I'm wearing my jeans
and yeah and the pattern goes to the
back of the sweatshirt thing in its you
like you it's really casual and I really
like it so there's a better look at the
colors for shoes I'm getting with my
