for Halloween which doesn't really have
to do with what I'm wearing I'm not
wearing this for tonight but I kind of
just want to share anyways yes so I'm
being a cheetah and this is my last you
trick-or-treating so yeah I'm pretty sad
about that but yeah it is what it is so
I'm wearing my rings on I did find my
ring this was my this is my favorite
ring it's actually like bull and
vintagey and I lost it and I was like
freaking out and then my foster I ever
found it like three days after I lost it
and I was so happy but I win my rings
and then I'm wearing a new one that I
have on my thumb because it's kind of
big for my other fingers but yeah and
then I'm just wearing two more on this
handsome I'm wearing all my rings my
nails are like it's um Nicole by OPI is
party at 3:00 a.m. and it's like black
with purple glitter in it but you can
barely see the Purple's which is kind of
like an awkward black color but I
thought it was good for Halloween so I'm
going out my nails and now I will show
you my outfit
no hat it's just kind of like this so
can you loose material and it's white it
has like black and topi colored cue
spots and I really like it's better just
win games and that's it it's really
simple but I really like it and I feel
like the top is kind of like a bold
statement so you only need much of
anything else
okay put shoes I'm wearing my combat
boots oh my god
yeah these are from go Jane calm and
they still have them so you guys like
these and you can check on their they're
really comfortable I really like them
and I mean they don't go perfectly with
the top but they have like the taupe in
here I do have shoes that Matt just
talked perfectly but they're like wedges
like boot watches but in like they hurt
my feet because I don't have like
inserts yet so I'm gonna put insights in
them and then I can wear them but for
now I'm just wearing these and yeah so
if you guys like this outfit and happy
Halloween
comment below tell me what you were for
Halloween and keep watching I'm just
wearing these earrings they're really
big and they're kind of like silvery and

really happy but I still really want to
wear them and I really like them all so
I'm going nose um that's pretty much it
for accessories and now I'll show you my
outfit
I didn't want it to be long and then I'm
just running it with some games it's
really simple but it's really cute and
casual but I really like the colors
combined together and the earrings and
everything I just really like it
okay and for shoes I'm wearing my black
Steve Madden slouchy boot things yeah I
haven't won these yet like all fall so

hey guys today's Wednesday and my
outfits kind of like super casual
I had like a skirt and a top picked out
but I really did not feel like wearing a
skirt today I'm just so easy but yes
I'll show you what I'm wearing it's not
like the best or anything but um yeah I
like it
so for accessories I'm just wearing this
necklace not having one forever
I got it in San Francisco and it's
wooden and they carved my name in it in
Chinese and then I'm just doing this
little red heart one yeah so now I will
show you my outfit has like coral and
like dark red stripes in it on the top
of the neckline it's kind of weird I
can't describe it it's kind of like
braided I mean colored jacket thing on
for me over it and it's just like a
button-up and I want over it the sleeves
are actually supposed to be rolled up so
when you roll them down they're kind of
short so you can see the sleeves from
this first wire underneath which I
actually like hey guys face Thursday and
basically my outfit is like extremely
casual I have a lot of tests today like
call one and I'm Jim honestly just did
not want to like I didn't want to like
wearing cute I just want to be
comfortable so yeah
I'm like super casual today like this is
as low as I will go but yeah
so basically I'm just wearing mascara
like the only makeup I'm wearing is
mascara and yeah when I'm wearing like
casual stuff I don't like to really a
lot of makeup so I'm just gonna mascara
yeah so that's anyway and now I'll show
you my outfit alright so I'm really
Stanford sweatshirt and I got this in a
medium because I wanted it to be like
big but thing is like the band if I
bring it down all the way it's too loose
and that like kills me so I just fold
this under so it's like this yeah so
this was a woman's medium and I'm like
tiny so you think I'd get a small but it
was like I'm just like tight like it
wasn't tight but it was like not loosing
Becky's fetch it like I wanted so I
think it's pull this under it's just red
and then it says Stanford it's like
embossed to whatever Stanford University
it has a hood and if you guys don't know
I like wanna go to Stanford so badly
yeah like that's like I don't know I
went to California in the summer and
like I visited the store or I visited
the campus and I got this from the store
so
yeah then I'm just wearing jeans because
if I always got pants I would feel like
a total bum but yeah oh yeah and my hair
is in a ponytail it's kind of very cute
yes I'm going all out with the casual
today I am obsessed with like college
t-shirts and sweatshirts and stuff like
I don't impress like that to school so I
never can wear them but fair today was
the day um but yeah I want to go to
Stanford so badly and I know that point
happens it's so how you get into but um
yeah so now for shoes okay
um I'm wearing my uggs these are the
Great Hall and it's just really weird
I have Great Hall and I have great
chocolate and I got the great chocolate
looking you before about these ones
these are pretty old but um there's the
same size but they're like smaller on me
and I think they might have like changed
the how I made them because they're nice
I wear them taller look really awkward
on me but I can with my chocolate once
when they tall they don't want that
weird so these ones I always keep folded
down so I'm wearing these folded down my
gray yep I don't want it was a lot

of them so I kind of just don't wear
them anymore but obviously same went all
