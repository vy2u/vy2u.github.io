these from my dad's friend he owns a
jewelry store and all the ones I have
were like vintage and he like um gets
them and polishes them up and stuff and
my dad went and he buys like silver from
him and stuff and so what he would fund
to them and he decided to give me this
one ring and it is um it's a hundred
years old over 100 years old he's fixed
it up so it's a good vintage ring and I
love it and it looks like this my camera
is an autofocus you're not going able to
see the details but it looks like an eye
and it has like a bunch of different
like intricate designs and that has a
little diamond in the middle so that's
really nice and then I'm just wearing my
normal ones and yeah he's so nice and um
yes that's why I give my rings um yeah

ruffles on the top and the sweater is
like a really nice kind of it's not wool
but it's like a wool material and it's
goes down right here and it's Navy with
white stripes and then the buttons are
like a nice light brown kind of turtle
chorus color because they're like two
different Browns and then I'm just
wearing this thick or not that kind of
effect braided belt and then I'm just
wearing some jeans and they have a
little hole right here yeah so I will
Twitter and for you and I could also
button this up if I wanted to and also I
could like cinch it what about but I
just like it like this just personally
and I really like it with the Rings I
think they just add like I don't really
keep touch to the outfit and um yeah so
okay for shoes I'm wearing my combat
boots can basically you're going to be
seeing me switching off from like three
pairs of boots this year probably my
riding boots these boots in my uggs my
uggs I'm really getting out of like the
augas they're just so warm that I can't
not wear them it's just like I don't
know like them it's just that everyone
wears them um I went to a powder guy
tonight and someone's on a parachute and
I might include it Hugh but after I say
this but I don't know if I can so much
like a picture of like the place where
we all put our shoes and there was just
like a huge pile of logs like everyone
wears them and um so I'm just kind of
like don't like being like everyone else
I mean just I don't know but I love
these boots anyways and I'm gonna be
wearing these at on along with my riding
boots that I wore yesterday but I
figured I should switch it off today um
so yeah I'm wearing these and you guys
have said you talked about the using my
other up for the weeks so um yeah so
that's what I'm wearing today I hope you
guys enjoy this and um yeah so keep
walking
hey guys so today is Wednesday and I'm
sorry my voice is kind of gone so
amazing but um yeah I'm going to show
you what I'm wearing
first of all the most exciting thing is
pulling my hair I get a waterfall braid
and there's lots of tutorials on it here
on YouTube but if you guys would like to
see me do a tutorial comment below so
this is what it looks like it's like a
French braid but then some pieces fall
and it's really cool so
that's what it looks like and then the
rest of my hair is just straight and
there's some like just in the back there
huh um yeah so I really like that I'm
going to put my pearls in but I'm not
wearing them right now they're actually
like right here but I haven't put them
in yet and yeah so now I will show you
the outfit it's kind of dressy today so
um yeah here we go hey guys so right now
you're probably thinking what's
happening she should be showing us the
outfit but I got home from school this
is after school I wanted to watch the
video that I recorded this morning and
the whole chunk where I was showing you
my outfit get in record so of course
when this is hat with Miss had happened
I had changed out of my outfit was
wearing sweats been taking my hair down
so I just changed back into my outfit
reading my hair um yeah to film this
segment of the video so if my hair looks
different or I look different or
something looks different and that's why
I'm but now I will actually show you the
outfit okay so basically I'm on this
really really pretty tribal dress it has
like royal blue black white and grey in
it but the gray is not super noticeable
as you can see these are the colors I
don't really know how while the lighting
is now since I had to refill this but it
has a nice zipper going up the front and
then it has some like little ruffles at
the top I'm obviously just wearing a
black cardigan over it because it has
really thin straps one I'm not logged
with those to school and second it's
kind of cold today but I really wanted
to wear this dress so it goes down to
about my knees actually but I willed it
up a little bit like I rolled part of it
under just so it wasn't so long because
it makes me look really sure when I were
kind of long dresses
so yeah that's it's just it's pretty
good length I think for school and the
buttons in my cardigan kind of match the
dress they're like grey and yeah I think
it's really really cute here's another
look at the pattern there's a ton of
like intricate designs there's actually
some like animals on it like if you look
close enough like I don't know it's hard
to explain but this is a really great
dress so I really love this
yeah that's what I walk today okay and
fresh shoes I am wearing my black
Oxford's by Steve Madden and if I
couldn't hold them they look like this
and they're like patent leather and
they're so cute and I really like them
with this dress and everything so yeah
that's what I'm wearing and you can kind
of see how they go together and he has
never look at my hair
so once again tell me if you would like
a tutorial on this because I really like
it personally I think it looks really
really cool so I've been trying to do it
for a while and I finally just tried it
last night and it works oh um yeah so I
hope you guys like this and keep
watching for tomorrow
hey guys today is Thursday and I'm gonna
show you my off of the week um basically
I'm running out of outfits I mean I have
a lot of clothes and stuff but I don't
like most of them which I think applies
to a lot of people so basically I'm
gonna go shopping this weekend a lot
because I have four days off I have the
weekend and then I have Monday and
Tuesday off so I'm gonna go shopping and
get some new clothes because I'm kind of
stuck in about here but basically I am
just wearing my rings that I won't
really wanna make - yeah and for
earrings I'm wearing these big wooden
earrings would like kind of a gold
design on them so yeah my shirt this is
getting kind of funny is my mom's old
shirt so basically I'm going to my mom's
closet instead of mine but if this is
all it doesn't fit her anymore and
it's not like a lady style anymore so I
don't know why I like it um and I just
wanted something like with my riding
boots with today so um I think this
matches nicely so now I will show you
what I married okay so basically this
shirt is just kind of like a peasant
style top it's dark blue and that has
some like lighter blue um kind of like
ferns on it I guess it has a little tie
up here so it fits a little his little
loophole and then the one thing I really
like is it has been cuts in the sleeve
which I really like so if you put your
hand on your hip you look like a nice
cotton your sleeve and then it has cuts
in the side too
I just stitched it with this brown belt
because I wanted to wear my riding boots
with it and this matches my boots
perfectly so now I kind of match I'm
wearing some jeggings um yeah I really
like these ones um so yeah that's the
outfit
it's pretty cute and here's a better
look at the pattern the pattern is not
my favorite but it's not bad and I think
the shirts are a huge style so yeah okay
and four she was like I already said I'm
wearing my riding boots here's a better
look at them um you know just a dark
brown leather buckle down here buckle up
here and then a zipper on this side and
these are really really great for me
because they're not too long since my
legs are kind of short okay and I just
fell since my legs are kind of short
lots of riding boots go too high like
they'll go on my knee not above it just
on it so it's like really hard to walk
with these ones are perfect and they go
right under my knee so I love these
that's what I'm wearing today and I hope
you guys like it hey guys so today's
Friday and if you've watched my off of
the weeks for two weeks you know that
every other week need my friend are
doing flannel Friday and I know this one
isn't real flannel but I suppose to me
like 72 a so I'd be kind of hot if it
were actual

and my pearls and then my hair is down
the street and now I will show you the
outfit okay so this is my outfit
basically this I know this flannel is
kind of spring colors but I still really
liked it and it was the only one that
wasn't actual flannel that I have and it
has like maybe teal pink and white in it
and I kind of copped the sleeves up a
little bit and then I'm just wearing
some jean shorts that we have a brown
belt on them yeah and the flannel is
tucked into the shorts yeah I really
like soft it's really cute really casual
and it's really comfortable so yeah I
really like this
excuse a better look at the colors
okay and for shoes I'm wearing my spare
keys these are the navy blue classic and
I'm pretty sure they're called Navy
deerskin so if you really like these
then move all classic Oh something oh my
/ just a classic ones and then they have
they're in the Navy do skin color so
they go with shirt and I love either
like the most comfortable shoes and yeah
