right now and if you guys may not know I
don't really know but I went to New York
City on Saturday and today it's Monday
but my calves hurt so badly and um
indoor track starts today for me I do
track and I'm on I'm doing indoor this
year as well as outdoor and I'm really
nervous because I can barely walk so I'm
gonna look really bad um but anyways
today's outfit is extremely simple but I
really like it it's kind of like edgy I
don't really know maybe not but
basically I'm wearing these earrings I
like some of my favorites they're gold
and then they have like a gold spiked
hanging down and then my hair is half-up
half-down just you can kind of see the
earrings and all that and now I will
show you my outfit so basically all I'm
wearing is just this black and the thing
I like about this is the pocket has a
zipper yeah I like that a lot
and it actually unzips in stuff so that
what this coat I like but it's really
salty and it's such a soft material my
jeans are grey got just great jeans
yes yes so that's the outfit I think
issues kind of make the outfit so this
is so plain but this she was kind of all
done with the whole theme so yeah you'll
see those in a minute okay the shoes I'm
wearing I got in New York City I was
thinking about doing a haul but I
honestly didn't get a lot which I was
kind of surprised that I thought I was
making a ton but I didn't but I got
these black combat boots and you might
know that I wear my brown ones like
constantly so I really wanted black ones
and this is what they look like they
have buckles on the back and then they
lace up and then they have a zipper here
it's fake but then they have the actual
zipper that you use over here so yeah I
worn these and I really liked them with
this outfit so yeah hope you guys like
this and keep watching for tomorrow
hey guys so I cannot tell you how fat I
feel right now um okay so I woke up and
I had track yesterday I was so out of
shape and then we had to run 10k hundred
meters which might not sound that bad
but we could do it constantly and I am
so out of shape so my whole body is like
so sore and then I have face wash my eye
and it was like burning for good like 20
minutes

pearls and no
a little bit and then the sleeves kind
of go down here then they get tight and
yeah and then I'm wearing this bright
kind of peachy coral color
Infinity's fuzz and when I got this I
didn't know whether to say these club I
figured out last night and I was so
happy because I really wanted to sit in
these clubs and yeah and then just

little bit than them and yeah so that's
my outfit it's really casual but it's
really comfy because I need to be
