because they're kind of going to do on a
shirt and I haven't wore these in
forever and me too like my favorite
shoes like I mean you're not the cutest
shoes in the world like I think they
cute but I know they're not like the
cutest shoes but these are the most
comfortable shoes I own because after
you get them and you read them a lot
they kinda like mold to your feet so
these things are awesome these are they
may be to your skin one so if you like
these then that's the type they are and
I really do recommend them is like a
