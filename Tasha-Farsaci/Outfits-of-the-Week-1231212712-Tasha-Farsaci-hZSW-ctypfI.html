hair is half half down and yes so now I
will show you my outfit okay so for my
picture I didn't want to be like too
dressed up but I still wanted to wear
something that I really like so I'm
wearing my favorite shirt of the moment
and it's this royal blue shirt from
Urban Outfitters and I don't know how
all my Claudia is picking this up but it
took the prettiest royal blue color and
then it has lace going all down the
front

clown to it you know oh I'm still trying
to figure out if I like it but you know
