along with it so basically they have
like a triangle top up here that's kind
of big and they have a really long chain
and then at the bottom there are three
little beads and then there's another
silver triangle and I just love these
especially with the shirt I'm wearing

as small as me but so it's really loose
and baggy but it's so long and I really
like it so yeah that's what I'm wearing
and I'll show you in a minute but I'm
going pearls and now I will show you is
the color it has like flecks of color in
it it's great but there's flecks of
color which is really cool so yeah
here's a better look at the colors for
shoes I'm gonna doing my black oxford I
don't have them with me but I'll put a
picture after this sorry I always do
that but yeah so bye guys
hey guys today's Thursday it's kind of
like a Friday for me because tomorrow I
have a half day and it's even shorter
because we have like a bullying assembly
thing at the end of the day so yeah I'm
probably gonna be wearing sweats
tomorrow but today I kind of decided to
dress it up so I'm wearing something
that's a trend that not a lot of people
probably would go for just because it's
kind of like I don't know I really like
it I think it's really cool but some
people it might be out of their comfort
zone but I really like it so yeah just
let me you guys know that I'm wearing my
pearls and my hair is half up half down
so that most of its back here is yeah so
keep watching focus on top it's just
this gray t-shirt it goes down like a
v-neck and it has a nice pocket right
here this is probably like my favorite
shirt and then it has black lace all on
the sleeves and on the back it also has
lace all throughout the back
which is a really cool okay and then for
my skirt I have the shirt tucked into
this black leather skirt it has like two
pockets on the side and then it has a
zipper going down the front it's not
real leather it's full of it but it
really feels like new leather okay my
hips are so awkward like this one goes
out for having this one anyways it has
like a like nice like seen bit here and
then two pockets and then the zipper
that goes down the front then I'm just
wearing some to sheer black tights
because it's really cold out
okay for my shoes I had two options but
I decided to go for these shoes because
I just got them I kinda want to break
them in their just these plain black
patent leather flats these are from
Charlotte Russe I got them like really
cheap so they were the only ones left
and they're coming too small for me but
I really like them and I wanted a pair
of black patent leather so these will
work in until the time being what I can
get probably a pair that's better
but yeah I'm pretty sure I'm gonna wear
these I have another pair that would
look okay with this but I think I'm
gonna go with these so yeah that's what
I'm writing today I really like this
outfit yeah so keep watching for
tomorrow
hey guys so today's Friday I have a half
day today so I'm like really casual like
normally Fridays are kind of casual for
me but today's a half day and it's like
an even faster half day because like I
said yesterday the class is only 15
minutes and then we have like got an
assembly so you know I am going casual
today
yeah but I'm wearing some pearls
obviously because I wear these things
every single day I'm only wearing
mascara no other makeup I mean I have a
little bit of concealer under my eyes
because I look like I always look dead
but I concealing doesn't even work like
I still have dark circles and it's
really annoying so if you guys know a
good concealer that's like somewhat
cheap because I don't need knee
concealer it's not like like I can wake
up and not put on concealer I'll be fine
but I like wearing it just because it
makes me look a little bit more weak so
if you guys have like a good drugstore
concealer let me know down below
as the pocket in the pan it's like this
awkward blue color it's just kind of
like a mix between Oh regular blue one
like a navy blue and then it says little
pink across the front and there's a oh
and yeah all that stuff then I'm wearing
yoga pants I got these on the Black
Friday sale and such they were like 25
bucks and those pieces are pretty plain
but I wanted a pair of plain ones
because they're just black and white
which I really like because all my yoga
pants I have three pairs but three pairs
from pink and they're all black white
and pink so pants
it didn't match so no I can get this one
yeah okay so I'm completely keeping it
casual and I'm wearing my gray togs oh
my god I just whacked myself a face um
once again I roll these down if I didn't
you guys don't know why it is because
when they are tall they look awkward on
me because I am so short so these have
always will down and yeah they're pretty
comfy and I'm going all out with comfy
today because yesterday that skirt was
somewhat tight and it wasn't the
comfiest day of my life
I mean you would always like stick to
the chairs so I'd be like getting up and
be stuck and it was just awkward it was
awkward so yeah that is my outfit for
today um hope you guys somewhat like it
I mean it wasn't my most fashionable but
it's really comfortable so good with me
and hope you guys like this after the
week
