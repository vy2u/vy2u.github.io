i think like everyone did but i am so
tired because i normally don't go to bed
till like two on like breaks and i get
up at like 11 so my sleeping schedule is
way off and i didn't fell asleep to like
one and i was hoping that i was going to
have like a delay a snow day or
something because you're supposed to get
like foot of snow but um you only got
like five inches so yeah oh and my super
in kind of never gets snow days like
every single school around me can have a
snow day and we have nothing but anyways
I'm really really tired just to kind of
showing that up and i'm going to show
you what i'm wearing so my hair's
getting darker so I'm kind of having
some like roots going on but um just
gradual because all this on my hair is
lighter and that's this hair but my
roots or whatever aunt um but my hair is
I've heard it a little closer to the
middle of my head so that's different
i'm wearing my pearls and now i will
show you my outfit ok so on top i win
this trophy kind of oatmeal color
sweater and to improbably wanted it too
large because i like them we make big
but it's really big so i just kind of
rolled up the sleeves
has like a cable that kind of pattern on
it as you can see and it has like hold
on the front so I wore my new pme
underneath then I'm just buying some dog
watch games with my riding boots which
I'll oh they are so comfy and that's
what they look like with the outfit
so that was my outfit for today I hope
you guys like it and keep laughing
hey guys so today's Wednesday I got
called a really fast I'm really late for
school but yeah I'm not wear my pearls I
totally thought but yes and I'll show
you my outfit okay so my hair is half up
half down I've been really liking this
lately it's like my favorite thing to do
and then I'm going this royal blue top
it's really really cute it's really sure
so I have my new cami underneath it but
it's just really roughly it has buttons
that go up the front and then it flows
out at the bottom I'm going this with
dark wash skinny jeans in my black
combat boots
so yeah I gotta go but I hope you guys
like this and keep watching for tomorrow
bye
hey guys so today's um thursday yeah
it's Thursday so I'm dressed in kind of
casual today it's not really cute or
anything but it's totally comfy it's
like super company today so yeah my hair
is up in a ponytail um so yeah it's kind
of different but I really didn't feel
like wearing it down today and i'm
wearing my girls and yes so now i will
show you my outfit ok so on top i'm
going this maroon very kind of colored
crewneck it's pretty big but it's just
like it's a small but i really like
getting sweatshirts and stuff bigger
because they're more comfortable and
it's from pink it's this really really
premium color it was in my whole video
so if you watch that then you saw it but
it just has the black love pink hole on
the side and then the back of it more
painful thing
I'm just wearing some jegging to this
because I wanted to be with really comfy
and then I'm wearing my own boots my
tall gray ones I normally don't put them
up all the way because I think they make
me look really short but I really wanted
to wear them up today so that's what I
did and it's just really really
comfortable that's all I was really
going for them and ask them
flip thousand outfit for today hope you
guys like this and keep watching for
tomorrow
hey guys so at the moment I'm aware of
the quality is not the best that's
because it's on my macbook webcam and
that is because I take a class in school
that we like take videos and film and
stuff and I was using my own camera and
it ended up getting dropped and it broke
so yeah I don't really have a camera at
the moment luckily my birthday's coming
up so I'm asking for like a new camera
even when the better quality so I can
film on that hopefully but for now I
might have to use my parents camera but
this is my webcam and I'm just doing
this really quick so today is Friday
today's flannel Fridays so I wearing a
flannel but first my hair is in a French
braid on the side of my head and then I
just have the braids coming down here
it's not the neatest in the world but
that's okay and then I'm just wearing
this three finger ring with like spikes
on it and now i will show you my outfit
okay so this is my flannel it's black
and navy blue this was been my Christmas
what I got for Christmas video um it's
really cute has two big pockets here it
buttons down and then for shoes I'm
wearing my black combat boots don't mind
