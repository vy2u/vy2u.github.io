think I'm gonna get a Sony Handycam but
I've heard they're not compatible with
iMovie and you have to like reformat
them but let me know if you guys know
anything about that comment down below
but my webcam is it horrible so I'm just
going to show you on that basically I
don't like wearing really nice outfit -
my hair is like nice is that weird I
don't know but I just put my hair in a
braid because I didn't feel like using
heat on it and then I'm wearing the
shape that I wear when I don't wear like
it's not very cute it's just kind of
like average but I wear it all the time
you guys don't understand like you guys
have that kind of shirt where like if
you don't know what way you just throw
it on because this isn't mine but anyway
my hair isn't a braid and then I'm
wearing my pearls and then I'm wearing
the satin taupe all over my lid you're
not gonna even see this because my wife
is right there and my camera quality
sucks but I think it's really pretty
neither like it so now I would say my
outfit okay so this is this shirt it's
this coral and white striped kind of
just like loose and baggy long-sleeve
shirt it's almost kind of cropped I
don't really know but I wear this thing
like all the time and then I'm wearing
some medium watch jeans these don't fall
down and yeah so then for shoes I'm
wearing my Minnetonka moccasins I just
got these the other day and this is what
they look like up close I really like
these and then on my nails is
pandemonium pink by OPI so yeah I hope
you guys like this um sorry I'm gonna
have to use my webcam to rest a week but
yeah bye guys
hey guys so today's Tuesday on my lid
I'm wearing Max tempting it's dark as
well but it's it's more bronzy than
yesterday I'm weighing my pearls and my
nails are still paint ammonium pink with
you might be becoming one of my favorite
colors I really like it my hair is down
and sturdy and yeah now I will show you
my outfit okay so on top I'm wearing
this really really cool color shirt it's
almost I guess seafoam even mean kind of
color this is kind of like a grandma's
top but I really like it
it has like some ruffles at the top and
then it has like a nice little bow when
it buttons down it to crop but I'm still
wearing my new cami underneath it
because it's really sheer so you can't
lace in my stomach but that's okay I'm
and then it gets longer in the back
so yeah I hope you guys like this and
keep watching hey guys today's Wednesday
ok so I have gotten like a lot of new
sweaters recently but for some reason it
seemed like before use like this whole
week ok um you guys do not understand I
live it's usually we probably usually
would have like 4 feet of snow by now
and it would be in like the low 20s or
high teens I know so being in the
forties and having no snow right now is
crazy and like I'm like sweating if I
were sweater so I've been trying to like
dig through my t-shirts but anyways oh
my hair is half-up half-down which I've
been loving anyway so there you go um
I'm wearing my pearls and I'm not
wearing dark eye makeup today I'm just
wearing all that glitters on the lid
believe me I really like it but I'm not
today and yeah so now I must figure my
outfit ok so on top I'm wearing this
pink floral lace shirt and it's just a
t-shirt and it's a really light pink
color I'm wearing my new cami underneath
but don't worry I got another one I have
more than one so I don't want to same
exact one every day because I've won
this already like places week so yeah
I'm wearing this shirt it's really
pretty I wear this all the time and then
I'm wearing some dark wash jeans which I
were like every single day you guys
coming on that but watch it and I know
I'm doing I am so tired right now
um and now for my shoes ok for my shoes
I'm wearing these black lacy flats so
they look like this and then they have
like a patent tip and like a velvety bow
looks like all together and it's pretty
simple so yeah I hope you guys like
today and keep watching for Thursday hey
guys so today's Thursday I'm really more
pretty quickly because I haven't been
able to eat breakfast cuz I've been
doing these videos so I'm gonna try and
go quicker but and with my pearls my
hair
have to pack down again it's getting a
lot darker it doesn't in the winter but
it's not as dark as it was on screen but
he's gonna come on tiger
and yeah I'm not having running jewelry
lately because I take it out class and
we've been doing clay so my hands are
like oh let's see maybe under that but
that's why I haven't been wearing my
rings anything yeah but now I'm shaking
my outfit okay so my office is pretty
simple today I'm just putting this white
sweater and as a cable knit pattern on
the front I got this for Christmas you
might have seen it in my Christmas home
