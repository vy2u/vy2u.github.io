the weeks this week I'm going to start
doing them again
I just stopped for a while because I was
we wearing outfit and I didn't to the
point of showing them twice you know so
I might not do out for the weeks every
single week but I'm going to try to do
them you know as often as I can because
I know you guys like them so yeah I want
to make this one a little quicker
because I go by kind of slow I always
drag them on but um my hair is down and
straight I'm wearing eye shadows to my
naked 2 palette which I love I just got
it yesterday so if you guys want a
tutorial I'm using it let me know on my
nails is for Audrey by China Glaze I
love it and yes so now I would show you
my outfit ok so on top of actually both
I've actually worn both of these things
re this year but I wanted to him again
because this year I want first day of
school and I feel like cardigans are
definitely something you can wear it
often so basically this shirt is just
this brown top it has like purpley roses
on it as you can see and then it has
like this kind of cool dip in the front
like a topi color the background is like
a taupe as well and then it cinches in
at the waist and I don't like kind of
elastic cinches see as you can see there
so I just put this Brown a braided belt
there and then it flares out at the
bottom and then on top of that I just
wore this plum colored cardigan on the
bottom I'm just wearing some dark wash
jeans isn't my favorites
I'm Abercrombie gained two my favorite
and then I'm wearing my moccasins they
look like this so yeah hope you guys
like this and keep watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today's Tuesday oh my god I
am so tired I am like my sleeping
pattern is messed up because I just had
a winter break I might you guys might
not have had it I have a break in
February as well a spring break but yeah
so I'm like and I normally don't quote
about - like - and when I wake up at
like 11:00 so I'm like all my stuff but
yes so anyways my outfit say I kind of
like it I mean yeah so my hair is down
and straight the same as yesterday and
on my lids I'm weighing ydk from my
Naked palette I'm a Naked 2 palette and
I really like it you probably can't tell
because my bright white right here but
yeah sooo now I will show you my outfit
ok so on top I'm wearing this black
long-sleeve t-shirt with a cheetah print
scarf here's a look at the cheetah print
it's actually has like a peach
background and the cheetah print is grey
and white which I thought was like
really cool-looking um instead of just
like your average two different colors
like I said I'm just wearing a black
long-sleeve shirt under this I could
have worn grey but I kind of wanted to
contrast against the scarf on bottom I'm
wearing some kind of medium wash jeans
with my combat boots they're kind of
dirty but I really am way too lazy to
clean them yeah so yeah hope you guys
like this and keep watching
hey guys so today's Wednesday um I'm so
tired no so sick of getting up for
school
but anyways we're here is down half a
path down and it is straight um and yeah
so now I will show you my outfit okay so
on top I'm wearing this annuity pink
blouse and sorry that it's going to be
in my most recent haul video I don't
know if I probably already gonna post it
or if I already did or whatever but
anyways it just has a bow on the front
and a pleat going down but for some
reason the pleats like going diagonally
like I don't know why but yeah so
there's the bow and a pleat and then
it's kind of has a high-low hemline with
cinch sleeves on bottom I'm wearing some
dark wash jeans from seventh all mankind
and my Oxford's
so yeah I hope you guys like this and
keep watching
hey guys so obviously my hair's up today
I never went hair up like this for
school but today I decided to because my
outfit is really really casual um I
always have one catch-all day per week
and normally my casual outfits like
Victoria's Secret pink stuff as you can
probably already tell this because it's
really comfortable but I think it's cute
as well so yeah I would be wearing
pearls but you guys might know that I
accidentally washed them down my shower
drain uh-huh
and I'm getting a new pair soon but the
time being I'm just wearing these kind
of like almost tacky earrings they're
just these like square jewel studs so um
yeah okay just says love pink on the
front in like a neon pink color and it's
really comfortable has a pocket right
here it matches my yoga pants these are
the lugging ones which I don't love just
because they don't fit me that great I
have really tiny legs so that might be
why but behind my knees they're kind of
loose I don't know but I thought these
are a gift so I really still wear them
and as you can see it's the same hot
pink from the sweatshirt and then it
just has cheetah print on the back it
says pink and then it has rhinestones
okay so maybe you can kind of see the
whole neat thing like when I bend my
knee there's like a bunch of extra
fabric here kind of bothers me too but
then you race I'm wearing my uggs
folded down with these I was gonna wear
them up but my legs look longer than
when I fold them down so I did that and
yeah so I hope you guys like this and
keep watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today's Friday I'm aware my
Hill could really look bad I've tidied
your like 50 things with it
and nothing was working so I just put
any like a braid in a ponytail but I'm
probably gonna fix it after this video
I'm just running really late but yeah
and I will show you my outfit okay so on
top I'm wearing this really colorful
print flannel shirt because me and my
friends are doing flannel Friday today
we're gonna wear flannels on Friday and
yeah so this is what the collars look
like they're really really pretty and
they're really bright and fun and I
really like them on bottom I'm wearing
some jeggings from ever coming in Fitch
and I really like them with my Sperrys
this is what they look like the Navy
deerskin kind so yeah hope you guys like
