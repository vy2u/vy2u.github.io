little weeks I only have a four day week
this week so I'm only going to have four
days in this week and then I'm going on
vacation because I have spring break I'm
going to Florida so I'm gonna try and do
some filming there but if I don't have
videos up that's why I'm yeah so anyways
today I'm wearing an outfit that I
really like and I get ready to show you
so I'm my nails is Sally Hansen's
Pacific blue and you guys may know that
royal blue is like my obsession so the
fact that I got this is amazing I heard
about this through Sarah Bell 93 X and I
got it and I'm obsessed of it and it's
amazing it's like super pretty and
opaque so I definitely recommend this if
you like royal blue and stuff yeah so
now I will show you my outfit okay so on
top I mined this shirt but you might
have seen in a haul video a while back
and I didn't know how I would wear this
to school so I waited for kind of chilly
day or I could work hard again because
as you can see it has side cutouts which
I love I'm a huge fan of like side
cutouts and it has like spaghetti steps
so I had to wear like a cardigan over it
but it's just like cheetah print and has
kind of like a sweetheart neckline a
little bit it has a side cut with a
little waste bin and then it flows out
and I absolutely love this it's gonna be
like a staple piece for me for the
summer and spring time and I think it
looks nice for like now as well just
with this black cardigan and yeah I'm
wearing some dark wash jeans I don't
have my shoes on yet but I'm going to
show you what shoes I'm wearing now I'm
just wearing these little fringe sandals
from H&amp;amp;M and they're really cute they
have a little bow with little tassels
and I really like these so I hope you
guys enjoy this and keep watching
hey guys so today's Tuesday my outfits
pretty casual today I think this is
going to be kind of a casual week but
you guys probably still wanted to see it
because you're always requesting these
videos so yeah yeah so I'm not really
wearing any accessories my nails I still
Pacific blue and yeah my hair is done in
straight the end and yeah so now I will
show you my outfit okay so on top I'm
just wearing this flannel shirt
um I probably won't listen out for the
week before but it's one of my favorite
flannels it's just really soft and I
love the colors this is what it looks
like up close it just has these two
pockets and then it goes buttons all the
way down and it's just kind of like a
red navy and white pattern and I really
like it I'm just wearing this medium
wash skinny jeans with my Sperrys they
look like this though the Navy deerskin
a classic kind and I really love them so
yeah yeah so I hope you guys like this
and keep watching
hey guys so today's Wednesday and it's
kind of my Thursday since I don't have
school Friday that makes sense
um and usually on Thursdays I dress
really casual so I kind of slipped it in
as being a Thursday so yeah my outfit is
really casual today um and I hope you
guys don't mind that I mean I still
wanted to do this out for the week video
because I know you guys really like them
but you should know that like I don't
always dress like really nice like today
you know not so much so um yeah I still
wanted to show you guys my hair is still
down and straight and all that so I'm
just wearing mascara today with a little
bit of eye shadow if you care about
seeing that so um yeah that's it and
yeah so I will show you my outfit okay
so if you guys have been watching my
videos for a while you know that I love
winning
Victoria's Secret connects with your
pants it's just about my favorite things
but today it was supposed to be like in
the 50s which I know is probably
freezing for some of you but for me here
it's kind of like moderate so I wore my
cropped yoga pants and these look really
awkward on me like they make me look
super short even shorter than I am but I
still wear them
um and then you sub like a polka dot
band and then they say pink and then
those I'm just wearing this connect but
I probably won't like a bajillion videos
it's just black and it says love pink
and hot pink on it because it matches
these pretty nicely just wearing my old
name beautiful flops with this because
yeah I know they're pretty gross looking
but yeah so yeah I hope you guys kind of
like this and keep watching
hey guys so today's Thursday basically
my Friday
I'm so excited like I'm going to Florida
so soon and yeah so basically my outfit
today I really like it I don't think
everyone will love it just because it's
kind of an interesting print and show
it's kind of like an interesting shape I
ordered it online so I didn't really
know it was going to look like so it's
kind of interesting about I still really
like it
my hair is half a path down I haven't
done this in a while but yeah I forgot
to tell you guys I got new pearls to UM
you guys might know that I was my pearls
like every day but then I like
accidentally washing down my shower
chain so yeah I got new ones and I am
wearing those I just like little ones I
think they're really pretty my new Pacha
stayed on really really well it's been
like four days except for this one nail
but other than that it is staying very
nicely so I definitely recommend this
nail polish but yeah so now I will show
you my outfit okay so this is the shirt
it's basically the snake print shirt and
it has a lot of cool kind of cut out
things it has two triangles here I'm
wearing my nude cami underneath and then
a tie it has some triangles here I mean
you can see my bra strap I'm popping
away this more over the summer where I
can just wear bando under this so I
wouldn't have any straps but there's
another one here another one here and
then it cinches at the bottom which is
kind of annoying
that's what I don't what about this
because I kind of dislike awkwardly
flows out but I still really like it's
still really pretty just flowy shirt and
cinches down the sleeves and it also has
these slits down the sleeves which I
really really like and I think it's
really interesting this is just a really
cool top no witness to Florida and I'm
probably gonna wear just a bando under
it and stuff so yeah and then I'm just
wearing some jeans and I don't know what
shoes I'm wearing yet so sorry I don't
have those but yeah just some dog wash
skinny jeans and yeah so yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this short out of the week
video I kind of a question for you guys
I have been making friendship bracelets
and I know I've told you guys that
before because I showed a few that I was
done in a video and I'm making this one
it's pretty thick you might not be able
to tell and I can do really intricate
bracelets and I was wondering if I've
set up like an eBay account or like an
Etsy or something and I like was telling
these for like five to ten dollars
probably like the more intricate ones
would be more but um
do you guys be interested in buying them
because a lot of you guys are requesting
like me showing you how to do them but
you really need to know like the basics
in order to be able to do these and like
it's kind of hard to like teach the
basics and then teach these because no
one will want to wait so I was kind of
wondering um what you guys would think
but yeah it's pretty thick you can't
really tell but it's a lot bigger than
my finger and um this has 18 strings so
yeah I was just kind of wondering about
that so let me know down below if you
guys would be interested in that and
yeah so yeah okay hope you guys like
this and yeah bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
