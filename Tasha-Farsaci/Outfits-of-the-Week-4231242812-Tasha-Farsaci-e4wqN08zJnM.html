things up but um today is my casual day
I usually have casual days on Thursdays

pink on the button white and then I'm
wearing my gray dogs pulled it down it's
been like snowing here every single day
and it's been like 40 degrees so that's
why I'm just so warm today but yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this outfit I know
it wasn't like really stylish or
anything but um yeah so keep watching
hey guys so you're probably thinking
that I'm gonna say it's Friday but it's
not because I'm really stupid and I
somehow forgot to fill my outfit
yesterday um on Friday today's Saturday
I don't know how so um it wasn't that
special it wasn't really that cute or
anything so I'm going to the mall today
and I decided I would show you guys my
outfit for today and put it in this
video since I forgot yesterday and yeah
um I like my outfit today it's kind of
um daring it's pretty trendy um so yeah
my hair is like natural I just kind of
like put a little bit of gel in it and
this is how I used to wear my hair all
the time and I don't know I don't love
it but I just had to wash my hair so
this is what I did let me know if you
guys like my hair like this um yes so
now I will show you my outfit okay on
top I'm wearing this shirt that I really
all the time
I've worn it in and out for the week
before but I like where I live where all
my clothes in the weekend is on so it's
just royal blue and then it has a little
tie at the bottom which I absolutely
love and it's so comfortable okay so on
bottom this is probably most exciting
thing these are my hot pink pants
they're jeans and they look like this
they actually kind of it's short on me
so I think they're supposed to be an
ankle jeans or something but they are so
cute and I love them with the royal blue
and I just think they're adorable I'm
going to wear my white sandals again
with this outfit I wear them so much but
yeah I don't have them upstairs and you
guys know what they will look like so
yeah I also forgot to say I'm wearing my
pearls I wear these like every day so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this out

comments down below you can come on your
feet outfit also let me know if you like
my hair like this because I'm not really
sure um so yeah I hope you guys like
this once again and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
