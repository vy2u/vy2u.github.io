late so I'm gonna go fast my hands down
the story I'm gonna wear my pearls I
just don't exactly know what they are
but yeah I'm going to wear them and I'm
also missing my shoes but I will be sure
to post a picture of the shoes I'm
wearing after this there like a little
clip or something but yeah so now I will
show you my outfit alright so on top I
win this shirt that I recently got and
it's just like a really extreme high-low
shirt
and it's cheetah print so this is what
the print looks like I'm also wearing a
black lace Bindo under this I don't know
if you can tell it's kind it's pretty
sheer but it's not super sheer so I'm
just wearing the bando
that I don't know if you can see on
camera and then I'm doing something that
I never would have done before I'm
wearing leggings as pants and that is
because this shirt covers my butt my
buttons right here and the sugar goes
down to all the way down here so yeah
I'm wearing this shirt and I thought
leggings would go really well with this
shirt so that's why I wore them and yeah
so yeah like I said before I'm going to
with my white sandals because I kinda to
match the whitish color in here yeah on
my nails by the way is Zoya as Ali it's
really nyan it's not showing off neon
but yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
outfit and keep watching
hey guys today is Tuesday my hair is
half-up half-down I'm just wearing
mascara and a little bit of eye shadow
it's actually a cream eye shadow it's
RSVP by benefit I think um I've just
been like really into just wearing
mascara and not eyeliner recently um I
don't know so that's what I'm doing
today I'm also wearing my pearl earrings
just a little pearls in my outfit today
I really really like it and I don't
think it's gonna be like everyone's
style home but I can get till 18th so
yeah here we go okay so for my shirt I'm
wearing a shirt that I've had recently
in my most recent haul video I will put
a little annotation right here if you
want to go watch that but basically it's
this light pink top and then it has
zebras all over it which is totally
weird but I love it so this is what the
zebras look like they're actually pretty
details and the light pink I just think
it's super adorable on the back it has a
zipper so I will show you that now on
the bottom I'm just putting some black
jeans and I really like them with this I
think they look really nice they kind of
pull the outfit together yeah yeah for
shoes I'm wearing these nude sandals
that they have little bows and then some
little stunts on the bows and yeah these
aren't the best quality at all they're
kind of bad quality but I liked them
with the shirt the nude in the pink
together so yeah yeah so I hope you guys
like this outfit I absolutely love this
here I think it's adorable but yeah so
once again keep watching
hey guys so today is Wednesday I was
trapped meat today and it was to be like
75 to 80 so it's good weather for it so
on my nails is OPI is fanatical huge lot
it's really pretty or fuchsia I don't
know what I'm saying but it's really
pretty and I really like it and it has
like a blue kind of reflex in it and
then my hair is down and straight and
I'm wearing Maybelline Baby Lips and
cheering me on my lips I don't really
know if you can tell but it definitely
is a lot of pigmentation for a lip balm
I can't talk this morning about I really
like that so yeah I'm wearing a dress
like I already said I have a track neat
so I have to dress up and yeah so here
we go okay so my school does have a
dress code it's not very strict but it's
enough that I have to wear at least
straps I can't work strapless and I
can't watch spaghetti straps so I have a
strapless dress on but I really wanted
to wear it so I just put this light blue
tank top under it so the top of the
dress has three ruffles at the top and
then it goes down and simchas with a
little bow tie the dress goes right
above my knees and this would party
shorter on most people I'm just really
really short but I think it's a good
length especially for school it kind of
just flows down and I really really like
the print here's another look at the
print it's just really pretty floral
with a coral and teal and light pink and
stuff for shoes I am going to wear these
white sandals also the ones that I wore
on Monday and yeah I wear these with
everything they're kind of getting beat
up but I still really love them so yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this outfit and
keep watching for tomorrow
hey guys so I just killed an ant on my
floor it was probably the most
disgusting thing in my life like I was
just like smacking a box down on it
because it was one of the big ones and
then it just started like and it was
really disgusting and I'm pretty sure
it's still moving but anyways I'm gonna
get in my outfit um today is Thursday
this week he's going my so slow but
anyways um it's supposed to be like 80
and I really wonder where this tank top
but it's probably not the most
appropriate tank top for school you will
see why so I've tried to level it out
with some long pants so maybe they won't
notice um
and I'm gonna bring an extra shirt to
school in case they like say anything to
me about it but anyways I'm gonna show
you today it's Thursday so you guys
probably know that Thursday it's like my
casual day and all that so um yeah my
hair is up in a ponytail and I actually
do this a lot I'm like obsessed with
this wearing like high ponytails I don't
know I like it um so yeah and then I am
weighing my pearls and I'm just weighing
mascara so that is my like facial region
for today and now I will show you outfit
ok so on top I'm wearing this shirt from
pink and the reason that I didn't really
want to wear it to school I wanted to I
just don't know if the like like it is
because the sleeves go down really low
so I wore my black pin no and it still
goes down kind of low in the bando as
you can see my skin to it there so I'm
gonna try and like hi bad hope they
don't notice um but yeah and I also tied
it right here on the side because it's
actually really long but I'm like here
and I really like the look of tying it
on the side and the back of it has lace
so yeah I think this is super cute and I
got it recently so they still have it in
the store if you're interested on bottom
by morning these yoga pants everything
all the time they have like silver
cheetah on them and then on the but they
say pink and like you know they'll
blinged out and whatever so yeah
there's just the bootcut ones and I
think I'm gonna wear like Old Navy
flip-flops with this and I don't have
upstairs but you guys probably all know
my old lady flip-flop looks like so yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this outfit I
think tomorrow I'm gonna try and fill a
spring fashion video it's been really
hard here because it's been like 40
degrees and I really want to wear like
do it outside and stuff and we're like
tank tops and stuff I don't want to
freeze to death so I'm gonna try and do
it tomorrow so stay tuned for that look
forward to it because that's going to be
really fun video and yeah so keep
watching
hey guys I look really bad today my hair
is just awful like I put in a fishtail
braid in a ponytail and it just look
extremely awkward so yeah I don't mind
that but I'm gonna show you my outfit
because I like my outfit it's just the
rest of me is really awkward so um yeah
here we go okay so for my top I'm
wearing this like floral shirt from
forever 21 it has like heating and
buttons down the front with like a
ruffle and then ruffles on the sleeves
and I think it's just really pretty and
girly and then on bottom I'm wearing
these really cute shorts from forever 21
and they are just like a fake kind of
denim look they're not really denim but
anyways they're high-waisted and then
they tie a little bow and have little
cuffs at the bottom and I think they're
just really really cute and I really
like them with this outfit I don't know
I'm gonna wear for shoes yeah I will
post a little picture clip after this

tell by this so yeah I hope you guys
