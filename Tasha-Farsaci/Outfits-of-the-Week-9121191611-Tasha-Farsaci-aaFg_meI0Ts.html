basically don't mind my hair and makeup
because I forgot to film this in the
beginning of the day so this is
afterschool's all completely done and
obviously it doesn't look as good as it
does in the beginning of the day because
I walked ugly back home like from my bus
stop which is at the top of ice tree and
my bus wouldn't notice we open the whole
time so it's blowing my hair around and
yeah I just got my haircut on Saturday
this today is Monday so it's kind of
like it's not too sure I'll make a video
you'll see it in a little bit cuz I'll
straighten it tomorrow or the next day
or something but it's like to here so
it's not that short but it's a lot
shorter than I'm used to you know so
it's kind of harder to put up into a
bond but um I have it in the bottom with
like a middle part which I don't
normally do just kind of something
different I guess
and yeah so I'm just gonna show you the
earrings I'm wearing first they look
like this they wooden and that they have
like this gold Cadillac design thing and
I'm willing the rings that I wear all
the time just this turquoise one and
opal and then another turquoise one and
yeah so I'll show you the rest of the
outfit right now okay so on top I'm
letting this really cool peacock shirt
and as you can see it had like this
peacock design there's the head and then
it goes into like the body and all like
the feathers and stuff
I'm just doing some skinny jeans and
yeah that shirt is longer in the back
than the front which is kind of like a
try
now and I'll just show you the color is
up close it has a really high neckline
which I actually like yeah okay for
shoes a lot of people don't like wearing
wedges or heels to school but I think
wedges are fine tools I probably won't
even wear but I'm just wearing these
wedges um these were going out for the
day video I did like a few weeks ago and
they're actually not that high because
as you can see there's a little platform
here so really they're only about like
this high which I don't think is that
high and they're really comfortable they
like shape to my foot and they have like
just kind of dark brown leather like
crossing and then there's a zipper in
the back these are from Target
um I don't know if they have them
anymore because this is from one link
this summer there's summer line but um I
know they have very similar ones and
lots of other places I actually saw some
similar ones in Marshalls so if you like
these a lot you can go check check it
out there but it matches the earrings
and yeah so that is my outfit from one
day I'll try to remember to film in the
morning tomorrow so I look a little bit
better but um yeah so stay tuned
hey guys so today's Tuesday and I'm
gonna show you what a Midway so
basically my hair is an another messy
bun because I didn't want to straighten
it and this is all I could think of so
it looks like that and I have my like
two pieces hanging down I'm just wearing
some like little crystal stud things and
I'll show you outfit now okay and then
the cool part of this outfit is probably
the scarf it's like a triangle scope so
you fold it down like this and it has
this really cool tribal pattern with
like gold tassels hanging down
on my nails I'm going for Audrey by
China Glaze if you guys are wondering
okay for shoes I'm wearing my Steve
Madden Oxford's and they're like black
patent leather and they look like this
these are really cute and I really like
them will be happen because they have
some pattern and then that kind of like
reflects on the scarfing stuff so I like
these a lot so that's my outfit um
here's a better look at like the pattern
and my scars and stuff um yeah so that's
what I wore and stay tuned for tomorrow
hey guys so today's Wednesday and
finally I want my gear down so you can
see how short it is um it's not that
short um just because my hair was so
long before it's kind of like a big
difference you know but um as you can
see it goes to like here and it was like
down to here before my belt is so I got
like three inches cut off which I needed
eight my hair is really healthy now and
yeah so today's Wednesday does anyone
else feel like this week is going by
really slow I know when you're watching
this the week will be over but like it's
only Wednesday and it feels like I've
been going to school for like a month
but yeah okay so I'm gonna start off
with my accessories as always I'm
wearing my rings I love the look of like
layered wings and all a bunch of like
big bangs everything is once again this
turquoise one this is my favorite ring
um
this opal then I'm going to on one
finger it's this little black one and
then this turquoise one lots of people
are asking me where I get these and my
dad's friend owns a jewelry store so
these are all the advantage rings and
they've been like from college and stuff
so you can't exactly get the same ones
but yeah and they are wheels so these
are like my baby I love these so yeah
I'm gonna show you my outfit now okay
I'm not sure I my name is really pretty
light blue
peasant top and it has like a paisley
design all over it what I did is I
belted the middle with my like skinny
brown braided belt just because it was
really flowy and I wanted to like cinch
my waist and then it has like really
pretty ruffles in the front as you can
probably tell and it has like a little
loophole in a tie Here I am wearing a
new cami underneath just because it's
really sheer so you can kind of see that
but that's okay and it ties this is the
paddle the better
I'm just wearing some jeggings as you
can see they're definitely more leggings
when jeans these ones but I like them so
the sleeves are really cute they were
like really flowy in the message and
then they also go out a little bit which
is really cool as you can see there
okay first shoes I'm wearing these shoes
from go Jane calm and I was not sent
these I know some people might get sent
stuff from there not sure I don't put me
but I didn't get some fees um these are
really cute the only thing I don't like
is they're not the best quality so
they're ripping up here but I don't care
um they're really cute basically they're
like this sandy color and then they have
some like crossing moping like stretchy
stuff up the front
um I don't know how to describe that and
they have like little tassels at the end
and they're kind of like snake skinny
looking and they have like a little
bitty wedge so it's good cuz I'm only
like 5 1 and yeah I really like these so
I wore these the outfit or I'm going to
wear these would be outfit and yeah
that's what I wore today snow oh I
actually just ordered combat boots uncle
Jang calm so when I get those I'll show
you so um yeah hope he likes like this
um and stay tuned for the rest of the
week

picture day um so when I have picture
day I like to wear things with like
interesting necklines or sleeves because
it's cut down to like how my camera is
right now I hear so that's what I'm
doing basically I just have like a
really really neutral eye on my
eyelashes look really um bold today
because I wanted them to for picture day
obviously so I have like a really really
light shadow on my lid and then lots of
mascara and just my normal eyeliner and
then nothing else I have some concealer
on but other than that nothing really um
so I'm just gonna show you when I'm
wearing really quick it's not much today
very simple but I'll show you guys
anyways okay so I'm wearing this top and
basically this is actually really sheer
but you can't tell because I'm wearing a
new cami underneath I'm not gonna show
you because if that's a cami but yeah
and so it's really cute it's actually a
water just doesn't really make sure but
I liked it oversized and I actually
tucked it in a little bit so it's tucked
into my jeans these are the jeans that I
wore on the first day of school I don't
know about you guys but I really wear my
jeans like all the time so um yeah these
jeans and I really like the details on
this shirt I think that's really nice
especially the stripes on the sleeves

the nice V right here right here is just
straight as you can see
the back is actually just like oh it's
coming untucked the back is just like
kind of got Heather color or an oatmeal
kind of color um but the front is very
silky and Shivani so there's that
okay pretty earrings I'm wearing my
