face and a messy bun again that's what
it looks like use my basic one and some
pieces in the front I'm wearing my pearl

now I'm going to show you what I'm
actually wearing and yeah so here we go
so I'm wearing this really pretty tribal
print top it has a bunch of really nice
fall colors in it actually some of my
favorite colors and I'm wearing of these
dark wash high waisted shorts with a
brown braided belt and he was better
look at the top as you can see it has
some really nice pattern in it and it
goes down to a nice long sleeve and I
had it tucked into the shorts
you know with them this nice little
Browns can you belt that I wrote all the
time so yeah the cool thing about this
outfit is probably my shoes and I'm
gonna share those to you in another way
so I will do that right now
okay so right now I'm in one year and
either when I'm wearing his shoes I'm
wearing these boots but I had like
warmers on both them so as you can see
I'm just going like these dark brown leg
warmers I really like how this looks the
outfit and you can probably see it right
now I think he'll like buckles on the
sides and these are really really cute
so I really like this outfit okay so
yeah those are what I'm wearing for
shoes as you just saw so yeah I really
like this outfit and for my desk food I
probably can wear these to school I know
some people can't but it's fine with
mine so yeah and yeah you already saw
what I'm wearing for shoes but basically
he's a better close up only I'm wearing
like one moves with these obviously and
they're like these suede boots in the
house like some up at the top
and they go down into this they're
really casual these are just from Target
like last year too so yeah I really like
these and I really like them with the
outfit because they're not too warm so
it's really good for this time of year
and yes so I hope you like today and
yeah
hey guys so today's Tuesday of my off of
the weeks and yes I'm going to show you
what I'm wearing
first I'm wearing these earrings I won't
and last week too you squat in and then
they have like gold metallic detailing
which I really like and they're pretty
big but they're not heavy at all so I
really like them then I'm wearing my
rings I always wear plus a new one I got
and always wear always wear always wear
and then this is the new one I got it
has like a really pretty stone it's like
the color of my nails which is um OPI is
meet me on the star ferry in case you
were wondering and then it has some like
darker ones around it and it's really
pretty some I'm wind my rings and now
we'll show you the outfit it's nothing
special but I still really like it so
yeah here we go ok so I'm wearing this
pro cleat and clinic color top and it's
really flowy it has like that kind of
trend that's going on now just like
button up there's a lot longer in the
back so as you can see this one is a lot
longer in the back than it is in the
front it's kind of crap in the front so
I'm wearing this brown with skinny belt
that I will yesterday to and that I
always wear and yeah it's really it's
really nice and then the shirt is has
like a collar up here but I didn't
thought on it all the way and the
sleeves are really nice and I fold it up
and then I'm just wearing the jeggings
jeggings yeah it's pretty casual but I
really like it
okay push shoes I'm wearing these shoes
I would these last week - and these um
sandals by go Jane calm in the action
five bamboo but I got him on go Jane and
they're like the snakeskin material and
then they have lacing up the front with
a little bow and then at the end of the
bill they have like little tassels as
you can see and then there's a little
wedge and zipper in the back and I
really like these but like I said in
other videos that I did um I don't like
them because like I'm the best quality
and they do lip in the front a little
bit but these are still really cute and
I really like them and I like them with
the outfit a lot so yeah that's what I'm
wearing today and not the best outfit in
the world but um I was just too lazy to
think of anything else but um yes so I
hope you guys like this and keep
watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today's Wednesday and thank
God it's like almost halfway over the
week Friday I have a half day so I'm
technically counting today is Thursday
but yeah my Friday outfit isn't gonna be
that great just because it's a half dice
but I'm trying to make up with it with
this often because it's kind of dressy
so my hair is half-up half-down again
just because I don't know and then I'm
wearing my pearls I'm always like
everyday unless I want to wear like
statement earrings like I did yesterday
but yeah I'm just wearing these and now
I will show you when I'm wearing outfit
wise okay so I'm pretty much just
wearing this jean jacket over this dress
and this dress has a really nice floral
pattern the sleeves are actually really
long ago down here that may like fell
out but I kind of just tucked them up so
you couldn't see them under the cup jean
jacket and if basically it's just this
really pretty paisley print I did have
about here but it was a weird place to
cinch so it kind of just kept falling so
I took that off but normally I would
more about there if it was you know
easier but basically this is just a
print it's just a really pretty floral
pattern and this dress actually came
with a slip so I'm wearing the slip
underneath and it goes down to out here
which i think is a good line through
school because it's not too long but
it's perfect it's not like too short
enough to hear anything
so I think this is the perfect length
once again I just cost the jean jacket I
think that gives it kind of a cute
laid-back look and yeah so
okay and for shoes I'm just wearing
these flip-flops with like purple
braiding and it goes with the football
and the dress yeah so that's what I'm
wearing it I kind of for other casual
things make the dress more casual
because I know a lot of people you know
me included sometimes think that it's
kind of dressy to wear dresses to school
but definitely by wearing like a denim
jacket and then wearing like casual
flip-flops really dress it down whereas
if I didn't wear the jacket and I were
like I don't know do something it would
look probably best year so yeah that's
what I wore today and Wow okay so keep
watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today is Thursday which I'm
really happy about because this week's
actually kind of going by fast last week
was like really slow
yeah it's Thursday so I'm kind of happy
I like Thursdays and yes so today my
outfits kind of simple once again but
yesterday it was kind of dressy so I
kind of want to just wear something
simpler so basically we're on the perils
I'm wearing the Rings the same ones that
I wore two days ago this big turquoise
one opal southern boys wanted on this
other new random one I got Oh
so before I start out for the day I was
just looking online and I really want
the Tom's only I want them to crocheted
ones and I don't think they make them
anymore so if any of you guys know where
I can get those other than like eBay or
something let me know because I really
want those okay so now I'm going this
death video and I'm gonna show you what
I'm wearing for the outfit right now
okay for my top I'm going really really
cute flowy kind of world print top thing
it has this really nice swirl print and
it has a lot of details on it first of
all it has like this ruffle going down
the front and it's not just a ruffle it
has pleading right here and then it has
buttons which I don't know if you'll be
able to see but there's pleading right
here and there's my full on either side
and then there's buttons little curly
lookin buttons that go down the front
which i think is it so good really cute
detail then I also love the sleeves on
the top there so like lo Ian
thank i'm see I gotta see the site and
you can see it right here and they're
really really pretty there it's like
cinches the bottom so that it's kind of
like yes since she's at the bottom and
it's just a really really cute and I
think that it's super girly and it
describes me like perfectly then I'm
wearing some dark skinny jeans like
always and yeah it's basically a kind of
a simple outfit but I really like the
top and yeah okay I totally forgot to
tell you but my necklace I'm also just
wearing my necklace that I got in San
Francisco that says my name in Chinese
and it's on like wood and for shoes I'm
going to wear the shoes I wore these
another time this week and what's wrong
with me um they're these go Jane sandals
with a little wedge yeah I like them
with the shirt
I'm really cute and I like in the outfit
and they're really comfortable my mom
wears them which is really weird
that's my outfit for today
hey guys so today's Friday and I have a
half day today so basically I go to all
my classes but they're cut in half so
instead of link all being like 40
minutes like they are now they're all
like 20 minutes so yeah I'm half gay um
old week me and my friends were going to
do like a flannel day which you know
with plaid shirts and it was going to be
like hot or we didn't get around to it
and my friends had like games of sports
they had no jerseys and we finally
decided we would do it today so I'm
wearing a flannel and my new favorite
boots that I ordered online so I will
show you those but they're kind of hard
to take off so I'll probably just
shaving them you like I did on Monday
here's my hair basically I just took
like a Dutch braid starting over here
and going to the back of my head and
then put it into a ponytail just because
my hair really needs to be like I don't
know it's not the best today I didn't
feel like doing much to it because it's
a half day so yeah that's all I did and
I guess I liked it a little piece here
so you know nothing special that I'm
just wearing my pearls and now I'll show
you the outfit
okay so I'm just wearing this flannel
shirt blue and it's really cute it kind
of has some like grey and the buttons
are brown which match my boots that's
cool except it's not too tight it's
actually pretty loose which I like and I
really like it it's like the perfect
length and everything yeah rolling
flannels so I decided I'm just
some dark skinny jeans in my boots
combat boots so I guess I will show you
those in the mirror right now okay so
these are my shoes as you can see
they're brown combat boots and I really
really love these they look really nice
with the outfit just because I kind of
add a cute touch I think I really like
them personally so yeah it's the outfit
okay here's a look of the shoes close it
up and I actually posted a picture these
on my Facebook page so if you haven't
liked it like it already I'll put it
down below but basically I just like
this brown cog neck color and they're
not real loving because I bought a lot
of their riding boots too and I'd rather
have those have real leather and spend
money on them than these um so yeah
these are from go Jane calm and I bought
them with my own money and basically
they have like shielding on the inside
so they're really warm and yeah I really
like them I think they're super cute and
you just lace them up the only thing
that I don't like about it is that
there's like no zippers so you do have
to lace them up and they're really hard
to get off that way but um I really like
these and they're really comfortable I
was in last night so yeah I really like
these and these are the shoes that I
would this outfit so you can see maybe
how they go that little button but maybe
yeah
yeah so it wasn't a huge I wore today is
Friday um I got and I hope you guys like
this out for the week tell me if you
want more of these and also tell me what
your favorite outfit was this week and
the only awesome so yeah I love you guys
