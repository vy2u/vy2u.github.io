the week this week and basically pretty
much every Monday I think I'd have a
messy bow and I have like a hairy
schedule that's yeah some have a messy
bun in my hair that's what it looks like
I've had tutorial on this and I will
annotate it right here so if you want to
go check out how to do this but it's
right here but now I will show you what
I'm wearing so today is supposed to be
like a teeny one so it's gonna be hot
which is weird September but I'm just
wearing my pearls and normal makeup and
kind of short so I'm wearing like
spandex underneath yeah I have this
snake skin kind of belt with it um this
is the pattern
I think it's really cute
okay and for shoes I'm just wearing my
black Oxford's by Steve Madden and these
give me really bad blisters but I'm
hoping I can break them in so yeah these
are really cute and they kind of go with
my belt they're both black patent
leather and yeah so they look like this
I'm so cute I love them so um that's
what I'm wearing today sorry was going
kind of quick I'm kind of running late
so yeah and keep watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today is Tuesday and yeah
I'm gonna show you I'm gonna wear it
it's been really hot you see like 80
something again today I really didn't
feel like going at Hank up in Schwartz
um I don't know I just wanted to wear
something a little more on top so yeah
I'll show you what I'm wearing in a
minute but first I'm just wearing my
pearls like always um and then they have
a little bit of a dark blue it on it
some Max tempting all the way and I just
have like a matte kind of creamy colored
highlight on my brow I mean that's all
mine so now I will show you yes it okay
so crochet tops are a big trend for the
fall and winter so basically that's what
I'm just wearing I'm wearing a crochet
top hop over a new cami but you can't
lacy but I'm wearing a new cami I just
interested it with a dark brown belt
yeah I think that adds like a nice touch
and then I'm just waiting jean shorts I
know they're kind of short but my school
doesn't really they're not too strict on
that so these are so comfortable I wear
them all the time especially doing this
summer so they're really wanted and
they're so comfortable so I'm just
wearing these on
and I really like this as you can see it
kind of has like a flow kind of thing
going on and then it goes down and to
just circles um and that's a better look
this was actually my mom's and it was
like a tank top underneath it built in
but I cut that out because there were
just strings attaching it so it's still
fine I could still wear it but I liked
it better than how it looked this way so
yeah okay and for shoes I'm wearing my
combat boots
I would these last week once um and I
love them and I really think they will
go go to the belt so I just really like
how it kind of like engies up the outfit
because this is so like girly and the
knee is really kind of like just make it
more edgy and the good thing about these
is if you want to get different look
with them so I really like this outfit
today tell me what you think and keep
watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today is Wednesday and yeah
I don't really know it's supposed to be
like 75 but it's most arranged so I
won't games and a tank top kind of like
to balance each other out so yeah but
I'm gonna start off with jewelry I'm
just wearing my pearls big surprise um
and then this week I'm wearing my rings
for the first time it's kind of really
actually where I'm like everyday but you
guys know what they look like just like
that my nails is vintage blue by Avon in
case you guys were wondering so if you
have like an Avon representative near
you I'd definitely recommend a nail
polish because I put this on Sunday it
has some chipped at all
so that's really cool and now I will
show you the outfit I'm wearing
okay this top is really cool it's
actually kind of long so I tucked it
under another tank up
that's why I might look kind of funky
but basically it's it's really sheer
gray color and then it has a bunch of
different like tribal patterns um kind
of like Soudan um all the way down and
they're really pretty colors it's like
orange painting like cream and it's all
the way down the top and then it goes
down to the kind of v-neck which is
really cool I have it over this other
time top because I can't wear such thin
straps to school but I can wear like
this thick of straps so that's good um
just bring some dark canes and yeah so
that's what I'm wearing nothing special
I just haven't talked into the other
tank top because it's like goes down
like here yeah
okay for shoes I'm wearing the same
shoes yesterday wearing my combat boots
like these are I'm obsessed with these
my riding boots came yesterday and I
love them but I feel like those I'm more
fall fall boots and these are kind of
just they're still fall boots but I feel
like the more transition you know the
effort I don't know but I love these so
much so I'm wearing these with the
outfit and yeah so that's my outfit
today um I think I'm gonna feel my hair
tutorial later so that might go off
later today
well Wednesday you're gonna be watching
this probably Saturday but yeah anyway
so that was today and keep watching hey
guys today's Thursday I'm so happy it's
dancing because I love Thursdays um just
because well Project Runway is on
Thursdays and that's my favorite show
and then I don't know I just like
Thursdays so um today I'm like an outfit
that some of you might not like and it's
not because it's ugly it's just because
it's um something that is kind of out
there people I'm someone who loves
stripes
I love stripes um and most people can do
stripes they like stripes like in you
know other colors other than black and
white I'm someone who loves
black-and-white stripes in the eye kind
of bold and out there especially has
this piece but um basically I love black
and white I love stripes and I love bows
those stripes and lace I'm pretty much
my favorite things and there's no lace
in this but there is a bow and they're
stripes and black and white stripes so
it's pretty awesome but yeah so I just
wanna let you guys know that this might
not be your favorite it might be a
little out there but I love it so I'm
just wearing pearls like always um
my hair's straight still after three
days yeah so there's a funny story
behind this skirt basically when I was
in California if you guys know I'm you
may or may not know I was in California
over the summer for two weeks and I went
into
love culture I think and there was a
skirt and I wanted it so bad
but I only had luggages and I'm a small
so that didn't exactly work out and I
was so mad because I loved it
so then like a month ago I was looking
online and it was these certain shoes
that I wanted and this website had them
and the shipping was like outrageous and
the only way that I could get free
shipping is if I spent $50 and you know
the shoes plus the shipping was close to
50 gallons so I figured okay I'll just
like five few more things so I was
looking on the website and they had the
skirt and they had it in a small so I
was so excited and that's how I got it
so I'm gonna show you that right now
okay guys this is the skirt I hope you
can see all right
basically it's black and white stripes
obviously and then it has this awesome
bow at the top that kind of just like I
love it it just brings the whole thing
together and the vertical stripes make
me look taller and by putting it at a
high waist it makes my legs look really
long
thank you probably you can't see my legs
but they look really long so it's
awesome because I'm 5 1 which of on you
guys have a hard time believing that but
I'm 5 foot 1 and it's because like if
you look at me like you're doing my
videos I'm like proportionate we'd look
tall but I really not so then I'm just
putting this loose kind of baggy off the
shoulder black top um I don't know I
wanted one of these colors and I just
wanted long sleeves because it's really
cold out almost like it's like 70 but
it's raining like really hard so I
wanted long sleeves and I really like
this it's only casual it kind of like
Hannibal's down the crazy skirt but yeah
I love this it's so cute and it's like
the perfect length I think from school
because it's not too short and you can't
see my bra or anything but yeah I love
this
okay push shoes I really wanted
something that would match this outfit
and I was gonna with my black Oxford's
that I weren't really in the week but
give me blisters so bad I just wanted
something that was comfortable so I'm
wearing my mom's shoes today and
normally my mom her shoes I love my
mom's shoes I like you know and my
people get older they always pick off
those shoes that are like six sandals
they have like a clunky like rubber
thing and bottoms like my mom goes for
that kind of stuff so um she has these
and they're not my favorite but they're
not bad they match the outfit really
nicely so I don't really know why
they're fun but they were really
comfortable like they were one of the
most comfortable flats ever one but
basically they're white like hat and
rather than wait all others not been
divided that that might be target I
don't know you know and then they have
like black rooming around them a black
stripe on the back and then like black
material tops I think if this wasn't
material this was like patent leather or
something I'd like these a lot more but
they're not bad and they go like really
perfectly with the outfit and it's
really good all together so that's what
I'm doing today I know it's kind of out
there for some people I love it
and yes so I hope you guys have a great
Thursday or had agree at Thursday when
you're watching this and um keep
watching for Friday's
hey guys so obviously I'm very casual
today basically I decided to do a casual
Friday that's all I can say I never do
this
I made me dress like in sweats once
every two months maybe once a month
depends in the winter I do more than
like now but um me and my friend was but
we're gonna have a yoga pant Friday the
last week we had a flannel Friday and
today we're wearing yoga pants and I
woke up and of course my time of the
month decided to come today so if I have
underwear lines or you know just don't
mind it um basically I've just gone all
out casual my hair's up I have like this
thick black headband going on I'm still
wearing my pearls um and then I'm just
wearing mascara there's nothing else
nothing but mascara on my top and bottom
because yeah I just don't feel like
dealing with anything else so I guess
I'll show you what I'm wearing it's not
you know very cute but yeah so here we
go okay so basically I'm wearing this
hot pink sweatshirt all the stuffs from
pink like Victoria's Secret Pink Zone

sweatshirt from pink and it says love
pink in black
and I'm just wearing some yoga pants I
didn't finally wear these um basically
my tea I got these for me like last use

wear them without just like having to
wear something so and they're these
