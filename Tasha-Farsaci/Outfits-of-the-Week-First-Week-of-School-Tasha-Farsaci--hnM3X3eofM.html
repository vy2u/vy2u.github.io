school and you guys know what that means
I'm gonna be showing you my outfit and
I'm also doing it for this whole first
week of school but today is actually one
day so I only have three days of school
this week so there's only gonna be three
outfits but I figured I still do this
because you guys love my out for the
week's you guys kind of know me for them
so I decided you know I had to do the
first week of school so actually I did
this first day of school out for the day
last year and I was looking back and I
actually want something really similar
which is really weird because my style
has changed so much but on the first day
of school I tend to wear things that are
pretty casual just because I don't want
to look like I'm trying really hard like
normally like on regular school days I
will wear dresses and stuff but on the
first day of school I just don't want to
because I feel like people are gonna be
like oh my god what I heard she's trying
so hard I like oh my god I'm wearing
something casual alright so on top I'm
just wearing this like topi kind of
brown tank top I've showed this in my
back to school haul video so if you
watched that you've probably seen it and
I mean it's a little big on me I had to
get the size bigger because they didn't
have any more but it just has this
really pretty kind of lace ruffling with
buttons and stuff and I got my nails
done yesterday
it's SC's lilac ism but um yeah and then
it just kind of cinches here and flows
out which i think is really pretty I'm
also wearing these earrings that I
showed in that haul video the kind of
way my ear down as you can see but
they're really really pretty and I
really like them
I feel like they kind of add a little
bit more to this outfit since it's kind
of boring and then I'm just wearing my
second whole piercing and then for gray
slits I'm wearing this brown one from
Bernie Melville this cross one from
brandy melville this braided one from
Florida somewhere this one from New York
City and this one from New York City so
yeah my favorites
once again in the haul video and I'm
just wearing my Brown sandals with these
that you guys all call Jesus sandals but
you kind of hate but uh they're my only
brown sandals guys so uh yeah those are
what I'm wearing if you guys haven't
noticed my hair it's just down and
straight but yeah that's what I'm
wearing today once again it's really
casual you know but I just wanted to
wear something casual today so if you
want to see what I wore in the first day
of school last year I'll put a little
link right here and if you're on your
iPhone or iPod you're not gonna be able
to see this uh-huh
pop-up because a lot of people are
always like oh my god you didn't put the
link but I always do it's just if you're
on your iPod or whatever you can't see
it so yeah that was today and keep
watching for tomorrow
hey guys so today's Tuesday my second
day of school owner on Tuesday Thursday
just kidding um so it's twist Weebly
holiday so I wore shorts and a tank top
because it's so hot in school yeah but I
think I made it appropriate for school
it's normally a shirt that wouldn't be
but high-waisted shorts help me fix that
so anyways I'm just gonna start off with
jewelry I'm wearing my favorite ring
that I haven't wound for ever but I love
this ring all of these are from my dad's
friends jewelry store so I don't know
what you can get them but um then these
too so yeah my nails is icees lilac ism
and I'm just wearing my pearls and then
my little diamond thing so yeah now I
will show you my outfit
okay so first on top I'm winning this
crocheted crop top and as you can see I
have high-waisted shorts so it's not
really that cropped for school but it's
really really cute it has like this
embroidery in the front with like a tie
and I think it's adorable so I love this
top I just put it with these maroon
corduroy high-waisted shorts and I love
these colors together and rooms like my
favorite color for fall and stuff so
that's these and these are from forever
21 so they're really affordable and I
love them
my shoes I'm wearing my black combat
boots I love these with this outfit I
love her in combat go to the Schwartz

outfit for this week I'm supposed to be
really really hot again today it will be
like 86 so I'm going shorts and a
t-shirt a guy really one of my fall
clothes but yeah so first of all I'm
just wearing the same earrings as I
pretty much always wear my pearls and my
little diamond things um one of these
little twisty ties cuz I like using
these as hair ties and then my hair is
just half-up half-down so now I will
show you my outfit okay first of all on
top I'm just wearing this lace kind of
t-shirt I wear this all the time so
you've probably seen it before
underneath I'm wearing a nude cami

need to buy one but yeah that's what
that looks like and then I'm just
wearing this floral scarf that is
actually my mom's but I've stole it from
her so yeah that's what this looks like
then for bottoms I'm just wearing some
dark wash jeans shorts they look like
this and then I just have a brown
braided belt line and then you can see
