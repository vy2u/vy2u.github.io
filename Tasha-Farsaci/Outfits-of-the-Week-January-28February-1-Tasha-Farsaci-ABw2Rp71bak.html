that i'm from mamas if until I feel it
i'ma smoke until it's done I don't
really give a my excuse is that
I'm young and I'm getting somebody shut
up
 it
Sarge
 it am I
you
you
all I care about
No
I love the one cloud but everybody and
all my niggas gotta eat I feel like that
Riley yes too much money and enough
money you know the fans listening nigga
what money I'm a made nigga I should
just something you lick it on the bench
like a bus coming what a mess ebooks
pitch some folks might as well say
cheese footage all i care about is money
and a city I don't know
bye guys I'm very upset about this delay
issue because stupid so now it's
basically like a half day I'm just have
shortened periods I think but I don't
have to take my trig test I don't think
because this unit was logs and natural
logs which was so hard and I'm good at
trig and it was hard and my TAS is
supposed to be today so maybe I'm lucky
probably not they'll probably still end
up taking it or something annoying yeah
so if you got a snow day today I hate
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
