didn't do enough for the week this week
just because I only had three days of
school and one of the days was spirit
days so I just wore like my school name
I'm not sure I'm going to it's tomorrow
but I just decided not to do it out for
the week video and today I actually had
a really cute outfit yesterday of mine
was boring but today I have a key one so
I wanted to kind of throw it into a
video somewhere I think I'm gonna add
this into my next out for the week so

more things come in the mail so this and
the shirt will be in it but yeah and
then on my nails is China Glaze devotion
I think okay so on top I'm just wearing
this olive green t-shirt with a pocket

looking I'm wearing it with that
necklace that I showed you earlier and

with some green in the foil that matches
the show perfectly I'm just wearing my
rainbow flip-flops with this and that's
the outfit

afternoon again because I didn't have
time to fill my outfit this morning so

my hair is just down and straight today
I'm just wearing a twisty tie on my
wrist I got this from a subscribers Etsy

these and I'm just wearing my regular
earrings and my little heart necklace

brandy melville I cut the sleeves a
little bit and then I'm just wearing
some leggings and the sweater does cover
my bought you can't really tell but it
does and then I'm wearing my riding
boots with some leg warmers and I think
this offer is really cute and comfy
especially for the Fall

half-up half-down I'm wearing my same
earrings as always and really no jewelry
so I'm my nails I forgot to tell you
yesterday is OPI is my private jet I

pretty so yeah okay the first thing I'm
wearing is this really pretty tribal
scarf that hasn't open it that matches
my cardigan and then I'm wearing it with
some black jeans and my combat boots

combat boots ever
I really recommend them but I really
like this outfit once again I'm really
cute football and I hope you guys like
it too hey guys today's Wednesday it's
supposed to be a little warmer today
like 65 which I know is probably
freezing too a lot of you but it's
actually kind of warm for this time of
year right now so I went shorts but I'm
also wearing a sweater so I kind of
balanced it out but my hair is on
ponytail and I'm just wearing my normal
earrings and now I will show you my
outfit okay so I just tied my sweater up
here once again I did move it lower
later in the day and I cocked my sleeves
and then I'm wearing these other shorts
that are kind of short I know they might
not be appropriate for some schools but
my school doesn't really care then I'm
wearing my black combat boots again and
I really like this alpha it's kind of
edgy which I like
hey guys today's Thursday today my hair
I just took a shower and I kind of like
scrunched it up so let me know if you
like it because it's really easy to do
and it doesn't involve heat so if you
like it let me know and I'll whip more
often but everything that I'm wearing
today is from brandy melville I know
kind of bad but yeah everything I'm
wearing is from there except for my
shoes they're from American Eagle so
yeah now I'm gonna get right into the
outfit okay so I'm wearing this kind of
grey and maroon pattern sweater from
brandy melville and it has a really cute
pocket in the front and it's kind of
cropped which you can't really tell but
it is and then I'm just wearing it with
a maxi skirt also from brandy melville

love this outfit I think it's really a
casual kind of cute guys Friday I know I
look extremely bad right now we don't

my hair looks so bad this is been in
since like 6 o'clock this morning let's
just leave it that and my makeups like
all half off because I fell asleep and

it's not very fashionable um but I'm
here throwing it because I just decided
to I didn't want to leave you guys
hanging you guys obviously want to see
this oh yeah but Fridays are a lot of
the times my casual days and since my
outfit was pretty dressy kind of
yesterday I decided I would you know

shoes up here um but I want my rainbow
flip-flops you guys probably know what
those look like because I wear them like
every single day but yeah I don't look
at my hair or my face right now my just
one mascara today that's all the makeup
I'm wearing right now and it's probably
half off because I slept on it this ho
