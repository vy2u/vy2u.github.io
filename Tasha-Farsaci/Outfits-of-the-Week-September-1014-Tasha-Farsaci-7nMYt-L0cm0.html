I'm such a loser I was going through my
videos on my camera just deleting old
ones and I accidentally deleted my
outfit from Monday I'm so stupid but
have no fear I refilmed it because it
was kind of cute I kind of liked it and
I wanted to pull off for the week I
didn't just want for days so that's why
I'm not looking my best okay my hair
right now I just slept on her wet so
it's just kind of crazy but still want
to film this video or this little clip
thing so I'm going to show you what I
wore in Monday here we go okay for my
shirt I wore this shirt that I wear all
the time you guys have probably seen it
in videos before but it's basically this
peacock tank top so yeah this has this
peacock on it with like green and red
and yellow and purple feathers and it's
really really long so I tied the side I
have a lot of people when I'm writing my
shirts saying oh my god but in your
I hate seeing those great video you said
you hate people tie their shirts but I
was talking about what a hair tie not a
little knot I love tying shirts or not
so yeah I just tied it in a knot on this
side I really love how that kind of
makes an outfit look okay and that's my
pants I don't know if you can tell but
they're actually dark purple pants these
were in my last haul video if you
haven't seen it I'll put a little link
right here but yeah they're like a dark
plummy purple color and they match the
feathers in the top so I just thought
they went really nicely with this and
then for my shoes I'm just wearing my
black combat boots by Steve Madden these
are like my favorite shoes for the Fall
I am obsessed with them and I really
like them with this outfit
hey guys today is Tuesday and picture
day for me I take terrible pictures so
wish me luck um excuse me my braces bum
yeah I don't know what if you're
wondering I get my braces off well I'd
only know for sure but they told me two
years when I got them on and it's two
years in March so I don't know kind of
soon at least I'll get him off this
school year but yeah so my hair is just
down and straight I filmed it getting
ready routine on my makeup so stay tuned
for that video coming up and yeah so now
I'll show you my outfit
okay I'm Todd I'm actually wearing this
shirt that I wore my first day of school
last year my school this year the high
school has a very lenient dress code so
I can wear spaghetti straps and stuff I
know I'm super lucky but yeah they don't
really care what you wear
so anyways I'm wearing this tank top and
if you haven't seen it before it's just
brown it kind of has like these hooks
right here
and then just like another kind of
taupey brown detail thingy up here I
don't know you know it cinches it the
waist without a belt but I don't like
how that looks so I always put my brown
belt with it and I just kind of tied it
like this so yeah I don't know I really
like how this looks and I like the
neckline so I think this would be great
for pictures I'm just wearing some kind
of medium ish dark wash skinny jeans
from ever combi kids and I'm wearing my
purple braided sandals because they
write to the flowers in the shirt
hey guys so today's Wednesday I feel
like this week is going by really slow
I'm in a really awkward crouching
slouching position Narine how much so it
kind of hurts so I'm just gonna get
right into my outfit for my earrings I'm
wearing what I always wear I'm wearing
my second hole piercing with a little
diamond and then my pearl for my first
hole okay this really loose and baggy
chiffon snake print shirt and this shirt
is a really interesting so on the
sleeves it has cutouts right there on
both sleeves obviously and then it has
triangle cutouts right here and then
down the back it has a one big triangle
cut out oh you're not gonna be able to
see that and it's just really pretty and
really intricate and then it kind of
sent you down here but I just tucked it
into these high-waisted black shorts but
you just a better look at the print I
love snake prints so much and I really
want a good pair of snake print jeans so
if you know how to get a pair and it's
like under $40 let me know yeah I just
like pairing it with these shorts
because these shorts are super
comfortable and they go with the shirt
don't mind my maxi boom this is really
ugly but it's just sitting here right
now so don't worry about it and all that
crap over there but anyways I'm just
wearing these black sandals I think
they're really like you and I really
like them a lot and they're really nice
LA the reviews are from Urban Outfitters
and yeah
hey guys today is Thursday sorry if this
is a really weird angle right now my
camera's above me but I was just way too
lazy move my tripod down so I just
tilted it I don't know if it looks weird
but anyways today is Thursday finally
this week is almost over it's been going
on forever about once again my outfit is
kind of like probably not good for most
schools but my schools dress code now
since I'm in the new school think they
don't care at all so honestly I'm pretty
pumped about that um so yeah first of
all my hair is this half packed down
I've been doing this like every single
day I just like how it looks plus my
hairs on my face in class so I don't
have been put up in a ponytail because
whenever I just wear my hair down
without it like cooked in the back I
always put it up in a ponytail because
it always goes in my face and then I get
a dent in my hair and it's just annoying
so yeah it's have a cap down and then
I'm just wearing my regular earrings
like always and yeah so yeah I'm
thinking of getting my ends tapered out
because my hair is pretty thick so it's
just down not what it's like half up
when it's just down it kind of looks
like homage at the end so if I got them
tapered out I feel like maybe it
wouldn't look that bad let me know the
water layer is but I don't know if I
really want to get layers but yeah if
you guys know if that would work let me
know but anyways that's off topic and
now I will show you my outfit okay so
this shirt is actually like one of my
favorite shirts I own I always wear it
ever all the time and it's just like
this kind of light pinky champagne shirt
it's like silky and then it has ruffles
on the front and then a little cinch and
it flares out and I love this obviously
there are the ties on the shoulders are
kind of annoying but you know whatever
it has ties there and I just love this
tank top I wear it so much and I think
it's really pretty
and it's kind of Jesse so if you wear it
with like jeans or something it kind of
just balances out and I really really
like it it's supposed to be kind of hot
today like 85 I know some of you guys
are like oh my god I don't I live in
like Texas it's like 95 you shouldn't be
complaining but that's hot for here in
New York so yeah I'm just wearing these
dark wash jeans shorts which I know are
probably too
for some schools but once again my
schools don't like hair and this brown
braided belts that I were pretty much
every single day so yeah and then for
shoes I'm just going my rainbows these
are the narrow strap dark brown ones if
you're interested and I'm obsessed with
these these are the most comfortable
flip-flops in the world
hey guys so today is Friday thank the
heavens seriously
this week has been so long but yeah it's
Friday thank God
and um alright my hair is in a French
braid I guess I'll show you I mean it's
not the most amazing thing on the world
but you know yeah whatever and then for
my jewelry I'm wearing a subtle
turquoise heart and there's a wooden
thingymajig that says my name in Chinese
but at least the guy who made it said it
day and like for all I know it could say
something really weird but yeah I got
both of these in California so don't
know where you can get those and then
I'm just wearing these really obnoxious
earrings sudden it's like wearing my
poles today with my little diamonds so
now I will show you that's my outfits
pretty casual today I don't get too
excited okay so on top I'm wearing this
like Henley style shirt I'm pretty
positive that's what it's called
I showed this in my back of school hall
but it's super casual and soft and it
just has like buttons going up the front
I really love these style of shirts
yeah and it's extremely soft guys it's
like three-quarter length sleeves just
gray and then I am wearing these shorts
from a combi and I just have my brown
braided belt on that my Square where
this every single day guys and yeah I'm
gonna I just have my little twisty tie
here typing so I have that and I'm with
