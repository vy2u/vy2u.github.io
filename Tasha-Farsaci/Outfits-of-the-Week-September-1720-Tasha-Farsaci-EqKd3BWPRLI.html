people will commenting why don't you try
cutting your hair so I did and this is
what I got out of it if you wanted
tutorial let me know and also tell me if
you like it because I'd like to know so
yeah I'm gonna try something new with my
out for the weeks this week I'm not
gonna be talking and during when I'm
showing you the outfits I'm either gonna
voice it over or just play music because
I feel like my out for the week's get
way too long so yeah once again let me
know if you like the hair and I'm gonna
get into it now okay so I have a really
sore throat right now so sorry if I
sound like a dying whale or something
but I'm wearing this really cute
elephant shirt it has a moon elephant
and I'm wearing a bando underneath and
then I would until heart necklace that I
move sass away lately and of course my
bracelets I'm just wearing a black body
con skirt with this this outfit is
appropriate for my school my dress code
like there is no dress code so I just
wear whatever I want but yeah and then
I'm wearing these like two black sandals
hey guys today is Tuesday for my hair
it's just the same Kohl's is yesterday
then has kind of fell out I slept on
them and then that's what they look like
and I still love them I love how it's
just some loose waves and stuff so once
again let me know if you'd like this
better than my straight hair I
personally do but it takes longer than
straightening it so I don't really know
but yeah I'm kind of dressed up today
because I've been wanting to wear this
dress forever so I'm really happy that I
finally got to wear it so I'm gonna go
right into the outfit okay so if hi
flashing my promise I'm so sorry I
didn't want to wear a strapless bra that
day because they pissed me off so yeah
anyways this dress had like a corset on
the top and I'm just wearing it with a
purple cardigan because it's strapless
and I don't think I can get away with
status in school that's like the only
thing in my desk code he'll be enforces
then I'm wearing these create the flaps
it football that matches the sweater
because and so matchy matchy okay and
then yeah that's better look I went
selling this dress
probably my favorite dress that I own
and I love it
hey guys today is Wednesday um it's
supposed to be kind of colder today so
I'm wearing long sleeves and pants and I
broke out my colored jeans today so yeah
okay it's gonna get right into the
outfit
okay so Samia I can eat this shirt but
I'm obsessed with it so it's just Navy
and white stripes and it has this floral
pocket which you will see right about
now so I was obsessed and smaller and
typed you guys probably know that and I
love the colors in this pocket
I'm obsessed seriously and then I'm
wearing teal pants that match the
flowers perfectly like I was totally
hitting it that day and then my Sperrys
matched my shirt it was just a great day
you know overall I always pretty
impressed with myself not gonna lie
yes today is Thursday but it's really
gonna be my Friday for this out for the
week because tomorrow I have a half day
but we only have one class and the rest
of the day is an assembly that I've
already had before like with a guest
speaker we already had him last year so
you know I'm gonna be sick tomorrow if
you know what I mean so yeah this is my
last outfit of the week
but I'm really excited about it because
I'm wearing like one of my new favorite
shirts I actually ordered this shirt in
two colors because I like it so much so
I might change the other color but I
don't know what yeah new favorite shirt
and then I'll just show you my
accessories now bracelets you know
bracelets and then my earrings so yeah
keep watching okay so this shirt is a
really pretty light blue I matched my
wall completely but the reason I love it
so much is because it has a really
oñate detailing like triangles and
stitching and lease all the stuff that I
love and it's like a mussel tank style
so it's like edgy kind of but then girly
it's pretty cool
my favorite dark wash jeans the bomb
seriously love them to death and then no
alpha is complete without my Jesus
sandals that you guys all hate but I had
to throw them in here you know yep okay
so that was that outfit
yes that was my app of the week this
week I know kind of shortened but
whatever I guess I'll show you the other
color of the shirt I got these are from
Urban Outfitters I their unsewn right
now for only $15 which is crazy because
their word only 40 and I also got it in
this like purpley maroon color so you
know this color kinda I think looks good
on me but let me know which one you like
better this one's just a pretty light
blue if you couldn't tell and then that
one

black one too so I hear that beeping my
