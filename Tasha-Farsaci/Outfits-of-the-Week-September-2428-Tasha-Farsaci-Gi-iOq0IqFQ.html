hair again I killed it last week I
actually haven't put that video off yet
so I don't know if you guys like it or
not but by the time this is off you guys
what I've seen it but once again tell me
if you like it it takes me forever
though it takes me like a half an hour
which is really annoying but um yeah I
cooled my hair because I just like how
it looks a lot more so yeah but now I
will show you my outfit okay on top I'm
just wearing a slowly kind of cropped
tank top and I really love the floral
pattern I think it's super pretty and
then I'm wearing my favorite necklace
and I were like all the time you guys
have probably seen it before I wear it
so often then I'm swearing a navy
cardigan over this and I kind of chopped
up the sleeves a little bit then I'm
just wearing some medium washed jeans
that I cuffed at the bottom because I'm
really really short and I'm wearing my
rainbow sandals
hey guys so today is Tuesday I'm
actually filming this after school
because this morning I overslept like
crazy and I only had 20 minutes to get
ready so I barely had time to get ready
let alone film my outfit so my hair was
just second day curls and they've kind
of fallen out even more now and they
don't even look that great so don't look
at them but yeah so my outfit wasn't
that great today or anything but you
know I'm still gonna show you so here we
go okay so that day I felt like a total
Hollister walking advertisement
I actually got offered a job there
either day so I was so mad I was too
young to take it but anyways I'm just
wearing that lacy blue tank top some
bootcut jeans because all my skinny
jeans were dirty that day and my
bracelets that I always wear and yeah it
was really simple but I still think it's
super cute
hey guys today is Wednesday um today my
hair is just in a ponytail like so I
have some like pieces hanging down and
stuff and yeah so now I will show you
the rest man
thank you I'm wearing this striped shirt
it has pink and light pink stripes on it
and I just pit it with this floral scarf
because you guys probably know I love
flowing stripes together I'm just doing
that same heart necklace and I just love
the combination of this I'm wearing some
dark wash the jeans and my rainbow
flip-flops hey guys today is Thursday
it's actually the end of the day again I
seriously had no time this morning again
but my hair are you support natural I
know it looks pretty bad but I just
really didn't feel like doing my hair
today so I didn't yeah so I'm wearing
the same bracelet as always I know I
sometimes show them in the beginning but
whatever oh this Navy one I don't
normally wear but I made this one by the
way so yeah and then I'm wearing the
same earrings as always so now I will
show you my outfit okay so on top I'm
wearing this really pretty crocheted
sweater those actually my mom's and I
just took out the underneath part but I
really like it and I wore with that same
necklace and then to know you and
jeggings that I will look ruining this
but I promise you they are I just wore
my same bracelets as always and was it
hey guys today is Friday my last day of
my off of the weeks my hair is in a
French braid it's French braid in the
back but I don't feel like turning
around so you guys know that looks like
and I'll show you my jewelry now I'm
wearing these two new rings I got from
brandy melville knowing this one that
everyone and the mother has and this one
with three skulls on it on my thumb
because my finger was a too small for it
to fit on any of the rest but yeah so
now I will show you my outfit okay so I
tried filming in a different kind of
spot today but I just wore this really
pretty slouchy taupe sweater with
leggings because it covered my butt
