you are new here my name is Tasha it
would mean so much to me if you guys
would subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already because I'm trying to
post a lot this summer and I would love
for you guys to see it
oh okay so today I'm filming a video
that I have been meaning to film for so
long and I don't really think I've been
putting it off I just think I've been
posting other things instead but you
guys keep asking me questions that I
wanted to address in this video so
finally sitting down and filming it Elzy
rise can't probably tell from the title
this is going to be a personal Q&amp;amp;A video
where I answer questions that are more
personal than I have ever answered or
that I normally address in videos I am a
pretty private person in my own personal
life as well so it takes a lot for me to
open up to people in my life let alone
the internet so I really do want you
guys to get to know me better because I
want this channel to be as personal and
friendship E as possible so yeah
basically I've asked you guys on
numerous occasions to ask me questions
either anonymously or not on my tumblr I
don't use my tumblr I just use it for
Q&amp;amp;A type stuff and I asked you guys a
few times because I've been meaning to
film this video a few times so I'm just
answering the questions that were asked
most frequently and that I felt
comfortable answering oh and if you guys
do like getting to know me on a more
personal basis like this it would mean
so much if you guys followed me on
Instagram it's just at Tasha I post a
lot of fashion photos photos with my
friends and just like what I'm doing in
my day to day life yeah and I've been
posting a lot more on my stories lately
so if you guys like you know interacting
with me totally follow me on there whoo
all righty I have not gone over how I'm
gonna answer these so this should be
interesting
okay so the first question that I got a
lot of is something that I feel like I
could do a whole video on
so let me know if you guys want me to do
that down below but it's basically my
dating history so far in college and my
opinions on like hookup culture and that
kind of stuff okay so I actually have
not dated anyone seriously since I've
been in college
and there's a few reasons for that I
guess I think the main reason is just
college boys in general and guys that I
find myself interested in or attracted
to either or they're just not looking
for a relationship and they're just
looking to like hook up you know or even
if they are looking for a relationship
I've always felt like I'm pretty much
sure for my age I don't know if that's
an annoying thing to say but I have had
people tell me that and I've always kind
of felt that way so even if these
college boys are looking for a
relationship I just haven't felt like
I've connected on a maturity level or
I'm looking for the same things so
that's been kind of difficult and you
know as I get older in college there's
not as many people in college that are
older than me
so it kind of even limits that whole
maturity thing even more so in this past
year of college especially the second
semester I have started like going on
dates or looking elsewhere from college
boys so more so guys that are out of
college graduated or a few years older
than me and so far that's been a lot
better if you guys feel like me then I
would recommend that but once again I
live in Los Angeles I go to school in LA
so that's a lot easier than I guess if
you were to live in a smaller town where
there's not as many choices or people
that's not to say that I haven't been on
dates or like had things with guys this
whole time like I have but it hasn't
been
thing like super serious I haven't had
like a boyfriend or anything and I think
another reason for that is I'm really
really independent and I like doing my
own thing and being alone I like being
alone a lot not like all the time but I
definitely love my alone time so that's
another thing that's weird with me and
like relationships and that kind of
stuff but I think like the main factor
of that and like college dating is just
like the maturity level and like what
guys here are looking for and in terms
of the hook-up culture and what I think
about it I mean for me I never really
feel comfortable if I'm with a guy and
he's also like hooking up with other
girls that makes me feel super insecure
or even jealous kind of so for me it's
not like my favorite thing but I know
that's what a lot of people in college
one they don't want the stress of a
relationship they don't have time for
that which I totally understand I'm not
against it but it's not totally for me I
feel like if I'm ever in like a hook-up
situation I'm always kind of hoping that
they like me and that it will turn into
something else but then a lot of times
it just doesn't it you definitely don't
have to be involved in it if you don't
want to but it's definitely always going
to be around and you're gonna see other
people partaking so it's just keeping in
mind what you feel comfortable with and
kind of what you know you want out of a
relationship okay so the next question
was what I have what I slash have I
gotten plastic surgery so what I ever
get it or have I gotten it okay so no I
have never gotten plastic surgery done
and to be totally honest with you I was
really really close to getting a nose
job this summer I've since then decided
not to at least for now I don't hate my
nose I don't you know think about it
every day and I don't feel like
extremely self-conscious of it it's just
something that I don't love about my
face that you know I would like to
change
but at this point in time I think I
could be spending money on more
important things or saving my money for
things such as rent or food that's not
to say that I will never consider in the
future because it is something that I
would like but yeah I don't think of it
as a necessity right now yeah I mean
maybe someday I will get my nose done if
so I'll let you guys know I'm not gonna
like hide it or anything but yeah that's
that okay this next question is the one
that I got the most and it is whether or
not I am a virgin and I'm just gonna say
no I'm not gonna go into depth because
my parents and my grandparents and my
other family members watched my videos
and it's just not something I'm comfy
with um and I got so many questions
following up on that with you know how I
feel about people who want to wait and
when you should wait and when you should
just do it and all I really have to say
on that topic is I think virginity is
something that is so personal to each
person and I think that anyone should do
what feels right for them and if someone
wants to wait until they're married
that's awesome and if someone doesn't
then that's great if you're one of those
people messaging me that's saying I
don't know if I want to just get it over
with like I don't know what to do my
biggest advice to you is just do what
you're comfortable with
I don't think you're ever going to look
back in the future on your past self and
be like oh I wish I had just got it over
with I think it's something that if you
do wait and you wait until you're
comfortable you will appreciate that
later on but that being said if you
really feel like you just want to get it
over with then that's you know your
choice too so yeah I just stay true to
yourself and don't feel pressured by the
people around you because I know it may
seem like everyone in college is so
experienced but trust me I know that
that's not the case
think about it and do what feels right
for you okay the next question is has
YouTube impacted my dating life yeah I
think it has affected a meeting friends
I know it would be hard for me to trust
people's motives is the exact thing that
someone sent me I don't think it's
really impacted my dating life
necessarily friendships I have so many
great friends that are not on YouTube at
all so it has in affected me in that way
I think I'm pretty good at judging
people's character and whether or not
they're genuine so that really hasn't
been a problem but it is harder for me
to find YouTube friends that I click
with I found that YouTube is super super
clicky with friend groups and once a
friend group is like established it's
really hard to kind of integrate and
it's not that people are rude and are
trying to exclude others it's just kind
of like once someone's found they're
like little gang or clique or whatever
you want to call it it's like solidified
I don't know I mean that's just kind of
how I felt and I'm also kind of a more
reserved quiet person I'm not someone
who is super outgoing in big groups so
when it comes to like YouTube events and
that kind of stuff it's hard for me to
like you really put myself out there so
I guess YouTube friend wise in the
YouTube community that has been
difficult but I have not some really
really awesome youtubers and not
everyone is like you or whatever okay
and last question that I'm going to
answer in this video is going to be more
lighthearted and free now that I'm 21
everyone wants to know what's my
favorite drink to get at the bar okay so
I really hate the taste of alcohol all
alcohol pretty much I just despise it
and for some reason even though I'm only
five foot one I'm a heavy weight so it
takes me a lot to actually feel it so I
don't only drink wine coolers or
anything because they just don't get the
job done if I'm trying to you know get a
little I was gonna say loose but that's
just super uncomfortable
you know what I mean if I'm trying to
like have a fun time I'm not gonna get
like a wine cooler I really like
ordering Moscow mules you can't taste
the alcohol so be careful I also really
like mojitos just one thing fun fact
about me I despise tequila I cannot
drink it just smelling it makes me want
to yak comment down below what your
favorite drink is because always looking
to try new ones yeah so that is this
video I feel like I kind of opened up to
you guys so I hope you enjoyed it I am
planning I'm filming a kind of life
update video and just tell you guys
what's been going on in my life soon so
if you guys have anything specific that
you want to hear about for that video
feel free to comment down below as well
as I know any other video requests you
guys have for me and yeah I love you
guys so much as always thanks for
