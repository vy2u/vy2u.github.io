video asking guys to ask me questions
because I'm gonna do another Q&amp;amp;A video
and I think I've done two of these
before maybe I've done three I'm not
really sure but I'll figure that out so
I asked you guys ask me some questions
and then I've taken pictures of some of
them and I have my microphone here to
answer obviously I couldn't answer all
of them because I got like 600 so yeah
but I just picked the ones that were
really frequent and then just ones that
I liked I guess so I'm gonna get right
into it
I look really really pasty in this
lighting I decide to sit on my stairs so
just don't mind my hastiness okay so the
first question is what's your favorite
subject in school and what do you plan
on majoring in in college so my favorite
subject is probably English I've always
been good at it I don't know why I just
retain information really well so if
we're reading something I don't have to
study for the tests like I know every
single thing about the story
it's really weird I'm really good at
that kind of stuff and I'm also has been
really good at like writing and that
kind of stuff so when I get to college I
really want to do something with like
writing in a magazine and I really want
it to be like a fashion magazine I think
that'd be so cool just like looking at
17 or Teen Vogue or something but I know
like everyone wants to do that so that
probably won't happen but I think that'd
be awesome
I also got asked where I want to go to
college and I know I want to go
somewhere in California I know I've said
that I want to go to Stanford but I
really don't know if I'm getting it in
there I have like a 98 GPA before
everything's like curved because I do
have a curve on my AP classes but I
still don't know if I'll be able to get
in it's so hard to get into so I I
really want to go somewhere California
so Stanford or USC or UCLA I'm going out
there this summer
so I'm gonna be looking at some colleges
so maybe I'll find some more okay this
one's been asked before but I'm gonna
answer it again basically it's just like
two people at my school know about my
YouTube and doesn't bother me and stuff
I get this question all the time and yes
people at my school know about my
YouTube people are kind of annoying
about it too like they don't like to let
it be they just they totally have to be
extremely annoying about it and the
thing is if people came up to me and
said stuff okay but people talk about me
behind my back and it's annoying people
are really really mean and if you want
to make a channel you have to accept
that that people are gonna find out and
you have to be strong enough to be okay
with that because people are so mean and
they're so rude and they don't
understand that they shouldn't be doing
that but they're gonna do it anyways
so yeah people I school will know about
it some people are really cool about it
and they're really nice but other people
are just really humanly and annoying
okay so another question is do I have
any weird fears and I think I brought
this up in a video before so I only know
if this is weird I actually think it's a
phobia I think I have a phobia that's
how intense it is so for as long as I
can remember I've had a fear I might
throw up and throwing up and all the
people doing it me doing it like animals
it doesn't matter I don't know why and
it's so intense like if someone throws
up near me alright like my foot starts
racing and I'm like freaking out like I
can't even control it like I feel like
I'm gonna like pass out or something and
I get so scared and it's not eat as bad
now as it was like when I was younger
it's still really bad but it was extreme
then like if anyone even said that they
have like thrown up in the past week but
I really cover my mouth I'm like not
breathe their air I was so so weird and
I'm still weird about it I still get
really freaked out I don't know what it
is I just I don't know if it's because
like I don't want to get it from them I
just I can't deal with it like it's so
scary to me and I don't know why I mean
it's just I don't do any of you have
that because I
actually a phobia it's bad I need to get
rid of it but it's really intense okay
the next question I'm gonna like lump
into one it's pretty much have you ever
dyed your hair are you thinking of
dyeing your hair do you want to dye your
hair what color would you want that hair
all that stuff so pretty much in my last
video I talked about how I was gonna dye
my hair brown and I'm still gonna do it
a lot of you guys are telling me not to
do it but I'm gonna do it guys it's just
it's set in stone I'm doing yet so
pretty much a lot of you were also
saying that you block my natural hair
color which you probably think is like
this which it kind of is but over the
summer what I did was I used Sun in a
lot and if you don't know a Sun it is
it's basically the spray that you spray
in your hair when you're gonna go in the
sauna met Megan's your hair so that's
why my hair is pretty light down here
but now that it's winter and I haven't
done anything my natural hair has
started to go in and it's just like an
awkward dark blonde and that's kind of
what's going on up here my hair is kinda
greasy right now so don't look at it but
it's really bad in my room which I'm
getting really bad so at first I was
thinking that I was just going to die on
lighter and get like all my hair like a
nice light blonde but then I was kind of
thinking what would i look like with
brown hair and I found this really cool
website that you can like upload a
picture of yourself and you can like put
like figure out where your hair is on
the website and then after you kind of
show who your hair is it'll change your
hair color for you in the picture and I
did that to me with brown hair and I
actually really liked how it looked so
I'll put that down below if you guys are
interested in looking at that but yeah
I'm really excited I'm dying it December
first so I'm really excited and I'll
definitely do a video once I do that
okay next is what kind of music do I
listen to
I am the weirdest I can look them widest
range of music I listen to so I like to
listen to I don't really know what a
genre you call it first I like to listen
to music like The Kooks I'm the Virgin's
I don't know those kind of bands do you
guys know who they are and then I like
hardcore rap boy like um like Wiz
Khalifa Kanye West and all that stuff
and then
is like weird song sometimes songs are
on the radio like I have the widest
range
I don't like country I don't like
country I don't really like that kind of
stuff but I really like Auto music oh
yeah next question I'm gonna answer is
do I have any weird habits alright I do
this weird thing I don't know why I
think it's just when I'm nervous
I'm bored I like to the inside of my
lips and it's it's so gross I don't know
why I do it but I'll chew it like all
around here and all around the sides of
my mouth and I like chew it the skin off
and it's disgusting I don't know why I
do it
and sometimes I like to my lips and bite
my lips it's weird I don't know why I do
it and it's gross and the inside of my
mouth is always ripped up and nasty and
it's really nasty and gross and I don't
know why I do it but if any of you guys
do that let me know because then I won't
feel so alone if I the opportunity to be
a guy for one week when I do it and what
would I do
okay so obviously I would be a guy for a
week because I guys have it so easy I
mean seriously they don't have to deal
with so many things that girls do and
guys are not all stupid and dramatic
because I have never been one of those
girls that's like all dramatic and into
drama and stuff I know girls say that
all the time when they're totally drama
freaks but I am I hate drama
I hate girls start drama I stay out of
that and I feel like guys do that to
most of them um I don't know I I don't
know what I do maybe I'd get a little
crazy
no but I think obviously i reveai and
maybe i'd ask other guys what they
thought of me maybe that sounds really
kind of like narcissistic I don't know
but I do that so those are all the
questions I'm gonna answer today I hope
