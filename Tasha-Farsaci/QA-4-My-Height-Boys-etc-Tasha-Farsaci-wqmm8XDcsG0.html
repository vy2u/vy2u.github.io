you guys to ask me some questions
because I was going to do you another
Q&amp;amp;A video so here I am of doing it
I picked like 10 of the questions I
would say I don't really know how many
for sure and I have them screenshot it
on my phone and then I'm gonna answer
them so I must have picked the ones that
were more thumbs up or ones that I
hadn't answered before and yeah so I'm
gonna get ready to it I'm currently
sitting on pillow is because my tripod
was not cooperating so if I'm like
shaking around that's why okay the first
question asked by Elmo Weasley 23 is who
are your favorite non Beauty youtubers
Tiffany Berg you guys may or may not
know matter but she's hilarious I'm in
love with her I'm obsessed with her and
she follows me on Instagram so I'm not
sure if she knows who I am or not I
really hope he does because I love her
and she's literally hilarious so yeah
you can you know go to a channel and
tell her I sent you and maybe she'll
know I exist
but yeah I like watching comedy videos I
think they're funny I wish I could do
them but I'm just not probably probably
not funny enough purple cow Lizzie cool
username um ask what color do you prefer
your hair natural or how it is now okay
so I got this question like a million
times on this video in different ways
that's when I chose so if you guys have
been watching my videos for a while now
you know I was blonde for the longest
time and then I dyed it brown and then I
dyed it really dark brown and now it's
here it's like getting back to kind of
natural it's kind of late on the end you
can't really tell but I'm getting my
roots like you can't really see boots
but a little bit because my hair is like
dark dark dirty blonde it's not like
this reddish brown like I have it so I
really kind of like them equally I
really like blonde hair I was lighter
here when I'm tan and I'm getting kind
of tan so I have a hair appointment in
like two weeks
ish and I think I'm getting highlights
but not like super super blonde just
kind of like a dark dirty blonde with
some like highlights but you know
probably go type again for the winter I
like them equally I probably will just
like switch on and off for a while
Josie D of hos Josie Josie D asked what
do you look for in a boy like what's
that one thing that makes you go crazy
okay for me the guys happen to be funny
I'm pretty shy and if a guy is not
talkative and not outgoing and funny it
just doesn't work for me because I can't
like come out of my shell and deep down
when I'm not when I'm not shy really
good for funny personality so I really
like guys that are funny and that can
keep a conversation going
acqua baby 41 asked do you want to have
any tattoos if yes where if no why
well I don't like really really want a
tomb just because I feel like when you
get old and you're like saggy that's
that's not gonna look cute second of all
my mom literally hates them like she
hates tattoos so much but like right now
if I could get a tattoo I would I mean
it I feel like I'd want more of I guess
semi-permanent one like I Hinata but I
think it'd be like you to have like
stars behind my ear like not like my
actual year but like back in here like a
few stars I think that would be really
cute okay Sophie Stalin add and una
Maria and probably more people ask how
tall are you okay so I have mentioned
this in a few B's videos before some
people think I'm really tall I guess if
you just see like my body without other
people around me I looked all that
people have told me that but I'm not I'm
five one I'm really anywhere from five
foot two five two five two is on my
permit five one is what I go with cuz
I'm like I don't know it's doing
anywhere in between there it's short
whatever it is okay Lindsay Pleasant
asked would you ever cut your hair short
okay so my hair is probably the longest
ever been at the moment it's like well
down to there but when I'm turning
around touches my butt and I did not do
that on purpose it's like every time I
get my hair cut I call like four inches
off and then it just grows my back it's
a lot of people want but I don't want my
here this long especially cuz I'm sure
it looks kind of weird but my hair used
to be short in like second grade first
grade I mean I thought I was a trendy or
something and it was like up to here but
it was angled up in the back so it was
like a wicked show in the back and an
angle to like my chin I looked like a
idiot
I thought I was like cool and trendy
whatever but I look stupid and then it
would just be like in this general area
for the longest time I mean I think
Schweiker is Hugh I just don't know if I
could pull it off like but this look
will this stuff bad like I think that's
really cute yeah but I just I'm so used
to having long hair now and it's like so
much more stuff you can do with long
hair that I'm used to doing but like if
I had short hair I feel like I'd have to
style it and straighten it every single
day so I don't know maybe in the future
but for right now I'm probably gonna
keep it long okay xx surfer girl XX
seventeen asked what are you looking
forward to this summer bucket list okay
this is actually funny because I've been
kind of thinking of a summer bucket list
in my head the main thing I really want
to do is go on someone's boat and go
tubing or jet skiing or fishing off of
the boats I've never gone fishing off of
a but yeah that's a lie I have but I
don't know I just think I'd be so fun
like preferably with someone more my age
think I've gone with my dad before but
you know preferably at the top of the
time for the cute boy about you know
that's not gonna happen
Maggi M asks the question that I get in
every Q&amp;amp;A video do you have a boyfriend
no I don't have a boyfriend
honestly I probably am forever alone
like everyone says that and I get really
annoyed and people say that but I say it
like it's okay really quick brant peppy
thing right here don't want us in here
because it's pissing me off and it
happened so much lately as soon every
single time as soon as I start to like a
guy the smallest bit he stops talking to
me it's not like I tell him it just
happens every single time and I swear to
god I'm getting so sick of it
does this happen to you okay the green
kitty 505 asked what genre of music do
you like listening to name five top
songs
okay so I don't really buy certain songs
anymore I mainly just listen to my
Pandora and if I like a song I'll like
screenshot or thumbs up or whatever so I
will tell you the Pandora stations and I
listen to him
currently I'm listening to the bravery
radio a band the bravery um I have the
Black Keys naive by the cooks fall out
pour it all out boy because I really
thought boys new song what's it called
my son's know what you did in the dark
or something like that something like
that I really like that song I really
like radioactive by imagine dragons
I've lived linking the song give me
sympathy by metric and yeah that's all I
can think of right now but I don't know
what yelling about all those black bands
are is it like alternative indie I'm not
really sure but let me know I like that
kind of stuff Lena milena smush Mele
Moby NARAS must okay animal I know that
name asked me what is one thing you
would change about yourself and why okay
this one's easy for me it's not
something physical because that's what
most people would probably change I hate
how shy I am like I hate it so much and
you guys probably don't see it in my
videos because I'm going in my videos
but I am so shy with people that I don't
know and when I'm putting situations
when I don't know people I'm awkward I
don't say stuff I'm just like I don't
know what to say like it's now in people
people think I'm a huge bitch for like
so many people my school think I'm the
biggest bitch just because I don't talk
but it's like I don't know what to say I
mean I don't know I hate it so much I
wish I could be one of those totally
outgoing people that everyone like wants
to be friends with but like I mean I'm
like that on the inside it's just like I
I don't know I hate it so much and it's
a really hard thing to overcome I used
to be way more shy YouTube's definitely
made me less shy but I don't know it
really stinks and once I know people
like I'm totally open with them and like
outgoing this stuff but it's just I
don't know it's really tough for me and
it really sucks that's definitely the
thing I would change
about myself because I feel like I would
have so many more opportunities if I was
just like not afraid to do things and
talk to people like I don't know I it
sucks it's Joe Lee said you look like
kendall Jenner with your eyebrows filled
in like that I'm gonna give you a hug
I wish help like kendall Jenner she is
flawless like the Jenner's are the only
reason I watched Keeping Up with the
Kardashians because Kim it makes me want
to punch a wall but apparently Brody
Jenner has signed to be on that
Kardashians so I will probably be
watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians
