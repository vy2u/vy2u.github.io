in like ten years um I'm here a few of
like an hour ago maybe I just posted a
quick video asking Gus asking some
questions for another Q&amp;amp;A I know this
isn't you know as good as a normal video
but um I don't know it's like the first
day of summer for me like the second day
actually so I've been really busy and I
was like studying for my finals and
stuff so I didn't really have time to
make like a really nice video and I was
just hanging out with my friends today
but I figured I'd do a Q&amp;amp;A and I will
definitely be doing better videos coming
up I'm going to Cape Cod I'm leaving on
Saturday so maybe I'll film some fashion
videos there on the beach or something
and I don't know I'm gonna try so yeah
but anyways I'm gonna get into the
questions I asked on Twitter as well as
on the video so here we go
okay Tara that you asked I'm sitting on
the ground there's bugs all over me um
okay Tara asked what's your diet and
fitness routine so lots of people I've
been noticing have been doing videos on
this or like asking this and I would
totally do a video on it for you if it
existed I know that's not what people
want to hear but honestly I eat what I
want and I know that's gonna catch up to
me eventually but right now I love food
I love things that are bad for me so
there is no diet but at least for my
exercise I do on track I'm not like
hardcore so people always ask me like my
times and everything and like I'm really
not that good so that's why I don't
answer that but um I do run track but
now like during the summer I love roller
waiting I go rollerblading all the time
there's like this place that I go a lot
where it's 3 miles there and back so I
go like 6 miles and I actually met
subscribers they once it was the first
time I ever met subscribers and it was
so her so funny because I was disgusting
and I was all sweaty and I was a mess
and it was my first time meeting people
but if you guys are watching this shout
out to you because that was awesome
definitely an interesting way to meet
subscribers but yeah I really played a
lot and people asked me like how I get
muscular
through whatever maybe it's from that I
don't know but I know what you're
thinking asked do you have your license
no I don't have my license I am 16 but
in New York State you have to wait six
months after you get your permit to take
your driver's test and I got my permit
in March my birthday was in February so
I have to wait till September and I'm
really mad I didn't just get my permit
when it was my birthday because then I
could drive in August at least but um
yeah that is if I passed my driver's
test because I'm not the best driver in
the world Lea quack I was asked who's
your celebrity boy and girl crush okay
boy crush it's funny these people are
siblings okay boy crush Brody John I
100% he is my perfect guy I don't care
if he's like thirty I don't care at all
he is so gorgeous I love him so much
hmm I woke him and then my goal crush
would probably be Kendall Jenner I just
she's so pretty
love her love them that family
I don't like the Kardashians that much I
didn't really don't I just like the
Jenner's okay Sarah F asked do you have
a boyfriend
nope okay my new bike asked what are you
planning on doing after high school okay
so I'm going to college well I'm in
tenth grade right now I was just
finished tenth grade so I have two more
years but I was up now I plan on going
to college I do not want to stay in New
York I don't like it here
I don't live in New York City so it's
not very interesting here um I really
really want to go to California so badly
my dream school is Stanford I don't know
if I'll get and I probably won't so I
don't know maybe USC or something but if
I don't go to California I know I want
to go somewhere warmer because I hate
the snow so maybe like North Carolina or
something like UNC or Duke but all the
schools I want to go to I'm thinking of
going to a really hard to get into so I
don't know
I as of now I want to major in like
marketing and business and stuff or
advertising or something like that
medium I don't know so if you guys can
think of any like cool colleges I would
love to be by a beach that's like my
dream and I don't want it to get like
any colder than like 50 but yeah I don't
know you guys want to throw anything out
there let me know there's quinny's 401
asked have you ever been told you look
like a certain celebrity um I mean not
really it's not like people look at me
and be like oh my god you look just like
blank I have I've had people tell me I
look like Kylie Jenner which I wish I
mean like I don't know I don't really
see it maybe sometimes and I have whiter
hair now obviously but some people say
Kendall - and that's like my dream but
yeah I don't really see it if you guys
think I look like a certain celebrity
tell me down below because that would be
cool but yeah and then another question
from I know what you're thinking ask
have you ever gone through a weird phase
okay guys I was the queen of weird faces
okay so one thing that I did was in like
fifth grade it was really cool to be
like Spidey or whatever but still was
like Aeropostale your arrow passed out
um so I would wear you know the arrow
pastel logo shirt with like sports
shorts and then my hair would be like a
nolo either a low ponytail with like a
middle part so like with pre-wrap if you
guys know what pre-wrap is or there
would be like all the way up here to the
side YUM with pre-wrap always pre-wrap
it's like a it's I don't know you guys
may or may not know what it is but that
and then I would wear like old maybe
flip-flops or something I don't know it
was the most awkward stage of my life
because I'm really not an athletic
person really like I can't pull off
wearing sporty stuff so that was that
was definitely an awkward face okay now
I'm gonna go on to Twitter
um I really don't use Twitter that often
mostly because I have a personal Twitter
as well they used to be combined but
then I had some issues with people just
like I don't know just some issues so I
separated them and it what it would look
like I would appreciate it if you didn't
find follow me on my personal one I'm
private but it's just like I mean I know
you guys might want to follow me but I
really just want to keep it separated
for specific reasons I don't know I mean
I get a lot of people that request me
but if you don't have if I don't know
who you are or like a lot of the people
that I follow don't follow you like I'm
gonna ignore it so you know just it's
not that I don't like you guys but it's
just I'd rather keep my Twitter separate
for the moment but anyways okay I'm
gonna pick some of these questions
Taylor asked brandy or urban that's hard
but probably urban just because they
have like a more variety of stuff and
like everyone has like the same things
from brandy but not a lot of people have
the same things for urban Anjali Patel
asked do you like tacos yeah I like
tacos I wish I have talked about closer
to me because though quesadillas are
happen and I like tacos as well I just
prefer chicken tacos because I'm not
much of a beef person but I still like
tacos selicia Hammer asked are you ever
going to back go back complete blonde or
just highlight it okay so I like my hair
how it is now it looks like this um you
guys might have seen that video like a
little bit ago that I told you that I
like highlighted my hair back and stuff
I like how it is now I don't want super
blonde but I do prefer it lighter in
like as compared to darker but when I go
back I'm probably just gonna get it
highlighted again so it's probably gonna
gradually get lighter just I don't want
it like super bleached blond or anything
but I do like it better lighter
especially if you like the summer when
I'm getting tanner which I'm kind of tan
right now but you can't tell cuz the
Lighting's weird yeah you can't tell but
anyways yeah I do prefer it later I
think everyone just kind of like goes
through the time when they don't know
whether they want it light or darker if
you're light you want a dark when you
talk you want light you know so yeah but
I'll probably be blonde
ask you ever get noticed in public and
yes I do
I mean I've I would say it happens like
it's happened a few times if you ever
see me in public
say hi I mean I'm kind of shy so it
might be kind of awkward at first but I
would love to see you guys and you don't
know how many people I get that like
tweet me you'll be like I saw you today
but I didn't want to say hi so she's
scared like please say hi I am not a
mean person I might look kind of mean
when you see me because I I mean I'm
just probably straight-faced but I
promise you I'm not a mean person so I'd
love if you come to me and it's like
cool and we can take a picture and stuff
so yep my friend Sarah asked do you
think I'm pretty
maybe one through ten no you're a
negative 69 okay those are all the
questions I'm gonna answer right now I
hope this wasn't too boring I hope you
guys enjoyed it leave me video Quest's
don't balloon because you know I'm
really need to stop slacking on YouTube

you guys so much I honestly I don't
think I deserve all of you guys because
