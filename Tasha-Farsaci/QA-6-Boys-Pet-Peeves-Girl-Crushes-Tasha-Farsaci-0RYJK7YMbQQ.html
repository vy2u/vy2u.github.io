with a Q&amp;amp;A video some people might hate
Q&amp;amp;A videos and think they are so boring
some people might really love them so
you know shout out to you guys like I
normally do when I have Q&amp;amp;A videos I
tweeted it was like a few days ago
though and I really don't have too many
followers on my Twitter YouTube Twitter
just because I don't really update it
that much so I also posted a short video
asking you guys comment your questions
because that also like reaches a more
broad spectrum of you guys so yes I have
chosen some of those and I'm going to
get right into them first question how
do you feel about me with glasses
because i really wish i had glasses and
these are fake glasses because i don't
need glasses um they were sitting right
here and i thought i'd ask your opinion
because i really enjoy glasses and i
want to wear them but i feel like people
will know they're fake so yeah let me
know I mean green asked what is your
favorite thing about balls so I'm gonna
be super basic or here and I'm going to
say scarves leggings boots mostly boots
if I had to choose one of those things
I'd be boots and then pumpkin spice
lattes from Starbucks Amy Hannah and
like 50 trillion other people ask me if
I have a boyfriend yet no i don't i have
had bad experiences with boys lately I'm
sick of boys I don't wanna think about
boys boys are assholes if you're gonna
unsubscribe because I swarm sorry I just
hate boys right now and I'm forever
alone I'm of bama Shack I'm hoping
that's how i pronounce it asked holy
grail hey louder so today I actually
straighten my hair but I haven't
straightened my hair in so long I have
actually been wearing it like natural
lately I just kind of get out of the
shower and scrunch it up with this
product it is the osseous brunch mousse
and this stuff is great it gets rid of
all my friends and I do have a natural
wave to my hair so I don't really know
if this gives wave but it does kind of
enhance my waves and I use this a lot I
only use this with like one other
products sometimes I don't even use the
other product and this gets rid of like
all of my friends and I have a pretty
frizzy hair when I just like let it air
dry or whatnot so
this is what it looks like it's your my
nails are disgusting sorry cash register
probs um anyways this stuff is probably
like in two or three dollars and it's
great and it lasts forever and I lost
the cap on mine but I would definitely
recommend this if you like you know
wearing your hair natural or you want to
try or even if you just want your hair
soft or to smell good because this too
has both a kilo of a beer I asked how do
you get a boy to like you first thing
you gotta do is flash in one of these
faces trust me he will not be able to
stay away okay two different people ask
me how many miles I run in a week to be
perfectly honest right about now it's
zero um I go to school I come home most
of the times I go to work then come home
do my homework and then sleep and then
repeat so running really isn't in there
I should probably get on that so web ask
are you planning on going blonder or
darker this fall PS i love your videos
so thank you um and i am probably just
whoa that was weird probably i'm
probably just going to keep it the color
it is this is actually my natural color
basically um i have gone through we're
near phases you guys might know um i was
dark i was i'm naturally dirty blonde
like so um i was a really dark brown I
was like light brown I was highlighted
i'm i'm still like highlighted but this
is my natural hair color like right
under here and i just get some
highlights on the top and yeah that's
what i think i'm going to be doing for a
while cuz i like it i feel like it just
looks the best on me looking back i hate
how i left with brown hair absolutely
hate it i don't know how i liked it at
the time so um i'm pretty sure i'm not
going to be going dark again what's up I
like bows asked what do you prefer
McDonald's or Burger King okay back in
the day it used to be burger king but
now I have moved on I have discovered
the mcchicken and the mocha frappe from
mcdonalds therefore mcdonalds
heavy music asks do you have a celebrity
girl crush yes I do have talked about
this in lots of videos kendall Jenner
definitely and then I have a ton of girl
crushes are like actually I actually
know which is kind of weird i'm
obviously not going to say their names
but I feel like I have more girl crushes
on people that I actually know instead
of celebrities is that weird do you guys
have that I swear I'm straight but I
mean I'm under store at underscore o.h
okay underscore so okay I'm guessing oh
okay I don't know asked oh god daddy

okay i have so many pet peeves i'm just
i'm a pet peeve e person I don't you
know I also talk to you my hair a lot
sorry I'm just going to say the pet
peeves of the moment because if I had
talked about why pet peeves I think we'd
be here forever okay my number one pet
peeve right now is people that use you
for homework answers I work pretty hard
in school like I get high 90s and I try
really hard and I put forth on my upper
and I always do all my homework and I
study and all that stuff and then
there's the people that don't do
anything and then they expect like they
can just mooch off other people who do
to their work and get good grades like
no we did not talk all summer you made
no effort to talk to me so don't text me
at like 10 and night and be like hey
girl love ya send me a pic of english
homework no don't do that like do it
yourself i'm not giving you my stuff it
would be one thing if you most the time
to do homework or we were friends but no
we're not friends we haven't talked in

the moment is liars Liars always pet
peeves but lately people have been lying
