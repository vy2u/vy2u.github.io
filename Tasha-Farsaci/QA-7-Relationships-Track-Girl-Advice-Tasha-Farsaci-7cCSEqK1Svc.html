I know this doesn't count as a real
video but I wanted to film something and
I don't know I know some people like
these so I'm doing one I apologize for
the lack of actual videos but I'm doing
this for you today I hope you guys
enjoyed anyways the other day I treated
asking you guys asking some questions
and I actually got some responses the
ones normally I don't because they don't
have a lot of followers on Twitter go
ahead and follow me on Twitter if you
want I don't only tweet a lot because
it's just my YouTube Twitter but it's
fusee Tasha
we're right here and same with Instagram
definitely follow me on there because I
post in there all the time because it's
my personal and my youtube so I post all
the time and that is also if you see
Tasha so please follow me and you know
I'm just going to read off some of the
questions at Jaz Kramer zero-zero asked
are you thinking of dyeing your hair
anytime soon so if you guys have been a
longtime human you knew or you might
know my hair was brown it was blonde
than brown now it's like blonde again
and I think I'm gonna keep it blonde as
much as I love dark hair it's just not
for me and maybe it's because I was pale
maybe you look better in this summer but
I'm gonna stick with the blonde I think
it just looks the best on me I do my
hair appointment in like two weeks so I
think I'm just going to keep getting
highlights because my moods are coming
in a little bit but um ask the color
change I'm pretty sure I'm gonna stick
to blonde probably try and lighten it up
a little bit more for like summertime
but um yeah Emily and Nyquist asked if
you could live anywhere where would it
be and as of now I would love to live in
LA and I know that's totally basic and
like all youtubers live in LA but I hate
the cold weather I live in New York and
not the city so it's not exciting but I
live in like New York State and it's so
cold tomorrow it's supposed to be like
negative degrees so hoping for snow daya
but I need the cold weather I hate not
having anything to do around here and
just the idea of California it sounds
awesome
there's opportunities out there so I
just really want to live there la Santa
Monica area okay that same girl Emily
asked have you ever been in a serious
relationship and that doesn't know I've
never been in a relationship unless you
count like middle school and honestly
it's like kind of embarrassing at this
point because I'm almost 17 and I'm
almost like kind of embarrassed about it
but it's like I just haven't found
anyone that I like sorry I'm gonna touch
my hair all throughout that's when I
remind her straight I like touch it so
much but obviously like I would want
something serious I wouldn't want to
date someone that I didn't really like
and at this point there's no one that
has worked out that I would like fate
and the people that I would date like
things just didn't work out so you know
as of now I've never been this serious
release from a relationship maybe before
the end of high school or maybe it's
just college for me I don't really know
or any of you guys my age that have
never had a relationship like let me
know Isabelle Vaughn asked asked what do
you want to do after school
PS favorite youtuber thank you like I
said I want to go to LA as far as
college I really want to go to USC at
University of Southern California it's
really hard to get into though so I
don't know how I hope I get in if not I
don't know where I'll end up but um I
want to do something with business or
marketing just because I don't want to
go somewhere for fashion oops sorry my
phone I don't want to go somewhere for
fashion just because I don't want to
only be able to do something like
fashion because I don't know how far
that will get you but if I have like a
business marketing kind of like film
kind of background thing and then maybe
internship and like fashion places I
think I'll have more of like a
background built up and I can do stuff
with Elle underscore Fossum asked what's
your biggest advice to girls
okay my biggest advice as of now is to
be yourself and don't let people change
you if
you know that's not where you want to go
because I know right now so many people
that I know are changing tremendously
and it's just because of like the people
around them and months ago or even like
years ago they would never want to be
the person that they are now and it's
sad watching that happen to people so I
mean obviously everyone's gonna change
I've changed like but just stay true to
yourself and don't let your friends
convince you to change it be something
that you're not because honestly in the
long run you might not be friends to
them after high school you know so I
don't know just be careful but you hang
out with and just stick to it yourself I
guess
Amanda's Cimorelli asked when is your
birthday and my birthday is February
17th I will be 17 any May Baumgarten
asked who's your favorite band slash
singer um I don't really know I listen
to a lot of bands I'm only just listen
to Pandora I really like the
neighborhood right now I guess I like
like alternative kind of indie bands
Julia King asked do you still do track I
have not been doing track indoor at
least because I just get a job and
honestly I really don't like track that
much I used to like it more than I do
now I think and I just would rather have
a job and get paid money then go and do
something that I don't really like
especially ignore because we actually
rectus outdoor and it's so cold I don't
know if I'm going to do outdoor track in
the spring or if I'm going to work just
because I would like the exercise but I
could just do that my own instead of
going to track and not going to work so
I don't know I will see how I feel about
that but as of now I don't think I'm
gonna be a drink track anymore
so yeah okay Abby Sydney Johnson asked
why fierce what made you choose that it
does suit you though okay this is kind
of a funny story like at the time before
I made my youtube channel I was trying
to figure out like a good user name and
I was obsessed with America's Next Top
Model at the time and Tyra Banks always
have fears and for some reason I liked
it so seriously Tasha X my name is Tasha
I
kind of don't like it at this point but
I can't change it just because like I'm
known as seriously Tasha and like
everyone at school calls me fiercely
hotshot if I changed it it was just like
it would just be sad you know but I
don't know I don't know if I'm fierce
pedesta Tyrell okay Sara Nyquist 99 asks
would you rather have a shark rip off
your toe and live in Paradise for your
whole life or cut off your own arm
before like a hundred million dollars is
that a billion dollars I think it's a
billion dollars hmm I think I'd rather
have a sharp grip off my toe and live in
Paradise because I wouldn't really mind
missing a toe obviously it wouldn't be
nice to meeting a toe but even if I had
like a billion dollars I wouldn't want
to be missing an arm so if I was in
paradise like I wouldn't need money
right so those are all the questions
that I'm going to answer today I did a
question though so I have a wildflower
phone case and the stunts are like
completely wearing off I don't know if
you can tell because they look pretty
gold on here but they're like rusting
and stuff and if any of you guys have
one of these let me know this happens to
you because I'm really annoyed because
these aren't cheap and I'm gonna have to
get like a new phone case because all my
phone cases I'm just getting nasty so I
don't know if this happened to you guys
anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this
