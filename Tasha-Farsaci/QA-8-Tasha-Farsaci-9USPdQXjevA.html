personal video they're not really
personal it's just a QA but a sit-down
talk for you because I feel like I
haven't done it in forever and that's
helping because I don't make videos very
frequently because I saw anyways I
tweeted out asking you guys to send me
some questions I don't have the biggest
follower and following following on my
Twitter so if you want to follow me it's
a through C Tasha just like my username
as well as my Instagram please follow me
on both of those it would just mean so
much to me so please follow me anyways I
tweet it out and ask to us send me some
questions for this Q&amp;amp;A video so that's
what I'm going off of um yes ok at
contro ask are you looking forward to
graduating next year I am so excited to
graduate next year if you guys don't
know I'm a junior in high school and if
you're not from the united states that
means that i have one more year of high
school before I graduate and I'm very
excited I am sick of just the petty high
school drama and I don't know I'm just
over it and I'm really excited to meet
new people going to go to a new place
obviously I'm really scared because it's
so different and I'm gonna be leaving
like my whole life up until this point
like I've known these people like my
whole life so obviously that's scary but
i think i'm way more excited that i am
scared so yes I am overly excited um to
graduate next year ok at Sarah Ian ssin
asked what is your favorite Starbucks
drink so recently I've been getting the
same drink and I really like coffee a
lot like coffee flavor not necessarily
like black coffee when my mom makes
coffee since it's really nasty but I
like coffee and I really like
frappuccinos from starbucks but I've
been getting like the mocha and I
sometimes get the java chip but they're
not like coffee enough for me so I get
the mocha with a shot of espresso and
it's the best thing ever it tastes so
much better than just the mocha like if
you like coffee you have to try it
because it's amazing and that's what
I've been getting lately and it's
definitely my favorite at teardrop
glisten asked how with your friendship
life going and a while ago like a year
ago you and a half ago ish I was having
a real problem with friends and
general and I think I've definitely
grown from that time I'm on a lot like
better happier place now and I've made
better friends so yeah I'm really happy
and you guys just need to know if you
ever in like a tough situation it will
get better you might be really sad at
the time you don't think anything will
get better but I promise you things will
look up and things will change and you
just have to be optimistic about it and
you will get through it because like I
said I'm really happy right now and
happy with my friends and I've just
learned that you know you just have to
be yourself and you'll find people that
like you for that and you don't have to
change yourself to try and like fit into
your friends that used to be your
friends and might not be like your
friends anymore so that's basically what
i want to say okay at yesenia 24 umm al
smith University do you plan on
attending after you graduate high school
so I don't plan on attending any as of
now because I don't know where I would
get accepted but you guys probably know
if you watch my videos frequently that I
would love to go to USC at university of
southern california I recently visited
there when I went to California and it
was amazing they have everything that I
want to do and I just love the idea of a
California in LA and I'm sick of the
cold and snow in New York but obviously
I would still be able to see it when I
come home from breaks but USC it's
pretty hard to get into so I just need
to make sure that my grades and I acid
he's and everything or up to par but you
know that's where I would like to attend
at addison Taylor asked how was prom and
from was fun I mean I'm not like a huge
like totally getting to school dances
especially because mine was in my
cafeteria but it was fun I love dressing
up I love taking pictures and all that
stuff so that was fun and I'm also going
to a Senior Bowl soon not mine obviously
cuz i'm not a senior but if you guys
want me to do a getting ready video for
that like I did for my prom let me know
because I would do that for you ok l is
andrea x 0 asked what was your favorite
part about visiting california and
despite the
I was with my parents alone for 10 days
it was amazing I just love how you can
be in the middle of a big city like LA
and then drive a few miles and beyond
like a huge beach where there's so much
space and just like tranquility i guess
and i just love it so much and I love
how you can drive to Malibu and be like
all the surfers and it's like just a
beautiful place and I just love with
this so much and I hope that I will be
able to be living there and around a
year so we will see okay half moon

celebrity who would it be and if you
could date any celebrity who would it be
okay I think I would want to either look
like kendall jenner or blake lively and

definitely a hundred percent be Brody
Jenner because I'm in love with him yeah

asked if you would ever go shorter hair
legs okay so my hair is at its all-time
long blanks right now my hairdresser is
like obsessed with my hair and refuses
to cart like line cuts off of it so I
get trims like every three months but
it's getting to the point where I think
it's too long like don't mind my
athletic shorts by the way but this is
it when it's wavy so when is stray it's
even longer and i don't know i mean i
like it but i would love to just not
have super-long here for like a little
bit like just to cut it to like here you
know but I mean I probably won't because
yeah I don't know I'm so used to it long
but I will only do like short hair like
everyone seems to be cutting their hair
short lately and I'm so jealous because
I wish I had the guts to cut my hair off
but um people at Hobby hey be so you
know okay Tori underscore Thompson 07
