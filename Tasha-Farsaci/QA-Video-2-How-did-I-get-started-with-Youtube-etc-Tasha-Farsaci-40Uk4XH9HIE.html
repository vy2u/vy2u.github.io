a Q&amp;amp;A video and just a few hours ago I
made a quick video asking you guys to
leave me questions that you wanted me to
answer for one of these videos and
basically I've done one of these videos
before and I answered like how old I am
and where i live in stuff so if you want
to see that video you can click little
annotation that i'm going to put right
here and yeah so i picked 10 questions
today because i don't want this video to
get way too long and stuff and I mostly
pick questions that have like thumbs up
and stuff because I know that that's
what most people wanted me to answer so
if I didn't pick your question don't
worry i'll probably do more of these in
the future if you like them so i have
pictures of all of them on my ipod touch
here I don't have the iphone yet I'm
getting in a few weeks but anyways um I
just took pictures of the comments that
had the questions that i was going to
answer so the first question that i'm
going to answer was actually my favorite
question um so congratulations to the
person i asked us this was my favorite
because i asked us ask me like why no
weird questions and i love this one so
basically it is if you were a chair and
any celebrity worth sit on you which
celebrity would you want to sit on you
so basically what I think this question
is saying is what celebrity do you find
the hottest because if you think about
it have you ever seen a hot guy with a
bad but like you'd obviously want
someone with a nice spot to sit on you
right and like I have never seen a
perfectly hot guy with like a nasty segi
but it just doesn't happen like that so
I'm just gonna answer with my favorite
guy celebrity right now you guys might
know that I was obsessed with a sack I
front for a while and i still love zach
and everything but i have found a new
man to replace app I'm sorry Zach I mean
not that he's exactly like lining up at
my door for me or anything but okay um
two words jesse metcalfe AKA god ok if
you don't know who jesse metcalfe is you
need to google him because he is perfect
ok he is like my type in a guy am I
actually watched the movie John Tucker
and wash to die for the first time and
then I
and Jesse Metcalfe is John Tucker in
that movie and the movie kind of
software was kind of lame but the fact
that he was in it and he was the main
character I'm dead serious I could watch
that movie 10 times in a row in not get
bored so go Google um jesse metcalfe and
john tucker must die after that because
he looks hotter when he was younger and
he will thank me later okay so this next
question is one that I'm not really good
at completing in so but had so many
thumbs up that I was like okay whatever
and it's my first kiss experience all
I'm gonna say is I was like six or seven
and it was with a friend okay this next
question is how do i earn money is only
from youtube or do i have another job
okay so i do earn money from YouTube
some of you guys might not know that but
basically everyone that that is a
partner um earns money and if you go to
someone's channel and they have like a
banner at the top of their and money
okay and I'm not going to tell you guys
how much it is it really differs for
everyone but I am 15 I plan on getting a
job once i can drive so once i'm 16 i
will try and get a job i'm not going to
just like try to use YouTube as a job
because I feel like everyone should have
like an actual actual like job in their
lifetime so yeah I will get a job once I
can drive to wait because my both my
parents work and it would be kind of
difficult for them to drive me I'm only
child so I don't have a sibling nekkid
I'm hear anything so yeah my job right
now is YouTube that tired money but um I
will get a job you know once I can drive
ok the next question is how do i
maintain my 99 average um i actually
have a 98 now my whole overall yearly
average all my average is average
together all my finals and stuff it came
out to a 98 so I don't have any not
anymore but yeah I have a 98 I'm pretty
happy with that I actually got in the
top 10 for my grade and there's like 500
kids in my grade so I was really happy
about that um I don't know what like
number i've also anything but yeah so
how do i maintain my average I don't
know I've always been like school has
always come pretty easily to me um but
all I can lease a is listen in class
and I don't know I mean so if something
doesn't interest you like global for me
when you're gonna have a test make sure
you read over all your notes and it
really helps to like reread the chapter
in the book if the class gives you a
book um you just want to focus really
hard on things and that's all i can say
i might do a separate video on that like
once school comes back around okay this
hair is really ugly yeah my hair's
natural by the way so don't mind this um
but yeah I don't know if schools always
come pretty easily to me so sorry if
that doesn't help you ok the next
question is what do I want to be when I
get older what do I want my career to be
you know that kind of thing so I've
always really liked reading and writing
i'm a huge like reading writing person
so i know i always want to do something
with that and obviously i really like
fashion and beauty and all that stuff so
i would love love love to work it like a
fashion magazine my dream job like
working at seventeen or Teen Vogue girl
like lucky or any of those magazines
that would be amazing i know that super
hard to do everyone wants those jobs but
i'm really hoping that um i can in turn
it in one of those magazines first I
feel like that'd be awesome so that's my
dream job I would love to do that so
much um so yeah okay so this next
question is why do I want to start
making YouTube videos and I'm going to
kind of add on their stuff into this one
because I got a bunch of questions like
kind of related to this question so I
really don't know how I found out about
like the beauty community I don't know I
think I might have started like how to
do a fishtail married or something like
that and then I just kind of kept coming
across videos so I decided hey I could
do that that'd be cool so I made a
channel without telling my parents first
which if you want to make a channel
don't do that because that's just not
going to help you they're gonna find out
eventually so I eventually told my mom
she in my dad they all found out and
they're really supportive of me I feel
like if your parents don't want you to
make a channel don't go against it
behind their back you need to like ease
into it and don't like push it on them
maybe you could show other people's
videos that you watch and show them like
exactly what you'd be doing because I
know parents don't like understand like
the internet sometimes
mind oh if they're watching this sorry
but um you know sometimes I don't really
understand what you're talking about and
you know like if you had a kid make you
up to a new life hey night with some
videos of me on the internet like you
know so you know you just want to show
them example what you're going to be
doing sit down and talk to them and be
like it's something I really want to do
you can watch the videos which is
awkward my parents watch my videos which
is the most awkward thing ever but um
you know it would help them and they'll
probably want you or like trust you
won't let you do it if you kind of like
do that so I guess I hadn't answered a
lot of questions in that but yeah okay
this question also goes along with like
YouTube obviously okay does everyone at
your school will know about your YouTube
and do you get teased at all all right
when I say everyone in my school was
about my youtube I'm not exaggerating um
a few of my friends first found out when
i first started because i'm pretty sure
i posted my link on our website called
poly boy that i was obsessed with at the
time and like two of my friends helped
me on that but i didn't think they see
it and they did and then one girl to
like everyone so uh like all my group of
friends found out which was ok as my
friends but that it kind of exploded
everyone knows and I do get teased about
it like honestly I don't care if you're
gonna make a youtube channel you cannot
care about people caring because
honestly what is it matter if they're
going to tease you about it you
shouldn't care about them anyways like I
think you'll realize I don't care
anymore like they'll still tease me live
ago seriously so sure they're probably
watching this and know who I'm talking
about um but you know whatever and like
even my teachers know okay that was
awkward like I got over kids annoying
but once my teacher started asking about
it that was really awkward but anyways
gonna use cut a guide be confident and
if you like doing what you're doing
which I do you can't let other people
get to you and yeah okay the next
question is what's my favorite store to
shop at and my favorite store is urban
outfitters you guys probably know that I
get a ton of stuff from there and I just
really like all the clothes they're like
I just like them a time and that's my
favorite story i also love brandy
melville which is really popular around
YouTube all of a sudden I knew about
that store forever ago
now after like LA I Mattson soccer
everyone's like freaking out over it but
i really love brandy melville it's kind
of like urban outfitters I really like
that kind of like hipster style i am not
a hipster ok not a hipster but i like
the clothes and stuff i also love the
website nasty gal but it's my expenses
like all of those kind of styles i would
the same that's kind of like my favorite
store but moving outfitters is
definitely my favorite ok the next
question is what is my favorite food /
snack okay I love food food is like my
boyfriend because you guys probably know
I don't have a boyfriend um food is my
boyfriend so you know me and fruit of a
special bond so it's kind of hard
getting into this question but first
favorite like deserty food is s'mores I
love s'mores I like this so good and
it's so fun like making out a campfire
like if I have a bonfire with my friends
and stuff I'm not the only one eating
s'mores but you know what I can't stop
myself they're so good and the second
favorite food of mine is fettuccine
alfredo it is so bad for me it's awful
but it tastes like heaven so yeah throws
my two favorite foods ok the last
question is what is my favorite brand of
jeans / ones that make my butt look best
okay I don't know how they make my butt
look but um my favorite jeans by far our
abercrombie jeans I know they can be
pricey I give my abercrombie kids
because I'm pretty small and I can still
fit into them but if not abercrombie and
fitch works I know they can be kind of
expensive but a lot of the times you can
get them on sale like honestly every
time I walk into the store they normally
at least have one style of jeans on sale
and they usually have like Jean sales
before school starts so um yeah I just
love their jeans they're really nice
quality and they don't have like too
much leg shibam going on like they have
like a little design of the pockets but
it's not too much and I love them and I
don't know how they make my butt look
but oh yeah those are my favorites so I
