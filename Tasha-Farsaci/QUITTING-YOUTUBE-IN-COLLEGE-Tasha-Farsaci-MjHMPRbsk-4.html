backyard and I wanted to film a Q&amp;amp;A
video because a few days ago I might
Instagram I post a little picture and
ask to you guys to leave your questions
for me in the comments and I got a ton
of comments so I wanted to answer some
of them now I haven't done one of these
videos in a while so I think they're fun
to do once in a while okay the first
question I'm going to answer is what is
my favorite app and I don't know if I
have a favorite app in general but one
that I've been loving lately is actually
really cool because my friend Eric is
actually helping to kind of like create
it at least for the Android and I've
kind of like been talking to him about
it and basically what it is is it's
called mochi and it's emoji keyboard and
it's basically like moving emojis that
you can send the people and it's really
cute because sometimes like the same old
emojis it get really boring so these
ones are really cool and I'm gonna show
you like me actually guys going through
my phone and doing it but there's really
cool stuff like there's a middle finger
emoji and there's like I don't know
there's like a lot of really cute funny
ones and they move and people are so
surprised and you send them to them like
oh my god what's that and it's really
cool because like I know who's helping
do it and it's just a cool kind of thing
so I'm gonna show you that okay so I
have my phone right now and I'm gonna
show you how to get the mogees once you
download the app and follow the steps to
download the keyboard so basically you
go to where you'd go to get your normal
emojis and then you just press the ABC
and they all come up like this and
they're so cute so I'm just gonna give
you a quick little overview of them you
can see them all moving right now one of
my personal favorites is the guy that's
eating right here and that is me okay
okay I'm gonna show you like a little
secret one that you won't know how to do
unless you watch this video or if you
figure it out on your own but basically
if you go down to this little guy he's
shaking his hand and you touch on him
and drag it to the guy next to him and
you paste it in it's this fake little
ellipse thingy that you get you know
when you're typing so if you send it to
the person it looks like you're just
typing and typing and typing and they're
gonna get so confused because you're
gonna be typing for so long and the
other secret one is if you go to this
guy who's giving you like the thumbs up
or whatever
and if you click on that and move it
over to the sunglasses guy and then
paste it in you get a middle finger
emoji which I know a lot of us had
always wanted and it literally flips a
person off and it's so funny and it's
great for certain situations and so the
other app is really fun unfortunately
right now it's only for the iPhone but
hopefully the Android version movie
coming out soon so I'm just gonna put
the link to that in the downbar if you
want to like check it out and down ok
the next question is am I going to make
videos in college and the answer to that
is yes part of the reason I did want to
go to LA for college is for YouTube and
just to make connections and do a bunch
of cool stuff like that so I definitely
want to pursue YouTube and make my
channel better I know it's gonna be kind
of hard with the adjustment so it might
not be as steady or it might be kind of
slow it starts let's start at first but
I definitely do want to make videos I'm
gonna utilize YouTube space and there's
other youtubers out there that I can
collab with and stuff so I definitely
want to make videos don't worry I'm not
leaving you guys ok the next question is
do I have a boyfriend and the answer
that is no I yeah I don't have a
boyfriend like for about a year but we
broke up in April I mentioned it like
quickly in a video but yeah I don't my
friend anymore we broke up I'm not gonna
like say why I mean it wasn't really any
reason in particular but yeah and I'm
definitely not looking for a
relationship right now I'm really
excited to meet new guys in college and
in LA in general and I'm like excited to
like date and stuff so no I don't have a
boyfriend and I'm fine with it I kind of
like being single more honestly but the
next question I'm gonna kind of like
combine two because they were asked a
lot and it's what college am I going to
and what's my major so I've told you
guys the college I'm going to is oil and
mayor Mountain University which is in
Los Angeles California and I'm so
excited I actually have orientation next
week so I'm gonna be there next week but
yeah I'm going there and my major is
communications because
it's basically a broad kind of major and
I'm not totally sure what I want to do
yet
but I know I want to do something with
like media and I want to do something
with fashion but yeah Communications
it's basically a broad kind of major so
yeah okay the next question is what is
my favorite TV show and I haven't
watched TV in a long time honestly okay
the only shows that I really watch now
are the Bachelorette and I watch catfish
when it's on which I haven't like seen
it actually on TV in a while but I
watched like reruns so The Bachelor vibe
I'm not only a fan of Kaitlyn that much
I mean she's like okay but I don't feel
like she's actually serious but you guys
watch it I think my favorite is Ben Z
and like the dentist too but he's a
little girly so I don't know but benzine
is my favorite at the moment if you guys
watch The Bachelorette tell me who your
favorite is but also like I said I like
catfish I like catfish since like the
start I honestly just love Nev like I
wish I can be best friends with Nev
honestly like if any of you guys Nonie
even want to set me up to hang out with
him that'd be awesome because Nev is
like my favorite person ever okay my
friend actually asked me my favorite
Mexican fast food restaurant and that's
really tough because you know I love
Taco Bell Chipotle and Moe's but I feel
like Taco Bell it doesn't really count
as Mexican like talk about such fake
Mexican but I mean like I love Taco Bell
and if I had to choose one would
probably be Taco Bell but after Taco
Bell would be Chipotle oh yeah okay
someone asks any pet peeves and I'm
pretty sure answered this before but I
have new pet peeves so first of all this
one I might have like said in another
video but I hear people fail on plans or
they cannot keep plans straight like if
I have plans with you please do not text
me like an hour before or half an hour
before and like oh sorry I can't go
anymore or like the worst thing is if
you don't text me at all I'm like I have
to text you and be like hey are we still
doing this and then they're like oh
sorry I can't like it gets me so mad
like if you don't want to hang out just
tell me like don't make plans with me
and then
fail at the last minute really don't
follow up with them it makes me so mad
my next happy I think everyone is guilty
of at some point but it's when you're
hanging out with someone and they're
only on their phone and like yes I am on
Instagram a lot but if I'm like talking
with someone or trying to like hang out
with someone I want to actually talk to
them and interactive Emily gets so
annoying if they're on their phone or
like texting people or snapchatting
people the interior time and I know
that's kind of what our generation has
come to but it's really annoying
sometimes and like I said yes I'm guilty
of this once in a while but I really try
not to and a lot of people I think don't
even realize if they do it so yeah so I
think those are all the questions I'm
gonna answer today once again be sure to
check out the app the moji app it's so
cute like you guys are honestly gonna
love it I'm gonna put that in soundbar
once again as well as like Instagram and
put our accounts and everything like
Instagram and Twitter go through see
Tasha but I'll put them in the downbar
as well I love you guys so much thank
you for watching and sticking with me
