hair tutorial for you guys and you guys
have been requesting like back-to-school
hair tutorials so I'm doing one for you
today I know when I'm going to school in
the morning I don't like my hair taking
forever to do and I like something
that's easy but it's still really cute
so here I have a bond it's kind of a
messy bun for you um but I tell you in
the end there's a way to make it more
sleek if you like it like that but
basically it's just kind of messy on the
top I have some pieces hanging down and
then it's just like a messy bun in the
back and I have a technique on how I do
this so that's what I explained in the
video and I came up with this the other
day I mean I'm not taking credit for it
I'm sure other people have done this
before but this is a really have been
liking to do my messy bun lately because
you can do it with any hair texture I
did this with my tears straight the
other day and my hair was kind of wavy
and frizzy today and you can do this
with curly hair and anything it's just a
really great bun it's Universal for
everyone all hair types and you can do
it with pretty much all hair lengths as
long as your hair is a little bit long
it can't be really short or anything but
I really love this bun I hope you guys
like this and yeah so keep watching
first thing you're gonna need is a hair
tie make sure it stretches and
everything so that'll be good for the
luck okay then you're gonna need bobby
pins I like to use big one since my hair
is long and thick but it's up to you
which one do you use well actually
you're gonna need a brush just to comb
out your hair hey guys so today I'm
going to be showing you how to do the
hairstyle and I'm starting off with like
natural hair up my hair isn't really
like this but it was natural last night
and I slept on it and then I went on
like a run so it's kind of gross right
now but this is how I'm going to start
off umm a good thing about this
hairstyle is you can do with any hair
texture it can be kind of wavy and
frizzy like this so gonna be really
curly it gives me straight and it looks
great either way so yeah let's start it
first thing we're gonna do to start off
this hairstyle is to kind of put your
hair up into a ponytail but not secure
it so you're just gonna kind of smooth
back your hair with your hands you can
use a brush if you want to and you're
just gonna kind of hold it there so I'm
gonna do that and I'll be right back
okay so now my hair is kind of slipped
back into like this high ponytail I have
it right about here so that's where the
buns gonna be depending on where you
want your bond to be like on your head
is where your ponytail should be mine's
like right here because I want my bun to
be right there so you guys probably all
know how to do like that pull through
bun where you start doing a ponytail and
then you don't pull your hair through
all the way it has a little bun and
we're gonna do that today what you're
gonna make the bun a really really small
barely pull it through it all and that's
gonna be like a main part to our button
so I'm gonna show you doing me you're
doing that right now I'm gonna try to
keep this a new frame but we'll see how
that goes
okay see as you can see I have this
little tiny bun right here and then the
rest of the hair is just hanging down
okay I hate when the hair hangs down so
I'm definitely gonna do something with
this but I'm just gonna do is kind of
wrap it it on the bun and wrap it around
the ponytail holder just like this
your hair might not be long enough to go
all the way around that's fine and then
you're just gonna use your bobby pin to
secure the hair that you just wrapped
around so I'm gonna do that and I'll be
right back okay so once you're done you
bun should look something like this
and I personally don't like my hair
slicked back to my head like this if you
do you're done right now
but if you like me and you don't like
that I'm just gonna pull mine forward a
little bit so you can see that I'm kind
of loosening it up and pulling it and
making it just a little bit more messy
because I like my buns to be messy I
don't like them to be like to put
together and I'm just gonna pull down
some pieces from the front of my head to
kind of frame my face and just make it a
little bit more messy and effortless you
know and then just keep pulling until
you like how it looks I'm looking over
here because I have them here right here
so okay so this is the final look you've
got some hair hanging down some kind of
Messier on the top and then you've got
your bun in the back this bun by all
means is not very neat and tidy if you
want it to be really neat you might want
to dampen your hair and then kind of
like twist it around the ponytail but I
like mine to be kind of messy with
pieces hanging down and stuff like it is
here if you don't like that then that's
perfectly fine but I like it a lot so
hope you guys like this head tutorial
