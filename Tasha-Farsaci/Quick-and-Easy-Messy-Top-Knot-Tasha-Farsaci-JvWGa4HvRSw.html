tutorial for you it's probably the
quickest hair tutorial i have ever ever
done it's just this messy kind of high
top nap on and i love it this is perfect
for the days when you do not feel like
doing your hair and you want to just
roll out of bed and go wherever you
going it's also great for if your hair's
kind of greasy because it slicked back
like honestly no one's gonna be looking
that hard so I just think it's really
like you it's so easy and you only need
two things I'm gonna need is a hate I'm
you know your standard hair tied
whatever you like to use and some bobby
pins I use these big fat ones because I
have a lot of a long thick hair but you
know depending on your hair type you
might not have to use these ones you can
probably use regular ones this works I'm
pretty much every hair length as long as
you have hair you know to about this
length obviously it's not going to turn
out the same for everyone I have really
long hair so you know my bun might be a
little bigger than yours it kind of just
varies with everyone that's why I like
it they never turns out the same each
time which i think is kind of cool so if
you want to learn how to do this bun
then keep watching ok so the first thing
you want to do for this tutorial is put
your hair up in a high ponytail
depending on how high you want your bond
is kind of how how you're going to do
your ponytail I like mine high so I'm
going to do it really high on the top of
my head but if you would want your
bottom back here maybe even just like
right there that's why you're going to
want to put your ponytail so once you
get your hair to your desired height
you're just going to tie it off with
your hair elastic now we're going to
start with the bun so what you don't
want to do is take your ponytail and
you're going to want to twist it a
little bit not all the way down and I'm
just going to start to wrap it around
the ponytail holder itself and then this
not twisted hair you kind of want to
hold down your bun and continue wrapping
and once you get it kind of the shape
you want it you're going to want to
start Bobby pinning it into place okay
so once you've got you bun bobby pin
into place you can kind of adjust it to
how you like it I like some pieces
sticking out so i might pull a few out
and kind of just loosen up the bun a
little bit depends on you know the vibe
you're going for a gas and then you can
kind of pull out some fun pieces and
your hair I just like to do that so it
doesn't look as polished but basically
this is what you got I think it's really
cute it's perfect for those days when
you don't want to do your hair and you
want a roll out of bed and go to school
so yeah I really like how he's annoying
baby hairs like me I like to personally
a bobby pin them up in the back because
I hate how these look like why are these
here I look like I have a rat tail and
those things make me want to cry
so hope you guys enjoyed this hair
tutorial I know it was really easy and
really quick but I still want to show
you guys because I think it's really
cute if you have any more requests for
hair tutorials or even any other videos

doing hair videos and stuff but I can
never really come up with ideas so if
you even have a specific picture you
want to send me a link to or tag mean it

love to try them out because I'm always
looking forward to trying new hairstyles
and turn them to you guys so yeah once
again I hope you guys enjoyed this if

likely to see it on Instagram because
