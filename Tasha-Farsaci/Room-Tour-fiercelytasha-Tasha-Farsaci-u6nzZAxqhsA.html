video for you or at least I hope so I'm
going to be doing a room tour and this
has been requested ever since I first
started making videos and I never got
around to it mainly because I never
really liked my room and I still don't
love my room I'm not gonna lie but I
have been a terrible terrible youtube
lately and I just wanted to kind of try
and make up for it by doing a very
requested video so I guess I don't let
them to it it's not perfect like I
didn't really know how to film it all
like nicely but um it gives you a just
in my room and I don't know I thought
maybe you guys would like it once again
my room is not perfect but you know I'm
grateful that I have room obviously um
there are things that I would change but
I still decided I would do this video
and show you guys okay so when you first
walk into my room this is what you see
and I'll kind of just give you an
overview right now so like I said I
don't love my room and that's why I
haven't done a room tour before but you
know it is what it is so once you first
walk into the door this is the side of
the room I have my mirror that should be
painted but we haven't gotten around to
painting it yet because the weather is
so crappy and above the mirror I have
four little new tile things and I got
those from Ikea and they're purple and
blue kind of teal because that's kind of
the theme of my room
but yeah the near I got like a garage
sale so I don't know where that is
probably generally but I don't want you
to see me in it so I'm not gonna get any
closer because I look disgusting at the
moment
okay next Amir I have this little thing
in my corner and I honestly don't even
know what you would call it it's just
where I throw all my crap basically I'm
not going to open it on top of it I have
a ton of candles because I'm like a
candle hoarder and most of them I bath
and Bodyworks except this one that I
believe it's from Walmart but they're
mostly the Christmas cents because those
are my favorite and I just have to get
around to burning them next to that
little thing I have my
vanity and you can kind of see me in it
cute outfit right um but this chair does
not go with it at all I've been meaning
to get a new chair and I kind of once
again just have not gotten around to it
so don't mind the chair but this is the
vanity it's from Target and it's where I
store my makeup and do my makeup and
have my perfume and stuff so I would get
closer there's my name tag for work this
I just kind of keep a bunch of crap in
I'm at the moment I have some cough
drops because I was recently sick here
are just the perfumes that I wear some
pink body sprays an hour ed hardy rip
off one I have fantasy by britney spears
DKNY be Delicious Harajuku Girls this
one smells like coconut it's nice
Pallister Malaya it's like my favorite
and my very favorite people that you see
in your candle for the sake of this
video this is vanilla bean Noel I have
my mirror that I do my makeup in that
has tons of fingerprints on it
YUM I've got my naked 2 palette this go
top a coral benefit thing and my MAC
eyeshadow palette and then over here I
have some motions deodorant and on this
ratchet thing I keep my brushes in and
that once again I was going to get
something for and I didn't
moving on to my bed area right here this
little thing the white thing right here
is also from Target I'm not really fancy
in my room decor
um but I guess I will kind of get closer
to show you up here on the top I have
some tissues because like I said I was
just sick I'm right in water that I'm
currently drinking it is dragon fruit
YUM and I have my phone it's the iPhone
4s because I've not lived in the five
life okay in the first little section I
just have these like geode rock things
cuz I think they're cool and my dad's
friend gave them to me I have some
chocolate at my retainer in a bookmark
and I have my trashcan which is kind of
gross so yes very interesting I know
okay moving on to my actual bed I don't
have a headboard or that is also
something I've been meaning to get but
at this point I probably won't because
Kyle
like just a year but I have this poster
above my bed of New York City and I just
think I got that online somewhere
because I Love New York and as you can
see lining my whole room of these lights
they're just Christmas lights and my
parents put them up for me
and there's one wall where they don't
work but don't mind that I have this
little lamp here that I believe is also
from Target and there is my bed overview
okay coming in from this side my pillows
are just like purple pillowcases I have
these Chevron ones from TJ Maxx this
fluffy one from Target this T one I'm
not really positive where that one's
from and then my dolphin pillow pet that
I always have there's just another look
at the New York City thing my main
bedding is from Urban Outfitters it's a
duvet cover so I just have like another
comforter inside there and then I just
have this fuzzy teal throw blanket thing
from Target here's just a closer look at
the bedding and I actually really do
like the comforter of my bed that's like
one of the only things that I like in my
room but yeah okay coming over to the
right side of my bed I just have another
one of those little white things on top
there is my clock and then I have my
laptop which I have an old-school
MacBook when they were white this hobby
kind of describes me because it's full
of food it's mainly chocolate and then I
just have some food took a pop popcorn
in here because it's actually really
addicting and it's not completely
terrible for you so yes I definitely
recommend that moving down I have empty
piece T cans just because I think
they're kind of cool and I want peace
tea and I just kind of kept them here I
don't really know if that's gross or not
but um the pink lemonade is my favorite
so I definitely recommend trying it and
then down on the bottom I just have some
random pink thing that I don't really
know what's in there
I just threw some stuff in there so my
room wasn't as messy for this video but
I believe there's like boxes and I have
my remotes in there for my TV
okay the wall opposite of my bed is
where my windows are and it's gonna be
kind of hard to see this because it's
super snowy out I actually have a snow
day today and that's why I'm filming but
I have two windows and up there is my
light this is from Ikea my dad
absolutely hates it but I think it's
really cute and it has cute little
reflections on my ceiling but anyways
those are my windows and I will show you
the stuff in between the windows in just
a second okay so in between my currents
that rod is like messed up at the moment
so don't mind that but I just have this
dream catcher and I got this when I was
in Cape Cod over the summer and I think
it's really pretty and it's cute
and it's just my style so I have that
and then down here is something actually
really exciting a home but it's just
this really cool plaque they sign me for
getting over 100,000 subscribers and
this is in there for you
and I thought that was super cool and
nice of them to send that to me and make
it and so I decided I would hang it in
my room so that is that here is just a
look of the outside right now yep snow
day in March typical New York
okay next to my windows is where I store
my nail polish and you guys might know
my huge nail polish hoarder so yes
that's where this is and this Rack is
basically full so that sucks but anyways
I'll go back I just have like this
little son thing and it actually came
from my parents friend's house they
didn't only want it anymore but it's
something that you hang outside your
house I guess but I wanted it for my
room so I just kind of hung me on my
wall there okay in this door room is my
closet I'm not gonna give you a huge
overview of it because it's really messy
right now and I just kind of threw the
stuff that I didn't want to be in my
room but I'll give you um a little
glance I guess it's a walk-in and I just
have some stuff in like racks there and
then I have this thing and then there's
another wall over there but yeah it's
really messy in here but these are
mostly dresses and jackets and stuff so
yeah okay moving over from next my
closet is my TV and this thing that
basically just stores more crap um so I
will get closer to that on top of my
little cable box thing I have two little
dogs from Victoria's Secret a little
mirror from style fall and some change
on this side I have my headband
collection that is growing at the moment
because I'm obsessed with headbands
right now like wearing them across my
head and I think they're super cute so
for over 21 Urban Outfitters I were
there mainly from then I have this
little jewelry holder thing that I
believe is from you see more of
something like that maybe t.j.maxx
and I just have a ton of bracelets in
here some necklaces some earrings and
then my two Alex and Ani bracelets and
then I have this random little vase with
a fake flower in it just because I
thought it added a little something so
that's that moving down right here I
just have old 17 magazines and then like
cards and stuff the people gave me I
definitely need to clean these out
because I don't read them anymore I just
kind of put them there so yes I have
sunglasses and stuff in there and then
my iPod and iPod dock in the middle my
Michael Kors watch box and I think the
watch is inside I just have some books
that I've read some of my DVDs then this
row is random just random crap honestly
then down here I have some hats and
beanies this is the box I keep all my
receipts in some paper and then just
another example of how fat I am I have a
huge assorted box of chocolate so it's
like halfway full at the moment and I'm
just keeping it under there for right
now just a yearbook and some books down
there next to that I have this white
little thing to store some of my jewelry
it's super cluttered right now as well
next to all that I have my coat rack
that I basically hang my scarves some
coats and my purse on it and Beth there
is my tripod too um but yeah I don't put
all my scarves on here and just the ones
that I wear a lot so right now I have
like my sweater infinity scarves that is
my most recent post it's only $30 from
Target so if you like it go there just
have some green poets my black puffy
vest my other purse from American Eagle
finally right back to where we started
my door I just have my name cut out with
like magazine
I did this so long ago I've had this for
years up here so yeah I don't know I
think it's kind of cute but as you can
see that's the wall wheel lights are out
we definitely need to fix the hose but
yeah so that is my room once again just
gonna do one last little overview I hope
you guys enjoyed this video maybe you
guys like my room more than I do but
it's definitely it's a work in progress
I guess I might add some more things but
I figured you guys would like this video
and I felt bad if we're not posting any
even heroes recently so I thought that
why not just circle it around here and
