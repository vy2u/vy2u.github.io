so awkwardly long on me I can't get them
like they're supposed to be ankle length

whenever I see someone wearing them
because everyone has them I don't want
to have them because they're like cheap
pants it's not worth it but like comment

hi guys so we just got here it looks so
cute they have bags full of like all the
stuff that they want us to wear so we're
about to look in there this is so crazy
so we're about to go to the first photo
shoot spot hopefully I don't freeze my
butt off I'll show you guys when we get
back guys this is so pretty please look
no no - Dom I think it's so long time
and I kinda just wanted to film the end
of this clip and explain to you like
kind of what's going on in my mind right
now so basically I don't know if I've
ever said this but I've never been to
Europe before in my life and it's just
like so special for me to be able to be
here um and like as much as I really
want to vlog and like to show you guys
around it's just been really hard for me
to like vlog and like take it all in at
the same time and like I've just been so
busy and like it's hard it's like really
cold out to take out my blog camera and
like yeah I really want to do it I've
been like so excited that I've been
keeping up with vlogmas so much but I
think for like right now while I'm here
I'll try to vlog like some stuff but
it's not gonna be like everyday
everything I do because yeah like I said
I just really want to take it in and I'm
sorry if like you guys are really
excited about these vlog because I was
too but like now that I'm here it's just
like really hard to do both at once for
me so yeah like I said I'm
try to vlog as much as I can I don't
even know what the footage is before
this like I don't know what it's gonna
be so hopefully it's not too jumbled but
yeah that's just kind of where I'm at
right now so I'm sorry but as soon as I
get home I will finish vlogmas
like normal but yeah that's where I'm at
so I'm gonna try and edit this vlog
hopefully there's some footage in here I
don't even know what's going on with it
but yeah I love you guys so much and
thanks for sticking with me and
hopefully you guys like this video
anyways and you don't hate me for
screwing up blog minutes it's just kind
of difficult especially with the time
change nearly I don't even know what day
is what and like when I'm posting you
guys are gonna see it's like random
times so yeah anyways thank you guys for
all the recommendations you've given me
I totally need to look at those and also
I'm thinking of going to London for a
day surprise so if you guys have any
recommendations of how I should get
there because I was gonna do Eurostar
the train but that's like more expensive
than a flight so I'm like should I do a
flight but also like flying is just a
hassle for me and like going through
security especially internationally I
don't know so please if you guys have
any experience with that let me know I'm
only trying to go for like one day one
night so yeah let me know I will try to
vlog I'm always posting on my Graham my
Instagram so if you guys want to follow
me on there I'll be posting on that a
lot but yeah I think that's a Gretchen I
like about to go to bed we're just kind
of like chilling right now so yeah I
love you guys so much and yeah thanks
