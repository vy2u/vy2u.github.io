do a story time video which is basically
when you sit down and tell a story of
something that happened in your life I
didn't think I had anything that was
interesting enough to do a story time
video on but then yesterday
something happened so as you can tell by
the title this has to do with a
foot-fetish stalker I had and the word
stalker is a little exaggerated because
he never physically stopped me that I
know of but it's still on the verge of
stalker so I'm going to get right into
it so pretty much if you guys don't know
I go to college and I was recently home
for my Christmas break when I got home I
had a ton of clothes that I really
needed to give it up I wasn't going to
my college I wasn't worrying about home
and I really needed to sell them so
basically I have accounts on Poshmark
and Macari and I was selling my clothes
on there if you're not members of
Poshmark or Macari I'm gonna put my user
names down below and i also have invite
codes for each so i think if you use my
Poshmark in my invite code you get like
$10 and if you use my Macari one I think
it's only two but anyways in case you
guys want to look at my clothes or
anyone else's clothes
those are my codes anyways the thing
about khari is they don't take a cut so
I was selling a pair of boots on there
as well as my Poshmark but I really
wanted to sell them on Macari because
they didn't take a cut and I was selling
them for around like $40 because they
are pretty worn but if you guys know
augsburger generally like 180 dollars so
anyways I was selling a pair of my old
boots you guys know I live in New York
State so my uggs get really really used
they're out in the snow and the salt and
they just get worn so I noted that they
were worn but they were still very soft
and cozy so this is where it starts to
get a little bit weird I went on my
Instagram and I saw that I got a comment
on a photo saying are you the one
selling the absorber card I know this
was a little weird for a few reasons
first of all you can just comment on
Macari if you have an account like you
can just comment on the post the second
thing that was a little bit weird was
this was a guy and I'm a size 8 in augs
which is pretty small woman's 8 so I was
almost positive these would not be
fitting a boy I mean maybe he was
getting them for his girlfriend or his
sister as well
something but I thought it was a little
bit weird so basically I answered back
because I really do want to sell these
eggs and I was just like yeah why and he
was like oh can you do me and I was like
no like you can just message me on the
app and he was like it's not working
like the app crashes whenever I log on
you guys can literally go in my
Instagram and probably see these
comments I'm not gonna say this guy's
username cuz I'm not gonna do that but
you could literally probably see these
unless he deletes them so anyways I was
like alright fine like I really do want
to sell these off so I D I'm Jim I'm
gonna read you the actual messages I'll
probably like put a few up here just so
you know I'm not making these up and
this guy didn't seem normal his account
was private but it didn't seem like a
spam account or anything like he had a
normal photo he had like his baseball
team and number and like graduating
class and his bio so he seemed like an
actual person okay so here we go
he goes hey I saw your tall gray I was
on Mercury for sale are they still
available smiley face I said what do you
want to know about the Uggs
he said well I really want them so how
long are they I said fairly mourn as you
can see from the photos I posted in the
low price he says okay yeah I noticed
that
okay and last question or they won
whether without socks this could be a
little bit weird but at the same time
maybe he just wanted them if they were
worn with socks you know so I said would
socks he goes okay
do you have any other really worn uggs
or any really worn shoes that could buy
so this was weird but the same time I
remembered I do have another pair of um
because that are pretty worn that I
would also like to give it off I said I
have a pair of tall chocolate dogs too
that are more worn than the gray ones
which is why I wasn't trying to sell
them because they are really really worn
he goes okay cool would you be able to
set any pics of them on here so I'm back
at college and the elves are at home so
I kept in my mom I asked her to send me
pictures of the boots like I went
through all this trouble because I
really did want to sell these boots so I
sent him a bunch of pictures of the
brown boots and he goes okay yeah I like
those ones too okay do you have any
other really worn shoes
I said no do you mind me asking why you
want worn shoes he says no I don't I
just like the more worn in dirty look
honestly adding the answer for a little
bit and then he sends me another one is
that okay at this point I was with my
friend Ann Marie and I was showing him
his messages and I'm like this is really
weird like should I answer she's like
yeah I just keep answering I'm like
alright fine
so I said yeah so are you going to buy
them he goes yes I would really like to
quick question do you have any really
worn converse or Vance look dude if I
had really worn shoes that I was going
to sell there would be on my apps I'm
not gonna just like give you my shoes I
said no i dont i can do 80 plus shipping
under carry i can just change the price
to the gray pair 280 inside book at once
here we go he said you have no other
really one shoes any brand
well one my Macari yet keeps crashing
when i try to open it is there another
app we could try to do it on I said you
can send me the money via PayPal and
just give me your address to send it
this car kills me he goes okay that will
work so I saw on your Instagram white
converse are those pretty woman
bro I'm not selling my converse I'm not
giving you my Congress I said I'm not
selling them if you pay me ninety on
PayPal that should cover shipping and
then I gave my paypal email I was really
just trying to get this sale done with
this guy was creeping me out but I just
wanted to get rid of these uggs he goes
okay sounds good
could I ask are the converse pretty one
dude give it up about the converse I
said not really he said could I see pics
if it's okay at this point I was really
creeped out so I said no they are not
for sale I'm not selling any others I am
NOT interested in talking for any other
shoes than the uggs euros okay I'm sorry
if I upset you but I just wanted to buy
some more of your worn shoes that's all
frowny-face sorry I said okay well I'm
not selling any other's final answer are
you going to send me the money on PayPal
or not he said yes I will winky face
could you send pics of the insides of
the gray and brown ogz I sent him the
pictures okay I sent me the pictures I
asked my mom for the pictures I sent
them then he goes hmm okay can we work
out a deal real quick
excuse me once again I was with my
friend Ann Marie and she's like Tasha
you gotta play into this you have to see
what this guy's thinking he's obviously
weird so I said what kind of deal he
goes well you know how I'm going to be
spending $90 would you be able to throw
something in so I said like what this is
the part that was very very weird okay
he goes well I'm not asking for this I
just want to tell you something I
thought was weird the other day I saw
this guy ask for a bottle of this girl's
spit
is that weirded what again I'm not
asking for I'm just asking what you
think of it so clearly I did not answer
that message she sent me hmm I'd have to
think of what I'd want got backed up
once again it didn't answer he says what
do you think at this point I was creeped
out I did not want to sell my boots to
this guy I just wanted to block him so I
blocked him on Instagram I have my
youtube business email in my Instagram
bio so I proceeded to get two emails
from this guy being like I'm so sorry
please unblock me like I'll buy your
uggs tonight I was not having it I did
not answer the emails I then had this
guy follow me on Twitter I know what's
his Twitter it was the same name it
wasn't like a spam Twitter because he
had like followers he was following
people like the sky follow me on Twitter
I then blocked him on Twitter then he
commented on the listings on Mercury and
Poshmark with his same name that was
like his Instagram name after he said
that he couldn't comment on them because
the apps were crashing he come my TV was
like are these still available or he's
still available so I blocked him on
those he then made another account I
know it was him because he commented the
same exact thing on the same exact
photos the username was like ugh finder
and it was like are these still
available I'm very interested
once again I was super creeped out
blocked him did not answer now this is
the weirdest part of the entire story
and the part that actually really freaks
me out so I was telling my roommate
Danielle all of this and as you're
talking about it I get a text from a
random number I said hey so I guess this
happens once in a while I mean someone
texts you hey you don't have the number
so Danielle was like okay look I'll look
it up like what's the number so she
typed the number into Google and she's
like oh my god Tasha it's him and I was
like what are you talking about so she
brings up this page and it's another
girl's Poshmark listing off her vans and
the same guy with the same username is
commenting on them and he's like I was
he's really stinky like do they smell
like feet
and she's like um no not really
and he said oh can you just text me
about them I think it'll be easier and
he leaves his number and it's the same
number that texted me I seriously have
no idea how this guy got my number I
don't have my number anywhere I blocked
his number immediately it's freaking me
out I haven't heard anything from this
guy since yesterday so I'm hoping he
sees this video and realizes this is
very odd and please do not contact me
again as creepy as the situation was it
was also kind of funny which is why I
wanted to share with you but it's weird
and I'm not gonna sell this guy my uggs
yeah so I hope you guys I found this
entertaining if you guys have had any

share weave them in the comments down
