doing a video that has been super
requested by you guys I'm doing a summer
off of the week I've done these during
school year and you guys all seem to
really like them and for some with him I
was totally slacking on them this summer
and didn't do any probably because I
don't leave my apartment and I wear
pajamas for a week anyways this is a
special often belief because everything
that I'm wearing can be bought on goat
if you guys don't know what Joey that's
basically the app I'm entering at this
summer I hope this whole video about it
I will link it down below but everything
and I'm wearing in this video can be
bought on throat so totally it check
them out I will put the link for Jo in
the description and if you all $5 and
free shipping off your first order

gonna lie your eyes some of these word
films on the same day but I swear
they're all outfits that I wasn't warned

didn't look like a piece of trash so

day so if I look the same
