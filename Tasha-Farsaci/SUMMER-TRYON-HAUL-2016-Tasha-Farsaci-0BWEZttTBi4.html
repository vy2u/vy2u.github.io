I know I did one a few videos back but
I've been accumulating some items and I
really wanted to show you if I sound
sick that's because I am actually really
sick a lot antibiotics and everything
but my nose is really stuffy and I have
a really bad cough I think I have a
fever honestly I feel horrible but I
still want to film this haul video for
you but if I sound like going easily
that's why okay so the majority of this
haul video is gonna be closed in
accessories but I want to start off with
something a little different because I
really like it and I've been meaning to
show you guys okay so you guys have
probably heard of set burn because I
have from a bunch of other different
youtubers and I thought it was really
cool and I want to try it for myself so
I finally did if you haven't heard of
suffered it's basically a monthly
subscription for perfuse so it's only
14.95 a month and you get to pick out a
perfume for every month and it comes
this really cute handy vial it kind of
looks like a big lipstick and all you do
once you put the little perfume in is
you twist up and then you can spray from
there so it's super handy if you just
want to throw this in your bag I've been
doing that and it doesn't spill or
anything and it's like nicely sleek
looking so I told people to juicy
because it's my favorite and I have just
went out of it so I thought it was the
perfect time to try Sunbird but there
are so many options
I think Sanford has over 450 perfumes to
try and if you don't know which one you
want to try it I have a whole
personalized twist so you can kind of
figure out what stencil you best for you
and what ones you like that's something
I really like about it it's kind of
personalized just for you so like I said
if you don't know what you want to try
although I do recommend evil ahjussi
they have a whole quiz so you can figure
out what you want to try right on there
why but anyways if you do want to try
out some food which I totally recommend
because I really like it I've been using
this everyday and once it runs out I'm
totally gonna get a new one I have a
coupon cord I can't speak guys I have a
coupon code for you for 25% off its T is
25 I'm gonna put it here and I'll also
put it in the description box okay so
moving on I got some new pieces from
2020 out i've halted on the past and i
really like this stuff it's really
trendy and very affordable for what it
is so the first thing I have from 2020
I'm actually wearing right now it's this
white and gray striped t-shirt tank top
thing and I think it's really cool I
like the cut of it because it goes
really far any year and you can see my
bra lap and what I was asked to make in
my bra laughs they're food free people
but yeah so I really like this as you
can see it's a little bit crowd which I
like and it's just really comfy it kind
of ripped and I really like this the
next thing I have from 2020 I was
actually learning in my last haul video
and some of you were asking where it's
from but it says really cute just a new
colored tank top it's a crop top once
again and how's it go bra hem on the
bottom and then just some buttons at the
front and I think this is really cute
once again with this bra and just in
shorts in the summer it's really
adorable and just easy to throw on the
next thing I got is a noise tank top
it's going to be really hard to show off
but I'll definitely try it on for you so
you can see what it looks like it's just
this cream-colored tank top but the
reason I liked it is because the back is
completely like laced up yeah you can't
tell it all but it completely sets up
your back and it's just really pretty
and this will look super good with the
champ so I thought this one was your
like you as well I got this pair of
shorts which are really cute they're
just a little big on me
so pop a try and wash them so they
shrink a little bit but they're these
really high rise destroy the jeans and a
really cute I think the Coco mom jeans
mom shorts I'm not really
I'm gonna leak all this down below but
yeah these are really cute and they're
really high-rise
okay the last thank you for 2020 ad it's
my favorite thing and I actually posted
a photo of this on Instagram yesterday
and you guys were loving it it's a green
bomber jacket and I've wanted one for a
while because they're really trendy and
I think they're cute and I really like
this one pretty picky and I like this
one a lot and it's really affordable so
its army green and then it has some
black detailing on a collar and then the
bottom of sleeves I don't know it's just
some silver zippers with the black
detailing as well and yeah this is
really cute and it's really lightweight
so it's fine to wear in summer
yeah so I love 2020 out and having like
all this stuff down below and I
definitely go and check them out okay
moving on I got some items from chien
calm I've called in before it's from the
most Asian online websites and
personally I believe that Chien is the
best why do they have so many reviews on
like their clothing and that a lot of
people have like submitted photos of
them where are the cool things you can
see what it looks like
I love Xi'an is my favorite one of all
at the Asian postal websites and they
did sent me this stuff so the first
thing I got my chin is not exactly
clothing it is sticky boob pads because
my monster stick I was going to I was at
some USC frat and might and I was
wearing sticky boobs and they literally
came off like under my dress I was like
whoops and I just had to like stop them
in my purse but yeah I need a new pair
so I got these little sushi in my 94
were more of a cloth and then they were
sticky but these are literally like
chicken cutlets so yeah next thing I got
is this gutting skirt which is super
trendy right now it's just like
literally a denim skirt with like
sprayed bottom a hug I didn't know how I
could feel about this but I thought it
would be cute with like I don't know a
college t-shirt like a game-day
or just like some sort of harmony I
don't know I just thought this could be
cute at a few different ways so I got it
the next oh my gosh
I was wearing in that state mr. grand
picture with my jacket and it's these
shorts I really love these shorts I
think they're so nice looking they're
like a gray black kind of a distressed
short really cute these are small a
little bit small - I mean I can wear
them and they look fine whether I don't
want to get over my butt and these are
small so just to keep in mind but I
think they're so cute and I would
definitely get these into another color
the next thing I got from Chien is a
two-piece set which is actually really
cute I didn't know how I feel about it
but I actually really liked it so the
top is just this little cropped tube top
and oops as I throw it and I'm pretty
sure it's supposed to go off the
shoulder I mean I guess you could pull
you out both ways but it looks off the
shoulder really cute it's inches at the
bottom and then the bottoms that came
with are these cute shorts I really like
that they're kind of public some layers
in the front and then a tassels and
together with these look really cute and
you can also wear them separately so
that's what I love about two-piece sets
I got this blue dress it's pretty
wrinkly right now but I think it's
really cute anyways it just looks like
this on top and it's blue and then it
has a little cut out there and then the
back kind of like tires and laces up
you'll see them a try on but the bottom
is just kind of like uneven like shark
bite fish you'll see what I mean I'll
probably get this happen so it's just
all one length because it's a little bit
longer me but overall I think this is
really cute and I love the color
especially for the summer the second to
last item is this black wrapper and then
I got it I was kind of confused cuz the
material is a little bit weird but I
actually really like it on
so it's this black romper with a really
deep front and then
slaves are lace and go out like this and
then the entire back of the muffler is
leased and I'll try to show you kind of
what the material is all right I don't
know if you can tell but it's kind of
like you know it's good I just thought
it'd be more of like a chiffon material
but it's this really like no kind of
stretchy material I do like it though
yeah so this actually looks really cute
on and I'll definitely be wearing it
the last item from Sheehan I'm not
really a fan of it's this maxi dress
it's kind of like what's this called um
she this is called when it's like this
on the top I can't think of it but it's
like that on the top and then it goes
down I don't know maybe because it's
really think Li that I don't like it
that much right now
I guess he slits into a lot of them yeah
and then there's these little little
sleeve things so it's like straight
across these little sleeve things I
don't know it's not bad it's just not
like super nicely made the scenes are
kind of weird but yeah okay I'm just
going to show you two more little random
things this top I got some Urban
Outfitters I'm gonna wear it to
Governors Ball if you guys don't know
I'm going to Governors Ball date too so
if you guys would go and let me know I
would love to see you guys there I'm
going with Gretchen Gretchen knows
beauty and I'm her twin sister Lucy so
if you watch these videos I'm learning
with her and Lucy so yeah I got this
shirt to wear there I think it's so cute
come over it it's basically like lace
kind of at the top would they get really
deep feet and then it's just like super
cropped with like a little ruffle on the
bottom and on the back is a really deep
as well and less than I want to show she
don't even know I'm showing these on my
videos but this girl lists who owns
