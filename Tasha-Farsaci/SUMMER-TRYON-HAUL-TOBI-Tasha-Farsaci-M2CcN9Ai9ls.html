you are new I am Tasha welcome so today
I have another try on haul for you guys
which I know a lot of you will be
excited about because so many of you
guys tell me how much you love my try on
hauls
so here we are before I into the video
if you guys are not following me on
social media and you want to I will put
them on the screen as well as in the
description box and one more thing
because I know a lot of you will
probably ask the shirt I'm wearing is
from LF I got it during their last sale
I don't think you can get it there
anymore but yeah that's where it's from
okay so everything in this haul video is
going to be from Toby comm which is one
of my favorite online stores like orders
from them numerous times they just have
the cutest xx pieces and all the time
they have half off sight line or if it's
your very first order from them you can
get off half off you can get half off
site-wide so you can really get great
deals on their site so I have a box of
goodies to show you and yeah I'm just
going to get right into it so the first
thing I actually wore a bunch in my
previous vlog video my Lake Placid blog
if you guys haven't seen that totally go
watch it but it's just as black
distressed leather no denim jacket I
wear denim jackets all the time and I
didn't have a black one so I got this
lift a month tab it just has some like
holes and stuff in it which I really
like I think it kind of like grunge's up
an outfit and makes it look more casual
okay the next thing I got I've actually
worn in a video and already in Instagram
post and I love it it's just this black
crop top and the reason really liked it
is because the sleeves are super thin
which I just think in a really cute
detail and this is just really really
flattering so I love this a lot I know
they have this in white as well so if
you like it totally check it out okay
the next thing I got is this really cute
striped off the shoulder kind of flowy
pop this is so cute I think this is
going to look great with some black or
some boy ripped up jeans and I just
really like this eyes like this is a
pretty trendy style of cup right now and
I am loving it
next I got is this really cool shape
dress a little wrinkly right now so
don't mind that basically it just has
these like ladder cutouts all throughout
it not sure how I can see that but it is
a black dress I'd also be great not only
by itself but also layered with other
pieces it's so basic they're just having
a little bit of a flair you know so this
is awesome once again they had bits and
other colors as well if you're not into
the black I got the new blush colored
tank top dress for a fin I really like
it it's pretty simple and it's pretty
short throw so if you're really tall
with my hat work for you I really like
the back because it's pretty open and
the sides go kind of low so this looks
really cute if you wear it with a
bralette but yeah I just really like the
color of this and I thought it would be
a basic that I could wear a lot I got
another sort of shift dress because I
only have anything in this color it's
just like emerald green color shift
dress and how they're just
straight-across neckline and then it
just has a little peep hole in the top
which i think is so cute and the straps
are adjustable and then it just kind of
slowed down so this is so pretty and you
look great was like a baton jacket
seconds last thing some of my favorite
items ever I'm in love with it
oh no its own button okay so basically
it's a slow floral romper I have a thing
for swirl rompers I can never get enough
this one is loci it has some buttons in
the front and it has these like little
flared sleeves goes down into a romper
and that has these ties so you can tie a
bow in the back this is just so cute I
love the pattern of this and they also
have this in just in a crop top version
I wanted to get that one too but I was
like no Tasha kick it to things the same
print so yeah I love this Robert so much
D lastly I got I am so impressed with
the quality is so amazing this is
definitely a more formal dress but it's
pretty conservative I mean some people
will say it's not conservative but later
cuz it's a pretty classy looking so it's
this black dress and on the sides are
kind of like lace up and then it goes
down it's like tight if it's not skin
tight you know what I need it's just the
right amount of tight
you're not like dying in it but it's
still super firing it goes pretty low on
the sides because of the lace-up
material is so amazing so I can wear
this to more formal occasion I think
it's going to be great so that is
everything in this haul video I hope you
guys
like it I'm going to be linking
