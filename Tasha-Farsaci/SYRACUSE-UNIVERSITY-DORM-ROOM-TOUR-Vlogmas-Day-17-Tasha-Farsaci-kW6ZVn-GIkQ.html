believe so
today yes I'm wearing a bathing suit
absolutely so random considering the
ground is covered in snow outside but I
just got this bathing suit in the mail
from red Carter swam because I'm doing a
giveaway with them on my Instagram in a
little bit it's gonna be interesting
because I have to post a photo without
wearing this and it's completely snowy
outside so I'm probably gonna go in the
snow and take a bathing suit photo so
that's intriguing if you guys have any
suggestions on how to not look like a
complete idiot
yeah let me know but yeah this is a suit
I never wear yellow and it's interesting
but it's like reversible to pink so
that's kind of cool anyways today I
meant to wake up early I like sent alarm
for 10 a.m. early but I'm still on
California time so it's like three hours
earlier for me so I couldn't fall asleep
last night until 4:30 a.m. and then my
alarm went off at 10 I physically could
not get up so I slept until 12:30 which
was like I'm annoying um but anyways I
just got ready I think I'm going to a
thrift store with my dad later um you
guys know I love drifting and he's
trying to find like a Buffalo Bills
thinks he's going to a game I don't even
know and it's like a really good thrift
store around here
um I guess like really good flannels
there and I'm trying to get flannels so
yeah I might go there and then I know
later tonight I'm going to visit my best
friend Melanie she goes to Syracuse
University so I'm gonna go like get
dinner with her I think and she finishes
finals today so that's exciting okay so
I'm in goodwill now I forgot to put the
memory card in my camera so I'm on my
phone and I'm just gonna look for like
flannels cuz that's basically like all I
want to look for right now
some like the flannel section I'm with
my dad and I think maybe after will go
to Pat Liana cuz I want to look at the
puppies obviously not getting one but
just like looking so I just found this
flannel
but I think I like like five bucks
really like nice and oversized I just
like the colors on it so probably gonna
get that totally go to post or salute
panels like I only get mine from their
stores I just found this cute turtleneck
for the cowl-neck sweater thing it's
like ten dollars
I don't know commit again but it still
has like the tags on it I think this
would be cute as like a sweater dress or
something it's like a 2x so it would
definitely be oversized on me but I
think that's pretty cute hi guys I'm
currently in the car I'm about to drive
to Syracuse University to go hang out
with Mel
I don't know well we're gonna go for
dinner honestly maybe something on
campus because it's Friday night so it
might be kind of hard to pump downtown
and I literally have not driven since
the summer and it's snowy and I'm scared
to drive so hopefully I do oh okay
fun fact I've had this USC lanyard since
high school and I kept it all throughout
while I was at LMU Just Cause like I had
a feeling you know and now finally a
student so I have it yeah so I'm gonna
drive down there I'm really nervous
about driving in the snow and I haven't
driven like on the highways downtown a
while so yeah wish me luck I will update
you guys a once in there
oh my gosh
whoa well I made it and then I gave mal
her shirt and I was walking and I was
like wait where'd my shirt go and I
realized I dropped it on the ground so I
wanted to get and this happened and I'm
supposed to put it on and we're going to
take a photo in it but now it's like
drench so don't bring a hole in it
mini dorm to her look how cute it is
I feel like you should narrate this I
had succulents up here but they died oh
yeah that always happens so I gave Mel
that sign and these tassels and look at
the super cool dreamcatcher her mom made
to match a tassels super cool got some
hats he got a desk got my closets oh
look it's me post kidney stone pretty
kidney stone pretty kidney stone
actually I don't know pre Kimmi stone
hey wait where are we right now this
place oh oh yeah on Marshall Street
because it was like the only place that
we would think head parking of course we
got fried pickles to share I think I'm
gonna get like the pizza after this cuz
I have to because I love it so yeah okay
guys so I just got home I dropped
Melanie off and then it came back but
basically it was really fun after the
fried pickle thing um I know that
YouTube Rooney Margo I don't know if you
guys have heard of her but if you
haven't totally go check her out I'm
gonna put her channel down below um
Margot Lee on YouTube we met up with her
because she goes to Syracuse and we met
up with her and one of her friends and
it was so nice we just like hung out for
a while and talked and stuff
I should have logged I don't know why I
didn't probably cuz like the first time
I meet people I don't want to like whip
out my camera even if they are youtubers
you know what I mean so yeah we like
hung out with them for a while but then
they had to pack because they're going
home tomorrow so we left and I just
dropped Melo up and came back and
driving like it wasn't too bad but on
the road - it's not plowed I was like
sliding everywhere and it's so scary I'm
really wearing my giant jacket cuz it's
so cold
um but yeah I think that's like mostly
what I'm gonna do today I don't know
what I'm gonna do right now I honestly
need to unpack like okay so I'm
currently on a dorm YZ website because I
think I'm going to get some stuff from
them
okay I always look in like the lingerie
section because they can have something
really cute stuff I always tell myself
and I'm gonna get like really like cool
like fun like lingerie or like cute
things toward a bed or like whatever but
I never get it like I'm still gonna wear
sweats and like not look cute so anyways
but I saw this and one thing they have
and don't get me wrong I love adore me i
buy podcasts on my snapchat story cuz i
just thought this was so funny like oh
my gosh just look like what back can you
imagine just like casually wearing that
like how does that even work like I
genuinely think if anyone saw me wearing
that like guys included they would just
laugh because I feel like it's so
ridiculous um I don't know love adore me
though but that that piece just killing
me my mom made chicken pot pie for
dinner which is like one of my favorites
probably just look too appetizing right
now I don't know where the top crust
days on this piece but yeah I'm just
eating a little bit of this now at 12:55
