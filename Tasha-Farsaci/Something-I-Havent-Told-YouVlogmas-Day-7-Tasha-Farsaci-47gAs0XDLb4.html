dressed yet and my hair is not fixed yet
but I just put some makeup on I have
class in a little bit but it's not going
to be anything crazy like I'm just
watching people present today so I
should just be able to chill in my first
class in my second class to be honest I
don't really pay attention because the
professor doesn't really know how to
teach so I always just end up teaching
myself anyway and then later tonight I'm
a bio and I had that exam I've been
trying to study for so I think after my
class my my econ class today I'm gonna
go me and Murray at a library like at
USC and I'm gonna study because I have
like a six hour gap and I'm gonna try
and study and then maybe finish that
research paper that I haven't finished
it all go me
yes so I'm just gonna like change I'm
literally in pajamas right now do you
guys like cute pajamas because I was
just on Victoria's Secret last night
comment down below and tell me what kind
of what you wear for pajamas pajamas cuz
like I always wear sweats like I'm
always cold even if it's like sixty
degrees I always wear sweats but I know
some people that like canned and they
like weird open underwear you know
anyways I was on Victoria's Secret and I
feel like a really cute matching set but
I always end up wearing on mismatched
the mismatched sweatpants and I want to
wear cute pajamas like I want to buy
them but I don't know if even gonna wear
that or if I'll just continue wearing
sweats so yeah comment down below and
tell me what you wear from pajamas for
my breakfast I just made some eggs with
spinach and then put some cheddar cheese
on top so yeah gonna dig in
okay I just got back from class and made
this French bread frozen pizza thing for
lunch not the healthiest but these are
actually really good and I just needed
something quick so I'm gonna eat this
I'm gonna finish editing my vlog from
yesterday post that and then I have to
study I have an exam at 6 p.m. tonight
and I still don't know anything so
that's great hey guys so I just put a
beanie on I just posted my vlogmas from
yesterday today and I'm about to go
study at once again I feel bad this vlog
ho gonna be so boring and literally just
exciting today tomorrow I think I'm
going to post a Q&amp;amp;A instead of you know
tomorrow imposing this the day after
that
I don't know what I'm saying tomorrow
I'm just gonna film a Q&amp;amp;A because
tomorrow it's gonna be boring once again
anyways something I realized I haven't
told you guys is like how the whole
Community College thing is going like I
say whenever I start talking about like
my college situation if you have no idea
what I'm talking about or what I'm doing
check out my transfer videos I'll try
and remember to link them down below
anyways I'm a spring admit to USC which
means I couldn't start until the spring
semester which is coming up so basically
I didn't want to just sit and do nothing
so I'm taking classes at Community
College if you guys are familiar with
USC it's not in the best area of Li it's
actually like basically in the ghetto
it's in a really shitty location I have
proof
because USC students have free movers
from 7:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. because they
don't want the students like walking
around at night like it's not a good
location anyways so since I wanted to
live by USC and live in the same place
for the fall and spring semester I chose
the Community College that was closest
to USC and if you can imagine like I'm
not bashing community colleges at all
like I think it's such a great option
it's so affordable and it's a great way
to get your education but you can
imagine a community college in one of
the worst parts of LA it's not ideal
most people are completely homeless and
nice but there are just some like really
sketchy people like I don't dress cute
to class because I will get disgustingly
catcalled like I wore a dress down to my
knees and I had guys yelling at me and
like asking me to like get tacos with
them I don't know I'm not even making
that up it's like a mommy like ever it's
disgusting like I hate going most of my
classes I feel like I'm getting stupider
because there is such a high curve that
I have like a high a but I'm really not
learning anything like I don't know it's
just frustrating because yes I'm doing
well but I'm not learning anything like
I'm not meeting any friends I don't
dress cute that's why I've been doing up
for the weeks I'm gonna start them up
again next semester oh yeah I just like
never really told you guys I really like
don't like the whole Community College
thing and if you are trying to do what
I'm doing you don't mind going to like
not the best Community College yeah I go
to LA TTC but most finger Mets go to
Santa Monica
I just didn't feel like commuting there
every day so yeah I'm glad I'm almost
done anyways yeah I'm gonna go study now
hopefully I can get this biology stuff
down before my exam at 6 and then after
that I need to go to the grocery store
because I have to do a cooking project
maybe I will fall out tomorrow then I
don't know we'll see I had to have
people to grocery store and I'm probably
gonna try and go to the gym tonight
because I haven't worked out in a while
before I forget I know I was just like
saying I didn't like my community
college but I do want to stress that
some people are super nice and great and
most people are there's just you know a
few sketch balls uh especially like when
I'm leaving at night class it's like not
ideal but we had to do these
presentations mine is on Thursday and
basically it's called like a special
event and you just like do something
kind of entertaining and then that kind
of has to do with the year I don't know
like the assignments in these classes
are very broad but anyways this guy did
like this whole game show kind of thing
and then if you got an answer right he
handed out presents that he wrapped for
everyone and like he made enough for the
entire class and he gave everyone
wrapped presents so that's like the
cutest thing I've ever seen like that
was so nice he said everything that he
wrapped was like kind of school related
and I got this little notebook that's so
cute oh my gosh shout out to him that's
literally adorable so I just got out of
my exam don't think it went to well I'm
about to go to the grocery store because
I need to pick up some stuff for cookies
I'm gonna make for presentation so I'm
just waiting for my uber please look at
the fountains
so extra but ya gotta get my boo now I
look like a tow they they decorated the
tree
it wasn't decorated a few days ago but
it looks so pretty now hey guys so it's
actually the next day now I realized I
never really ended off the vlog from
yesterday and I'm thinking that vlog
from yesterday I was really boring or
really short so basically what I did
after I showed you guys I was going to
crochet store and I got the stuff and
then I went to the gym and then I passed
out I was so tired I apologize if this
vlog was boring I hope you guys enjoyed
it anyways but I love you guys so much
and thank you for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
