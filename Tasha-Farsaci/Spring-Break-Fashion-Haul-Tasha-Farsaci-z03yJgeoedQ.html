the haul video from when I went to
Florida over spring break and a lot of
you guys were asking me why when I went
to West Palm Beach so yeah if that means
anything to you guys and I had a good
time I did a lot of shopping more than I
actually planned I'm doing but yeah I
was saving all my money a lot I bought
pretty much everything on my own and
yeah so I'm video right into this
because this is a ton of stuff and yes
so here we go the first two things
aren't really specifically from any
stores so I'm just gonna show them now
they're both bracelets because like I
said I'm gonna start stacking bracelets
this is what I made so the first one is
just this leather braided bracelet and I
got this from like a little street
vendor on like this craft show thing I
went to and it's just leather and it's
braided and it's really pretty and I
really like this just for like stacking
on my wrists and stuff and yeah this
next one I got it's actually really
funny because I was on Etsy and I found
be like the exact same bracelet and I
was about to order it but I didn't want
to order until I got back just because
whatever and then I was in like a store
called wings and it's basically just
like you know like those tourist shops
and they have like the name of the place
you went to on like all the shirts and
stuff well this one was massive and it
had like bracelets and stuff so I
decided to look at them and they had
this bracelet and I know this might not
be some of your style but I actually
really like skulls and I'm not like oh
my god yeah or anything but I really
like this and I thought it was really
cool so basically it's this bracelet it
has like these bright purple skull beads
on it and it's just like kind of woven
in and then it has like little knots
between each skull and then it has like
a little adjusting thing when you pull
them and my wrist is really small so I
had to adjust it all the way but I think
this is really cute and it's really
unique and I'm so glad I found this
because I was gonna order it off a tee
but um yes so I really like this I think
I'm gonna start off with the stores that
I got the least from just because I
don't know how to get those out of the
way so the first one I'm going to do
with Urban Outfitters okay I actually
planned on getting a lot from moving
Outfitters and then when I went in there
there wasn't really much that I wanted
so I just got two things the first thing
was something that I would want it to
get anyways and it's just a black band
oh I wanted a lace one and I wanted a
black one just because they're like a
staple
Pease and I can wear this under my stuff
in the summer instead of wearing like a
whole human stuff and this was $14 which
is kind of expensive for this but it was
a really good one and it was like
exactly what I was looking for so I got
that the next thing I got from Urban
Outfitters I don't actually love but it
was really cheap it was only $9.99 which
is crazy for Urban Outfitters and it's
definitely in trend for this season and
it's basically this neon yellow lease
tank top and it's showing up like not
the right color on camera it is neon
yellow which isn't my favorite color but
once again it's a really huge trend and
I don't know it will look good with a
pair of pants I bought which I will show
you and yeah it's just like a Razorback
and then it's lace and I like it I mean
I know it's not like my favorite thing I
got or anything but I still really like
it and once again it was only $9.99 on
sale so yeah okay next I want to ever
come me kids because you guys might know
that I'm like tiny just like in general
so I fit into their shorts and jeans and
I want a new pair of like white shorts
because the ones I have are kind of
awkward on me like I'm not short enough
but they're like not long enough to be
long shorts they're kind of baggy
they're just awkward so I wanted a new
pair and they're probably really short
but I wear short shorts I've mentioned
that in video before so you don't need
to come up with a short but basically
they just white they have their
distressed a little bit and then they're
cuffed and yeah um I really like these
and it was like 40% off the entire
stores so these were a pretty good deal
next I went to American Eagle and that's
not usually the storage shop at just
because that's where like everyone in my
school shops and I wonder the same
clothes as everyone else but I just got
a nude band oh because they didn't have
a nude wedding my size at Urban
Outfitters and I actually really like
this one and it's just lace and nude
which doesn't match me right now but
it's still really nice and this will be
great undershirts because you won't want
to see it and I wanted a nude one then I
got a pair of sandals well two also on a
checklist for me that I wanted to get
and I really like these they're really
nice quality and they look like this so
basically I'm going to show you one
they're just like these brown leather
looking sandals I don't think they're
real leather but they have one store
here and then strips across when they
don't buckle and I don't know I just
really really liked the way these looked
and they really could she like it's
really really soft right here so they're
really comfortable and I love these
these are like $30 which is kind of
expensive for sandals but I really like
them and I'm obsessed so I'm really glad
that I got these okay so I also went to
a Plato's Closet and if you don't know
what that is they basically sell like
used clothing but it's like all teen
like fashionable it's all cute stuff
it's not like if you went into like
Salvation Army and we're like digging
around like all the stuff is cute and
it's like from you know our age poop of
my age group or whatever so I found this
shirt and it was only like six bucks so
I was like well I'll get it and it's
just a cheetah print kind of like flowy
high-low tank top and it has a Razorback
and I think this is really cute I'll
have to wear like my black bear know
with it and this was from the brand
cotton on which I had gone to once I
think before and so I saw that the mall
that I was going to had this store in it
so I got a dress from that store which I
will show you in a minute but yeah
basically it's just really cute and it's
really soft and this will be great for
the summertime
so like I said I actually went to the
store cotton on because I knew that I
like that tank top and I found maybe my
favorite purchase or at least one of
them you guys might know that hi-low
skirts and dresses and stuff are really
really in and right now or for like the
season stuff and I really didn't know if
I would find one that would fit me just
because I'm really short and everything
is always too long for me and it's just
like awkward but I saw this and I really
liked it so I decided to try it on and
it fits me perfectly so basically it's a
dress and it's gonna be kind of hard to
show I'm probably gonna put this in a
spring fashion video let me know down
below if you're gonna want one of those
I'll probably include a lot of these
clothes but it just has this really
pretty like rose pattern and I really
really like this so maybe they're not
roses I don't know but then it just goes
down it cinches here and then it goes up
higher right here you can probably see
that and then it goes down low in the
back and this fits me like perfect and
it's really really cute on and I
absolutely love this so yeah okay so the
next thing I'm going to show you it's
kind of funny and
okay so me and my friends have this
thing and okay so a ton of guys around
where I live like to wear these shirts
and they're by Mikey and you guys might
know what I'm talking about and they say
like kind of sexual sayings on them and
we call them douchey Nike shirts so I'm
sorry if that offends any of you guys
but there's one's the l DS guys weren't
it's like skilled in every position like
come on we all know what that means and
then there's just like so like oh my god
you're a tool but they're funny you know
what I mean
so we joke about them and then I was in
TJ Maxx and I saw one for womens and I
was like freaking out like I cannot
explain to you guys because just before
that I had been in the mall and there
was like a women's finish line or
women's something like that and they had
a ton of them and I was like oh my god
but they're like $30 I'm not gonna spend
that much so when I saw this one in TJ
Maxx
I like freaked out and it's just like a
joke I'm gonna wear it to like track and
gym class and stuff so basically you
will see what I mean now it just says
you can't stop me which isn't very
sexual but most of them are or they're
always really like oh I'm really cocky
I'm so much better than you but um yeah
and it just says it in hot pink and yeah
this is just pretty much a joke but I
really wanted it and yeah so if you guys
know what shirts I'm talking about let
me know okay and also from TJ Maxx maybe
I was Marshalls because of this tag says
Marshall so Marshalls maybe I just got a
pair of Nike shorts because I almost
bought these in Dick's feel like $30 and
they had them at Marshalls for like 15
and they just have pink on the sides and
like a nike thing and I wear these to
track I really like sports shorts every
day to track so I wanted a cute pair
because these are cute and they're like
not too long because I hate when shorts
are too long and awkward so yeah I got
these okay so the next place I went was
Victoria's Secret pink and I hope sucks
with it like it's kind of crazy I love
it um so the first thing I got was our
free pair of underwear and I know you
guys might think that's weird to me to
show you but they are
so I am showing you okay the next thing
I got is something that I've been
wanting for a while you know how they
have those like half a zip put any
things and I'm only really picky about
my sweatshirts and stuff so I wanted to
wait till there's one I really liked and
I really like this one I don't have a
pupal sweatshirt from there so basically
okay everything's falling uh-huh
basically it's this pupal half zip thing
and you can see right here how it like
zips up halfway and it just says love
pink and black and then it has a neon
pink dog and it's not really showing up
neon pink because my lights right here
but it's neon pink and it's really
really soft and fleecy and comfortable
and I'm really glad I got this this is
really expensive it was like this is 44
50 but I had $20 to there so it pitched
in for this and I'm really glad I got
this I really like it and it's
definitely one of my favorite sweatshirt
styles from there now so yeah okay the
next thing I got I was also eyeing in
their store but I didn't get it at the
same time I got that sweatshirt I got in
a different time
because at my hotel I saw a girl wearing
it and I was like oh my god I should
have gotten that looks so good on her so
I went back and got it basically it's
this neon pink tank top and yeah I don't
know it just says pink on it it's neon
pink it's really loose and then it has
lace in the back here and what you do
with these is usually they're kind of
long so you kind of tie a knot in the
side and it looks really like you if you
go on Pink's website I'm pretty sure
they're home pages like the models
wearing this tank top and it's all tight
and they're not on the side which is
really cute and I really liked how that
looked so I got this and this was $25
which was kind of expensive for it but
if I got something from that storm I
also got a free tote bag for $5 so I
just paid $5 for this and it is a
massive tote bag that says pink on it
with a heart and I've been using this
from school so yeah and it what fits all
my stuff because I'm an overachiever and
I have tons of crap that I read in
school so yeah okay the next place I
went was Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack
I'm just gonna kind of smush them
together so the first thing I got from
Nordstrom was this scarf and I was
actually eyeing it I'm
and then when I went to the Nordstrom it
was on sale so I was like oh my gosh
it's meant to be so basically it looks
like this I don't have no gyms in my
area isn't that weird it's weird
everyone has Nordstrom's I don't but
anyways it's just like this floral print
and then it goes into like a Paisley and
then floral and it's one of those square
scarves that you guys probably know I
love well you're just holding on a
triangle and I'm like obsessed with this
thing and yeah I think it's really
really pretty and here's a look at the
colors and stuff so yeah I got that and
I was super excited about this because
it's something that I've been wanting
and then I went to a Nordstrom Rack and
I there was a ton of stuff that I could
have gotten there but I just limited
myself to one thing and it was a pair of
hot pink jeans and I got another pair of
colored jeans before that but I'm
obsessed with colored jeans I only I
have two pairs now and I'm so excited to
wear them so these ones are hot pink and
the weird thing about this or the cool
thing actually is in the actual
Nordstrom where I bought the scarf I was
looking at the color deans and they were
like fifty dollars and they had the same
exact colored jeans in Nordstrom Rack
for 27 so I got these ones and they're
hot pink and I'm obsessed with them and
I'm definitely going to conclude these
in my spring fashion video if I do one
so yeah I'm really excited about those
okay next I'm going to do pack sign
which is a new fountain store of mine I
shopped they like a few years ago but I
haven't like gone back and my mom was
looking for swim trunks for my dad in
there and she was like oh they have
collie jeans for only $15 which is
really good by the way so check out your
pack son and I was like okay because at
the mean time I had gotten hot pink ones
yet so I was really looking for a pair
so I walked in there and I found a bunch
of things that I liked so obviously the
colored jeans these are teal and they're
amazing and they're not showing up
really teal on camera but they're
definitely more green than they're
showing up and these are so awesome I
love them and yeah so I got the teal
jeans for $15 which is amazing so go
your packs on they this would probably
the best color it was just like red and
then like rusty orange but yeah check
out your packs on then I got another
probably one of my favorite purchases I
love this
so it is like this purpley tank-top
thing it's chiffon and it's button-up so
it goes like this it's high-low at the
bottom but the perfect part without this
is the back the back is like lace for a
little bit and then it's cut out and I'm
pretty sure a few people on YouTube have
this similar shirt to this so let me
know if you guys know that but this is
unfolded it's supposed to be foolin but
anyways it just has a lace back with a
cutout and I think this is amazing and I
can wear one of my Bandos underneath
this um so yeah this was $30 I think but
I was obsessed with this so I had to get
it and I loved it so much
okay the next thing I got I got from the
pecks on outlet I went crazy shopping
this was not all in one day I went
shopping like few days I think so
anyways this was only ten dollars and I
really wanted to sweat shoot just a warm
comfy sweatshirt that wasn't like a
brand like pink or Halston or whatever
you know what I mean so I got this one
because I don't know it seems really
soft and it's just like this teal color
sweatshirt and it's like this material
on the inside it's not fleece which is
like this lightweight material which I
really liked and it's just like you know
your average sweatshirt but I really
wanted a plain one and this was on sale
for $10 which is really good so I'm glad
that I got this and the last store I
went to was forever 21 and this was
within a few trips I went to like three
of them maybe two to I think actually um
but yeah I went not that crazy I could
have gone a lot more stuff but I held
myself back so I'm gonna start off with
accessories the first thing I got was
another bracelet because I've been going
bracelet crazy and it's just this really
cute hot pink bow bracelet and I don't
know but this was like a dollar fifty
and I just thought it was so cute so I
got this then I got another bracelet
that a lot of you're probably not gonna
like it's really edgy it's just like
this crazy spiked out bracelet and it
has like three rows of spikes all over
it I really wanted one that was one row
of spikes but they didn't have one so I
just got this one and it is crazy but I
really like it and it looks really cute
on my arm so yeah this was 780 so kind
of spensive I'm definitely gonna get my
wear out of this and then I got two
pairs of
I've really been liking like big
statement earrings you might be able to
see back there no you probably won't but
you might know those hot pink feather
earrings I've been obsessed with those
so statement earrings are awesome so I
got this first pair and these are really
really cute they're like beaded and
they're almost tribally and I think
these are super pretty like royal blue
which I love hot pink and then just like
a kind of clear gold color so I love
these in these are 580 and then I got
another pair of feather earrings but
these are peacock earrings and I've
wanted these since like the third grade
like peacock earrings before feather
earrings were like really in I don't
know so I saw these and I fell in love
with them so they're like have a really
long chain and then I just come down and
these big peacock feathers and I love
these so much and these are gonna be
super super cool so yeah I love these
and these were for 80s oh yeah now for
the clothes from forever 21 I'm gonna
start off with the boring thing I got a
pair of black leggings because believe
it or not I do not have a pair of black
leggings which is crazy because I am so
against leggings as pants but you know
what I decided that I would get these
especially used to way around the house
maybe his pants but don't tell anyone
um because these are really comfy and
maybe with like a long straight that
covers my butt and these were 580 so it
was a good deal and I really needed a
pair then I got a pair of shorts that I
almost didn't get but I'd seen them
online I really liked them and I tried
them on and I think they're pretty cute
so they're just kind of like this fake
denim material I don't think they're
really denim but they're kind of like
this light wash they didn't have dark
washing my size and they're loose and
cupped at the bottom and then they just
have a little bow tie at the top with a
built-in like belt thing that goes
around it and sorry they're not buttoned
but they're high-waisted and I think
they're super cute and they're really
comfortable and I really like the bow
and stuff so I got these these are only
thirteen fifty so yeah the next thing I
got is very interesting and I'm gonna
tell you it's a zebra shirt but you guys
are covered thinking okay zebra print
but no I am talking actual zebras shibam
oh it's really wrinkly right now and for
some reason I was obsessed with this
when I saw it and if you like this light
pink color and then
as zebras all over it yeah I think you
tell me what you want to name this one
because we're gonna name him and yeah
and then on the back it just has like a
zipper which I love and this is just
like amazing and I'm gonna wear black
high-waisted shorts with this and it's
just gonna be amazing so this was only
1580 and I love it okay in the final
item in my haul video is a dress and I
actually saw this in one of the Forever
21's I went to public the second one and
then I saw I didn't know my size and
then when they had it in my size and
this forever 21 I tried it on and I
liked it and I got it so it's really
pretty and it fits me pretty well it's
not too long on me which they normally
are it hits like right above my knee so
basically it's just like I keep saying
basically I'm so sorry it's just this
like royal blue dress in the background
with these four really pretty coral pink
mint green flowers on it
it has a bow tie in the middle which is
just kind of awkwardly hanging there
right now but it ties it a bow and then
it just goes down in the dress form and
here's the print once again I really
love the print it's really gonna be
awesome for spring and summer and this
is only like 1980 I think which is
really really good for this so yeah I
got this and I really like this and yeah
so I hope you guys enjoyed this haul
