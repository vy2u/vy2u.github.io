and I apologize if this quality isn't
very good I'm using my other camera that
I really got for taking pictures because
I can't find the charger to my normal
camera and it's dead so i'm using this
one and i hope the quality is ok it
might be kind of weird and I don't have
a viewfinder so I'm just kind of like
looking into the camera and hoping that
I've been the frame but I'm doing a haul
video today i'm gonna call this a spring
fashion haul i guess because spring
breaks coming up for me and that's what
i got the majority of these things for
because i'm going to California to look
at colleges so I wanted to dress cute
while I'm there obviously because it's
gonna be warm at least one more than it
is here it's still like 20 degrees in
New York right now so yes I'm looking
forward to the warm weather definitely
so the first thing I have to show you
are a pair of boots and I actually got
these a few weeks ago from steve madden
but i figured i'd throw them in a year
because i love them um they were
actually on sale because I don't really
know it's summer I guess I'm coming to
the summer so the boots are on sale but
basically they look like this and they
are these black leather kind of booties
I guess they're like motorcycle style
with the buckles here and I love these
so much I've been wanting a short pair
of black boots for the longest time and
I just think these will be stupid cute
with like high-waisted shorts and stuff
this summer and i love them now also
with like leggings and stuff but they
are really cute and the best part about
this is i got them for only forty
dollars um which is amazing and they
originally like 120 so the deal was
great and I've already won a few times I
just love how a nice they look and yeah
okay next I recently went to Boston on a
school trip and we didn't get to do a
lot of shopping just because it was an
English trip so we did mostly like
historical things but we went to this
kind of indian reserve place I don't
exactly
you remember what it's called but if I
think of it I will put it right here but
I just got a necklace except I was
pretty and you guys might know my
obsession with like feathers and
turquoise and stuff so this is what it
looks like I don't know how the focus is
on this camera but if you can see it's a
turquoise stone with a feather dangling
and its really cute i have another
neckla necklace it's similar to this
except longer so it's really cute when I
layer them next I got one thing from a
website called boo boo it's in the UK I
believe this is what it looks like it's
like a very kind of purply maroon color
which is like on my favorite colors to
wear it is off the shoulder so it has
these top straps here and then the
sleeves are here so this part is like
off your shoulder and then it's kind of
like a I wouldn't say peplum because I
didn't really pop out but it's just like
a baby doll maybe like ruffles on the
bottom and this is really cute it's
really soft it fits kind of weird just
because these go a little bit more off
the shoulder but it was only fifteen
dollars i got it on sale and had a
coupon code or something so yes it was
good for fifteen dollars and i will
probably be wearing this a lot ok the
next item I saw Laguna Beach love I
don't remember the number at the
Endeavour video but I saw her wearing
this dress in her video and i will link
her video down below if you guys don't
know who she is but I saw her bring this
dress and I knew I had to get it and she
said was from lulu's so I was must order
it and I realized they sold out in my
size so I found it on another website
called Tilly's it's also a storm and it
was cheaper and a pen a coupon code and
they had my size so I'm gonna try and
show you what it looks like I'm gonna
need to get it happen because i am only
51 52 ish and it's a maxi dress but on
top it looks like this it's basically a
fully tribal pattern i would say it's
black and white and then
it just goes all the way down but it has
some slits in either side I'm probably
gonna put a clip it of me wearing this
but I love the back as well it's like
tied I don't know I just thought it was
really pretty and I thought this would
be so cute with some black sandals and
stuff in California so ok lastly I'm
going to show you the stuff I got from
forever 21 first thing I got with these
bangles that you could probably hear
like clanging this whole video but they
look like this they just have some
turquoise stones and them I'll get
closer it's again I'm not sure how the
auto focus is on this but they look like
this and they're just really pretty
silver bangles and I got these in like a
small medium so you can get different
sizes and yeah I think they're really
cute they're really 1080 which is kind
of expensive but I figured that I'd wear
these all the time because i wear my
alex and ani bengals all the time and i
just think they look cute together so
yeah and i like these because you could
just wear two if it were all of them i'm
wearing all of them today but you know
you can mix and match i guess ok the
next thing I got I don't know how often
I wear it but I got a fedora and I know
some people hate fedoras and I used to
hate fedoras but my friend had one and I
tried it on my actually really liked it
and then I was thinking of outfits that
I could win with it so I got this fedora
and it's basically just this light tan
color and then I like how it has like a
brigid brown leather kind of strap
around it so I'm thinking of wearing
this with my hair like curled like I
have a whole album plan do you guys do
that like if you have a plan like your
hair with your outfit see I always picks
you up it took my hair curled but then
I'm waiting too lazy to comb my hair so
that really works out but my hair's half
up half down right now so this probably
look really dumb it wanted to go on my
head cuz my hair clip but yeah I don't I
don't know um
yeah maybe would be down and it would
probably be curled with this or in a
braid or something but I think this will
be cute for the summer I can't walk to
school obviously but I'll figure it out
one of the main reasons that I actually
made this purchase opposed to get these
sandals and I don't have really any good
black sandals so I wanted a pair because
sandals and while i live in during the
summer so i got these really cute
gladiator style ones i'll just kind of
like fold them up so they're black
leather they have she's crossing in the
front and you know three straps here i
am like a six and a half or a seven and
i got these in a six and they fit me
perfectly so if you're interested you
know do that if you have really wide
angles low I don't know if I've ever
money is because these are even kind of
tight on my ankles and I have tiny
angles so yes but gets one yeah but
that's what these look like and they
were nineteen eighty so only twenty
dollars for these and I think that's a
really good deal because they look nice
they have zippers in the backs they're
easy to get on and yes ok the next thing
I got is a pair of leggings and I'm
obsessed with patterned leggings I kind
of have a problem open out photos in
forever 21 on my favorite places to get
patterned leggings so this pair was on
sale for seven dollars and I don't know
if I love them or hate them I feel like
they're either something you love or
hate and I'm kind of like going back and
forth but they're basically this floral
paisley kind of weird pattern um it's
some weird color combinations I'm not
going to lie but I think with like a
solid colored sweater or something these
could be cute um yeah I don't know
they're definitely interesting but I
love forever 21 is patterned leggings
they're really really comfortable on
there good quality so yeah you know
we'll see how these work out let me know
if you love them um don't let me know if
you hate them because that will make me
sad okay the last thing I got from
forever 21 is actually the shirt that
I'm wearing and I'm gonna try and
to show you what it looks like because
I'm obsessed with it so basically it's
kind of this flowy dip dyed shirt thing
tunic I know the sleeves are kind of
flowy and they have little side slits
which i think is super adorable it goes
down to a V in the front as well as the
back and yeah I just think it's really
cute and really pretty especially for
the summer and I want to wear this with
that fedora and some brown braided
sandals and jeans and I think it would
look so cute for the summer so we will
see so those are all the things that I
got for this haul video I hope you guys
enjoyed it um I am actually getting my
hair done and like a week or so so I
figured I'd asked her eyes what do you
think I should do with it I am thinking
of going even lighter for the summer but
I don't know how light or if i should go
much later but um I don't know I think
I'm gonna keep the length pretty much
like this cuz long hair is a must for
the summer for me maybe it's selfish or
layers in the front but basically do you
guys think I should go much lighter than
this I don't know let me know though um
I'm definitely planning on doing more
fashion videos but i like to filming
those outside and as of now it's 20
degrees so i will do those once it is
warmer out but yes i hope you guys
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up and leave comments down below
