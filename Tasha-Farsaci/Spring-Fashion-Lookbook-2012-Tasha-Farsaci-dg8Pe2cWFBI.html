my spring fashion lookbook video I
actually filmed this video like the rest
of it and a different day so that's
probably why I look different there was
just a few things that I didn't address
in the video that I kind of want to tell
you guys before you watched it I guess I
kind of just wanted to do a little
disclaimer because I knew that there
would probably be some people that were
going to ask some things or comment some
things and I kind of just wanted like
tell you guys a few things before you
went and come into bed so the first
thing I wanted to say was that I know
that some of these things probably
aren't appropriate for school and you
have to know that this is not like a
school lookbook video this is just like
what I would wear you know on the
weekends or if there was no dress code
basically like I am obsessed with like
shoe materials and lace and stuff and
that normally is hard to find something
to go under unless you want to layer a
bunch of tank tops which I don't like
that look especially if the shirt is
like crap then you see the tank top and
stuff so a lot of these things I just
wore Bandos under so you can see my skin
but once again it's not like I would
wear this to school or anything these
are just things that I would like to
wear on the weekends or over the summer
is stuff so I kind of wonder what you
guys know that and my shorts and stuff
they are really short but you know
that's just kind of how I like to wear
my shorts and I wouldn't necessarily
wear those to school or you know to like
nice formal places so that is the first
thing the second thing is I know that
some of you guys might not like all
these things these are my personal style
and if you don't like them I mean
everyone is entitled to their own
opinion but if you feel like you're
gonna comment something mean about it
just restrain yourself because honestly
it's not helping anyone
and I personally like my style and I'm
just doing this to giving the other
people ideas that kind of want new ones
for these spring trends and stuff I hope
you guys enjoyed this video I worked
really hard on it and especially now
that school is almost over
I will definitely be working harder on
more videos especially over the summer
and stuff and I tried to edit this one
pretty nicely so let me know if you
would like more of these because I have
a lot of clothes so these videos would
be pretty easy for me to do keep
watching
this first alpha I'm wearing this tank
top with like a shark bite in it which
is kind of cropped and has little tails
on the side I think is really cute and
also has some purple florals on at which
I love
then I'm going a black waist band go
under it since the sleeves go low with
my brown watch and bracelet I'm just
wearing some jeans kind of level out the
crappiness of the shirt I'm just wearing
some Brown strappy sandals with this
as you can probably tell by this outfit
I love color for spraying I'm just
wearing this really free magenta shirt
with a lace cutout on the back with some
bright teal pants which I'm obsessed
with for the spring and summer
I'm wearing some bracelets this one
skull bracelet that matches the shoe and
a bracelet I made and then I'm just
wearing some white sandals
in this outfit I'm going a hi-low dress
which I absolutely love and it fits me
like perfectly it's not too long and not
too short and it just has this really
pretty rose pattern on it and I
absolutely love it I'm going with a
brown braided belt and I'm wearing some
nice strappy Brown wedges
okay in this Alfre I'm wearing the super
cute yellow lace top with my favorite
jean cutoff shorts that are pretty short
but I still love them especially with
the summer I'm wearing a nude bando
under the top just because it's really
sheer and I'm just wearing the same
strappy sandals and the Brown watch from
the first outfit
in this last outfit I'm wearing this
really pretty royal blue shirt that I
wear all the time it just has a really
cute tie at the bottom and I'm wearing
up my white cutoff shorts that are once
again short but I love them I'm just
wearing this with this really pretty
floral scarf I have it also had a little
bit of Paisley and I'm obsessed with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
