here doing a haul video for you so
basically I have a lot of really fun
like springy summery clothes which I
actually have a lot of now because I
live in LA but I have a lot of fun
things I wanted to show you guys so I'm
just gonna get right into it
hopefully Lighting's okay it's kind of
hard for me to film in my room because
nothing really is aesthetically pleasing
behind me I mean my desk is like
mediocre but the windows right there
this little white kind of gets this side
of my face if it's like annoying or I
look weird I'm sorry it's like the best
I can do
also before I get into showing you the
clothes I post a lot of outfit photos or
photos of me styling like clothing and
stuff on my Instagram so I would
absolutely love you guys would go and
follow me I always post on Instagram
it's like my favorite social media
website other than YouTube of course but
Xperia sleek Asha I'll put like my name
right here but if you guys would go
follow me that would be awesome you guys
can like keep up to date on my life and
self okay the first clothing store I'm
going to show you pieces from is called
2020 app it's an online boutique and I
really really like it because it's super
affordable I may have really cute pieces
that are really trendy I noticed with
the website that a lot of things have
different styles as you'll be seeing
some like what I got so I think a lot of
people would like it and it's so cheap
and affordable everything is really cute
and there's tons of different vibes so
the first thing I got is this really
cute just white crochet tank I think
this would be perfect for Coachella it's
really cute with like some ripped up
boyfriend jeans or even like cute little
flowy shorts just really really cute
super versatile very boho just something
that I would wear all the time so it's
just really cute I feel like they have
this in another color as well the next
thing is me 2020 a bizarre romper but it
actually looks like a dress I swear it's
a romper but it's a dress and it's black
and I have these pinky bad flowers on it
and then it goes down and you can't
really see the short - Kailah take a
shift dress but there are shorts which I
think has a really cute touch it has a
nice v-neck in the front as well as the
back which is like one of my favorite
things I think that's really flattering
and pretty and I think this will look
really cute with something black he'll
do these so cute you've been dressed
this up or down and I love it the next
thing from 2020 app is a pair of jeans
and I wore these on Saint Patrick's Day
because of green let me zip them up they
were actually very long when I got them
so I cut the bottoms which normally that
might sound weird but that's kind of
trendy now for like pants to have bra
bottoms like Rohan so pretty much for
these olive green jeans jeggings but the
reason I like them is they have tons of
rips in them and you'll see better when
I show you what these look like on but
they're just so cool so destroyed as an
I cut them to be like ankle length they
are a ton of different colors and these
on line but their high-rise super cool I
am obsessed with these next thing from
20/20 AB is this really cool tank it's
just kind of like your waffle net like
thermal material it's just really pretty
like robin's egg blue or tiffany blue
kind of color my hair is on it it's just
really long and loose I feel like this
is more of a tunic e-street quick to
Nikki but it's really comfy this is like
a bra lat and just some leggings or some
jeans to class it's perfect very soft
very casual and I love it the last thing
from 2020 I'm actually so excited about
because this shirt is so me so basically
it's a graphic tee which I don't
normally wear a lot of but I've been
getting more into them so it says oops I
have mixed drinks about feelings
I love this shirts so much not saying
anything about mixed drinks but in terms
of feelings like girl needs feelings I
are kind of joking 2020 app is actually
doing a giveaway with me and you and
basically all you have to do is click on
the link I'll put in the description and
usually enter your email address and
stuff and you're entered to win a
hundred dollar gift card so if you do
that and you follow me on Instagram and
obviously subscribe then you're entered
for a chance to win hundred dollars to
that website which everything is so cute
so why would you not enter ok so the guy
I bought a ton of stuff from this store
so it's called Irene's story and I was
wearing a dress from there and my last
out for the week so if you haven't
checked that out I would go check it out
but basically I'm obsessed with it
uh-hum I thought it was only like one
store in LA because of the store in
Marina del Rey which is really close to
my school and everything was so cute and
I thought it was gonna be expensive when
I went in and then it wasn't some
obsessed and then I found out they have
an online store so I did even more
damage but obviously like this is my
style it's super boho and laid-back and
like trendy but cute and cheap so I love
it definitely check it out this is not
like sponsored or anything I just
seriously like love them so the first
thing I got I actually saw a friend's
friend wearing it and I'm obsessed so I
got it because I saw it on your website
it is this pink and white pattern dress
it's super low cut 5 no boom so this
talapia shoe um and then it just kinda
like flows I don't know this is like so
cute boho and I love it the next thing I
got is I'll beat up a pair of like
sweatpants this is like the only time I
will ever buy sweatpants I don't know
why I thought they were so cute but
they're pretty much just like this black
and gray
like tomorrow old kind of print and
they're like skinny sweatpants so
they're like kind of tight but not too
tight I've been really into tie-dye
lately my other dress from there that
was in my up in the week was tie-dye so
I saw this shirt online and I really
liked it I don't know why is tie-dye
trendy or am I just weird but it says
very oversized shirt and it just has
this like blue and gray tie dye print
the edges are like raw and I don't know
festive water for it but whatever
there's like a slit in the side of the
shirt which i think is really cute like
a little bit hi-low and then it's just
like really oversized I can go off the
shoulder with a broad left and I point
this a few times already I love it I
avoid this dress the other day and a
bird pooped on me so hopefully I got all
the birds resolve it before I'm showing
it to you now if I can okay so it says
blue and white floral dress and then it
kind of like strikes at the bottom with
like more florals really really cute and
then I love the back of it the straps
like cross which I love the dresses with
cute back detailing so I love this dress
so much hopefully a bird will not poop
on me next time I wear it second last
thing from Irene's story
I got in store and it's this really cute
like casual wrapper so it's basically
this kind of soft t-shirt material
really deep v but I wear like a bra with
it and stripes and then like a little
ruffle on the bottom this is so
comfortable but it's so cute I was
wearing like I'm a ruined bra lap and
looks really cute once again I don't
have boobs so I can get away with it the
last thing I got is really cute I was
going to wear it on Easter but I ended
up not dressing nice for Easter
it's this pastel dress and I apologize
the back this supposed to be tide pool
but like I can really figure it out
anyways so it looks like this it has
this really dainty like
so floral print and then it goes down
and the back is really cool I just I'm
tied it does it looks kind of funky and
now I like don't want to tie it again
but if you can figure it out basically
has like two straps on each side and I
think you're supposed to tie a bow in
the back so they can open the back with
like a tie nice that's what I think I
like this this will make me look really
in with a tail and I just thought it was
cute and easy with like brown sandals or
something so I couldn't resist this I
almost forgot I have two pairs of shoes
to show you these are from zoo shoe calm
which is a website that sells a bunch of
different brands of shoes like Steve
Madden Sam Edelman Chinese Laundry etc
so I apologize that these are dirty but
I've been wearing them a ton they're
these Steve Madden brownie sandals I
don't wanna be the exact name but I'll
link them down below really cute a lot
of people would probably call them Jesus
sandals because somehow whenever I pick
out ground sandals all of you guys call
them Jesus sandals not trying to get
offensive if that offends anyone but
they're just brown sandals really cute
go with everything so I ring all the
time in school and then of this next
Paris from Chinese Laundry and I think
they're really cute they just don't fit
me and it's weird because I'm not too
small like foot wise but my foot like
doesn't fit in them like width wise and
I have a very narrow foot so I don't
know if it's like the style of the shoes
are what but basically they're kind of
like sandals were like a little chunky
heel I don't think I really consider
these heels
I guess they kind of are I don't know
but they're really really cute they just
don't fit my foot right thank her really
bad stop I like zombies on Poshmark
or I'm gonna card or something I'll put
my in my codes as well as my profiles
down below they're basically websites
you can saw your clothes on and if used
my codes I think on Poshmark you get ten
dollars when you sign up with my code
and mercury you get two so free money
ladies and gents am i right anyways I
believe this is the end of the haul
