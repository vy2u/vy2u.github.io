you I know you guys coming waiting for
it because I do them all the time and
it's been a few videos since I've done
one so this is pretty collected because
I've been getting a lot of things in the
mail lately and I've been just been
waiting for a bunch of them to come so I
could put them on a video for you the
first place I'm gonna start off with is
a website calm look book store so you
might have heard of them because they're
really popular in Instagram I think they
have over a million followers and the
website's really cool it's not like a
website I've shopped on before so
basically all the pictures and even the
layout of the website looks like a
tumblr page but it's awesome because a
ton of the clothes are like really cute
things that you see on tumblr so it's
really cool first thing I got is this
really cute crocheted burlap I've always
wanted one of these and I saw it on
their website and I had to have it and
this one is really cute it's just tied
and it's pretty cropped and I got some
really high waisted shorts like the
other day that actually aren't in this
haul but I did and they look really cute
with this okay so this next item I'm
really excited about it's a romper you
guys might know that I have an obsession
the remembers I've been buying way too
many so it looks like this on the top
it's just lace like crocheted and then
it has straps and then it just flows out
into this really flowy like shorts thing
and in the back it's basically all open
as you can see and it just crosses and
this is so so cute I'm literally
obsessed with this and I can't wait til
it actually gets warm here in New York
so I can wear it I got another romper
from look book stores so if this one is
a floral pattern it's more like a dark
floral I would say
and then it has like pom-poms on the
bottom and they're all aligned along the
bottom of shorts and yeah it's really
cute
next thing from the bookstore is this
periwinkle colored shirt and I love
periwinkle I feel like it doesn't get
the hype that it needs but it looks like
this and it's just chiffon and it kind
of has a Kobe neck and the bottom has
this look cute little leg floral crochet
and then the sleeves have a little slit
in them so this is really cute and I
thought this would be perfect with a
statement necklace so I had to get this
especially for the color the last thing
from lookbook story is this really cool
tank top I love things that are really
strappy and like intricate so this one
looks like this and basically it these
two in the front cross it's gonna be
kind of hard to see see that right there
and then there's like two more in the
back so basically it's like a cross
front like top thing I don't know I
think this will be really cute with some
high-waisted black jeans and maybe like
black wedges or something and it's a
prettiest like teal color I'm gonna put
their website as well as all the links
to the clothing pieces I got in the
downbar so if you like any of those
definitely go check them out next I have
some things from romwe first thing I got
is this purple sweater because I love
sweaters and honestly they're very
practical where I live because it's
freezing all the time so I got this
purple one it's almost like a maroon
purple like it's on the edge of being
maroon but I think it's more purple than
maroon and it's just cable knit and then
it has like these really cute kind of
like holes ish in that part and then the
sleeves and it's not very long but it's
not cropped it's just like a normal
length so this one's really cozy and
I've already worn this next we runway I
got this dress and it's a cream color
and it's very wrinkly I apologize
because also the shirt I'm wearing right
now it's pretty wrinkly hopefully you
can't notice
and then on the middle of the sleeves it
has it was crocheted part and then the
sleeves go down like this and then also
the bottom of the dress has crocheting
I got another dress with crochet and
this one's black so if I can get it
situated
it's more of an off-the-shoulder kind of
I don't really know it looks like this
and the top you can see it has like this
little crocheted trim and then it just
goes down and into the bottom which is
also trimmed with crochet so I'm gonna
be all crocheted out if you guys have
been watching my videos for probably
even a short amount of time you know I
have an obsession with the color maroon
so Ron White had a leather jacket that
was maroon and I saw Lauren Elizabeth
had one from Topshop and I loved it but
I'm not going to spend a ton of money
and this one from Runway is pretty
unaffordable in a formal pretty
affordable what am I saying it's
affordable so it looks like this and
it's really nice quality it's just your
burgundy color Lubbock jacket the only
thing I don't love is that the bottom
has this belt thing and you can't take
it off it's attached and I wear my
jackets open so I don't know I'm gonna
see what I can do with that but it's
really you and I'm thinking this with
like a black t-shirt dress or a black
ship dress or anything like that is
gonna be super super cute and I'm very
excited about this
the last thing from wrong way is
actually something they didn't order
they sent me like the wrong bang around
I actually sent me these pieces so I'm
not really concerned about them sending
me the wrong thing because I didn't pay
for it but still it's kind of annoying
because if you guys were to buy things
from there I wouldn't want to get the
wrong thing but anyways it looks like
this it's just like a really boxy shirt
with floral pattern it looks really bad
on me it's old me up I don't know if
it's just my shade but their shape at
the top but I'm not a huge fan so it's
okay because I really liked all the
other stuff
Romilly did not pay me anything this
video is not sponsored they just wanted
me to try out their products and show
them to you so that's been I have a
scarf I'm wanting to show you
from moon cats and I have another scar
from moon cats I posted an Instagram
picture in 84 it's like plaid and circle
and this one's really cute as well so
it's a sweater material and I know it's
a spring haul but it's not spring
outside here it's literally snowing
right now whoo so anyways yeah I thought
I'd show you it's like taupe and black
and white and it's really cute
especially if you don't know what to
wear and just throw it on with leggings
and like a black sweater and you're good
to go so I really like this stuff I have
had this bathing suit for a while now
and I kept forgetting to show you guys
but it's of a website called to die for
bikinis to China for swimwear I'm gonna
put the links down below but it came in
this cute little bag and I know you guys
always ask me where I get my bikinis so
I wanted to show you this one so a lot
of that bikinis kind of look like
underwear and like not a bad way like
the bottom was doing the tops not so
much but I thought that was super cute
and it's a very well made so it looks
like this I got the floral one and the
top is lined with lace and as you can
see this is just like a triangle style
here's a better look at the bikini it's
really really cute and then the bottom
is where it kind of looks like underwear
but I don't really care it's like lace
on top and then the bottom it is once
again just the floral color and I really
don't think it's too underwear II just
because they match and like this is
clearly a bathing suit top and it's
bathing suit material and everything
these are really well-made they're super
pretty and they have a ton of options on
their website so definitely go check
them out if you're looking for cute
bikinis for the summer lastly I have a
few things from forever21 that I wanted
to show you forever 21 there's two
stages where they're 100% on point and
right now they are 100% on point the
first one is this black halter top and
the best part about it is look at the
top of those guys it's crocheted
and it's a halter top and then the
bottom is also has like little little
like crochet ish detail can you see kind
of you'll see in the Triad but this is
also cropped and I'm obsessed with it it
was only like how much was it 1290 so
definitely check this out I'm gonna try
and link this stuff below too because I
just got this next thing in from forever
21 one of my friends actually got it
last year and I was really jealous
because I wanted it and I'm totally
being a hypocrite right now because I go
k-state and even people I know buy the
same things isn't evil like I didn't so
I can't eat that anymore but it's this
tie-dyed off the shoulder ship dress and
it's so freaking cute guys alright so it
looks like this on top and then as you
can see it's off the shoulder and then
it just goes down and finished like is
this not the cutest dress you've ever
seen in your life
the last thing from forever 21 is a maxi
dress and I'm always really nervous
about ordering maxi dresses because I'm
5 foot 1 and they're always really long
on me and that I have to pay to get them
happy but this one looks kind of short
I'm a model so I was like why not
and it actually does fit me perfectly so
I'm very much taller than me it might be
a little short so it looks like this on
top and I'm literally obsessed at the
top it's so cute and embroidered so
here's just a better look it looks like
this and then there's the told dresses
printed like this little medallion I'm
gonna see if I can get this to focus
there you go so this is how the whole
dress is printed and then it crosses in
the back it has like a little cutout
hole right here as well which is cute
and it just goes all the way down with
like slits and the bottom half is sheer
because there's a little slip but it
only goes like halfway down so yeah this
is so cute and I can't wait to wear all
this summer and spring stuff guys you
have no idea so that's everything that I
have in this haul video I hope it
inspired you to buy more clothes for
spring and summer even though our
wallets will be crying we will be
looking
great definitely check the down bar to
see any of these pieces because once
again like I said I'm gonna try and link
as many things as I can if you want to
see me wearing any of these pieces be
