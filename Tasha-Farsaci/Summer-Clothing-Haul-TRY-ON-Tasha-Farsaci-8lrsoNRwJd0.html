a little mini haul video I accumulated a
few things but I'm about to go on a
little trip to Los Angeles for 4th of
July to stay with a friend from school
I'm not on going to beauty con LA with
Gretchen loves beauty so I'm gonna be
gone for like 10 days or so and I wanted
to pre film some videos before I left so
that I would be able to upload when I
was there and I had like a few things
that I could put in ha video so I'm just
doing one of those before I get into the
things that I got for this video if
you're not subscribed to my channel
please subscribe it only takes one
little thing and it would mean the world
to me if you want to follow me on social
media to keep up with my life off of
youtube I'm going to put all my little
platforms right here and I will also put
them in the description of this video
you guys always ask me where the things
I'm wearing my videos are from so this
dress I know it's kind of scandi but I
have no boobs at all and I'm umbrellas
so we are fine and this dress is from
Irene's
story it's a boutique in Southern
California I don't know if it's like
other places but it's one of my
favorites the toilet is from naked comm
and my necklace is from Urban Outfitters
okay so the first thing I thought I want
to talk about is a set from fabletics
I've been hearing so much about
fabletics it's basically one of those I
know they're one of those like
subscription the websites but it's for
athletic clothes and I've been working
out a lot more this summer because I got
a gym membership for the summer and I
don't want to waste it
don't waste my money that I spent on it
so I've been going almost every day and
when I go that often I run out of my
workout clothes to wear so I thought
this would be the perfect time to try
out fabletics so I'm just gonna give you
a little bit of background about
fabletics in case you don't know what is
it all so pretty much if you sign up as
a VIP member you get your first set of
athletic clothes for only $25 which is
crazy because if you go to like a
competitor's or like you know a popular
workout brands store you can't even get
a sports bra for $25 so you can really
get an entire outfit for only $25 as
you'll see
when I show you everything is amazing
quality it's seriously just as good as
very expensive workout brands and
everything is so cute that honestly I
would wear this not just to workout I
would wear this around the house I'd
wear this to a grocery store wear this
to the mall I'd wear this to class like
everything is so cute and there's a lot
of pieces that you could mix and match
with things to have more you know
wearable outfits fabletics have super
flattering pieces for every body type
you can go on there and you know I'm
sure that they have different sets that
flatter different types of people
there's new collections and outfits new
pieces all the time which is great and
the prices are great too I know that
cute workout clothes can sometimes be
outrageously expensive and fabletics
so that's great okay you guys are
probably like shut up we want to see
what you got so the first thing that I
got in my little outfit set is a black
tank because I didn't have a nice black
tank torn out and I feel like that's a
staple so I got this one and the
material is amazing it's kind of loose
and flowy which is good for the gym
because if I sweat and my shirt is too
tight
sometimes it just leaves like marks and
the back is what I really loved about it
you can see probably that it has all
these cute little holes on the back
which not only are cute but they like
let air and so you're not sweating as
much in case you couldn't see here's a
better view so cute and it's gonna be so
perfect for the gym so my favorite
bottoms to work out in our cropped
leggings so I saw these cropped leggings
and I knew that they were going to be
perfect through this super bright blue
color I love wearing fun leggings to the
gym the material is amazing it's so
thick and just wonderful like these are
the nicest quality leggings I have I'm
not even kidding and I have expensive
workout brands so seriously it's so
thick I absolutely love these and then
to tie the entire look together is this
black and blue sports bra and have some
black matches with the blue kind of
under way which is just such a cute
detail and I can't wait to wear this
entire outfit together it's gonna look
so bomb
promotional consideration before this
video was provided by fabletics
okay the next IATA box from forever 21
and I made a purchase because I wanted
this one two-piece set potentially for a
beauty con and you guys are gonna have
to let me know if you think I should
wear it because I'm not totally sure now
if I want to wear it for beautycon but
anyways I wanted that and then I was out
like a little over three dollars and you
know that forever 21 has free shipping
over 50 and I hate paying for shipping I
feel like it's just such a waste of
money
so naturally I spent it off to make $50
okay so starting off with the reason
that I made the purchase is there's two
piece set and I was wearing this top in
my swimsuit collection video and you
guys are asking you where it's from it's
from forever 21 so it's black cropped it
looks like this and then it has some
really pretty floral embroidery and some
lace-up detailing in the front and then
the bottoms came separately if you buy
them separately and they're just like
the same thing with black with the
floral pattern and then like little baby
ruffles on the sides I think this is
really cute I just don't know if it's
dressing it up for beautycon I've never
been to beautycon or VidCon or anything
with that so I don't really know how
dressy people dress but yeah I mean this
is cute I'm gonna wear it eventually I
just don't know if you gonna wear it to
beautycon the next thing that I got is a
same material it's just this black
babydoll dress actually nothing special
but I thought it would be really good
for layering and just like a staple
piece it's kind of like a babydoll dress
so it's like a tank and then it gets to
this part and then it flows out a little
bit more the whole dress is loose but
it's definitely like a baby doll style
it's a really good wag for me it's above
my knee but it's not really sharp which
is good so it's like pretty conservative
I thought it'd be cute with like a
flannel or like a green army jacket or
something so I thought this would just
be nice to pick up and it was only 15
90s so I think it's a good stable to
have okay in the last two things from
forever 21 or literally a random
purchases to get over the $50 in part so
I got a 5 pack of black ankle socks I
wear black ankle socks all the time and
I really hate buying socks I never buy
socks but these were only oh they're
like five dollars which is like good I
know I'm
I wear these all the time so yeah and
then I also got a pack I'm a con of like
neutral colored hair ties for only a
dollar which is a really good deal and I
yeah I lose these all the time so you
know I got these okay the last thing I
want to show you I picked up at Urban
Outfitters yesterday I really wanted
this to wear with some high-waisted
black denim shorts that I have so I went
in and got it and it's just this
bodysuit I've never had one of these
before
but I like the idea of that and I've
been seeing this one for a while and
I've always kind of wanted it but I
never bought it until that I knew I
wanted it for an outfit so I like the
top of it I don't know I just like the
cut I like how its kind of low-cut but
not really I mean I don't have any boot
to show off but I still think it's
flattering I don't know I like it and
it's just my favorite olive green color
I love wearing this color okay so that
is everything that I got for this haul
