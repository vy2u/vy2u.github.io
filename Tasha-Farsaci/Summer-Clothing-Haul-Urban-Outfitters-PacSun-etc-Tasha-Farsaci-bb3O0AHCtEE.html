for you i'm going to call this a
summerhall because these are mostly
summer clothes mostly some of them are
but yeah I've been chopping today and
then some of this stuff I ordered a few
days ago I like a week ago so i decided
i would show you the first thing i got
like a week ago and i actually ordered
it from hautelook or hot look or
whatever you call it I have never
ordered anything from there before so I
didn't know what to expect but I really
liked this sweater so I ordered it and
it's by the brand jack by BB dakota and
it's gonna be really hard to show you i
might put it on in a minute just kind of
show you what it looks like on but it
has a tithe that you can take off so
here is it without the tie and you
really can't see what it looks like so
i'm going to put it on really quick for
you this is what it looks like without
the tie it's just kind of open or
whatever but if i take the tie they came
with and kind of close it like this it
looks really cool with like a little
flaps or whatever I are and then I can
just tie it in a little bow and I don't
know I think it's cute I've been wanting
a cardigan sweater kind of thing that
has a tie for a while so yeah and then
it just has like different kind of
stitching's and I think it's cute okay
next I have stuff from urban outfitters
the first thing I'm wearing and it looks
like this it's just this little tie-dyed
kind of baby doll tank top but I really
liked the back it looks like this i have
a crocheted kind of thing going on and
yeah i really liked it and the clothing
oh my god sorry i have a little door
stopper here it sounds like a fart but I
promise it's not anyways um yeah I
bought this was thirty four dollars and
then when i checked out it was 20 so i
love when that happens and i just got it
in like a kind of grayish bluish purple
tie dyed print they had a lot more
colors but this was my fav i got this in
the store as well as this henna tattoo
because i really like henna and I've
been wanting to like get one done or at
least get a kid doing myself but I saw
this little like um
temporary tattoo thing and he was on
sale from 99 cents so I figured why not
it just looks like this I mean it
probably would look really stupid but it
was 99 cents so what are those two
things I got in the store and then like
a little bit before that I had ordered
online from urban and the first thing I
got is this tank top and it looks like
this it's so pretty it's like uh I don't
know it's almost like a neon pastel that
makes any sense like watercolor thing
and then it just has like this studded
pattern in the front and then if you
turn it around to the back it has like a
little cutout of their last thing from
urban is this infinity scarf this is not
very summery but it was on sale and I've
been looking at it for a while so
basically it has one layer of floral and
one way up is like netting kind of thing
and when you put it on it looks really
cool I award the other day because it
was freezing here um I don't know I like
the effect it give us when it's layered
um yeah so I got this it's on sale if
you want it check it out on their
website and its really soft and I ok
moving on the stuff today I went to the
toy a secret and I just got three
underwear but I'm not gonna take that
out um okay I went to forever 21 and I
got one thing that I'm gonna do a DIY
with I'm thinking so I just got this
crocheted tank top because when i was in
urban i saw a crocheted tank top that
was like navy and pink like tie-dye and
it was really cool but it was like fifty
dollars or something and I wasn't gonna
pay that so I bought this one for twenty
dollars from forever 21 and I have some
pink dye already i'm just gonna have to
get navy and i'll tie dye it and i think
i'll do a DIY because i think that'll be
cool and something people be interested
in because i really like the urban one
but i figured why not just make one
myself so yeah I picked this up it's
kind of big because the sizing was like
small/medium medium/large but um I don't
know I think it's cute and as you will
see in this hall I got a lot of
crocheted things I think that's kind of
what I'm liking really
but yeah I got that from forever 21 and
then i went to american eagle my
princess is hanging a little bit
everything was forty percent off and i
had a gift card so i didn't pay for this
hey it's once again another crocheted
thing I've been wanting a crocheted bag
for a while so when I saw this one I
figured I should get it it's really cute
it's just like a full kind of crocheted
pattern it opens up with a little flap
and then you've got your inside there
the last place I went was packs on texts
probably my favorite store now I mean
either pecks on our urban but our wing
is like so expensive it's annoying
Texans not like really cheap but it's
better than urban so you guys may or may
not know i know i've mentioned it before
that packs on is selling brandy melville
now and maybe not all of that at least
mine is so that's pretty cool and I got
a few things that I have been wanting in
brandy melville and then when I went to
the store in New York they didn't have
them so the first thing is this little
white cropped t-shirt and I've been
wanting to these for a while to way with
high-waisted stuff cuz I never really
know what to wear and they had it at my
pecs on so the other brandy melville
thing I got my bag was this little dress
and it's pretty popular so you might
have seen people have it it's just like
your basic skater dress it's pretty
short I mean it's like okay on me
because I'm short but if you're any
taller than me which is 51 I wouldn't
recommend it the back has like I cut out
I hope you can see it and I think it's
really cute is it's really flattering so
I got this and I think this was thirty
dollars then I got a zip up sweatshirt
that it's not zipped up at the moment so
I'm going to zip it while I'm talking to
you and I'm pretty sure I wanted this at
one time but it wasn't on sale I like
sweat shirts that are cute like kind of
fashionable because they're comfortable
with their cute so I really like this
one it's by nollie and it's floral you
know Huskies really pretty like peachy
flowers would like some gray and stuff
and it's just a zip up hoodie and this
was on sale for like eighteen dollars i
think yeah
99 but it's really comfortable and I've
been wanting it and I just like this
kind of stuff for what I want to be
comfortable but I still want to look
cute last thing I got from pax oh and
I'm really excited about I really like
it it was kind of expensive but I went
for it elements again with the crocheted
so I got a maxi skirt and I have one
it's really hard for me to find them
because I'm social work that they're
always way too long on me and it's kind
of stupid but this one fit hmm so
crocheted again it's basically like this
dusty rose crocheted thing it hasn't got
a little mini skirt under it so it's not
pretty sheer and then it goes down all
the way we'd like this crocheted stuff
and I tried this on with or the little
white t-shirt and looks really cute so
i'll probably be wearing this in an
upcoming up for the week because i
really really like it and this was
forged up forty dollars which is not too
good but I mean I think it's really cute
we and it's by the brand Kyra if you're
interested so yeah that is my whole
video um I think it's a good amount of
stuff I buy too much stuff like I'm
honestly making myself stop so you
probably won't see a haul video for a
long time because i really don't need
all the pose that I have but uh yeah so
um yeah I think that's all I have to say
I be sure to leave a comment down below
what your favorite thing was that I
bought you can leave a video response of
u haul video is what you've been buying
for the summertime um that's all I can
think about but I hope you guys enjoyed
this hobby yo and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
