for you I'm gonna call this summer
clothes just because I need an excuse to
why I bought these things but I have
some things here that I bought a little
less than a month ago and then I have
some things that I bought really
recently and I kind of decided to just
put them together because they're all
things I haven't shown you before and
yeah okay I'm calling these summer
clothes but I'm really still in the
school that might be surprising for a
lot of you guys but I live up north I
live in New York and I go back in like
September so that's why I get out later
I get out of June 12th but I go up until
the 20th because I have finals up until
the 20th
I have biology geometry global and
English that are after the 12th and
they're kind of dispersed throughout and
my last one is the 20th so summer starts
to me the 20th after my geometry final
after the 20th I'll be making a lot more
videos because it's summer and I have no
life so that's what's gonna happen but
I'm gonna get started to this haul
because it's probably gonna be pretty
long okay so the first thing I I'm so
excited about if you guys follow me on
instagram you've probably already seen
them and if you don't my username is
curiously Tasha just like my YouTube
username um but these are basically my
joy like I just keep them over there on
that white thing so I can stare at them
all the time yeah alright I have a
little backstory so I have always wanted
Sam Edelman pumps the spiked ones and
you guys might not know what those look
like but you also might and I wanted
them for the longest time but they're
like $160 and I'm not exactly the most
practical thing for a 15 year old girl
to have so you know I wasn't gonna spend
$160 on them so I had 5000 so TJ Maxx
for my grandma from Christmas I really
had a hundred but I spent fifty and what
I've heard some I was just walking
through Kiki Max and then I went over to
the shoes and Sam Edelman spiked punch
was just sitting there one size my size
and one pair and I went into like a mini
coma
I'm dead serious I was freaking out I
started like dancing on the store it was
it was crazy they fit me perfectly and I
only had to pay $30.00 because they were
and I had a $50 gift certificate so it
was just amazing and this is what they
look like they are nude peep toe and
then they just have spikes all over the
back and I know peeny bunny 97 has me so
if any of you guys are gonna come with
that yeah I know but I love them so much
like I can't even tell you how much I
love these and I don't know what I'm
gonna wear them yet but I will wear them
and I just like looking at them so yeah
okay so the next place I got things from
was Urban Outfitters and I actually
ordered both of these things online I
don't know it's this shirt I'm gonna
show you first is still available
because they got it on sale but I know
the dresses so I really wanted to show
you guys this shirt just because I'm not
exactly sure how to wear it
it's this coral lace top and it's just
lace all in the front you know but then
the back has cutouts and bows all the
way down at which I love and you can see
it's cut out and anything Lacey and
Bowie Bowie I am obsessed with so the
problem I have with this is I wear a
nude bando with it but since I'm a lot
Tanner than my nude bando now it just
looks like a bra and I don't really know
how I can wear something with this I
don't want to wear a tank top just
because it'll look all bunchy in the
back there so maybe get a different
color bando I don't know what color band
wouldn't look like a bra that's what I
want to know so let me know if what you
guys think I should wear with this but I
believe I got this on sale for $20 I was
looking at it when it wasn't on sale and
then when it went on sale I just decided
I should get it some and this was $20
the next thing I got was kind of a
splurge for me
I don't normally spend that much on
clothes unless I really really like them
and I saw this dress in the store I do
have it open outfitters near me and I
saw it in the store and I just thought
it was too much for what it was and then
I just kept thinking about it
so when I went back to the store they
didn't have my size anymore and they
only had it in a different color which I
didn't really like as much so I tried it
on in the different color and if they me
perfectly and I just do I had to order
it so I ordered it in the color I liked
and it was $69
uh-hum which is you know a lot for this
dress and I didn't really know if it was
worth it but I'm in love with it and I
cannot wait to wear it over the summer
so basically it's just this white Lee
stress and the top is kind of like a
corset just because it's tight and it
has padding so it has a taupe outlining
and then a light pink middle and that's
just kind of the top and then it flows
out into this white lace and I'm in love
with this the back has like a nice
elastic so it's really stretchy and
comfortable and I love this dress I know
they still have it online they have it
in this color and they have it in a
different colors to get olive green
which is actually really cool but it's
just not my favorite color preference
but um I absolutely love this and I
cannot wait to witness okay so the next
thing I got is from H&amp;amp;M and I know a lot
of people have this shirt in short
sleeves or not that shirt there's a
dress in short sleeves I've seen it a
lot on YouTube but they came out with a
tank top version which I actually like a
lot more and I absolutely love this it
was only $13 so basically it's just this
Navy and white striped tank top dress
it's tight at the top and then it flares
out at the bottom and this looks a lot
better ah man does me just like hanging
out showing you here and I actually took
the picture and put it on Instagram
today so I will post that picture when
I'm done talking about this but anyways
this is really flattering I got a lot of
compliments on it and it's actually
really short so if you're tall I don't
really recommend this dress I'm short
and it's short on me so yeah once again
if you're tall I don't recommend this
but other than that it's super
comfortable and I love it
okay then I went to Victoria's Secret
and I'm not sure if they're semi-annual
sale has started but they had like
massive sales in there so I'm not sure
maybe it's just like a precursor to it
but let me know about that but I went in
there and although yoga pants that were
full-length
were only 25 dollars which is great
because if you know Victoria's Secret
they're normally like $35 so that was
$10 off which is really great and
bootcut is my favorite they were 25 foot
bootcut and for wedding but I like the
bootcut the problem with Victoria's
Secret yoga pants for me is since I'm
only five foot one and they're always
way too long because they make them for
the freaking angel model ladies and my
legs are not that long you know so um
yeah that just doesn't work for me so
I'm only want to get the short in scene
but then that's only online and I don't
like paying for shipping so I was just
deciding to look at the yoga pants
because you know $25 and I saw they had
shortened seams so I was freaking out
like I was like oh my god it's meant to
be some and then I found a pair that I
really liked and I actually have a
sweatshirt that matches them so pretty
much on the front there just purple and
they have a hot pink dog and then on the
back they just say I love pink in black
and then they're just the boot cut short
inseam and these fit me perfectly so if
you're around my height get this short
and seen because they are amazing okay
in the last place I went was forever 21
I actually ordered some stuff online as
well as getting things in the store and
a lot of these things are basics and
that's because over the summer I really
don't dress super nice I just wear like
basic plain t-shirts and tank tops and
stuff so I wanted to kind of stock up on
those and stuff so that's kind of why I
got that stuff I'm gonna start with the
things I ordered online and the first
thing I got was sunglasses I wanted a
pair of gold aviators I have black ones
but I just don't really like how they
look on me so I wanted a pair of gold
ones and these are perfect they're gold
and then they have like a brownie you
know lens and these were only 580 if you
can read that so I guess I'll put them
on for you I really like aviators I
think these look decent on me I guess
so yeah I like these a lot and they were
a big deal and I'm pretty sure they will
still have them online so if you like
these then check that out and like I
said the next two things I got with
basics um first thing I got was this
neon neon pink racerback tank top and
I'm obsessed with neons like this is
this is neon it might not be showing up
me on but it is it it's just this plain
kind of loose tank top and it's like it
looks like it's just cut it's not really
doesn't leave a nice seam or anything
which I like the look of actually and
it's just kind of faded in sheer and
this is gonna be great for the summer
this is like all I wear into summer
these types of things so I got this and
it was only 980 and then I got another
basic top I got a t-shirt and I don't
really know why I got this but I like it
I tried it on it was really cheap so
it's just this mint green t-shirt which
I like mint green a lot it's a really
trendy color for the spring as well and
it's really loose it has this massive
pocket in the side just short sleeve and
it's like big and baggy and I really
really like this I feel like this would
look really cute with some denim
high-waisted shorts and those aviators
and stuff but yeah just I love the big
pocket that's I think what's told me and
the color and it's just really really
cute it's probably looking like boxy but
it's actually really like you so I
really like this and it was 1180 okay so
now I will show you what I got in the
storm the first accessory I got was just
this neon pink bando and I got this so I
can wear under that neon pink tank top
because like I said it's pretty sheer
this is inside out but this was only 350
and I think it's a really good deal
because I think just neon things are
really really in trend for this season
and yeah it's just a neon pink bando and
I'm in wear this I know a ton of things
this is adorable so yeah this was 350
and then I just got this teal scarf it's
just like a really really long you know
your average scarf but I really really
liked this and I love the color this is
like one of my favorite colors so I
decided I would get it and this was 680
ok so now I have 2 more kind of basic
t-shirts I got the same shirt as that
pink one only in navy blue and I don't
know why this was only 480 and that was
like
9 something but whatever it's just the
same shirt and navy and I think this
will look super super cute with that hot
pink bando like how cute would that look
with the band under it so I think this
is really cute
once again I wear these all the time and
then I got this really really cute
striped shirt I'm really into stripes
and it's really really high neckline it
goes like right up to here and then it
goes kind of wide off your shoulders
it's three-quarter length sleeves and
then it's just kind of loose on the way
down and I really liked this this was
only 1090 I believe so it was a super
good deal and I think this is really
cute and it's something that you can
wear with a lot of things okay so I've
been wanting a damaged shirt for the
longest time and I was on Nordstrom and
I found one that I really really liked
in the juniors section and I was just
going to order it and then it sold out
in my size which is really annoying and
it was fifty dollars which was a lot so
you know I must have liked it I was
gonna spend that much on it so I was
really mad and then I let him
differently when he won and found it I
liked um so basically it's just this
dark wash denim shirt and it has like
cuffs you can roll up the sleeves which
isn't my favorite I kind of just wanted
it straight down but it looks cute
cuffed as well and you know it's a
little bit oversized but I really like
and this is only 22 80s so it's a lot
better price than the one from Nordstrom
was okay and this last thing I got it's
kind of I don't know it's different it's
a maxi dress and it's kind of weird for
me to wear maxi dresses because I'm five
foot one and obviously this is way too
long on me I'm getting it my mom's
hemming it thank you mom
but I really really liked this and some
girl in my school had it and I normally
never will buy things that other people
have because I know I hating people do
that with me in my school but I loved it
so much and I'm not gonna wear to school
just because she's already worn it but I
just loved it so much so it's just this
floral print and it's a tank top on top
it's Navy and it has these really pretty
flowers with some buttons and then it
just goes down all the way and then the
back has this cutout the hold up hold
backs cutout but a big section of the
back is cut out if you can see that and
this is just really cute it actually is
really flattering because it's send
cheese like up here
so it makes my legs look like they're
actually long which is amazing so I got
this and this was really really
inexpensive for how much for two dollars
it was 20 to 80 so that is everything I
got I hope you guys enjoyed this haul
