a video that kind of a lot of Cougars do
but I still kind of want to do it just
because it seems kind of fun and
everyone has their own take on it and
you can probably tell by the title what
its gonna be it's gonna be summer beauty
must haves and a lot of gusto beauty and
fashion but like I figured if I did that
would be so long the video so I'm just
gonna kind of do a beauty video of
someone must-haves and then like next
week or something I'll do the fashion
version so yeah so pretty much these are
like my opinions you don't have to rush
out and buy them but just kind of things
that I think are really good to have you
know for the summer months and yeah I'm
sorry my phone just vibrated um yeah so
I'm just gonna start out and what I'm
gonna start off with is lip products the
first thing is like a really good
chapstick because your lips can burn in
the Sun and like get all dry and stuff
so the first one is just like a good
chap stick this is yo ice lip balm
everyone probably knows about it it's
like the egg mine the flat egg because I
have used so much about uh I really like
that one and then there's one that like
SPF is really good for the summer
especially if you're out on the beach or
something and this is blistex just decks
or whatever and it has SPF in it so this
one's really good you know if you're
going outside
alright the next lip product is a bright
lip color I'm really not someone to wear
lip colors at all I don't wear anything
really on my lips except for chapstick
but this is a really pretty um lip stick
by Avon it's in the color wink and it's
a hot pink it might not look hot pink
but when it's on your lips it's actually
really bright and it looks like this I
don't want to use this a lot just
because it is kind of bright and I'm not
a huge fan of like lipstick and stuff
but it is really nice you know so yeah
this is a bright lip color something
really fun for summer like a coral or
something so I definitely recommend
picking one of those up for days and you
just kind of want to like experiment um
okay now I'm gonna move on to like face
or blush and stuff okay
my favorite thing like I've really
really been getting into blush and I
like pain blush I'm not a powder blush
person I just don't like it and these
are two of the cream blushes I've been
using lately this is my favorite this is
a little mini it's to steal a
convertible color which is basically
like a cheek and lip stain thing and
it's in the color peony and this is not
a color I would normally pick out I got
this in a little set but I'm really glad
I did
it's like this weird kind of brownie
coral color like it's kind of ugly but
when you put it on your cheeks it makes
the prettiest orange a coral color and
it's actually really pretty especially
for summer it just like goes on your
cheeks really nicely and it blends and I
really love this I'm gonna get a full
size I really like these convertible
colors because I stay on like all day so
yeah and then my second favorite cream
blush right now is just the Maybelline
Dream moves blush this isn't forty soft
plum and these are like the most
wonderful things ever they're like
moosie you guys have probably seen these
a lot before and you just blend them
right in I think I don't like about
these as they have shimmer I'm not a
huge fan of that has like lots of
shimmer in it which this does but it's
still really pretty and yeah I still
really like it so cream blushes are
definitely like a must for me especially
for the summer like I like them all year
round but for the summer it's just like
having lots of powder on your face does
not feel good oh yeah okay
now I'm moving on to eyes a waterproof
mascara I think we all knew this was
gonna be in the video this is my
favorite right now I've tried covergirl
LashBlast but when I think of waterproof
mascara I think of like going in the
pool swimming not just like chilling out
by the pool like I actually jump in the
pool
so with covergirl LashBlast my eyelashes
clumped together in about three our
lashes and it was pretty disgusting like
I jut got out of the pool and I had two
eyelashes on each eye and this is a
loyal voluminous carbon black waterproof
this one does not clump my eyelashes
together they stay and loyal voluminous
is my favorite mascara anyways so I
figured I'd get it in waterproof and
it's gray my eyelashes stay nice all
throughout the pool and yeah so a
waterproof mascara is definitely a must
for the summer at least for me because I
feel like
Scarah makes me look a little better and
it works for the pool so yeah I
definitely recommend this one though if
you're trying to figure out which one to
get
okay and then I really think purple
eyeshadows are really really in for
summer and you should definitely have
one I'm not a huge fan of like blue or
green eyeshadow is there like any other
color but I feel like a really good
color like if you want a pop it's
definitely purple I feel like it's
really wearable and there's lots of
Purple's out there that are made into
kind of a natural purple color this is
not a very natural people this is my
Urban Decay somethin palette I don't
remember this which one this is but it
looks like this and yeah I don't really
use this a lot I don't find myself using
it but because there are some bright
colors in here I'm just gonna knock the
brush out okay if you see this blue
purple color right here it's called
flash it looks like this it's a really
really bright purple color and I think
this would be really pretty to kind of
work it into a look maybe put it in the
crease or on the lower lash line or
something it's really really pretty um
that's a nice purple but if you're like
me like you're more of a neutral person
this is probably the purple for you this
is a matte color and this is like my
little matte quad right here and the
color is down here I'm Cara Moore might
not be showing up purple but it's really
it's called tracks and it's really a
purple color and it has a gold shimmer
in it so it kind of makes the illusion
that it's like a gold but it's
definitely purple it's this one right
here it's probably not showing up at all
but it's it's actually it's purple and
it has tons of gold shimmer and it's
just really pretty if you don't like if
you want to see what it looks like
go to like google and type in like Mac
tracks eyeshadow swatch or something and
you'll see that it is really pretty its
pupal and then has tons of gold shimmer
in it it's like a really pretty color
and this is what I like to use when I
want like a pupal pop to my eye but
still neutral so yeah Google eyeshadow
or along with any other like bright
eyeshadow is really in for the
and I think it's really nice to have
mm-hmm okay then my last like makeup ish
product that I'm moving under hair it's
just kind of like a brake coral nail
polish this is my favorite to use just
kind of cuz it's I'm not really like it
this is my OPI and it's in the color
cajun shrimp this is one of my first OPI
colors and yeah it's like okay it's
really hard to explain like it looks
almost pinky red in the bottle but on
your nails like all in G red and it's
like your perfect red coral orange pink
nail I'd say it's more of a bad Orange
cool I don't know but it looks like this
it's just really great like I like this
because I don't like red nails on me I
feel like it looks really bad on my skin
tone but this definitely works for my
skin tone and yeah so cajun shrimp by
OPI or any holy nail color okay
now I'm on bahir products um a lot of
people ask me about my hair a lot of
people like the biggest most comment
I'll get real I love your hair how do
you get your hair long what do you do
your hair yeah so I cut my hair in the
beginning like when did I cut my hair in
the middle of this year so probably like
three months ago I got a haircut like
right about here and it's growing back
right fit it's like right here right now
and people always ask me how do you pull
your hair out I have a little video on
that it's kind of old I'll probably like
remake it and stuff but basically last
summer I didn't use heat at all well I
used heat about three times in the whole
summer so that's kind of how my hair is
healthy and it's got so long but these
products you know kind of help me if you
don't want to use heat but you don't
want your hair to look completely
disgusting I definitely recommend
getting a moose this kind of adds like
volume and waves to your hair if you
scrunch it up this is something that
helped me not use heat because it helped
my hair not be frizzy and yeah so I do
have naturally curly hair curly wavy
hair so this kind of just like amped up
my pills but I would still probably work
with people with straight hair they
still wouldn't be as curl you know so
yeah definitely a mousse because this
helped you from like stop from using
heat as much because I like to kind of
give my hair a break over the summer and
it gets really long if you do that so I
really like this and in my last video
people were asking me how is your hair
so shiny and it's it really it kind of
is pretty shiny and it hasn't been like
until recently and I think it's because
I've been using this product and also
has been really soft which i think is
this product it's the Aussie 3 minute
miracle and this is like a deep
conditioner you put it in in the shower
you leave it in for 3 minutes and you
wash it out for me it doesn't do
anything to my natural air dried hair
but after I straighten my hair my hair
is so soft and there's no there's no
like split ends or anything and it's so
soft like this is my hair straight and I
didn't straighten it like failing
anything today like it was still
straight from yesterday but this stuff
is amazing it smells so good and usually
after I straighten my hair my hair will
smell like broke and but this this like
covers the whole burnt smell and my hair
still smells like this and yeah this
stuff is amazing like it definitely is
making my hair shiny and soft so yeah
this is the Aussie 3 minute miracle and
I think it's like three dollars at a
drugstore so that's like amazing ok so
that's all the stuff I have um yeah so I
hope you guys like this video I hope it
wasn't too long it was only like no
almost 10 minutes but yeah I'm gonna be
doing a fashion portion too so yeah
check out these things especially the
waterproof mascara that's like I think
the must out of this video but if you
have any more questions you know you can
come with them or you know inbox me or
something and yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
