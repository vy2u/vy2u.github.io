my Texas vlog part one you guys all said
you wanted me to continue with part two
so I'm doing that and today is Black
Friday but I wasn't like super into like
getting up early and going shopping I
don't only want anything there's nothing
that I like have my eye on or anything
like that but we're still gonna go
because like it's me you know what I
mean
so I think we're going to Barton Springs
Creek Mall or something like that I
don't really know so we're going there
and then I really want to go thrifting
cuz apparently Austin's really good for
thrifting and I like drifting a lot and
then I don't know we'll see what goes on
but I think we're just gonna get coffee
from this place it's like really close
to here because they have empanadas and
they have like a chicken pot pie one I'm
obsessed with chicken pot pie like I
don't think I've ever mentioned that but
I love chicken pot pie so yeah we're
doing that I'm wearing this jacket that
is new I got it from blank NYC you can
get it at Nordstrom and then I'm wearing
this gray t-shirt dress kind of like a
black a chinois acid-washed grey from
Windsor and then some like black tall
boots chicken pot pie empanadas
all right so we went to the mall I
bought too much stuff I'll show you guys
a little sneak peek later but I'm
definitely doing a Black Friday at haul
time to thrift
okay so it's the next day now I didn't
finish blogging yesterday I was really
tired we didn't feel very well so I
didn't show you when I got a tough story
so I'm gonna show you now so the first
thing I think all this stuff was like
half off so yeah okay the first thing I
got is just this green turtle back cuz
tronex it like in style now and there's
tungsten up there stores and I used to
hate them but now are like them so I got
this just olive green one and it's a
large I got it so it would be kind of
oversized and I think this was like a
dollar so it's a really good deal it's a
nice material and then I recommend
looking in the men's section for
t-shirts because if you guys are into
like band shirts or just like graphics
they have some really cool ones I found
this one for myself and it's just like
this graphic I don't really like the
back I didn't notice it has something on
the back so I wear this with like a
flannel or something
or just like a looker jacket but it's
really cool and I like it a lot and then
I promised Harley Davidson shirt anyways
it has this really cool graphic on it
this one's oversized I think it's would
be cool if you like put some holes in it
or something so it's just fun to kind of
look around and find different ones like
these you can find a bunch of Harley
shirts at their stores this was like a
last minute decision cuz it was like a
dollar fifty I think so I was like oh
why not just like this olive green shirt
and I thought it would be cute to kind
of just like fill on over something I
haven't tried anything on I need to wash
all this as well but it's just like I
said this olive green shirt has like a
pocket on one side there and I thought
it could be cute for layering and then
we went to one more thrift store and I
found some really good stuff in this one
I got this snake print top I couldn't
decide if it was like ugly or not but I
think I liked it
it's like mock neck which is really
trendy right now and just like loose
kind of loose watery material snake
print so I thought this was cool I have
found I know the Harley Davidson sure
except this one was in the kids section
so I think I'm gonna cut it into a crop
top I think that'll be really cool just
looks like that and then like probably
the best find this is kinda dirty so we
need to wash it I found this LL Bean you
know coffee vest and the kids suction
but it's definitely the boys took
perfect size for me and it was half off
$4.99 so I got this like 250 and it's
just this teal color and I thought this
was really nice it's gonna be nice for
when I go home for Christmas and yeah
yeah so that is what I got thrifting
yesterday you guys want me to do a whole
video on like 15 tips totally let me
know because I will do that and comment
down below and tell me what the best
thing about thrifting ever was if you
guys go I'm curious to know so yeah I
think we're going to San Antonio today
so I will finish a blogging later hey so
we are currently in San Antonio at the
Riverwalk readers and getting some food
I'll show you oh this is our really
unflattering angle looks like this it's
really pretty there's just lots of
tourists and that gives me a lot of
anxiety but it's okay
and you know I think sour cream chicken
enchiladas
you guys know me you know I love fried
pickles so this had to happen
yum-yum-yum
hey guys we just finished eating and my
parents want to go look at the Alamo but
the line was so long
and I was just not having it plus I know
it was like might sound bad
history for like historical things I
mean like I'm looking at it right now
but I don't really want to let go in it
or anything and like just look at the
line so that it's like the start of the
line but it literally goes like all the
way in there I don't know if you can see
all those people but it literally goes
all the way in there and up and around
like in those windows is still aligned
so it's so long so I'm literally just
like sitting here on this ledge thing
hello so it is Sunday now Sunday
yeah it's Sunday and I don't think I
finished vlogging yesterday but I got
like gelato last mile and sort of photo
here I didn't bring my vlog camera but I
got that and then today we're about to
go get a brunch at swearin Co but I
probably shouldn't say that because
it'll probably be too busy or closed or
something and it won't work but we will
see currently I am freaking out because
let me flip the camera okay if you guys
know me you know I love wiener dogs and
pugs and I was just like randomly
looking at animal shelters in LA like I
do not need a dog I can't take care of a
dog right now but like literally guys
look at these two right next to each
other and if you also know me you know I
love like like little like dappled
speckled wiener dogs look at that dog
that's like my dream dog Hey and then
like this one like what that's like the
cutest thing I've ever seen so I'm like
in denial right now if any of you live
in Pomona California or by LA please go
to adopt those dogs and then invite me
over to play with them because I'm like
obsessed with them so yeah we're about
to go to brunch and I will show you my
food there I feel like this entire vlog
is me showing you food but whatever this
is my omelet with potatoes and toast and
then this is some chicken sausage gumbo
I got nice coffee yum-yum-yum hello so
now we are done with the brunch and I
guess we're gonna check out some flea
market because what did you say I was in
the top there's number eight at the top
ten flea markets in the country yeah so
we gotta go in case you guys are
wondering about these sunglasses they're
my new baby bands I think they're new
actually I'm pretty sure the person told
me they were new but they're like copper
frames and they like the round one so
people like always ask me no yes and if
you wonder who's in the back seat it's
your mom
yup she sits in the back she's the baby
so we came to the wrong one super
sketchy
yeah not ideal basically this place is
so sketchy it's not we're trying to come
to market we're just walking by like
Barton Springs and Zilker Park on the
past and we just found some really cool
turtles I'm going to show you okay so
there is literally a turtle on there if
you can see him and then there's like
three right there and I really like
turtles I used to a pet turtle fun fact
her name was Tilly so yeah they're
really cute oh and this is like really
pretty the waters are really blue if you
guys are from here do you know what's if
it's natural or if it's dyed because it
literally looks like teal right now so
total let me know because I'm curious
got a good thing going babish
you know what Kali needed so currently
this part of the spring is like blocked
off and that's like they make it like a
swimming pool kind of thing so that's
pretty cool there's like lifeguards and
everything but yeah I'm not gonna swim
today today's not the day all right so I
think the last stop of this vlog is this
Bailey Street art wall or something like
that it's just like a curfew DD park and
some of you guys recommended me coming
here so I think I'm gonna sing like take
some photos and stuff but it's pretty
cool
these shoes have no traction and I'm
struggling and it reminds me of the time
that I hiked Runyon with Nike Roches and
almost fell actually I did fall so
that's good you go Glen Coco I'm not
looking forward to getting down it's
gonna be even harder but this is a super
cool view I feel like this should be my
thumbnail anyways yeah we're gonna try
and struggle to get back down now yeah
this is super cool if you guys are from
here and know what the longest a piece
of artwork has stayed on this wall let
me know I'm really curious to see how
long it takes people like paint
something over so yeah let me know found
a fact about me I love peace teen have
you guys ever tried it I used to be
obsessed with the cans and I think I've
tried like almost every flavor now I
don't think I've tried this one so
that's gonna be fun but let me know down
below if you guys like peas tea okay so
we just got back and I think I'm gonna
end the vlog off here because I've
gotten a decent amount of footage and
I'm leaving tomorrow back to LA and back
to school so yeah thank you guys so much
