will love this one because it's giant
and it's actually kind of cozy I feel
like whenever I say I'm doing a fall or
winter haul it's like summer clothes
because I live in LA and it doesn't get
very cold here but this stuff is
actually like pretty cozy pretty Fawley
so I am super excited to show you guys
really quick before I get into showing
you guys the items if you're not
following me on Instagram and you want
to you totally should I post tons of
personal just like photos I post my
outfits I post pictures with friends so
if you guys want to keep up to me on a
more keep up to me I always mess up when
I'm saying this if you guys want to keep
up with me on a more personal basis
totally follow me on there and I will
have my other social media handles in
the description as well and before you
guys asked where my sweaters from it
will be in this haul video so stay tuned
oh and I will be linking everything in
this video down below so if you guys are
interested in any of it check the
description okay so the first store I
have things from is a company called LVN
fit they have the cutest workout sets
I'm obsessed with two-piece sets like
clothing wise so two-piece sets in
athleisure and workout clothes are
literally amazing so they have super
cute ones and they were nice enough to
give me some so Thank You lb and fit
okay so the first one I think you guys
are gonna be really excited about I saw
this on Danielle Carolyn and I was like
oh my gosh I need that so it's this
gingham workout set guys this is the
sports bra and what I like about their
sports bras is there a little bit longer
so personally I awareness is just like a
top with the matching leggings so it's
just this awesome
gingham sports bra and then the legging
is it comes with are so fun and when I
love about their legging is as their
high-rise these are the only leggings I
will wear high-rise ones
because they just suck everything in and
they're super flattering so these are
the leggings so in case you guys are
wondering I got all of their leggings
and a size extra extra small the sports
bras I got in an extra small so in case
you guys are wondering this is my
favorite print but the other ones are
super fun as well okay so the next set I
got a different style sports bra but
it's still you know super cute this one
is kind of just like a gray white and
black pattern and then the leggings are
the same once again high rise oh and
they do have a little zipper in the back
so that's super convenient as well okay
and then the last little matching set I
got from them is this sports bra by the
way you don't have to get these in sets
you can get them separately but I just
think they're super cute assets so I
grabbed this little hombre sports bra to
go with these striped yeah I got the
colors minis were super fun so yeah I
really really like these too
okay the last thing I got from lb and
fit is this jumpsuit I thought it was
super unique and unlike anything that I
have in my closet so I thought it would
be really fun to style I'm just not
totally sure how I'm gonna style it yet
so off it's not gonna look like anything
cool but it's this it's this jumpsuit
it's kind of like a it's definitely a
sporty vibe it has like jogger bottoms
and zippers you'll see this in the Tryon
but if you guys know how you would style
it totally let me know because I think
it's a super fun piece yeah on the best
part if you guys use the code Kasia 15
you can get 15% off on lb and fit and
their website they have swimwear and
stuff as well so you guys should totally
check them out okay the next door how
things from is exporting goods and I got
some really really cozy things guys so
get excited this first thing I posted
I'm like Instagram story and you guys
are freaking out and I wasn't really
saying where I got it I mean I guess you
could give it at a few places but I
wasn't really saying hey I was waiting
for this video but it is this extremely
fuzzy Patagonia little quarters at guys
the best part about this is that it's
not just as fuzzy on the outside it's as
fuzzy on the inside because I know a lot
of jackets and sweaters that are like
this fuzzy on the outside or never like
lined with it on the inside but this
puppy is this all the way through and I
know I have this in a few different
colors but I just think it's so amazing
I'm going to bring this home with me for
Thanksgiving and Christmas because it's
gonna be cold in New York when I go home
but this is amazing I think this would
make the best Christmas gift for someone
okay the next thing I got from Dick's
something that I feel like I've wanted
it since like sixth grade I got a pair
of Uggs
and I don't even know if people like
uggs anymore but I love them I still
wear my uggs all the time to the library
I think there's something cute I have
like the little mini Bailey Bailey
button ones and I think they're adorable
but I've secretly always wanted this
pair pause this video and comment down
below which pair you think these are
before I open them I bet you guys it
won't Gus okay so they are the knit bugs
are they called the classic carny
basically they also come up like this
but I think I will wear them fold it
down I don't know I just always thought
these were so cute so I have to get them
and yeah I don't know let's bring odds
back guys okay next from Dick's I picked
up a sports bra it's this Nike sports
bra it's gray dark gray and then has the
signe on coral lining and then something
else super cute is the back it's like
criss cross e so I really like this it
has built-in pads but I believe you can
remove them yeah you can totally remove
them if you want but this is just super
great I love it okay and I also grab
these joggers from Dick's they're just
these Nike kind of grayish black little
cropped joggers I like these because
they are cropped length so they're not
way too long on me I feel like whenever
I'm looking for joggers they're always
way too long because I'm five foot one
so they always just look super weird but
these ones fit me really really well and
I think they're just like nice and
casual if I want to be more comfy for
class or just hanging out doing
schoolwork so I thought things were just
really cute okay the last thing I got
from Dick's it's not really fashion or
anything but I still want to show you
guys it is a hydro flask and I cannot
tell you how many people have told me to
get these I know Ann Marie
my roommate always uses it and Gretchen
always uses it so yeah I also don't
drink a lot of water I'm really really
bad with that it's probably why I got
kidney stones I don't even know if I
told you eyes but I totally had kidney
stones last summer so throw back-to-back
but anyways yeah I really need to start
doing more water and apparently this is
like the best way to do it so I got this
and it's like bright magenta purple
color and I'm excited I start using it
and hopefully not be dehydrated like I
normally am okay and the last story I
have things from is Express which is
actually where I got this little sweater
but I got a ton of really cute fall
pieces so I'm super excited to show you
guys yeah
so first is this sweater I really like
it because the sleeves are a little bit
cropped so they're not like you know
getting in the way or anything but it
has this really cute little turtle mark
I know they have this in a bunch of
colors and you will see abettor in the
Tryon but I really really like it it's
long it's cute it's comfy but it's not
like it's not like too cozy so this
would be great for layering or like an
la summer or summer winter point I'm
having but yeah I love this color this
is like one of my favorite colors right
now it's just a dusty rose color okay I
think this might be my favorite item
from Express
if this camo it's just super big cozy
sweatshirt
I got it in this like a light camo color
but they had it in like you know your
classic darker came out color as well I
just thought this one was like pretty
unique and cool but this isn't the
softest hoodies I've felt we're not
going to use just like Kleenex
it's so soft on the inside like
incredibly soft you guys need this and
something else that's awesome is it has
a little front pouch pocket which is
great and yeah this is just like
amazing I love it so I got this in a
size extra small but I know they had an
extra extra small as well this runs
really big but I loved sweatshirts to be
really big so yeah I love this this next
piece of Express is actually really
funny so I bought this and then I posted
a photo in it on Instagram and then my
friend texted me and she's like wait I
have that same skirt and so does my
friend and my friend and I ended up
wearing it out on the same night but
it's this really cute faux leather
miniskirt and I've been looking for one
for so long a full of a miniskirt that I
really really liked and this is the one
I think it's so cute it's like the
perfect length I think this one's petite
but yeah I don't know I think it's
simple but it just has it a little
detailed with the zippers and stuff and
I really really like it it's great for
going out it's also great if you want to
layer it with some sweaters and stuff
for a cute fall outfit maybe she's on my
boots but yeah I am really really into
this and it is faux leather whoo okay so
going along with the camo thing I got
these camo sweatpants I don't know these
are cute like I would wear these as an
outfit but they're also like that
amazingly soft material so they're kind
of like jaggary style they're a little
bit long on me so I like to cut the
bottoms and I think they still look
really cute but literally these with a
black tube top and some like sneakers I
think is a really cute outfit and
they're so pretty comfortable guys like
oh my gosh but I really really love
these and they're kind of like a gray
camo so they go with a lot okay my
favorite thing to wear and the fall and
work there is flannels I just thought
the color of this flannel was super
unique it's like this oh you know it's
kind of like a dusty magenta if that's
even in a thing I don't know but it's
like back color and black and I just
thought this was just really cool I love
flannels so much I got this on a medium
because I like my flannels to be
oversized and I believe this was an
oversized fit to begin with okay I
grabbed this really cute bodysuit it's
this black and white striped material
it's a thong bodysuit which is my
favorite I hate non
long body suits because they give you
the worst underwear lines like it's so
annoying so this one's a thong and it
just has these really adorable little
knot details I think it's so cute and I
love body suits I think they're so easy
and they just make everything look nice
and tucked in so yeah this is adorable
guys this dress foam Express is so
flattering so basically I got it in this
like gray and pink like dusty rose
marled material it's basically this like
knit dress I would really call it a
sweater dress because it's not like
super thick but it's definitely a knit
dress and it kind of has this ruching
toward the bottom which just looks
really really flattering but yeah this
is a fitted dress I love wearing like
fitted sweater dresses with
over-the-knee boots in the fall and
winter I think it's such a cute look so
yeah I really love this and they have
this in so many different colors I
really really get it in just all black
okay I'm just sucker for beanies I love
them a because I'm normally having a bad
hair day I did my hair for this video it
doesn't normally look like this but I
also don't like washing my hair so if my
hair is kind of dirty or just a mess I
love wearing beanies to cover it up and
I just this beanie is my two favorite
colors
it's burgundy and like a dusty rose I
love it so much I'll put it on its gonna
mess up my hair
guys I think it's so adorable and they
have these with other colors as well
they had it a really fun like neon hot
pink which normally I would they could
be kinda ratchet but I really liked it
so I kind of want to get more this
beanie fits my head perfectly I have a
small head but oh my gosh this outfit
right now is like me in fall I love it
okay I got two pairs of shoes they're
the same pair of shoes in different
colors the first parent is gonna match
this outfit too much it's almost
sickening they are these dusty rosy
Bobby
slide on sneaker things from Steve
Madden I was I knees for so long and
then they have them in express and I
think
they're so cute this is all my favorite
styles of shoes I always wear vans in
this style I think they're just like
really cute and they go with everything
and this color is literally my
everything so yeah I got them in pink
and then I had to get them in black
I literally have them in this bag
because I've been wearing them so much
and they're kind of dirty I really need
to wash them but yeah I just got them in
black as well they go with everything
seriously guys they're amazing so you
guys should totally check these out
they're really great quality and they're
not too expensive so yes yeah so that is
everything in this haul video I hope you
