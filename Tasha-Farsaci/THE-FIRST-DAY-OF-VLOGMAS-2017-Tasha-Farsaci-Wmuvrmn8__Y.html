believe vlogmas came so fast basically I
just rolled out of bed I have to go to
alpha P and pass out apparel because
basically I just got the marketing chair
position from one of them and for alpha
thei so I have to go pass out shirts
there for like an hour and a half and I
went out last night I was out really
late so I'm not feeling the best right
now I'm not moving the best either but
yeah I have to do that so I think I'm
gonna be there for like an hour and a
half and then I have like an online exam
to take but yeah I'm really excited for
vlog vlog miss to be starting it's so
crazy like I said it came so so fast but
yeah next time you see me hopefully I
won't look like a trash can and like I
do right now
but yeah happy vlogmas
hi guys so it's quite a while later now
I look and feel a little bit more like a
human now but basically yeah I passed
out shirts and Alfie and basically the
reasoning for that is we make apparel
for all of our events so a lot of girls
order shirts from the invites that we
have and then they send them to their
dates as like a thank you gift for
coming so yeah I was passing out those
for a while and then I just edited and
posted my college week in my life vlog
from this previous week and then I came
back watched some YouTube videos and
took an online final for my workout
class yes we had a final so yeah and
then I got ready but basically if you
guys did watch my most recent college
week in my life basically I am doing
vlogmas with dope this year so I've
talked about dough so many times but in
case you guys don't know what it is you
haven't seen my videos where i've talked
about them basically they're a shopping
app and you can shop so many different
stores all in one place all in the app
all on your phone it's the best thing
ever if you guys haven't tried it I will
put a link down below and if you use the
code Tasha you get five dollars off and
free shipping for your first order which
is really amazing because I'm literally
like handing you a $5 gift card to one
of your favorite stores because they
have so many stores on there my personal
favorites are revolve ASOS Urban
Outfitters sorry that was like a hiccup
free people shop Bob there's so many
stores so anyways so basically this year
they chose a bunch of influencers to
send vlogmas gifts to so every day of
vlogmas they have a wrapped gift for us
to open so Ann Marie and I my roommate
are both doing this so we thought it'd
be fun to open today's gift together so
yeah guys I've been so excited for this
I've been wanted to open these ever
since they came in the mail so I'm
excited that I finally get to open one
