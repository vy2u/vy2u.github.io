don't really know i think it might be 13
but I like honestly can't remember um I
just woke up and I know someone from
magic links which is a website that I
work with sometimes said they're gonna
come drop off a gift in my house at like
11 a.m. which is like now so I'm like
gonna wait until they come and then I'm
probably like get ready and finish up
packing cuz I leave the airport around
like 3:45 today so I'll show you what
that is when it comes guys they just
dropped off this sign look how cute it
is this is like completely custom
handmade oh my gosh this is so pretty oh
that's so sweet of them to think of me
thank you so much magic links oh my gosh
I can't wait to hang this up okay guys
so I just put makeup on so that I could
pack all my makeup up my current room
situation is a disaster because I'm
packing but before I forgot I wanted to
open my day at 13
don't bogman skip today's a little mini
one so let me figure out a spot to put
my camera okay I'm literally gonna be
squatting on the ground for this one but
day 13 let's see what she is guys this
is so weird
oh my gosh it's a fresh sugar lip
treatment okay and if you guys follow me
on snapchat I literally posted last
night that I was debating buying a huge
pack of these because I love chapstick
so much and I didn't end up buying it
but oh my god what are the odds I'm so
excited
guys you don't you're reading my mind
thank you guys so much I just put it on
I really really like it I'm obsessed
with chap sticks and lip balms cuz my
lips were always so dry so I never like
using like lip sticks and stop so these
are perfect because they're tinted and I
think this is just like the perfect like
natural color oh my gosh I'm really so
excited I wanted these so badly
thank you dope
I think I'm about to go get some food
probably it lemonade really quick
because I've been wanting it and then I
need to come back last-minute get all my
stuff together and then go okay guys I
guess I'm going to show you like kind of
what I packed this is my carry-on so I
just have like my makeup my bag that I'm
bringing two pairs of sunglasses I have
like my hot tools my straightener and
color in there and then I have like
tampons and there cuz homegirl is
getting her period wonderful and then
this is the main bag I basically just
packed a lot of sweaters
obviously some hats this is for home too
and then some jackets I have like some
pajamas there a lot of jeans a hat I'm
bringing these tall leather boots
because they're flat and then those
little heeled ones are the ones that I'm
gonna wear on the plane they're actually
really comfy I'm also wearing the coat
on the end of the rack on the plane and
I'm debating if I want to bring my
leather jacket I feel like maybe maybe I
should just to have something a little
fancier but yeah this is it so far and
then I'm gonna bring my North Face
backpack as well hey guys I'm all packed
up look at my luggage they're so cute
they're like a mother and child so
aesthetically pleasing guys I'm so salty
that no one's going to the airport with
me because I can't even take a picture
outside the airport with my luggage and

oh my god that rhymed I need to I'm like
slouching some wearing booties I need to
make a shirt that says that's when you
know you're an insta ho comment down
below if you'd buy it

while I'm gone for break because I don't
want anyone to steal it Anne Murray's

murder myself so here she is here's my
airport OOTD I'm wearing my big coat
from ASOS my sweater from Joyrich some
Lululemon's

like wet squirrels we're waiting for
Lucy to get back from her internship
yeah I am a wet squirrel oh dear lord I
don't know you're awakened like forming
sentences right now I'm so tired wait
this needs to focus I thought I only
know if I wanted to focus on my face
like say every word I'm saying wrong
like I say the wrong words and I don't
know what I'm talking I can't sleep on
planes so I popped like way more
melatonin than I should have but I still
like barely dozed off like I would wake
up probably like every ten minutes and I
would try to adjust myself I don't know
how people just like lay there like sit
straight up and sleep like how do they
like knocked out yeah they'll be like
yeah and I have to like curl up in like
a position I kept putting my foot like
on the armrest of the person in front of
me and she kept moving her arm back and
like touching my flat comment down below
if you guys can't sleep on planes
because I literally took so much
sleeping medication and I just like was
barely dozing off so I am like not doing
too hot right now but I'm so excited to
be here yeah I know that was like the
first time I got here I live agent
sleeping forever but I like wanted to
stay up the whole day because I was like
I'm just so happy I'm here I'm just like
you need sleep you're gonna die yeah I
like mist I don't really know what day
this is I'm just this is like the next
day technically but I'm gonna squish it
Thursday night yeah I'm with the
plane footage and then I'm just gonna
like show you what we do tonight and
then that'll be like this vlogmas i
guess yeah
but i'm probably not gonna make it that
way tonight yeah you've been here I
shouldn't say you're back I remember
sorry I'm delusional
Gretchen what did you do sushi roll I
could think of worse things January
yeah when you hit up the classy
who remembers our blog from home San
Francisco this summer would be etosha a
milkshake so we got order things that
I've never seen in my life and we
figured this would be easy cuz you can
click English guys got you and I are so
dumb we like I don't know if they didn't
take credit cards or what was going on
but no one spoke English you know so we
like found an ATM and took out euros
just see it are mixed Flurry's ATM fee
was probably like 20 euros but like I
literally don't care hi guys this was
like the longest day /blog of my life
probably because it was like two days
yeah basically
Lucy was like saying buy a lot of her
friends here so Gretchen and I just went
to this like little cafe oh my God my
nose gets so bad tonight I always say
this in my vlogs look at it and like a
boot off huh why does it do that
I think cuz we were cold manager that's
true it always it always does that but I
was really cold
mmm so we went to this little like cafe
restaurant and our waiter was so hot but
he didn't speak any English and
cigarettes me and I were just like he
was like making fun of us yeah and then
I asked me to check and eat you couldn't
see cuz we're taking money but he looked
at me and he was like yeah I saw him do
that one he was just like and then you
would like bend down till I give us the
check and his arm was like on my arm and
I'm like and then we're leaving
he was like hey see you soon he
literally didn't speak English was the
entire time clearly knows her American
like the second we stood down hands it's
the American menu not the French one and
then we're leaving to go see you soon I
was like dude yeah so we did that and
then we went to McDonald's as you guys
slightly saw and they didn't take credit
cards which would be like really weird
and I was like this is embarrassing
blind so then we went and got some euros
and then always well so I'm really
really tired I might add it this right

might just go to bed but yeah thank you
