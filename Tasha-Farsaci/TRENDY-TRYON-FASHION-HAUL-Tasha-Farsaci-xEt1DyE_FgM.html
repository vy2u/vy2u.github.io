or for you guys I absolutely love
everything in this video like I am
obsessed with everything so I cannot
wait to show it to you guys before I get
into the video if you guys are not
following me on social media especially
Instagram you totally showed because I
post a lot of outfit photos and stuff so
if you guys want to see these style or
how I actually wear these from day to
day totally follow me on there it's like
a super personal outlet for me anyways
if you guys want to see me on a more
day-to-day kind of thing totally check
me out there as well as my Twitter and
my snapchat sympathies here as well as
in the description box okay so
everything in this haul video is from
this new Australian website I found
called princess Polly guys Australian
fashion is my like I honestly think
I was meant to live in Australia
everyone is blonde and tan and they have
koala bears and kangaroos and awesome
clothes like oh my gosh I love
Australian fashion the only thing is
they kind of have different seasons from
us so all this stuff is kind of summery
but I do live in Los Angeles most of the
time so that it's perfectly fine for me
before yeah I do have a coupon code for
you guys you can get 20% off on princess
Polly with the code top 220 I'm going to
put it on the screen as well as in
description pit as well as in the
description I'm honestly use that
everything is so cute and I actually
obsessed with all of it okay so the
first things I'm going to start off with
are the accessories from princess Polly
the first is this plain black velvet
choker
the reason I'm very happy about this is
because I've tried to get things like
this before and they never fit my neck I
have a very small back and I've
literally got in I've tried to get
chokers like this and they're like
hanging and they look so stupid but this
one fits me perfectly it's like the
perfect width I think it's just really
nice I love this oh my gosh this next
item I have been looking for everywhere
it's this a black belt with this like
western buckle and the same thing these
are always too big I've tried to get
them online before they come in the mail
and your giant but this one fits
perfectly it's just a black belt all the
way around with
a supercool kind of Western inspired
buckle I like this one because the
buckle is not giant it's like the
perfect size you can wear this with
everything you look super key with my
outfit today ah I just love this I know
I'm gonna be wearing this a ton you can
wear this on your waist you can wear it
on your hips
literally Wallace the next one I got is
a bralette and I got this because I saw
it on the model with a shirt that I
actually have later on in the hall and
it just looked so so cool so I'm trying
to get this situated okay so it looks
like this it's basically this beautiful
black lacy bra let but have these straps
that kind of go up the front so if you
were a shirt that has kind of like a
deep V or it cut in the front you can
sell these straps and some of the lace
and I just think it's super pretty this
is beautiful I'm perfect for layering
okay the last accessory kind of item I
have princess Polly are these shoes from
the brand lipstick guys I'm obsessed
with these shoes I've been wanting a
pair of black just kind of strappy heels
for a while because I only have like
black pumps and I just wanted some
strappy ones so I saw these on princess
Polly and I almost died they're so
beautiful
they look like this I've had it on this
little foot mold still so you guys can
see basically they're a black suede and
then they laced off your foot and tie
wrap around your ankle and tie oh my
gosh I am obsessed with these the heel
is kind of chunky so they're comfortable
to walk in oh my gosh I can't wait to
wear these hopefully I go to some for
showing the invites or something this
semester because these are going to be
on my feet I love them when you open
them you kind of have to lace them up
your lend yourself which is perfect
because you can make sure they fit you
how you want them to finally I got
everything in a size Australian 6 which
I believe is an extra small and they all
fit perfectly I would not go any smaller
so if you guys are my size go for a 6 ok
so I saw this shirt on the website and I
thought it was so amazing but of course
I got into colors it's going to be
easier to see in a Tryon section but
basically it's this flap top and that
has
these really long ties and you just tie
them in a bow in the front and goes like
super low-cut then the tie is kind of
hang down in a bow oh my gosh I just
think it's so beautiful and this will go
with so many things it's perfect to wear
casually if you want or it's great for
going out as well so I got that in black
and then I got it in white as well the
two staple colors I know I'm gonna wear
both of these a time I just think it's
so flattering and cute okay the next
thing I got I'm so excited about
it's a damn dress I love the denim trend
I think it's so fun I love wearing denim
shorts and jackets and dresses and
skirts literally I'm obsessed so I saw
this dress and I got so excited
basically it's a denim bodycon dress and
it has this like little peep hole in the
front as you can see and then it just
goes down the body hug dress it has
pockets what more can you need the back
has a cool zipper okay moving on I got
this floral romper I like this a lot
because it's floral but it's definitely
like a fall winter floral thang oh my
gosh
I swear I'm the loudest most aggressive
sneezer on earth like oh my gosh that
sounded like a world beast okay so
basically it's a black white taupe and
mustard color and has some cute flowy
sleeves the trend in this haul video is
the front it has some like front ties
which I just think is such a cute detail
I love that and then it just goes down
into the shorts this is so cute you
could totally layer this with like a
leather jacket and wear some booties and
make it totally fall in winter for LA
already just wear this with black
sandals and it'll be great for the
summer and spring and everything as well
so I'm super excited about this this
next dress I got oh my gosh it's so cute
I got a lot of floral prints they sell a
bunch of floral prints which is great
because I am obsessed with floral prints
let me tell you trying to zip this thing
so basically it's this light blue floral
print dress and we watch the tensor
everywhere it has like a deep v cut what
I love is it has these tires on top of
the shoulders I think that is one of the
cutest details ever it's so girly and
like flirty and cute it looks like this
and then it goes down into a dress this
is pretty short but I'm really short I'm
five foot one so I can make it work but
if you're much taller this might be like
number two
take on you anyways the bottom has like
this little extra ruffle I think this is
so beautiful
the back is pretty much open I love this
next dress because it's just such a
neutral color I just think it's really
cool not something I have a lot of so
it's basically this kind of light tan
colored floral dress the sleeves are so
cute in like like what is this no no
what I'm trying to say like floaty I
don't know I like how the neckline is
square I think that's super flattering
it's just this cute little dress once
again kind of short and the back has
this really really pretty little tie so
this is awesome
I love this so much you can wear this
with booties we wear this with sandals
okay and the very last thing that I have
from Princess Holly is the shirt that I
saw on the model with the robot you guys
remember the robot I showed so once
again this is going to be kind of hard
to show off but you'll see it better in
a try on it's this kind of red floral
pattern and it has that same tie tie
front thing you see I have these long
ties it's the same as the black and
white top and she looks so good the
briella
I'm picturing it with some black ripped
skinny jeans some black boots so cute oh
my gosh I love this ooh before I forget
princess Polly has free express shipping
to the United States if you spend over
$70 which is amazing it comes so fast
and you think it would take forever
because it's coming from Australia but
it only takes two to three days because
you get fully expressed shipping like
craze the heavens and there's so much
new stuff it'll be easier sparing 270
dollars okay so I'm going to link
everything that I got in the description
box I'm going to put the coupon code
down there I'm going to put all that
good info down there so totally check
that out thank you guys so much for
