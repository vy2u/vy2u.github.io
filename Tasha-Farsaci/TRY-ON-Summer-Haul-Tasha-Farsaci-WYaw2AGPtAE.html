a haul video and I didn't get a ton of
stuff but I still I wanted to show you I
recently went on kind of a College Road
Trip
kind of thing I had a wedding to go to a
Nashville Tennessee so we were kind of
driving down from New York New York
where Island and just stopping the
places of elam away so I stopped at
University of Maryland Georgetown and
UNC so that was that I really loved
Georgetown now I wasn't a huge fan of
the other schools but Georgetown was
great so yeah and on the way I did a
little bit of shopping and I decided I
would show you guys the stuff that I got
because I guess it's kind of exciting I
don't know I'm going to jump right into
it but before we start this shirt is
from paksa and I know I'm probably gonna
get some questions but yes that's what
I'm gonna sit towards this side because
I'm going to put little clips of me
trying to close on over here so first
place I actually ordered stuff from so
this is not on the trip but I figured
I'd show it as well
it's from mushy inside which is an
online website and I got two things so
first thing is the sunflower dress and I
love sunflowers so much so this is
really cute and it's really comfortable
it's just a t-shirt material and it
looks basically straight except there's
little drawstrings in the front so you
can kind of pull it together and tie it
and it's just a really cute dress it's
really really comfortable and it's great
for the summer yep next item unless item
i got from she inside he's a dress and
you'll see that i got something very
similar later on in the hall so i'll ask
you about that one to get there but it's
basically an off-the-shoulder
white dress with some lace details and
it looks like this and then the back
also has some crochet
okay so I'm a very small petite person I
always have been
and it's hard for me to find jeans that
fit me how I want them to fit me because
I like my pants to be tight and it's
kind of hard to find ones that aren't
like way too long on me because I'm five
foot one so things can get a little bit
hard and I used to get jeans from
Abercrombie kids because they had one in
my mall but then they decided to take
the ever Kumbi kids out of the mall so
that was a really rough time for me so
as I was roaming the halls of Tennessee
maybe I don't remember exactly which
mall I was in that was never coming kids
so I just got a nice pair of dunk ish
washed and they're the super skinny
jeggings I think and they were only like
$20 cuz they were on sale so that was
great and these are great pair of jeans
they're nice and tight and they're not
too long on me and I just love ever
comfy kids their jeans so I'm probably
gonna have to order them online from now
on which is very sad but yes she's got a
nice pair jeans I went to Lululemon and
I have the long wonder under which are
basically like thick leggings by the way
how do you wash those so they don't pill
because mine chilled and I'm pretty sure
I can just look it up but if you guys
have any tips let me know because I'm
really angry because blue the lemons not
cheap and they pilled and it's not a
huge deal because I don't really wear
them so that my buck shows anyway is
that's where they pill but anyways I
wanted a pair of cropped ones because I
always wear cropped like yoga pants and
crop leggings all the time so I got
these ones and they have this kind of
neat pattern on them it's kind of floral
I don't know I thought it was kind of
cute and then they have a little logo
down here and I'm scared to watch these
so let me know how I wash them once I
wear them self yes I got these and I'm
excited to wear these I'll probably wear
them like every day okay I went to packs
on and this is where I have a shirt that
is similar to the dress I got when she
inside so I bought this shirt thinking
it was a shirt
and then once I tried on it got like
it's like wrestling I have a shirt
that's just like this one only mine's
from Urban Outfitters and I thought it
would be the same fit but it's not and
this one's a lot longer so let me know
if you think I should keep both but it's
the same idea it's a white off the
shoulder top
this one has buttons down the front and
then it kind of ruffles down and has the
sleeves like this that like flow out and
I really like this one a lot but as you
can see from this it's like a dress
length and I might just wear this with
jeans and then keep the other one it's a
dress but let me know what you think
because this wasn't super cheap so yeah
also from PacSun I got this a really
cute tube top and I want this to work to
her I went to the Vans Warped Tour if
you follow me on instagram and publish
some pictures of me wearing this and I'm
obsessed with this top I've already worn
it a bunch of times because it's just so
cute I've seen it before in store and
I've never got it and then I just got it
and I love it
so it's the last story I have to show
you is forever 21 and the first thing I
got is boring it's a black maxi skirt
but I never had a black maxi skirt
believe it or not and this one was only
890 so it was a great deal and I'm glad
that I waited to buy one because this
one is this fabulous
next I got this black flowy kind of
shirt thing it has some eyelet kind of
lace crochet at the front on that it
just kind of flows out with like a black
and white clothing pattern and the last
thing I got is another shirt and it's
kind of weird it's a
looks like this you wear it off the
shoulder I mean you don't have to but I
think it looks a lot cuter off the
shoulder and it kind of looks like a
band a oh maybe I don't know or some
sort of flag thing but I thought it was
really cute I'm gonna be trying to film
a lot more videos for you guys I really
apologize I've been so busy this summer
