the seven deadly sins of beauty tag he's
really exciting I wasn't tagged to do
this but you know it's okay it's okay
because I have you guys that my probably
want to see this and yeah so i'm not a
huge makeup person i love makeup and
stuff but i'm not someone to spend a lot
of money on makeup which i call weight
which is why i don't really do you know
more makeup videos and i'm normally
focused on fashion because if you gave
me on her dollars i would probably go
spend it on clothes more than make up
actually I definitely would um so yeah
okay and sorry if I look extremely
sweaty in this video I'm this it's like
nine o'clock right now and so I have all
artificial light and these lights are
like beaming on me and I am dying um
yeah and that's why I'm wearing a tank
top so you know yeah so I really want to
do this video and even though i'm not a
huge makeup girl i still love it and i
still want to do this tag so yeah i'm
gonna get right into it and yes so here
we go
ok so the most inexpensive beauty item
is probably a one dollar item I mean I
probably spend like less than a dollar
and certain things but you know for the
sake this video I wasn't gonna go
digging around or anything so the item
that I chose was the elf tone correcting
concealer it looks like this I actually
got recommended this to me in a video um
so I read all your comments you know I
just see you guys know I read them all
um and I actually I don't love this but
I've used quite a bit of it as you can
probably see there and it's a pretty
good product I mean I don't find that it
does much but um it smells like oranges
so that's always a plus ok in my most
expensive beauty product I actually
bought today so yeah this is kind of
awkward um but it's the Naked 2 palette
I'm sure you guys have all seen it um
I'm really really really behind on this
bandwagon basically I got like forty
five dollars to sephora for my birthday
because my birthday was the 17th so
thank you to you guys who told me happy
birthday by not forty five dollars worth
and I really didn't know what to buy
because I have most of the makeup that I
need and I'm not a huge like person to
buy makeup like as I said so i decided i
would get one of the naked palettes and
i was originally planning on just
getting the first one because you know
first one but then I saw this one and I
actually like the colors in this one
better because they have more cool tones
like topes as opposed to like bronzy
colors so i'll just show you a little
bit I don't want this video to be too
long but um that's what this looks like
so you guys have probably seen it before
but this was fifty dollars which i think
is a lot to spend on makeup and I
probably would have done it if I didn't
have the gift cards so yeah this is my
most expensive
ok so the products that I have a love
hate relationship with have got to be
like lipsticks and lip glosses and the
reason i love them is because they look
great I mean especially lipsticks they
can really change your whole look and
lip glosses are just like cute and fun
to throw on you know but I absolutely
hate how they feel like I don't know I
don't worry I'm not like anything on my
lips right now and this lighting is
terrible i'm like a pale like demon with
all this things light right here but I'm
not doing anything on my lips I normally
don't and if I do it's chapstick just
like clear um I don't know I always try
lip products but then I never liked them
because I hate the feeling of having
things on my lips that I can't like you
know spread around without it like
getting all over my face if that makes
any sense so um yeah the product that
has been the hardest to get would
probably be my mac eyeshadows and not
because I don't have a mac immune me I
have a counter but I never really liked
going to counters I feel like they're
always kind of intimidating I don't know
maybe you guys know what I mean you
don't but um yeah I had to get mine in
new york city i have like five and um I
got my quads in New York so yeah these
are the four colors I got in New York
and I got them in New York City a while
ago and I just got them there because
that was what the store was and I didn't
want to order them online because I hate
paying shipping and yeah so that's the
story behind that I guess they were kind
of road for me to get
okay my most delicious beauty product
this is hide from because you guys
probably know most people are picking
like lip glosses and I don't like lip
glosses so I picked a lip stain kind of
thing it's the seal lip and cheek stain
and pomegranate kush and some reason I
love how this smells it smells like
fresh pomegranates and it has like a
nice brush applicator and I actually
really like this so um yeah this is my
most tasty or whatever I don't know the
questions are right here most delicious
beauty product
ok which beauty product you i delet
neglect due to laziness I can't talk
right now ok so i don't know if this is
a beauty product but i guess it kind of
is I'm washing my face so like face
washes and scrubs and stuff I am very
bad about like face and skin care but I
don't really have a problems my skin
like I don't really get pimples I don't
really break out and I don't wear any
foundation I just sometimes we're under
eye concealer in the mornings but um
yeah that might surprise some you guys
but like I don't really do much to my
skin and like sometimes I'm really lazy
so I'll just like put some warm water in
my face and that's it but um yeah so cuz
I'm always so tired than I do it and I
just want to skip it but um yeah
okay what beauty product gives me the
most self confidence that would
definitely be mascara um I could leave
the house with just mascara I could with
Jess mascara every day and I'd be
perfectly fine myself but if I don't
worry mascara I look like a lump of
potato like it just it's embarrassing
like I don't know how mascara changes
how i look so much but it really does
and a lot of times I just wear mascara
to school and I'm perfectly fine myself
and yeah so mascara would definitely be
the answer for me
okay what attributes do you find most
attractive in the opposite sex this is
kind of random but I mean I'm perfectly
fine talking about it because I'm
attractive guys you know good stuff
right okay so I'm gonna go with the UH
my personality and then I'm gonna do you
know physical because that's what
everyone else did and yeah so
personality mostly like everyone else
said they have to be funny I'm actually
a shy person like if I don't know you
I'm extremely shy and I'm up me being
kind of awkward I don't really know but
I'm really shy and like I cannot like
start the conversation if you're not
funny you're not like easy to talk to
you I'm sorry I keep touching my hair
it's like in my face but yes we have to
be funny um you know that's basically it
I mean you know good personality
obviously okay and like looks-wise all
right I've kind of like a weird one I
love when guys have like a defined
jawline do you do you know what that
mean I mean like yeah well anyways I
like that i also like when guys have
white eyes um I don't know blue green
that's really I like that a lot and yeah
oh oh oh and if they dressed nice like I
know that's kind of a weird one but if
guys dressed nice it makes them so much
more attractive me it's just I mean guys
in my school don't exactly dressed nice
so that's like a breath of fresh air for
me um so make this video a little more
lively how about I insert some pictures
and examples
okay and then what item would I most
likely want to receive as a gift okay I
really don't know um everyone said
perfume that would be a great one
because I don't like spending money on
perfume um this because like I don't use
it all that often but I really like
having it so that'd be a good one and
also probably like any Mac product
because I can't i don't really like
going in the stores I don't like going
to counters cuz i don't know the people
kind of make me feel like awkward so um
if i didn't have to deal with that that
would be cool um but yeah that's pretty
much it i hope you guys like this tag i
hope you guys liked egg so I haven't
been doing videos i'm a lazy bum um but
yeah so hopefully I'm not like sweating
and I look like a pig but um yes so I
take all of you guys because I love you
all so yeah hope you guys like this and
