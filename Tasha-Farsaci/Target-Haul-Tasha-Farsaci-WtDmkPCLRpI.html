recently got back from Target I just
told my mom I needed to pick up a few
things and yeah that's what happens when
you go in Target
I didn't buy any clothes though so kudos
to me because honestly I did not need
any more clothes be perfectly honest
it's a bunch of random stuff I didn't
know if I should give a haul but I
tweeted out to you guys and you guys
said you want to haul so here I am doing
it before I show you things that I got
at Target I went to Dollar Tree because
my mom needed to get something for a
party were having for my grandpa who's
turning 90 so shout out to grandpa
uh-huh and I was wandering the Dollar
Tree and I saw sunglasses and I assumed
there would be really ugly because you
know they're a dollar and I saw cat eye
sunglasses now to be perfectly honest I
don't look very good in them but I think
they're cute and they were a dollar so
yeah I mean I don't know what do you
guys think I think there's there were a
dollar so Yolo next I got some starburst
flava morph they were also a dollar yeah
we will see that's all I got at the
Dollar Tree I was a big spender okay now
moving on to first thing my mom actually
bought me this I don't know why she put
it in my bag she's interesting but she
caught me this piggy racer because pigs
in my favorite animal not gonna lie and
I guess she saw this
next thing is toothpaste whew a lot of
you guys have been asking me how I found
my teeth so white and I used Crest
Whitestrips as soon as I got my braces
off but I've been off those for like a
few months now and I was just using the
toothpaste that it came with and
basically it's the 3d white toothpaste
and I just ran out so I got two new ones
and also I think my teeth are looking
whiter because I'm getting tanner I
don't know but this true face is
definitely really good and I think this
white my teeth too then I got some
makeup remover this is just not even I
don't know I think it's Target brand cuz
I'm cheap honestly I know I'm like a
beauty guru or whatever I don't really
know the terminology but I don't spend a
lot of money on makeup
like I don't I go into Sephora and I
want to cry because why would I spend
$35 on a grunt I know some people might
hate me now but honestly like I don't
spend a lot of money on makeup so the
makeup I got it's all very cheap this
isn't no specific order I'm literally
just grabbing stuff out of the bag so
anyways I'm just gonna do all this
makeup first my target has elf which is
very dear to my heart because it's like
1 to 3 dollars so I just got some eye
primer because the stuff is good I got
an elf baked eyeshadow that was three
three dollars so I was spending big on
this one it's in the color toasted and I
really don't need more eyeshadows but
this one just looked really pretty I'm
gonna try and take it out here see what
we're working with alright so it looks
like this so far
so this is what it looks like doesn't it
look really pretty I thought it looked
really pretty so yeah I got it
and then I restocked on my clear eyebrow
gel mascara it's clear mascara what am I
saying yeah I use this for my eyebrows
I've been wearing the natural like all
summer except right now because I had a
job interview today and I wanted to do
my hair for her but I decided I would
pick up this not sure mothers of each
baby sea salt spray because I've seen
like a million people talking about it
and I thought this would be nice if I go
to the beach or if I just want that
beachy hair hug yeah so I got this from
Target
looks like and then I was out of my
Aussie hair insurance you guys might
have seen that in my hair care routine
that I did recently if not I will put a
little annotation right here but yeah I
went back to get it and they didn't have
it they must have like changed the
packaging because it looks like this now
and I think it's gonna be more of a gel
instead of like a spray but it says new
look on it so maybe they just changed
that change the packaging but I don't
know I got some coconuts M&amp;amp;Ms because
these things are the bomb they're really
good I like coconut a lot of people hate
coconut but I love it so much so these
are really good ok the final thing I got
was a bracelet to add to my arm candy
this is like my daily arm cake except
the blue ones I don't wear sometimes but
I wear these brown ones every day
because they match everything so I saw
this and I was like I have to get it
it's it looks like this it's like a
little feather and it's on a brown cord
so this could also judge my daily arm
candy maybe I'll put it on now
this back of this thing is like Bratz
dolls do you guys remember when you
Bratz dolls were like the coolest thing
ever but it took like ten years to get
them out of the box and you had to undo
like 50 trillion twisty ties
oh the day so I've gotten it off and I'm
gonna slide it on cuz I don't know if
this is adjustable or whatever they it's
so cute look at it it goes so nicely
with my bracelets that's what I got at
Target and then the Dollar Tree stopped
I hope this wasn't too weird or boring I
know it was kind of brand home but
sometimes I like watching things like
this so if you're feeling generous

fuse of Tasha just like my username
