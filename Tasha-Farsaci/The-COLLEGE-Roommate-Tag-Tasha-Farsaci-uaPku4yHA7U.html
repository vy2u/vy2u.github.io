things you're gonna be talking yeah I
got I'm sorry if I seem more interesting
so today I am here with my roommate
Danielle hi everyone
and naturally we're doing the roommate
tag so yes this is my roommate we are in
the dorm room I figured a roommate tag
has to happen you guys asked for the
roommate tag
so we're here doing the momentum
innervated so you know I'm not gonna
waste any time we're going to jump right
into this yes let's go okay number one
did you guys know each other before you
became roommates
not really we like me that on Facebook
because neither of us wanted to go
random because I think that can go super
wrong so we like found each other and my
message each other
yeah we like kind of Facebook dated
three totally coming it was adorable
okay though it worked out you know yeah
we like know people here that didn't
choose their roommates and they don't
like their Romania it just didn't go
well for everyone so I think we made a
good decision
number two what did you guys initially
think you think of each other the first
time you met the person was so funny
yeah okay the first time we met we
wanted me before we came here so we met
in like New York City and it was in the
middle of like a torrential downpour
like there was no flood warning and yeah
I don't know idea it was fun though we
like 1ups dinner in Little Italy so we
had a good time I don't know what I
thought of you I know I mean we kind of
already knew each other yeah yeah okay
what do you guys usually argue about Oh
No
I don't want to make for your arm you
don't really argue at all baby Oh me
about my hair being everywhere no I feel
like that's like a joke that's a joke I
think if we argue about anything it's
not arguing it's just complaining
yeah I'm deciding who's going to take
out the trash oh the trash yeah I don't
know we don't yeah what is one thing
that really bothers you to choose me
okay I've got it it's our it's our big
inside joke about your hair oh my hair
it gets everywhere I'm totally bad like
oh um it's just it gets everywhere it
happens it doesn't like annoy me it's
just we make a joke out of it because
I'll like go pick up something somewhere
and there's like Tasha's blonde hair on
it mine isn't something you do it's
something you don't do and it's you know
not that it's that you never have class
okay that's been good one Daniella's net
class of Mondays so she's a three-day
weekend every weekend and then
Wednesdays she doesn't have class until
7 p.m. and I have class every day of the
week 6 do you guys both have the same
passion for makeup I'm gonna say that
Tasha is a little bit more passionate
about makeup than I am
but I like Vegas I'm not even very
passionate like I didn't bring that much
I feel like I like clothes more than I
like makeup yeah oh definitely
we both did really like well with
bringing not an addicted not a
ridiculous amount of makeup true what
does she think of your YouTube oh well I
think it's really cool she's really like
cool about it
okay who spends the most time getting
ready in the boy you do because I just
like don't wake up yeah or I don't get
ready I mean I feel like in terms of
like if we're going out I think it could
be equivalent if you were doing your
hair oh yeah my hair takes a long time
so I yeah I don't know I get ready for
class and stuff and I gave up like
really really but yeah it's hard to tell
since we never have we're never getting
ready at the same time yeah what was
something that you two didn't notice
about each other until you became
roommates oh I know something that you
probably hadn't noticed about me
there's all the faces and like
imitations like made oh my gosh to do
your um no I'm not going on YouTube
nobody's oh comfy cat Danielle can do a
grumpy cat I can do a grumpy cat face I
don't think I'm going to you have to
stay tuned for next video um Oh
something you didn't notice about me
now do you guys sometimes get fed up
with each other from seeing each other
too often we don't even see each other
that often because our classes are like
opposite yeah well no we see each other
like that's true all the time like we
don't have class together so we don't
like spend all day every day - yeah can
you see that piece of my hair and you're
not my bad oh my oh wait I know
something that's annoying
yeah that's not annoying for me it's
annoying for you is your phone falling
and the YouTube side going down okay so
my bed is locked all the way up if you
haven't seen my dorm tour check out the
dorm - I'm gonna link it go low but my
vents locked it and there's like a
little crack in between my bed in the
wall and underneath my bad I have my
youtube like a hundred subscribers or a
hundred thousand years five hundred when
a thousand subscribers like plaque and
sometimes my phone will fall off of my
bag in the corner like it hooked around
the plaque and not the plaque off the
wall and then they all get stuck in the
corner behind my dresser and everything
and it's just like this was huge
commotion like it'll be like that 4:00
in the morning and all of a sudden
you'll hear we're both just looking at
the plug right now what yeah one time it
was like it was 4:00 a.m. and I hear
this huge crash and I knew what it was
and I couldn't leave my phone down there
because it was my alarm so I had to get
out of bed pull myself apart get my
phone out climb back up it was it was a
struggle yeah how do you avoid tension
that says we're not even getting real
yeah what's one rule you guys have while
living together really didn't establish
rules yeah I'm the remain agreement that
we had to sign that our our RA like came
and passed
we didn't read it we just checked off
all the boxes inside it yeah I don't
know like I don't like take your clothes
like I don't wear your foot yeah that
doesn't count
I don't know thirteen how do you feel
how do you deal with sharing a bathroom
well I'll be sure about them with our
entire floor so it's not just us
oh okay I bet you know the same thing
I'm going to say what's the one most
annoying thing about the bathroom the
people do not do with a bathroom flush
people don't flush people people do not
flush the toilet there's that one person
we don't have we don't know who it is
maybe it's a few people but someone
literally goes to the bathroom I'm not
talking pee a ghost the bathroom it just
leaves it there they just like don't
flush and like you're in college you
should know how to flush the toilet at
this point or at least you should know
that it's like very inconsiderate to not
flush the toilet like I go to the
bathroom
I shouldn't have to open the stall and
be scared to look at the toilet yeah
your shower is also a really unfortunate
except there's one shower
that's the handicapped shower but we
don't have anyone that's handicapped on
our floor so anyone can use it and it's
bigger and it has like a little bench
put your like shower caddy down on it
it was a luxury do you make two separate
dinners at night oh we don't exactly
make dinners because we have a fridge
and a microwave
the light feel like I mean we eat
separately nerds I mean sometimes we go
to dinner
but yeah I mean we also have differences
like Tong schedules so yeah what are
your favorite thing is that you like to
do with each other go shopping go
shopping go to the beach um oh what was
I gonna say Harris bowls for a paradise
oh my god yes um you know experience
awkward situation oh that's definitely
on the top of the list
yeah I've be bombarded in our own room
people just flying newsroom inside he's
probably watch I know he probably is
shiny know who you are huh 18 what
happens when one person gets sick oh oh
well we've been there um I guess like
the third week of school Tasha got
really sick and did you have like it was
like stuck flow bleh
it came back negative but like the
antibiotics like got rid of it in like a
day but I saw the fever so I'm pretty
sure with strep throat because it was
going around campus yeah and the room
basically was infected like I wasn't
angry or anything it's not her fault but
there was germs in the air so um I slept
into one else's room like all the floor
yeah one night it was really bent and it
was also very hot still like 95 yeah oh
maybe not let's just talk about having a
fever and having it be like 90 degrees
and laying in bed in your own sweat like
yeah holiday mission 19 have you thought
about having pets or a pet oh yes we did
I get out of bed oh I forgot oh my god
so like why dick the second week of
school connect my second or third week
of school we got what they were giving
away fish on campus we didn't go out and
buy a fish
they're giving away fish they're like
okay so we got a fish and it was doing
fine it was fine but the water started
getting a little murky so I was like you
know I feel really bad for Sully Sully
was our fish so I'm like Sully is
struggling he's in some cloud water like
I feel bad I can't I see him anymore I
tried to drop him some plant life into
kind of it really heat up clean up the
water nothing really happened I'm like
okay you know I'm gonna go I'm gonna
dump out the water gonna get new water I
tried to give him temperature water I
thought it'd be five Sully went through
a shock apparently there was some sort
of shock that he went through and there
was a shock serum that we were supposed
to include when we change the water that
the people who gave us the fish did not
include in our care package
so unfortunately Sully did not make it
is it is it like put him in the bowl did
you water I knew something a little bit
wrong
like he just feels like you would say
yes okay I let's go I'm like this is not
looking good at mixtape tangle yeah rest
in peace sorry so that's in peace 20
what is the funniest thing you've done
together
I'm trying to baby don't like to us what
would be funny would it be funny to
anyone else the kind of funny the very
first night of school I went through an
emergency exit on accidentally I was
really a hobby of arms in the entire
field like oh my god the elevator
the Olivia picture about elevator
picture that was really ok so that's
like the first funny thing yeah I open
an emergency exit actually I had a boy
open an emergency exit for me not
knowing that it was an emergency exit
and the alarm went off in the whole
building
there was a sign that said like do not
open this door it's an emergency exit
like alarms will sound and he's like
standing at or reading it then he just
pulls it open anyway but we didn't know
ok but I thought of the funniest thing
so once again like I'll be the second or
first week of school so it's like in the
elevators there were these just like
posters on either side of like people I
don't know it's always like inspiration
for guys cool thing I don't really know
how do we even get the idea anyways we
have like a guy and a girl side out our
floor and each side has look at their
own RA so like the guy RA and a girl RA
and we were gonna we decided that we
would like print out pictures of their
faces and put them in place of the faces
people be elevator elevator but we
couldn't figure out how to scale down my
face size so we had to leave the girl
all right out yeah but we are we did
manage to successfully place the face on
the face on the base and okay last
question 21 has being roommates helped
or hurt your relationship oh it's by far
health did I mean considering we didn't
really know each other before a roommate
