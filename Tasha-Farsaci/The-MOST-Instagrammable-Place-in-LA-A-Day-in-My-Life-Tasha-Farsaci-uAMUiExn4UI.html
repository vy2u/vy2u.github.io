today I want to do a little vlog sort of
thing it's a really nice day to Saturday
and I think my friend Leia and I are
going to go to probably Alfred's
teahouse no he alfred's tea something
it's really really really cute little
tea place in LA they also have a coffee
place Alfred coffee where I saw Joe
Jonas and Ellen DeGeneres so yeah we're
going there it's really really cute so I
wanted to show you guys and I haven't
done like a little vlog in a while so
this morning I haven't looked on much
I've just gotten up and got ready I'm
wearing this really cute little
two-piece set from princess Polly and
I'm wearing my necklaces from Etsy and
about to make a little protein shake I
know Tasha what the heck can you drink
protein shakes I'm actually collabing
with fit shakes on this video so I'm
going to show you guys what it is okay
so basically fit shakes is made by 50
and I've worked with them before and
they reached out to me and they asked me
if I want to try their fit shakes and it
was chocolate flavoured so I was like
okay I love chocolate you know if it
tastes good then that's good because
it's good for you how I figured I'd try
it basically you can mix it with
whatever you want you can mix it with
water if you want low calorie I mix it
with milk personally because and it
tastes like chocolate milk but you can
also blend it with like fruits and like
cacao nibs or anything you want just to
make it taste as good as you want it to
in each serving there's only 100
calories which is so amazing and they're
16 grams of protein and 28% fibers so
homegirl feels healthy when she's
drinking this so this shake is supposed
to help you build muscle and burn fat I
know how it's you know going to do well
with that considering I ate pizza this
morning for breakfast but yeah it's
actually really good so I'm going to
make it quickly
yeah so this table is actually really
good
it honestly takes like chocolate milk
that you make with like chocolate powder
my only complaint is that the powder
definitely dissolved very well so I
don't know if it would work better if I
were to blend it or something let me
know what you guys think and also let me
know what you think I should mix in with
this because I'm interested to try and
find new things to mix it with but yeah
if you guys want to try this out I do
think it's really good I do before
moco's
it's just fit shake five I will also put
that in the description
yeah accurate
so we both got the pink string purely
for aesthetic fructose hundred percent
and it's not it's not bad it tastes like
it's definitely weird but I like it
he's like sugar yeah and pink just dog
tail is like the color pink yes but
outside is cute as well I just took some
pics there you'll see them on the graph
we're going to now explore find more
places putting more photos pepillo
sipping on this strength this is the
back until IQ signal focusing but it
says there's also keep on I'm gonna zoom
can't we all just get along
that's amazing I know right to play out
who do you see right now Connor McGregor
is right behind me right now he's behind
that guy I don't know who this is but
she took a big deal he was dope
false alarm
who wasn't him rule we don't tell anyone
that stupid I am no one can believe
label him with sunglasses on but then we
got a better look more like I've never
been born but guys the other day I saw
Robbie from Joe Joe season of The
Bachelor at in and out and I never
thought he was a ha like I always
thought he was attractive but it's kind
of like feminine-looking not that that's
bad but like whatever and I literally
saw him in and out he's so much hotter
in person and I couldn't help with him
because he looked that much hotter and
then we pulled up his insta and he was
wearing the same hat in and out that he
wasn't in so they were like oh my god
and yeah Robbie water Izzy hit me up
what do we keep every penny because it
was really close and you can walk and
the thing I came up to her in time Oh
way I got her through it first and I was
looking at the white boys rule comes
away
so eh it's not everything there we go so
I'm so I'm still super good there's the
first incident I can always be
ten years later my first game I listed
the chicken curry sandwich so I would
recommend ya hi guys so Leah and I both
just got so so tired all of a sudden
it's like really muggy out and just like
kinda like gloomy but like almost gloomy
and muggy so we woke up really tired and
we might see each other later we might
just like hang out or whatever but right
now I'm about to change into some like
comfy clothes and watch the show I was
recently shown that there's a show in
the UK called love island which is
literally like the UK's version of
bachelor in paradise and I am obsessed
with it so I've been binge watching that
on my laptop if you guys are from there
or if you know what I'm talking about
let me know because I love it so I think
that's what I'm going to do for now just
like a chill Saturday hey guys
oh it's literally 9 p.m. now I am
convinced I was drugged not really but I
literally got home and passed out I was
so exhausted and I just got out and just
heated up some homemade mac and cheese
that I made yesterday for a national mac
and cheese day yeah so I just did that
I'm sitting here I'm going to watch that
reality show living life oh my gosh guys
also I just ate a bunch of pickles and I
don't know if I'm visually stupid and
this is like a well-known fact pickles
have zero calories
what so I love pickles healthy snack
