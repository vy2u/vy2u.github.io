hideous I still haven't figured out how
to kind of film in my new room because
the windows are right there so this is
like the best spot but there's nothing
cute behind me so I'm still working on
that I apologize that I've been kind of
m.i.a I haven't posted a video in a
while and I've just been really trying
to adjust and trying to meet people
because it's been really hard since I am
a spring in bed at USC so I've just been
kind of like trying to do my own thing
and like meet a bunch of people so I am
really focusing on YouTube so I just
decided to do a little Q&amp;amp;A I kind of
posted a snapchat or not it was an
Instagram story and I was like comment
on my last photo and then I'll put your
comment in a Q&amp;amp;A maybe so if you guys
don't follow me on instagram it's
fiercely hot shot you should totally
follow me because if I do more things
like this in the future you'll be able
to participate and you can see more of
my like personal day-to-day life so yeah
if you guys want to follow me that would
be great okay so I'm just going to you
know kind of scroll through the comments
and pick ones that I see that come up
often or that sound kind of interesting
okay so a lot of you guys are asking how
I stay in shape particularly like how
I'm skinny when I eat a lot of crap um
so one question is how do you manage to
eat really unhealthy yet stay so thin
like you so I guess I can just do a
little overview of kind of with my
workout diet situation if you guys want
a full video on that totally let me know
but basically I've always had a fast
metabolism I'm naturally pretty thin but
um I have been going to the gym like
every day here I do have a lot of free
time because I'm only taking three
classes at Community College right now
if you guys are new to my channel and
have questions about what I'm doing for
college and all that stuff I'll put my
videos addressing that and your
description
can't speak I'm sorry but basically I've
been going to the gym like every other
day or every day you know when I have
time and then as far as food I do me
unhealthy a lot but not all the time I
mean like if I'm eating Taco Bell like
yell snapchat it but I'm not always
eating Taco Bell and I eat pretty small
portions like I don't need a lot also
try to walk a lot of places you go I
know I cook my classes a lot of them are
like the fourth floor buildings and I
always take the stairs
so yeah just like little things but I do
think I have been wearing the gym a lot
so that is how I'm staying like fit um
but yeah I also am pretty naturally
small so okay going on you guys are
asking me about college dating and like
college dating advice and guys I have no
idea like dating in college is super
hard some people you know are more like
the dating type and they were totally
like a lot of people are fine with
having relationships but for me like I
don't even know what I want and it's
hard to find guys that do you want a
relationship um at least like the guys
that I'm interested in so yeah like
right now I have no idea but I can get
back to you on that um guys I don't know
dating help with his weird boys are
weird I don't know a lot of you guys are
asking what my favorite part of living
in California or living in LA is and
I've always been a city girl I really
love cities there's just so much going
on and so much to do so that's one
reason I like LA but I love California
because all the beautiful beaches I just
love the weather I love the beach
unfortunately I'm kind of far from the
beach we're living like at USC I love
how like Northern California is so
different than Southern California but
it's still like so cool and unique and
I'm um like I said there's just so much
to do and there's so many opportunities
and pull people out of you so yeah I
just really love it and I hope
in LA for a while because yeah I love it
here how tall am i I've mentioned this
in videos before I'm five foot one so
I'm short a lot of you guys assumed that
I'm really tall but I'm not I'm super
short
so yeah I'm five foot one what am i
majoring in so once again you'll kind of
get more into depth this answer if you
watch some of my college videos
basically last year when I was a student
at LMU I was a Communication Studies
major and when I applied to transfer to
USC I was also find the communication
school but they didn't let me in as
communications so right now I'm
undeclared but I just need to like get
straight A's so I can transfer into the
communication school so ultimately I
will be a Communication Studies major
again but right now I'm undeclared but
you know like I have all A's right now
so I should be fine
transferring into it if you guys were
asking why I started YouTube and
basically I remember back in the day I
started like a long time ago maybe five
or six years ago honestly that was the
dryer did you hear that
anyways I started you two a long time
ago I remember I watched a hair video a
girl doing her hair I thought it was
really cool so I started making videos
most of them were like hairstyle videos
and some of them got very popular and I
was like wait this is so cool and I just
really liked doing it it was the perfect
creative outlet for me I didn't really
feel like or I didn't feel like I fit in
really where I lived at home I just felt
like I was someone I was just more
creative and there was more things I
want to do and that was kind of with my
creative outlet so you know Here I am
now still doing it I've had so many
amazing opportunities you guys are so
amazing like whenever I meet you guys
you guys are so sweet and nice I want to
say thank you and I seriously do love
YouTube like you guys must know that
because I started so long ago you know
before I like like YouTube has just
turned into something people do flowing
money to like get famous or
ever but I have literally started in the
Stone Age like I started I had no idea
that anyone made money off youtube I had
no idea like anyone got to do like cool
stuff I just thought of a school that I
could post a video on the internet and
people would see it you know like
YouTube has come so far but I mean I
think you guys know that I'm like
genuine about YouTube because I've been
doing it for so long so yeah that's why
I started and I still love it okay so
what the next question is how do I like
being in Community College right now and
I'm how excited am I to start college at
USC in the spring
okay so Community College right now I'm
not loving it um I don't know a lot of
the classes are very easy and I know
some people are going to kind of like
butter over to psych people were getting
mad that I cheated about getting like a
really high grade I'm a community
college they are a lot easier than I'm
used to which is fine I just I mean a
lot of the people I mean no one's really
like super friendly I feel like I don't
know it's just like I don't I don't love
it they are mean I go to class like I'm
getting A's I leave but it's just really
hard to meet people that go to USC
because I'm not like actually on campus
like going for the classes so I'm really
excited to start classes there I'm
excited to be more challenged and just
meet people that are you know in the
same class as me and like doing the same
things as me but you know I'm so
grateful to be in LA and feed my nice
apartment and you know be going to class
at all so yeah it is kind of a struggle
adjusting and meeting people especially
because I could in Russia sorority um
but yeah I mean once the spring comes
along it'll be fine just for now it's
kind of like Nick how do I deal with
stress in college cuz girl I'm
struggling okay home girl I was
struggling to I'm not just like the
classes just like everything the
adjustment so what did i do yesterday I
got my nails done it was like my stress
was like bubbling over and my nails were
you know she
the effects like I had peeled off my gel
manicure I had hangnails everywhere guys
I'm going to show you how great my nails
look right now okay yeah like not that
to my own horn but they're looking
pretty great they match my dress and I
don't know about you guys like when my
nails look good I feel like I'm a little
bit more put together no but on a more
serious note it's just important to know
that like everything is going to get
better and you're going to get through
things just try to organize your
thoughts keep yourself busy if you're
stressing about a certain thing or
person and yeah I get your nails done
you know treat yo'self girl because
it'll make you feel better okay those
are all the questions I'm going to
answer today I think are touched on the
ones that were asked the most
