telling you guys I was transferring
colleges and ever since I have
transferred I've been getting an
overwhelming amount of comments and yams
and just questions from you guys asking
me how I did it what I did
tips and tricks and I haven't been
answering any of those just because I
figure it would be the most helpful to
just film an entire video about what I
did to transfer by no means is this
going to be the guarantee that you get
into your university of choice but I'm
just going to tell you what I did and
what I wish people had told me when I
was applying the transfer because at the
time I knew no one that went through the
process and I had no idea what I was
doing and if it was going to be
successful or not so there are some
things that I wish I had known anyways I
just thought this video would be helpful
I know some of you guys may not be
interested but for those of you that are
here it is quickly before I get into the
video if you're not following me on
social media you guys totally show it
it's super personal I keep my social
media like very personal rather than
like fizziness see you to be so if you
guys want to see me more on like a
day-to-day basis you guys can totally
follow me on Instagram or Twitter or
snapchat or anything I'm going to put
them all in the description box and if
you're not subscribed to my channel
please subscribe review lots of college
videos like this one but I also do
fasting videos and lifestyle videos and
hair videos and all that kind of stuff
so you guys should totally subscribe if
you aren't already all by the way it's
game day today so that's why I'm wearing
a Jersey okay so I'm just going to give
you a little bit of background
information if you want to see the video
where I talked about why I was
transferring exactly where I was
transferring from and everything I have
a little video about that I will link it
down below bye I'm going to go into a
little bit of a backstory just in case
you guys are new to my channel and you
no idea what I'm talking about so
basically I attended Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles for my
freshman year of college
LMU is a four-year private university
this video is how I transferred to USC I
don't know how it works for other
colleges or universities if it's the
same fit similar if it's different but
this is just what I did hopefully this
can help some of you okay so as soon as
I figured out but I wanted to apply to
transfer I went on USC's website to try
and get all the deadlines straight and
see exactly what I had to do and you're
going to want to do the same thing
because it's specific for every school
and every major that you're applying to
what you need so I think the application
deadline for transfer was February 1st
for USC and for the major that I was
applying into I needed a few things
extra I know I needed a recommendation
from a college professor and I think
that was all that was different from
just like normal applicants but make
sure you go and check and see what you
need for the school you're applying to
because it could be different so
basically what I had to do was fill out
the common app again which of you guys
have already applied to college you know
this sucks but I haven't fill it out
again it was basically the same thing
except some of the questions were
different you know obviously because
you're transferring and then the coming
up essay was why you want to transfer
something along those lines instead of
what it was previous years and then it
was a supplement for USC USC had a
supplement and I just filled out those
questions I did get a college professor
recommendation which was very difficult
because at this time I had only gone
through college classes for one semester
and I really didn't feel like I clicked
with any of my professors I really
talked to them I'm not a super talkative
person in class I kind of heaped myself
so I didn't really have a great
professor but I didn't have a choice so
I just chose the class that I enjoyed
the most professor that I liked the most
and I asked her for a recommendation if
it's possible I would recommend getting
your recommendation letter from a
professor that's in your
desired major because I'm a
communication major and I didn't get my
letter from a communication professor I
got mine from a sociology professor just
because at the time I didn't feel like I
would get as good of a recommendation
from another professor but if you can I
would say try and get your letter of rec
from someone that's in your field of
study something else that I cannot
stress enough is checking articulation
agreements and seeing if your courses
will transfer to the school that you
want to transfer to if you guys don't
know what that is I don't know other
schools have this but USC on like some
website of theirs you can type in the
school that you're currently going to
and it'll show you the courses that are
equivalent to courses at USC or will
transfer for credit at USC so I didn't
know about this obviously my first
semester because I didn't know I was
going to want to transfer but for second
semester I looked at this and I made
sure that I signed up for courses and
that would transfer for credit because I
knew if I got in I would not want to you
know I've taken all those courses at LMU
and them not count for anything at USC
so this is so important I cannot stress
this enough please please please find
out and make sure that your courses are
going to transfer because you don't want
to be spending more money and then being
at college and extra year because your
courses don't transfer I know a lot of
you guys are going to be asking me about
my grades
and my GPA and I'm going to be
completely honest with you I think that
is the most important part of the
application you can have a killer essay
you can have like good extracurriculars
but it's really all about the grades um
I got lucky my first semester at I love
you and I have taken fairly easy courses
when I had signed up I think my
counselor was just trying to put me at
easy choices so I could like get
adjusted to the school so I wasn't what
I was trying but I wasn't trying to
super super hard and I ended up with a
3.7 for my first semester if I had known
I was gonna transfer I would have tried
even harder to get closer to a 4.0 but
obviously at that point in time I was
just you know like having fun enjoying
my first semester of college but when
second semester rolled around I knew
that I wanted my GPA to be higher than
it was first semester because I knew
that
improvement in my GPA would look good to
a us me counselor so I was also taking
harder classes but basically I pushed
myself so hard I get extra credit I went
to office hours any possible time that I
could and I ended up with a 3.8 7 GPA
second semester so basically my
cumulative GPA from LMU was a 3.8 and I
believe USC's average admitted transfer
students GPA is a 3.7 so I was a little
bit above keep in mind though if you
guys are not familiar with me I am a
spring transfer admin at USC so even
though my GPA was high I still didn't
get fall admission so I mean I guess
it's not all about grades but who knows
in terms of my outside I personally did
not think it was very strong
I just wrote about how USC is the my
dream school for ever my essay was
basically what I talked about in my why
I'm transferring colleges video once
again I'll link it down below that's
basically what my essay was I really I
don't think it was that great but it's
just what I wrote and I was honest and I
was myself and Here I am so USA did ask
for my high school transcript as well as
my a CT scores
I'm not sure how much this factor into
the admission decision I think in high
school my high school did grading
super-weird I didn't have like a GPA on
a 4.0 scale
I had like a percentage out of a hundred
and I believe my average at the end of
my four years of high school was like a
97% so yeah I did pretty well in high
school I had a 31 on my a CT so I I
guess that probably helped my
application but I really don't think
your high school scores do a lot for
your application it probably just did
more for me because I was applying to be
a sophomore transfer rather than a
junior transfer and they didn't have a
ton of information from my college year
I submitted my application and
everything before the deadline make
so you do that because if you forgot
something and you've submitted your
stuff on the deadline you're going to be
too late so I definitely say to try and
get everything together and submitted
before the deadline a lot of you guys
are probably wondering how UFC got my
spring semester grades when I had to
apply by February first
so actually what happened is they waited
until the end of my spring semester and
then they send me a letter in the mail
and in my USC portal and they were like
hey we want to see your spring grades so
I had to send them a copy of my spring
grade transcript and that's why it took
me so long to hear back from them they
were reviewing that so basically I got
through the first cuts
I would assume and then they wanted to
see how I did in the spring semester I
don't know if they do this for everyone
but I need a were going to do this for
me because I only had one semester of
grades to show them I know that if
you're transferring as a junior they
might not ask for this because you have
more grades and more years of college to
show them but for me I knew they were
going to ask my spring grades so that's
another reason why I like kicked it into
gear spring semester I think the last
thing that I kind of want to touch on /
end on is don't assume that you're going
to get in and I don't want to be like a
Debbie Downer and maybe the school
you're transferring to is in competitive
or whatever but you don't want to put
all your eggs in one basket I know I
still paid for housing at LMU because I
didn't know if I was going to get into
USC and I didn't want to be left with
nowhere to live luckily I did get in but
like I said I know you want to hope for
the best
but you also have to prepare for the
worst so yeah just don't assume you're
going to get in I really hope you guys
do get in but just be focused I think
that's everything I wanted to say in
this video once again if this is the
first video you've watched in mind or
you know nothing about what happened
with my transfer experience or process
totally watch the video link down below
I don't forget a lot of things up if you
guys have any more questions about
transferring or my
totally leaves in the comments I'll try
and answer them or if you have a reading
comments and you see a question that you
can answer feel free to answer I got me
great if this video helps you out or if
you liked it please give it a thumbs up
I love you guys so much and thank you
