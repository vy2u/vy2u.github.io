that I went back and forth on in my head
about whether or not I was gonna film it
so many times but ever since I mentioned
potentially filming it I've been getting
questions from you guys asking where it
is and all that stuff so yeah I'm
filming it as you can tell by the title
this video is going to be me
talking about my experience with Verde
recruitment
Bertie rush what happened because in my
video where I showed you when I wore for
it if you haven't seen that I will link
it down below
I basically mentioned that it didn't
really go very well for me and I almost
dropped out of brush completely and a
lot of you guys don't want to hear why
so yeah I'm gonna tell you basically
everything that happened and there has
been something that has been going on
for like a year that I never really
talked about so I'm gonna mention that
as well really quickly before I get on
into the video if you guys are not
following me on social media and you
want to keep up to my keep up to my keep
up with my personal life feel free
because I post tons of personal life
pics and stuff on there so yeah okay
yeah I really have not planned how I'm
gonna do this video so I'm probably
gonna be all over the place but I guess
I'm gonna give you guys some background
about me and how I felt like going into
rush and whatnot so basically this year
I'm a junior at USC the University of
Southern California and the reason that
I just watched this year's junior is
because I transferred from a different
school that I did not rush up and I was
a transfer spring admin last year so I
couldn't rush because rush was in the
fall rushes in the fall at USC and even
though I was a spring admin I couldn't
do it and they don't really have spring
rush so this is the first year that I
could rush at USC and to be honest I
never really saw myself as like a
sorority girl I mean I don't know I was
I was really shy in high school so I
wish it's never something that I really
saw myself doing but especially being a
transfer student at a school where Greek
life is so prevalent
and very like emphasized I feel it was
something that I really really wanted to
do to meet people just to be more
involved and you know to be able to like
fit into the school more I don't know if
that makes sense yes obviously not
everyone is in Greek life at USC but it
is a very big thing and it was just for
me I felt like it would be the easiest
way to feel more integrated and to meet
people meet a bunch of girls like me so
yeah I was really excited to rush and I
had heard things that rushing as a
junior isn't very easy because
sororities want younger girls so if you
know they're in the sorority for longer
and whatnot but I wasn't I wasn't too
nervous because I did have a lot of
friends in the sororities that I felt I
was interested in and they would all be
like Oh Tosha it was so fine like
everyone loves you like whatever so I
know that everyone always says to go
into rush without any preconceived
notions and I do agree that that is the
best way to do it but when you've
already gone to the school for a
semester and you know people in the
sororities you have friends and certain
sororities you're obviously going to get
an idea of where you see yourself or you
know where you want to go you see the
people that you feel you get along with
most all in like one house or two houses
and you kind of you know it's hard to
not be like oh I want that one so yeah I
did I did go into rush having an idea of
where I thought I would see myself but I
still you know I still wanted to like
obviously give all the houses a shot
okay so I went through my first round of
recruitment and I actually felt really
really good about it I enjoyed it I
enjoyed all my conversations with the
girls and there were like three houses
that I really really liked they also
happen to be houses that I had friends
in that I had thought I would like
beforehand so maybe I was a little bit
biased but there were three I really
really liked three and then obviously
there was more that I still liked and
then somebody liked as much but I felt
really really confident I felt that all
my conversations when really well
and yeah I just felt like it was working
out so far so I remember there was like
a gap day in between our first round and
then when we got our first round of cuts
so yeah I wasn't really nervous I was
feeling like I said pretty good about it
and I remember we were grading we were
getting our email with our new schedule
when I was in class so I was prepared to
open it in class and like I said I
wasn't worried to do this because it was
the first round I was like I'm sure
it'll be fine what I think my
conversations are good they were great
so yeah I was in class waiting for the
email there was one of my friends next
to me who was also waiting for the email
and I got it and I opened it and I
looked at this email and like my top
three had all cut me and then another
one that I had liked caught me as well
so I was looking at it and I was like
wait is this like is this wrong is this
just for like the first day I was
honestly like in shock yeah so in this
moment I was really really shocked
especially since those three like
favorite houses of mine I thought the
conversations went really really well
and I had kind of I felt like I'd kind
of had my heart set on those which I
know is just it's not the way to do it
especially because I'd only gone through
the first round but like I said I did
know people in those houses I had
experienced you know a bunch of girls
that I knew were in those houses so yeah
I was really really upset and although I
know I did still have a good amount of
houses left I was just so focused on the
fact that I was cut from all of my like
favorites at the time that I was just
really really upset it was hard because
I had a lot of friends who were rushing
at the same time as me and none of them
had been caught by as many houses as me
or by the ones that they had wanted so I
just really felt like no one felt like
how I felt and at this point I was just
like really discouraged I was like okay
like I thought I had friends in these
sororities like why wouldn't they stick
up for me
just got really really annoyed with the
process and I literally like I almost
completely dropped out that day I was
just so upset and so like overwhelmed by
what happened and I just felt so
discouraged but the more I thought about
it I realized that there were still
houses left that wanted me and wanted me
to come back and that I did have really
good conversations at and I told myself
okay Tasha just go through another round
like you already went through all this
just go through it and see what happens
and if you don't like any of them you
can always drop then but from now just
like continue with the process yeah so
it was really really tough continuing
with the process because obviously I was
still so like shaken up by the first
round of cuts but like I said I had
really really great conversations a few
of the houses left I liked a few I just
really didn't see myself there yeah so I
ended up finishing out the process and I
ended up in Alfea which honestly from
the first day was one of the places I
had really great conversations I just
didn't know any girls in it prior to my
experience so I just wasn't really like
biased towards the house dude I mean yes
so I'm not gonna sit here and be like oh
my gosh I'm like ecstatic this is the
best thing that's ever happened to me
because you know it's still a tough it's
tough meeting new girls but I have met
some awesome girls in also fee you know
I'm still trying to get to know everyone
but I definitely am like so happy that I
finished out the process because if I
had dropped I never would have even
known what it would have been like to
join a house and I never would have met
the awesome girls that I've met so far
so yeah I guess what I want to say is
that I'm not gonna tell you not to go in
with preconceived notions because I know
that that's almost impossible but keep
an open mind so even if you do get cut
by all the houses that you thought you
would have wanted just finish it out
because even if you don't end up loving
the house you're in you can always drop
it afterward but if you drop during rush
you can't go back to you what I mean I
just want to be clear that I'm not at
all trying to be like Oh Alfie like
wasn't what I wanted like but I just
joined it cuz I like knowing if I hadn't
wanted to join it I wouldn't have it's
not cheap you know what I mean I loved
all the girls I talked to you I had
great conversations
so I am in no way shape or form I'm
trying to be like Oh like they were my
backup like whatever like that's not the
case I wouldn't have joined it if I
didn't feel like I could actually see
myself there yes so that is kind of what
went down during the whole week but I
kind of want to touch on something else
that has been going on with me that has
to do with this for about a year now
and I just really didn't know if I
wanted to bring this up because I don't
even know if you guys would care but
it's been something that's actually
really been bothering me and I don't
know if this will even help anyone but I
kind of wanted to just talk about it and
maybe this will explain like what
happened to me during rush whatever all
right so about a year ago maybe not
quite a year ago like January of last
year I remember I was google searching
something about USC and recruitment or
watch because I wanted info I wanted to
see if there was any way I could join as
a spring admin I don't know exactly what
I was looking for but I googled it so
one of the first websites I came across
I'm not gonna say the name of it because
I think it's a horrible website and it
really sucks but basically one of the
first websites I came across I clicked
on and if you guys know what this
website is please don't comment it
because like I said I think it's awful
and I don't want people to know about it
but it's basically a website that has
like every college on it that has like
Greek life and you can go to your school
and then it's basically just threads and
forums about Greek life at that school
so I had no idea what this website was
when I clicked on it I just saw like USC
like Greek life or something so I
clicked on it and I saw my name my name
as a title of one of the threads at the
time it was like my screen name or
something my life you see Tasha because
that was like what my screen name or
whatever and I was like what the heck
because this thing had like three
thousand views and over two hundred
posts in it so I click on this and
basically people had been bashing me and
talking about how I'm going to rush for
like months
and the things were in in this thread
were so mean and okay I get hate
comments on my videos almost every day
and they don't bother me because you
know these people don't know me in real
life but seeing it like this like these
are the people that I most likely go to
school with and the things they're
saying like affects my personal life so
seeing this was really really difficult
for me they were saying that I hook up
with all these guys I'm like getting
with this guy and this one a frat which
is never like none of this stuff was
true they were saying how I want to be
I'm not rich enough for these sororities
I'm from this small town in the middle
of nowhere like who am i coming to LA
thinking I'm like all that they're
saying oh she's like cute but when she
opens her mouth I want to die like just
like just think of all the mean
that you can think of and it was all
written about me here and people were
basically saying like every sorority
should cut this girl like make sure
she's blacklisted like she sucks she's a
weird youtuber blah blah so because they
were using my real name in this thread I
got it deleted because that's like
against the site's rules or whatever but
they just kept popping back up like as
soon as I would get one deleted people
would post new ones and I think that was
frustrating part about this for me as I
was like who was posting this stuff and
he was reading this stuff and am I like
friends with them like have I talked to
these people and thought that they liked
me and then they're going on this and
like posting about me so yeah I never
really talked about this because I
didn't want people to see it and I did
bring it up to some of my friends in
sororities and I was like hey like I
found this stuff about me it's not true
like is this going to impact me and they
were all like oh my gosh you know like
no one reads that like that's so stupid
they don't even worry about it like
everyone loves you that's met you like
oh blob so yeah I just like did my best
to ignore it I know people will probably
say like Tasha like don't read it like
why would you read it it's stupid but
like if people are saying these like
really disgusting things about me I
don't want people to be reading it so
obviously I've like been monitoring it
and trying to delete the things that I
could get deleted there are even people
posting
pretending to be me saying things that
would make me look bad make me look like
I was really cocky it was just like a
lot these postings were going on through
the whole week of recruitment as well so
people would be like oh I saw her down
the row like she's going back to these
houses which at this point was
completely false all the way to bid day
they were like oh she has these two left
which completely false oh she got
dropped from everything like completely
false
literally all just crazy crazy um
yeah so I don't know if that even
interested you I just felt like I needed
to talk about it and yeah I just kind of
say I'm a real person and I mean I know
it's probably not all of you guys ever
posting this it's people probably that
go in my school but yeah I am affected
by things I'm not like not so yeah
throughout the whole recruitment process
none of my friends and houses were
allowed to talk to me because I was like
a potential new member or whatever so I
talked a few of my friends afterwards
basically uh one of my friends said that
a girl that I had never talked to you I
don't even know saw those things about
me and talked about them or I said no we
don't want this girl like I've seen
these rumors I've heard these rumors and
yeah cut me so yeah I don't know if
that's the reason these houses cut me
I'm not gonna be like oh this is the
only reason they didn't want me like no
that's not how it is but I just wanted
to talk about it because I think a lot
of people will think when they're
posting online it's not really going to
get to the person and it's not really
going to affect them but there is a
potential that it did affect me anyways
that's basically my brush experience I
just want to end off this video once
again saying I am very very happy that I
joined everyone I've met so far has been
super welcoming and so sweet to me I'm
getting a big soon so I'm really really
excited about that
and yeah I mean obviously I'm still
friends with all my friends and other
how
and it's nice because I get to make
friends and also fee but I can also have
my friends and other houses so yeah it
all works out it was a tumultuous
stressful process for me but yeah you
know what happens happens and it's nice
to know that the girls in alpha fee
actually wanted me and whether or not
they didn't see these rumors about me
they wanted me and to get to know me as
myself instead of like going off of
rumors or or whatever yes so I
don't know if this video would be
helpful to any of you guys but it was so
requested and this is what happened to
me if you guys have any crazy sorority
rush experiences please put them down in
the comments below because a girl I know
it can suck anyways I love you guys so
so much thank you for sticking with me
and stay tuned for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
