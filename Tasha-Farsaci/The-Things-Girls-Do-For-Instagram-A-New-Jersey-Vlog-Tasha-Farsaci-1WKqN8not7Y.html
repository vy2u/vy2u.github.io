exciting vlog or at least I think it's
exciting you know maybe you guys don't
think it is but basically me my best
friend Mel and my parents are going to
Wildwood New Jersey for four days and
we've never been there before but last
summer we went on this random kind of
spontaneous trip to New Jersey and I've
logged it so we kind of want to do the
same thing this summer is so if you
haven't seen my vlog from last year you
guys have to watch it it's my favorite
vlog I've ever done because there's one
clip at the end that is so funny in my
opinion I love it
so I'm gonna link that vlog down below
you guys should totally go watch it and
I do need to address with one thing in
that vlog before you watch it if you
haven't seen it so in one point in the
video I said something about like
stereotypical New Jersey people and
everyone got really offended and I was
not saying that to be offensive like
when I think of stereotypical New Jersey
person obviously being from out of state
I think of the show Jersey Shore and I
know that not everyone is like that I
know most people are not like that but I
just saw people that looked like that
and I think I said like Oh stereotypical
Jersey people but trust me like someone
could say stereotypical New Yorker and
I'm not offended so I wasn't trying to
offend anyone if you were one of those
people that got offended or if you were
to watch that vlog now I don't want you
to like get offended next I did get a
new vlog camera I got that annoyingly
expensive one then everyone has the
canon g7x because i've been vlogging
more and there's been like times where i
want to kind of bring a camera along to
film something i don't want to bring my
big clunky one so yeah I got a new
camera I hope you guys appreciate it cuz
it was quite pricey ok and then just one
more thing before I get into the rest of
the vlog I hate showing emotions I'm
just really bad at it or I'm just like
awkward I don't really know how to
explain it I'm just gonna say this in
the beginning of this video because I
know these people will be watching it
most likely
so basically Mel is my best friend
and I knew that coming home from college
I would probably drift from my friends
from high school and I have you know I
really have drifted from them but that
was expected I went to school so far
away in LA but Mel and I have just
gotten closer and we really haven't
drifted at all so she's really special
to me she's a really great friend she
seems younger than me she's starting
college this coming fall at Syracuse
University so around who I live so she's
gonna be local and I don't think I've
mentioned to you guys yet but I just
signed a lease for a twelvemonth
apartment in LA so that means I'm not
coming home and next summer and what's
kind of weird about that is my parents
are probably going to be going to be
moving to Florida within the next year
so I'm never gonna live at home again
I'm ever gonna be back at this house
really in living here I might be back
for like Christmas break but that's it
like I'm never gonna live in my room
again I'm never gonna like live with my
parents again but I guess what I'm
trying to say is that this is like the
last time I'm gonna have like my parents
and my best friend all together kind of
at once I feel like for a while so this
trip is kind of bittersweet for me and
if these people are watching this video
I just want to say you guys mean so much
to me and I'm really excited for this
trip okay yeah I just wanted to kind of
throw that in here because I'm like
awkward saying this stuff in person but
anyways this is actually the day before
we're going we're going tomorrow morning
but I probably wouldn't have time to
vlog early tomorrow morning so yeah I'm
just doing it now but next time you see
me we'll probably be in the car
yeah
so we're in the car just playing some
doodle dump and then we have like what
five hours love basically now McDonald's
today
we show updates
we made it what do you have to say New
Jersey to take too seriously it's like
fairly cute in here so it's literally so
packed it gives me anxiety just looking
there's so many people did not expect
this oh it's honestly like a zoo this is
like so many people I don't know why I
thought it would be not this funny but
maybe it's just because it's a Sunday
right now hopefully like tomorrow if we
try to come it won't be this busy but I
don't know guys we'll have to see
I just wanted the pug or the wiener dog
just look at that little guy move into
the cat space bitch please okay so we're
trying to go to dinner now but it's like
a half hour wait so the berating dog to
dog to cafe or something it's quite
humid as you can see by this little
piece of my hair but yeah we're just
waiting like a half-hour my parents are
going to put money in the car meter and
yeah it's a pup in time so far yeah
steamy
oh there's kind of cute boys and I'm
vlogging so
good morning guys so it's the next day
now and we literally set an alarm for
7:00 a.m. so we could come to the beach
to take pictures and at like 7:15 it
starts Thunder storming and we wanted to
be early so that the beach wasn't packed
like it was yesterday and it's so humid
out my lens is like fogging up I'm like
worried that all these cars or people at
the beach I know I don't we're gonna see
you so yeah I'm wearing this really cool
one piece from chien I think or is Apple
or one of those and we're gonna get
bowls afterwards so we'll see oh this is
such a relief guys look at the
difference between today this early and
yesterday so hopefully my hair doesn't
raise wish me luck well as soon as we
got out here my hair decided to frizz so
I I made the executive decision to dump
my hair so these pictures might turn out
horrendous but you know it's it's
whatever okay so we made it to the acai
bowl place it's Aloha
smoothie Co so hopefully it's good I
mean it probably will not compare to
paradise bowls but we're excited so I
just got them I got the monkey bowl with
strawberries and smell got the same
thing
I'm literally
I said the quality is too good for me to
look this bad
yeah hi guys so we haven't blogged in a
really long time I think last time was
this morning when we tried to take
pictures and it didn't work and I dumped
my head it is so hot I honestly think
this is the hottest weather I've been in
in so long
like I can't be outside without actually
like perspiring like where it's dripping
off your body I know my mouth fell
asleep on the beach and I was just
watching like the beads of sweat form
out of her
yeah so we went to the beach for a
little bit it was so hot we couldn't
stay for that long but now we're going
to Wawa to get well I want to try their
coffee cuz I can never have for some
reason that's like they have good coffee
and manners like this shirtless man is
walking I like old man anyways I want to
try their coffee really badly and I'll
wants to get stuff to make guac
cuz she brought avocados with her I
always do a piece I need to stop so we
got them clearly what do you think mal I
think it's really good the only issue is
if they don't make it for you and
there's no lids yep there was no lids
for the smallest size I know I sound
like such a brat right now I mean I
would give it an 8 out of 10 just
because they didn't make it for you but
I guess it wasn't too difficult so yeah
I know I was just a grocery store and
people who have it probably think I'm
crazy and really weird
but I was still pretty excited so we've
got the Flamingo all laid out it's
probably you're not gonna get out the
door I don't know maybe we just know
maybe we won't Bluff the head yeah we'll
just blow up the head out there but
Mel's been pumping this for like a solid
three minutes and nothing is happening
we found out that no air was coming out
of the pump update almost done oh yay
guys catching crab take two if you
remember this from last year's blog
comment down below oh it's so tiny we
didn't think we were gonna catch any
because it's so shallow I don't know if
you can see that rest in peace another
crab that wasn't us we wouldn't do that
do you want any messages for my vlog dad
grab on guys look at I caught a tiny one
like me but I'm too scared to hold it
look at it it's such a nugget I don't
know I don't know I think he would get
me do it no don't put him down okay guys
he's going in Vitoria I don't want the
birds to eat him oh well we're getting a
really nice healthy dinner at around
9:30 just some fried pickles got the
fried Oreos last night so I'm pretty
excited what I eat in a day I think
we're gonna end off the vlog here so
