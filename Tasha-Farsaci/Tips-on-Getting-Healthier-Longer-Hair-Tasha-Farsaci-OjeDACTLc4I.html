that's like probably a lot of people
wanted to see when I get questions or
compliments on my videos and stuff it's
normal like I love your hair or your
hair is so pretty or how do you get your
hair so long and healthy and stuff and
basically I have a bunch of tips that
are kind of like apply to how my hair
gets like this I did a video kind of
like this a while back but okay that
video is really embarrassing all my old
videos are really embarrassing and I
just keep it up because it gets a lot of
views it's not like horrible but I feel
like this one's gonna be a lot better so
I'm not gonna say after you do this like
after a week of doing this stuff your
hair's gonna be perfect but I'm just
saying that after like a while it might
take up to like a year if your hair is
really damaged you know this is going to
help your hair be a little more healthy
look a little better and you know grow a
little faster basically my hair it goes
down to like here it's pretty long and
my hair grows pretty fast
um my bangs I like to have bangs anymore
but they're like down to here and I got
them cut up to here like five months ago
so my hair is growing this much in like
five months which is a lot um I think
it's because I do all this stuff and you
know I take care of my hair so I just
want to let you know that this might
take a little time to work it's not
going to be like a media or anything
but after a while this will help you
hair so stay tuned
this tip is to cut down on heat like
this is probably the biggest thing ever
if you're one of those people that uses
heat on your hair everyday or
straightens their hair every day your
hair is not going to be healthy I don't
care how much like how much he
protecting you use or you know how much
you get your hair caught you guys not
gonna be healthy if you use heat
everyday now my hair is straightened my
hair is kind of like wavy and curly kind
of combined and I do straighten my hair
but when I straighten my hair I do a few
things that's like you know help it to
be not so damaging I let my hair air dry
like a lot of people they blow dry their
hair you want to let your hair air-dry
because even though it might give it a
little fuzzier blow-drying your hair is
so damaging like it's like straightening
it twice you know when you blow drying
it and you can just skip that step and
your hair will still dry so that's what
I do I don't blow dry my hair I just
skip that whole stop I wrote my stuff
down in like a little book so that's why
I'm looking down okay so pretty much I
only straighten my hair once a week my
hair lasts for a few days without
getting greasy which is gonna be like
the next tip but basically I only
straighten my hair once a week or I only
use heat on my hair once a week so that
might last for a few days but after like
I only shave my head once like seven
days if I do it twice the next week I
don't use heat at all so that's
something that's gonna be tough for a
lot of people like if you strain your
hair every day maybe go down to like
three or four days and kind of work your
way down over this summer it's a lot
easier last summer I did like a no heat
summer that like helped my hair a lot
but this summer I'm too lazy but yeah
basically you know to cut down your Heat
different to like smaller portions a
week because that's really gonna help
you and you know help you in the long
run so
the second tip is if you dye your hair
do it less frequently especially if you
dye your hair light lighter because that
dye really doing just your hair
I have never dyed my hair this is my
natural hair color it's kind of like a
Dogu blonde but it gets lighter in the
summer so just you know rock you natural
hair or like dye it less frequently
because if you go back like I know
you're gonna get roots but that's kind
of in right now like the ombre hair
effect so I don't know just like try to
dye your hair less frequently or if you
get like blond highlights try to get
like maybe a little less or a little
darker or something just kind of maybe
like help your hair and kind of not dye
it as much because that's really damaged
three is to don't wash your hair
everyday my hair since it's thick this
is not all my hair I have more hair in
the back my hair is pretty thick and it
might not look it but it is so thick
hair takes less time to get like greasy
and oily but I know Mike one of my
friends her hair gets greasy like
overnight what you're really stinks but
basically don't wash your hair every day
that's really drying and it does damage
your hair I don't have to wash my hair
for like four days which is pretty crazy
and I'm lucky but if you are one of
those people that your hair gets greasy
like overnight try a dry shampoo I know
that there are some of the drugstore I
know those at resume one I don't know
how well it works but if that one
doesn't work for you I'm sure there's
tons of other brands I've never used one
but I know lots of other gurus have so
if you search like dry shampoo review or
something up there then you'll probably
get like some good results and you can
definitely try that out so then your
hair won't get as like washed and dried
out and you can keep your heat style
longer which is something I like to do
my hair can stay straight until I wash
it so my hair can stay straight for like
three or four days whereas other
people's only lasts for one so that's a
really good tip just try not to wash it
every single day
the next tip is to give regular haircuts
I'm not saying every - I really like for
weeks like people recommend you get your
hair cut every four weeks but I'm not
gonna do that I like my hair long and I
know a lot of you want to grow your hair
out so if you get your haircut like
every four weeks it's just gonna stay
the same length it's gonna grow out but
then you're gonna cut it back so
basically at least twice a year I get my
hair cut twice a year which I know isn't
great but my hair is fine it's not very
damaged it does have like the ends are
kind of dry but I'm due for a haircut in
like a month if you take good care of
your hair you're not going to need as
much haircuts but basically you are
going to need to get a haircut like I
know some girls in my school that are
obsessed with having long long long hair
like way longer than mine but they don't
get their haircut like for a year and
it's kind of gross but um just try to
get your haircut if you here is severely
damaged like when there's no repair just
get a haircut that's like to start out
the whole thing you just need to cut
your hair but basically that's just
gonna get the dead ends off it's gonna
make your hair healthier and when you
have healthier hair it grows faster and
there you go
so yeah it's make sure you get your hair
cut at least two or more times a year
but you don't need to get it calling
every four weeks like they say cuz that
your hair's not gonna grow
okay and then my last tip is to use hair
products that kind of help strengthen
your hair I have a few right here and
this one is the Aussie 3 minute miracle
this stuff is really really good
this is a deep conditioner and what you
do is when you're in the shower you put
this in after you wash your hair and
stuff and you leave it in for three
minutes and then you wash it out and
this really like moist we moisturizes
your hair and it just like helps it be
like silky Europe
I used this before I straighten my hair
and my hair is like really soft and
stuff and it's really shiny and that
stuff really does help my hair I think
that this is a great product and it
smells like the best thing I've ever
smelled before it's like coconut
pineapple and it's amazing so this is
only three dollars - so I definitely
definitely recommend getting this even
if your hair isn't that damaged get this
because it really really helps okay then
I have a chi product which is more
expensive this is a hair mask so this
kind of just like masks your hair from
like damage I don't really know but um
basically you just put this in and woke
it in when Li for this one in for five
minutes and I've hear people using masks
before or after they go swimming because
chlorine really damages your hair so
this is really good to have like a mask
and this smells pretty good this is the
nourish intense if I didn't already say
that by cheek and just you know
basically like hair masks deep
conditioners are really good okay and
another product I don't really have one
right now but it's like a leave-in
conditioner so when you get out of the
shower put like this sometimes it's
spray sometimes it's like a gel just put
it into your hair will get into like
mostly your ends because those are where
they're really dry and then you just
leave it in there and it really helps to
moisturize and you know kind of seal
your dead ends and that's like a really
good product to have - with your hair is
like really unmanageable and dry and
stuff but yeah so and that was my tips
for healthy hair video I hope you guys
like this um
I hope that it helps you you know this
isn't gonna happen instantly but I
really hope that it does like help you
eventually so if you have any more
