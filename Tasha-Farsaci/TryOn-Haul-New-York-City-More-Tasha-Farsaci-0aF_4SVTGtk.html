different area in my room I'm Akshay
filming on my bed so yeah you can see my
bed now but I wanted to switch it up
because I know my filming locations can
be boring sometimes
so I basically I'm doing a haul video
today and I'm apologizing because I know
I do a lot of haul videos but this one I
really wanted to get up and I promise I
have lots of hair videos play on before
or after this video and all that so I
know a lot of you guys do like haul
videos which is why I'm doing it but if
you don't I apologize and I promise that
new types of videos will be up soon so I
recently went to New York City which is
what a lot of this stuff is from but I
also got some orders and online and so I
decided I would show you those too okay
starting with the online things I have
seen things from the choice calm and
both of the websites that I have things
from online I'm kind of like Asian
wholesalers websites so you has a
copyright of them but these items are
from choice the first thing I got is
just a plain black and white striped
long-sleeve shirt and I love stripes I
love wearing them with like green jacket
and some ripped jeans and stuff so I
really wanted it sure because I don't
have a black and white striped shirt and
it's super soft it feels like brandy
melville material yeah it's nice and
long and flowy so you can wear this with
a lot and I think this would look really
cute with a blazer as well so I really
like this one also from choies I got a
kimono and it looks like this it's
really pretty I love the colors it's
more fall I would say it's just white
and it has some like navy and pink and
like rose there's even some butterflies
on it which I just think was a really
cute touch also from choies I got the
sweater I'm wearing and it's honestly
one of my favorites but
it's perfect it's beautiful and I love
it as you can see it's just kind of like
Dolman sleeves and it doesn't go all the
way down but it's copped has some cable
knit and it's really cute it's really
warm and I really love it
five sequin choice I got a tank top and
I'm not really a huge fan of it just
because I thought it would be lined and
it's not so it's just your kind of
classic crocheted lace tank top and then
the bottom has some like different
crocheted and it's really cute it's just
I don't find myself wearing open
crocheted things like this often because
I can't wear many things underneath them
to school and I know I could really get
a new bikini or something but I don't
like camis and I don't know I mean this
is okay but it's more of a summer like
each cover-up I would say so
I don't know it's cute I just don't
think I'll be wearing nice too often I
also have a few items in she inside
quickly and is a big sweater and I love
big sweaters I wear them all the time
I've already worn this one like twice
and I've only had it for like a week so
it's this really big kind of gray and
white salt and pepper Moe sweater and
it's just cable knit and what I love
about it is it has like little pockets
at the bottom the sweater is super thick
and it's really nice quality and I know
I'm gonna be wearing this probably every
single day in the pond winter all right
next thing machine side is this really
cute but very wrinkly I haven't heard it
yet kind of a t-shirt I don't know it
just has a beaded neckline it dips down
kind of low there so I don't you find
something to wear underneath that but
it's just beaded and white and on the
ends of the sleeves are also beat it and
it just kind of goes down
lastly I got mushy inside is it a trench
coat and it's gonna be hard to show this
so you'll see me with it on or whatever
but
it's just your kind of khaki
double-breasted trenchcoat yeah yeah it
has like a little belt and the like ends
of the arms are also kind of felt it or
whatever but this is a really good
quality and this is really cute I feel
like stylish New Yorker when I'm wearing
this so yeah it's pretty long but I
really like it yeah it's probably
something that I would wear if I was
gonna be outside for an extended period
of time because it's kind of difficult
to get on and off a big the belt and
everything but it's really cute and with
some riding boots this would be great so
moving on to the things that I got in
New York I really didn't get as many as
I normally would but I just wasn't
really liking the tons of stuff so I
don't know for moving Outfitters I got
one thing and it's just this maroon and
navy striped really flowy shirt I
haven't tried this on your head
so do I like it but it's just looking
really nice I love flowy things and as
you can see the sleeves are kind of like
connected into it that makes no sense
but that wormholes
I don't know so this is gonna look
really flowy on and I love Navy and
maroon together so this would be nice
and this was on sale so I had to do it
going along with the maroon stripe trend
I went to brandy and Brittany is either
hit or miss for me I think I like it a
lot more in the summer in the spring
time because once you get to like the
fall and winter everything is just kind
of bland I don't know I almost wasn't
feeling it but I do love stripes like I
said and maroon is my favorite colors so
I saw this rune and white striped long
baggy t-shirt and it's super soft and so
I was like you know why not I went to
Nordstrom Rack and I really liked
some rock especially because I like
noise strum and I don't have one near me
at all like close this one it's probably
like five hours away so it's really
unfortunate and Nordstrom Rack is even
better because it's discounted so the
first thing I got from there is a like a
headband but it's one of those nature
yes nature winter would knit headbands
and I I have a odd obsession with these
I don't know but this is my favorite one
definitely because it's tight and I
really small head like my head is not
normal size hum so I'm glad this is
tight and I got a lot of hockey games in
the winter and that's a necessity and
just living in New York you kind of need
one of these but Nordstrom Rack also has
makeup and stuff so I saw this Stila hit
and it has let's see five eyeshadows a
McLaws an eyeliner and like their lip
and cheek like duo thing and it was only
$30 so I kind of have to get it but as
you can see it has all the stuff in it
and the colors are really natural in the
palette I'll show you see the colors are
totally colors that I would wear I know
I do have a lot a good amount of makeup
but that was such a good deal and I
really love stealing and it's amazing
quality so you know I get it
lastly from most Morocco also something
that I'm wearing
so their army green pants and I'm
obsessed with them and they were a
splurge and I I'm not guilty I have no
shame they're beautiful
they have zippers there by Paige Dunham
which is an expensive we're going to
begin with these where we're doing only
like $250 and I got them for like me but
I've already worn them twice and they're
amazing
I wonder if over 21 and just got some
mom heather gray workout crop pants
because I've been seeing people in my
school with like great crops linking
things and I always put my black ones
and I thought they looked really cute
with the gray ones also from forever 21
I got some wiener dog hot dog socks
because I love wiener dogs I know my
guys might not know this you might know
this but I'm obsessed like I love them I
need one in my life and they all swim
obsessed with pugs so if any of you guys
have a wiener dog or a pug and you
follow me on Twitter or Instagram tweet
me a picture of your dog or Cosette and
tag me because I will probably like
explode with happiness because I am
obsessed with wiener dogs and pugs but
when I saw these socks and there will be
like a dollar fifty I had to do it so
yeah I also really like pigs they've
been one of my favorite animals since I
always like three so I saw this pink
loofah and
it's like you know you need to need to
come with me and living my shower
last but certainly not least I went to
Buffalo Exchange and it's basically like
a Plato's Closet type of thing it's like
buy or sell your stuff there and like
buy other people's stuff but they also
have new items there so it's kind of a
combo I got myself an Urban Outfitters
shirt and it's all the tags on it when I
got it so that was a loss but it's just
this pupal kind of baby doll sure it has
some lace on the top in the back and it
was only $10 so I didn't really know if
I wanted it but it was only $10 so I did
it see what's brand new home and it's
just like a sweater material almost but
it's really cute and I like it a lot
I also got my boyfriend s shirt at
Buffalo exchange it was one of the new
items something out there just because I
saw it and I was like wow that's the
perfect shirt for a guy and I don't know
if he's gonna like it or wear it but I'm
gonna make him wear it because it's
beautiful so yeah it looks like this
it's gray and moving stripes oh what a
surprise has some glue on it and then
some darker gray my hair is on it yeah
but it's from the brand am big I've
never heard of it but this shirt with
beautiful and it has a little pocket so
that is everything that I have for you
in this whole video and I'm really sorry
that I keep doing holes over time like I
I am gonna be selling more of my clothes
on my eBay account if you missed out on
the first time that I did or if you're
looking forward to new things I'm gonna
be selling a lot of things soon so I'm
probably gonna post a video about that
coming up so keep your eye out for that
like I said hair videos are coming off
and if you have any other video ideas

the ideas Department so that she would
everything I have going on right now

continue to watch my videos and just
post positive comments and like all that
stuff because you guys the reason that I
