start off the vlog showing you my very
uneventful breakfast because there was
literally no food in my apartment
besides literally just like sandwich
bread toast I have one with butter
almond peanut butter and I really need
to go grocery shopping later I'm just
trying to figure out time to do it I
have class in a little bit and then I
think I'm gonna come back and get lunch
with my friend Lauren so I will update
you then okay so I just packed up a few
of your values it's Poshmark
orders you can see them over there I
just got back from class and now I think
I'm going on campus USC campus to get
lunch like I said with my friend Warren
and I'm gonna send out those boxes and
stuff so yeah my hair is like kind of
still wet I showered before class my
apartment complex has this really
convenient shuttle service because my
apartment is like a half mile from
campus so it's kind of far just to walk
to class like every day so they have a
shuttle service which is like really
convenient so I'm just gonna like hop on
that shuttle hopefully I don't miss it
so yeah like I said once I get to campus
I will update you before I forget here's
a little out for the day I'm wearing
this like burnt orange lace-up sweater
from is Apple it's really cute it has
like flared sleeves and then I'm just
wearing my dark wash ripped jeans from
Topshop and then some of my favorite
little taupe booties from a Steve Madden
and then I just have my Tory Burch bag
so yeah okay I got this beautiful panini
but do you ever come to USC go to seeds
you get the number 2 panini it's so good
and I got it with Lauren introduce
yourself
Lauren has slid into my DMS on Facebook
because I needed I needed springing my
friends I posted on this friggin it page
and she this girl's probably getting
eventually really weird messages so I'll
just say hi yeah so that's where it
started down the DMS okay so I just got
back from lunch and I have like two
packages here so I guess I'm gonna open
them and show you what they are pretty
sure I know both of them are okay this
one is sweet hash mark I wanted this
shirt and some of you guys might be like
Tasha what the heck I don't know why
basically I'm pretty sure this is a
Budweiser shirt I don't know one of my
friend has one and she's wearing it's
like my notes hello like American jeans
like perhaps we didn't stop I don't know
I just think it's fun they sold us at
Rubin Outfitters and I saw it on
Poshmark and I just thought it'd be
really cute so it looks like this yeah
this is really cute and I think that
says this is a men's small so I could
wear it you do probably not as a t-shirt
dress maybe I don't know I think this
would be cute like tied up in a knot and
then with like some shorts or like an
overall dress or something okay and in
this next box I actually remember I
received an email from someone and they
were like marketing so Ella's beauty
line or she has a line of something and
they were like hey you want some bath
bombs and I'm guessing that's what this
is because the bottom says zoella you're
not gonna be able to see that but yeah
the bottom says zoella on it so we will
see okay so I just opened it and three
Bassem there's like exciting because
I've never tried bath bombs before I've
always wanted to and I have a bathtub
here at school so that's pretty cool hey
guys a little bit later now I've been
studying because I missed a lab exam
over Thanksgiving break because I had a
flight and I missed the exam so I have
to make it up today and I didn't really
study until today that's such a good
classic me move like I'm actually doing
classes at USC I'm gonna struggle
because I'm such a last-minute studier
but anyways yeah I'm doing that and I'm
hoping I can leave my class a little bit
early because I'm only get out at 9:00
but there's a date - tonight for a frat
that I have
friend them if you guys don't know what
a date dashes basically what it's
supposed to be is the day before guys
find out that they have a date - and I
asked a date and then they you go to a
venue but basically how it works here is
guys just ask a bunch of girls that they
want to come to come so it's not like
one guy with one girl type of thing and
you get on like a bus and you go to a
venue and no one knows what the venue is
until you get there it's normally like a
bar or a club or like a restaurant that
has a bar or something like that
so they're always like really fun and
they're always themed and today the
theme is Christmas and I have this
amazing Christmas sweater that I've been
dying to wear and some you guys are
probably gonna hate it
some of you will probably love it so
I'll show you guys later when I'm
wearing it but anyway is the date - kind
of party pregame thing starts at 9:00
and I get a class at 9:00 and I want to
be able to like get ready and stuff so
I'm gonna try and leave class early mom
if you're watching this I'm sorry I
apologize yeah but I'm gonna try and
leave class early so I can get ready and
I think my friend Lauren that I showed
you guys earlier is gonna come to
because like I don't want to go alone
because it's not really like the guy is
just asking one girl you know yes I
think I might like straighten my hair
really quick so I don't have to do that
when I get out of class because it's
like a mess right now I literally just
showered and sprayed some like women
conditioner in it and this is what
happened so if you're curious what my
actual natural hair is it's this okay so
I'm about to leave for class I'm not
feeling too great about this lab exam
but I'm like a really high grade right
now so if I don't do the best hopefully
it's okay um yeah so I'm gonna leave I
straighten my hair as you can tell and
then literally I'm gonna come back get
ready to show you guys my outfit
and go so yeah you will see me then okay
guys so I left class a tiny bit early so
I could come get ready this is my outfit
I have this like Christmas headband I
got from forever 21 and this is the
sweater okay it says Santa's favorite ho
and I know some people are gonna be like
oh my god like that's so like
inappropriate or you shouldn't be
calling yourself a ho like I just
thought it was funny like I'm not
calling myself a ho I just thought it
was literally hilarious and I got it in
a size large so I'd be like a t-shirt
dress and then I'm wearing just some
white over-the-knee like sheer socks
with my disgust
in Converse these are literally like
hard like I just put them in the wash
and put them on right now and they're
like hard crusty like really gross but
yeah I don't know if I'm gonna end up
filming at the actual date - if not
thank you guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
