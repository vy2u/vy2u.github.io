so it's really early it's like 7 a.m. I
haven't woken up as early and so long
but basically I have my USC
orientation today for spring admits but
I think it's only for spring admits that
aren't freshmen because I have a friend
with this pretty minute freshman and
who's this tomorrow so yeah I don't
really know what this entails I know I
have to go because I have to schedule my
classes but I really like don't want him
to be there for the entire thing because
it doesn't end until 5 p.m. and I have
like studying and stuff to do so I'm
gonna see like what I can get out of but
yeah so I have to be to campus in like a
half hour and I have to catch the
shuttle in like 15 minutes so yeah I
don't know if I'm gonna like film on
campus or anything we will see I'm gonna
bring my camera at least but yeah I'm
like really nervous to schedule my
classes because I know there's not going
to be a lot of things left because it's
like so late I'm springing like
literally get like the last classes so
I'm like really nervous I'm probably
gonna have 8 am's like every single day
um but yeah we will see I will talk to
you guys later
oh by the way my piercing hurts so bad I
didn't like sleep on it obviously um but
it's so bad I just like cleaned it or
whatever my room is super messy but in
case you're wondering what I'm wearing
I'm wearing this like kind of sweater
turtleneck dress from Windsor this vest
it's like faux fur and then like faux
leather from blank NYC and then I'm
wearing these tall leather boots I want
to see they're from Enzo and galini I'm
not completely sure I got them from
Nordstrom Rack so yeah this is my outfit
I wanted to look kind of cute but it's
kind of cold out as well so yeah this is
going to be my breakfast which I'm fine
with these are pretty good I'm probably
gonna try and get a coffee once I get on
campus I really have no idea what to do
most people are going to have guests but
I'm just alone like without my parents
so yeah I'm not really sure I'm gonna
wing this we'll see how it goes
nice campus is so dead because I'm
pretty sure it's literally called dead
week right now which is like the period
of time before finals where they just
designate students for studying and like
you don't have classes or anything
that's the library it was just really
loud to chuck was going by but yeah the
Starbucks is over here so I'm going to
try and go to bed oh my god all these
poor souls at the library unless they
just left our bikes
I spent my my final destination I don't
even know if you can see it I'm like I'm
doing a slow zoom there you go I got a
vanilla soy latte so here we go
so I just picked up my little like info
packet thing apparently I'm supposed to
read that
I got a nice job drawstring bag great
with a water bottle so I'm just like
sitting here I have a while now like 45
minutes until anything happened so I
guess I'm just going to sit here and
enjoy my coffee it's super quiet because
like I said there's like no students
around plus it's so early it's like 7:30
high so I just got back from orientation
sorry if my nose is rad I swear I'm not
drunk like my nose always gets red it's
so strange let me know if I happens to
you this happened to me in my blog from
yesterday as well but anyways I'm really
happy because I actually got really
great classes and like a great schedule
and I did not expect that to happen
because I am a spring in May and I
figured they wouldn't have a lot of
spots left in classes but I don't have
Friday classes and I only have one class
on Thursday and I do not know how that
happened so I guess I'll show you the
classes I'm taking if you guys go USC
maybe we'll be in the same class okay so
these are the classes that I'm taking
introduction to cinema goes for a GE and
then I'm taking to comm classes that you
can see in like the middle and the
fourth one and then my philosophy which
goes for humanities is current moral and
social issues and I don't know I just
thought these all sounded pretty cool
and I really like obviously
communication is my intended major if
you guys don't know what happened to me
I'll link my entire video about my
transfer process and stuff down below
but basically I applied to the
communication school and I got in as
undeclared not into the school I applied
to so I'm just taking a bunch of comm
class
so it'll look better when I try to
transfer in but yeah I'm really happy
with how this turned out
so right now I'm just going to edit my
vlog from yesterday and try and post
that and I have so much work to do
I still to study I literally have an
exam tomorrow so I need to get on that
so our apartment partnered with
Victoria's Secret pink and is giving out
gift bags to the first 100 people okay
who needs studying yeah we being below
100 but if not I'll probably cry but
I'll show you what's in the gift bag
hopefully it's not or a Lorenzo
t-shirt because you'll cry got candy
after like 20 million
getting punched hold on me without
people that's loaded on me things sorry
at all but this is literally so extra
right now
and we can't get our gift bags until the
end we pass it here
and wait but you know i guess i can'twe
complain cause i got my candy so we wait
for like 50 minutes and then we have to
sittin there and watch the whole fashion
show even though we were supposed to do
homework because he's already making
sure to expose felix at UFC pink line hi
Chester Oh what do we get
what do we get Pacey one time you
Safety's and lotion and some girls we're
getting cute brats and tank tops yeah oh
yeah I know this girl just drills retire
drink all over my butt and my own foods
and it doesn't even say sorry she just
like so yeah just our salty
goodbye oh wait ladies and gentlemen
don't forget the pen we got a hand and
this sticker he's so excited yeah like
okay if they were multiple youth pasties
