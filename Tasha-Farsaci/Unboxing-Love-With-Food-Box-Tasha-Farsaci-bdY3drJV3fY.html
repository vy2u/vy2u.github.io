type of video muli I do kind of beauty
fashion hair videos on this channel but
today I have a food video so recently a
company contacted me that does the kind
of subscription monthly boxes and I've
never done one of these before but I
have a love for food and this box is
literally called love with food so when
they asked me if I want to try out one
of their boxes and like unbox it for you
guys I was like yes so I'm going to put
all the information with down bar but
basically it's ten dollars a month for a
box in for every box that you buy the
company gives food to a hungry person or
a person in need I know I love watching
unboxing videos for these types of
things so i decided i do one for you and
I have the box right here I better not
show you my address home so it looks
like this and I'm just going to take the
plastic off of it and dig right into
this because I'm hungry right now it
says snacks won't do good so I'm pretty
positive that these are like healthy
snacks which is great you know if you're
trying to get in shape or not eat as
nastily so I'm just going to open it up
and okay so inside so far it looks like
this what option hopes I'm not swear I'm
sorry guys so as you can see here it
says one box one meal and you can kind
of just read the info here like with
most subscription boxes I've seen
there's a little like pamphlet thing and
it's healthy what's in it but I'm not
going to read it yet because I want to
be surprised alright so first thing I
see here is a miracle tree moringa
organic strawberry tea
so I'm not a huge key person I think it
tastes kind of like water to me okay my
eyes are randomly watering I promise I'm
not crying like my eyes water Brando me
all the time so disregard that anyway so
i'm not a huge key person but i'm
definitely try us out because i like to
tell varies a lot and I want to like tea
I'm just not in your training next thing
I see in here are the annie's homegrown
bunny chocolate grams and I love teddy
grahams the chocolate teddy grahams so I
think I'm gonna like these a lot and I
know they carry this Annie's brand and
wegmans where I used to work I actually
recently quit my job I was a cashier at
wegmans minister grocery store and i
work at ever call me a bitch now random
but yes anyways I saw the sprint a lot
it's a very organic and everything so
these are going to be good for my lunch
there are three of these little tootsie
roll looking things okay it says they're
true joy choco choose I'm really hungry
so i think i'm going to eat one right
now if you alive um reaction so i'm just
going to open it up
I thought my chocolate all over my teeth
can help up that was really good it kind
of tasted like a brownie in like a
cookie will form if you've ever had a
chocolate tootsie roll kind of like that
all right this next thing says to moms
in the raw almond butter cocoa truffle
that's very exciting you know I'm
overjoyed are now this is this is great
I love chocolate all right the good beam
roasted chickpeas with sea salt so I
like chickpeas in soup and stuff I think
I've only ever had them in like stupid
vegetable soup so this is gonna be very
interesting um yeah it's a pretty small
pouch so if i don't like them I don't
have a ton all right next thing hemp
hearts raw shelled hemp seeds sprinkle
on salad cereal and yogurt all right I'm
kind of confused because when i think of
hemp I think of that like stuff you make
bracelets out of that looks really like
rope like so I'm kind of confused I
guess it's gonna taste like rope
raw shelled hemp seed I don't know maybe
this will taste like sunflower seeds all
right next is the good boy organics
baked organic potato snack box with sea
salt so it looks like just a little kind
of potato chip thing I like potato chips
a lot so I mean I'll probably like these
um yeah they're cute the packaging is
like you want all this stuff so offs all
right let's see Oh guys is really
exciting okay the buy one give one food
company two degrees chocolate banana
mini snack bar okay I love chocolate and
banana like frozen bananas covered in
chocolate I was so good so maybe that's
what this will taste like it's really
small but it looks really cute and I'm
excited about this one all right next
thing 180 degrees it looks like none of
rice bites so they look like kind of
like granola chunks let's see my size
clusters bursting with flavor simple
healthy ingredients to keep your day
going
these ones have cranberries so I don't
know I mean this sounds cool we'll see
ok so again it's the box there's a few
things in the bottom so let's see what
this is it's like a little card and it
has the curb is what is this salt free
herbes de Provence blend
what
I don't know and then it has like a
recipe on it hmm oh this school is a
little gift card for ten dollars to
urban remedy calm
I don't really know what that is but
it's ten dollars so I'm going to have to
check the hell and then there is all
these little cards so let's see there's
just I think that basically like the
promotional cards for a lot of these
brands so you've got the two degrees one
and then the t1 the hemp hemp foods one
then oh you've got a coupon save a
dollar on the two moms like truffle
thingies oh wow I dollar off
any normal limb product oh it looks like
this and then a dollar another dollar on
the two moms stuff so personally I think
that's a really good deal for ten
dollars especially because it's all
healthy so you're spending ten dollars
to potentially like save yourself from
getting morbidly obese just kidding I
mean that's cool because i always want
to try and eat healthy but then i
remember i like chocolate and Taco Bell
so hopefully this box will help me out
and I think it's really cool if there's
actually a food box because there's so
many beauty boxes and all that stuff you
know when it comes down to my heart it's
really food first like I said before if
you guys are going to sit in this box
and checking all the products that are
in the box definitely look in the
downbar because it's super cool by the
way my necklace is from happiness
boutique I know you guys are probably
going to ask I'll put that down in the
down bar as well I thought this video
would be fun i know it's different from
my channel but i hope you guys enjoyed
it and got excited about food because
let's be real here food is always
exciting love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
