you're new my name is Tasha welcome so
if you might know me you know I do a ton
of try on clothing haul some of you
think it's too much I know I'm sorry or
a problem but I know a lot of you guys
love them but you normally do affordable
try animals but not as affordable as
this one this one is literally
everything is under $15 so this website
called ferry season comm reached out to
me and they asked me if I wanted to do a
haul video that at FaceTime unique items
and at first I was like let us not
really know if I want to website what
was the best a lot of the pictures were
kind of blurry and they weren't you
going to see but I look at the prices
and they were so incredibly affordable
now I decided I would do this video
because if these items were great and we
want you guys to be able to see them
because they're really really
inexpensive so I'm sitting like half of
these items are hit in half or a myth
and I'm going to show you them now I got
a mix of clothing as well as bathing
suits because you know I'm obsessed
bathing suits I also did the video
because I could show you guys the items
to buy from its website and the items
not too much okay so I'm going to start
off with my favorites in the hips from
this haul so the first item is this red
romper and I have this exact same romper
from Princess Polycom which is a lot
more expensive than this one this one
isn't really as thick and as lined but
it's literally the same pattern is just
red I have it in white so it's this red
little romper and it has these little
aqua shoulder sleeve and then it goes
down into shorts I'm obsessed with red
right now and I love rompers for the
summer and spring like who doesn't and
this one is so cute the quality is
pretty nice it's just not you know not
super line but it's not a poo so I
totally recommend this and I love it
my next favorite is another dress it's
the same material of that dress which I
really like it just feels a lot more
expensive than it is basically it says
maxi dress it's another floral it's like
a navy and orange floral so Orange Sarah
cute if you go there I have these little
office shoulder kind of I don't even
think you can call these please I only
know what they are but they're cute and
then it goes down into a maxi and then I
think I have slit in the front
oh yeah okay very slip in the front and
nice it fits me perfectly but I'm five
foot one so if you're really tall expect
this to be more of a mini length dress
on you anyways I'm obsessed with this
and I know they had it in a few colors
so I totally recommend this the quality
is amazing by the way I got everything
in a size small
except for this so I got this in a large
because I wanted to be more oversized
and I think it fits perfectly it's a
yellow t-shirt and it says blondie on it
as you can tell I am blonde I just
thought this would be cute for like a
little beach cover-up top and apology's
really nice I think it's really adorable
so yeah ok so the next two things from
the site are Tommy Hilfiger Duke these
are really popular
I've seen these like all over Instagram
and these are really really inexpensive
Duke so if you're into that totally
check them out first is this little
Tommy bando I've seen this everywhere
and this is like seven dollars eight
dollars on the website I'll put on the
screen it's so cheap and apology this is
really good this would be so cute for
the fourth of July
I got another Tommy Hilfiger goop it's
just this a little black crop top and
then I just has the Tommy logo on it
really cute once again great for summer
and this was so inexpensive okay next I
have two piece set I love two-piece sets
because they look like you put so much
effort into your outfit and you really
didn't at all I love them so basically
it is this striped one I'm loving starts
right now it looks like this pretty much
you tie the front of the bow I love hot
like this it's really cute and then it
came would be little striped shorts also
really cute just a great outfit together
this would look great with some white
sneakers okay now moving to the clothing
that was kind of a Miss for me so the
first thing is this dress now don't get
me wrong wrong wrong I like this dress
it's just the material is super weird I
don't like the material but when you're
wearing it you can't really tell anyways
it looks like this I'll put a picture of
what these items looks like on the
website you can kind of see the
differences
so it's this orange dress with these
flowers on it the only thing is this
material is like
cops do me and like you can see it's
like a different color on the other side
I thought this would be more of a
cottony material but nevertheless it
looks so cute on it fits perfectly and
it looks really cute on you can't really
tell what the materials like so not a
complete mass budget not what I was
expecting
okay the next kind of miss in terms of
clothing is this olive green midi dress
okay so basically I was thinking this
would be like the mini dresses I got
from she in a while back in a haul video
kind of like a thick cotton and tight
whereas this one is more of like an
athletic material I don't know how to
explain it the materials are kind of
weird it still looks good on it's just
the material is kind of strange but I
don't hate this it's still cute just
like I said material is kind of all okay
and then the last clothing item is this
dress I really really hate the material
of this one in the picture it 100% looks
like it was vicious on materials and
that's all because they don't use the
same they don't need pictures of the
same items you know I mean but when I
got it it's this really really gross
material it's kind of like the orange
dress Ali words it's honest and just
like plasticy and this is like maybe it
doesn't look that bad on camera but it's
really really bad it's just it's like
dress off the shoulder but ya know the
material is so gross I love I camp okay
so now moving on to swimsuit I'm going
to start off with a hit they have a lot
of the same swimsuits that baffle calm
have except they're even keepers so if
you guys like the Apple suits or she and
suit through any of those Asian online
for soups you're going to get bad before
the cheapest price at ferry season so
the first one that I really like I
haven't tried this on yet so I'm hoping
that it fits okay looks like this this
has this really cool kind of I don't
know bohemian pattern I think it's
reversible because it looks like this on
the other side which is also cute I
really like this I'm hoping it looks
good on and then the bottoms are the
same I also think they're reversible
they have this cool pattern once again
and then
like I said they're lined with the other
pattern so I really like this one I have
some padding and and the padding feels
pretty good so this one is great and I
think this looks like $10 I'm not even
joking
okay the next swimsuit hit I actually
got this same suit from saffle in a
different color I got in white so on
here I got it in black once again it's
amazing this one I had the best quality
that I've seen from like dapple it was
really really nice material in stitching
and this one is the same but even
cheaper than berry season so it's just
this black bikini it has some really
cool embroidery on it and then the
bottoms are very very nice as well they
just look really expensive and this is
so cheap so yeah there you go
a really really great fine I think this
looks so expensive and it looks like
super chic
okay the next swimsuit hit is this red
and white striped one
this would be really cute for the fourth
as well it looks like this at first I
wasn't too crazy about this so it's not
perfect as you can see some of the lines
don't really match up like like here
they don't they don't match up perfectly
and then the same with the bottom
they're not like the best quality some
of the stitching is loose and whatnot so
I'm not obsessed with these but I do
select how it looks on not a very great
quality but still cute you probably only
get one or two or three ways out of this
it's nothing crazy but like I said since
the quality or no since the prices are
so low you can't really go wrong okay so
the last few suits are mixes for me this
one okay this is a myth because it's not
the same as a picture I actually got the
same suit from she in and then I think
I'm selling around Poshmark or something
so this one was different than the
picture and I really wanted the one the
picture and then this one came and don't
get me wrong it looks similar but it's
not what I wanted basically it is the
tropical kind of triangle print suit the
bottoms are very full coverage which I
don't like very much but I know a lot of
people do so yeah I'll probably find
this on my Poshmark bitch swimsuit
No okay this is really really not good
at all so it's just polkadot off the
shoulder top first of all this is huge
like this is not going to fit me and
it's a small it supposed to like lace up
the front yeah not so much
and the bottoms are so incredibly thin
if you already in the water
everyone will be seeing everything if
you know I mean and once again these
look pretty big for small and then
there's like a bunch of loose threads so
I really do not recommend this one in
all its really sane and cheap looking
and it doesn't really look as good as it
did in the pictures okay imma laughs did
they actually sent me two of it because
they didn't know which size I would want
so I'll show you it this is a kind of a
deep or blue like swim bathing suit so
this isn't bad the only thing is that
thick nice super super strangely it's
just like this navy blue one piece of
this crochet detailing not bad but like
I said the fit is so off on both of them
there are some loose threads it's hard
to say like oh this is so bad because
they are so expensive like we're like
SEC but I don't know I don't like these
because of the fit and you know the
quality is not completely finished yeah
sometimes everything that I got from
very seasoned comm I think overall you
can find some really great pieces on
this site but there are some pieces I do
not let the pictures and I'm not good
quality so if you are not order from
them I definitely recommend you know
looking at people's haul videos and
ordering the things that they ordered
because you really don't know what
you're going to get from these sites
anyways if you like this video please
give a thumbs up and leave a comment
down below telling me what your favorite
thing was in this haul I love you guys
so much and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
