quick video on why I haven't been making
videos and I also I'm gonna add in a
really embarrassing moment that just
happened to me and I'm I want to cry
because it's awful okay so first of all
I haven't been making many videos
because I am still doing testing I live
in New York State and we have to take
Regents exams if you don't know what
they are they're basically state tests
and they're like finals but they're for
the state and then they go on your
permanent record and your colleges see
them and since getting into a college a
good college is really important to me I
want to do well on them so I've been
studying and they last a lot of the day
so that is why I have made a video I'm
going a hat because my embarrassing
moment engulfs a hat so I have two more
and then I will be done so that's why I
haven't made any videos and I got a
haircut but my hair is really greasy and
nasty now which also explains the Hat
but yeah I felt like I need to tell you
guys that cuz normally I upload a video
every six days but I just can't do that
right now because I've been studying
most of the time so yeah that is that I
will have a video up soon but now I'm
gonna tell you guys the embarrassing
moment because it's comical it's just
awful so I have a freshman in high
school and I don't know about you guys
but in my school like if you're even a
year older go to someone you are so much
cooler than them so basically all people
here older than me I think they're like
10 times better than me you know even
though my birthday's in February so I'm
the same age as some of them that's just
how it works
so anyways I have a poking in my house
and me and my friend were just hanging
out there we like riding our bikes
around because once again I can't drive
yeah I'm 15 just kind of embarrassing
but whatever we were riding our bikes
around and I would bring this hat
because my hair is really greasy I
haven't had time to watch it
because I've been studying don't worry
I've watched my body we'll just we're
just not gonna get into that so anyways
we were just sitting in this little
pavilion thing they have um there was
this like super hot guy playing the
cross over by like this cage thing with
no shirt on okay so obviously we were
trying to figure out who it was because
hot guy with no shirt on okay so she had
to go home to eat dinner and love
I got to go by the way that guy was on
the path to get back to my house so I
was gonna try and figure out who it was
or whatever so anyways I wasn't wearing
this hat this don't yellow me for
wearing a Boston hat I don't really have
a conference this is just my friends but
anyways I wasn't wearing this hat I was
wearing a school hat and hats are kind
of big on me because I have a really
small head I just didn't want Ford
school hat in this okay anyways um so I
was riding and I was trying to figure
out who was we were making awkward eye
contact and the I knew they were
definitely older than me by then so that
was just awkward to begin with so as
soon as I ride by my hat flies off in
LeAnn's right in front of him and I'm
not talking like four feet in front of
him I'm talking like this far in front
of him like a foot and I don't know to
do I was like oh my god I don't know
what to do so I had like a really
awkward laugh like I was just like and
so I I dropped my bike and I turned it
out and he was just staring at me like
he didn't even pick off the Hat like it
was just sitting there in front him so I
had to awkwardly bend down and grab the
hat meanwhile my hair is naturally
messed up because it was an appointee
tale in half and I just awkwardly
grabbed the Hat looked up and he was
still just staring and I didn't even
know what to do I was like oh my god so
then it took me like a whole extra
minute to get back on my bike and
sometimes try to hold my hat because I
didn't want to put it on and have it
fall off again and so that took me like
an extra minute and it was awful I can't
even express to you how bad it was
because he definitely saw me and I
definitely saw him he was definitely
there a junior or a senior so that's
just awful I I don't even I don't even
want to think about it it might not
sound that bad to you but it was pretty
awful I mean at least he could have
picked up the hat you know what I mean
but no nope and my friend was long gone
by then there was no one else around us
he was alone I was alone it was awful
like I don't even know I don't get
embarrassed that easily but that was
awful and I don't even want to think
about it but I have to get it off my
chest so I decided I would tell you guys
so you guys can kind of feel for me and
all that stuff so that's what happened
to me legit like 20 minutes ago and I'm
still like pooping my pants about it I
just hope I don't see him again
and yeah so okay videos will be coming
soon let me go down below what's your
most embarrassing home it was
I've had many I don't think that's the
most embarrassing but honestly right now
it feels pretty awful um so comment
below your most embarrassing moment
I love reading comments and that'll be
pretty interesting and I won't feel as
bad about it so yeah comment that down
below or any video requests because I
almost done in school thank God so yeah

quality I just had to tell you guys that
story so yeah bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
