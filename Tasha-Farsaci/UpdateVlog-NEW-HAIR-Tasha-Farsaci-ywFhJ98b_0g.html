alive I'm here I'm still making videos
I'm so sorry I heard in my videos and
forever you guys probably know I went on
the cruise and then I missed a few days
of school so I had to make up a lot of
work I was just really busy I know I
have really crappy excuses but I am here
now I'm just gonna be doing an update
kind of vlog video I know I suck that's
kind of boring but here I am I can't
really talk that much because my mouth
is killing me I'm getting my braces off
April 2nd which is gonna be the best day
of my life
and basically yeah and they all my mouth
is wires now they didn't even use rubber
bands and it's killing me I have I
literally has like holes in my mouth and
like calluses and it's just like it
hurts so bad so if I talk kind of weird
I'm like doing this you know why anyways
I wonder who's and that was fun and I'm
back so I'll be trying to make more
videos okay first thing I want to talk
about is probably the obvious it's my
hair you guys may or may not know a
while back I dyed my hair brown and then
it faded super fast super fast like
really fast and I was really sad because
I liked it brown and today I had another
appointment and I got it really dark a
lot darker than last time and I loved it
so much it's gonna fade also because my
hairdresser refuses to use permanent dye
on my hair cuz you said it like damaged
it really badly or whatever so this will
probably fade too which I'm sad about I
love my hair like this I know there are
those people that are gonna be like no I
hate it I love you blonde hair but okay
let me just let me just be a little
bitchy right here I'm sorry I can't I
can't I can't
not all right nothing bothers me more
than the people that will comment on my
pictures on my videos and be like you
brown hair so ugly on you go back blonde
like okay I respect your honesty but you
didn't have to say it like that and I
don't think people understand that
especially when you don't go this dog
you can't like immediately go back
blonde like it just doesn't look like
that
and I don't go and do this myself I get
it done so it's not cheap I'm not gonna
drop like so much money like a day I
have to go back blonde and this is gonna
sound really mean but if you like blonde
hair so much Dyer of self diner own hair
blonde I don't know I like mine like
this I'm sorry if you don't like that
that's how it's gonna be I'm probably
gonna keep it this color for a while if
you can't stand that I don't know what
to tell you but watch my old videos yeah
so sorry if that was me but if you do
like it let me know because they don't
make me happy because I really like it I
mean I don't know but yeah that's pretty
much all I have to say about my hair
I got it cut a little bit not much and
then in the front I just kind of got
some shorter well things going on cuz I
was trying to just sick of like all one
length in the front so that is that I
guess I'll talk about the cruise now it
was really fun we left the 18th which
was the day after my birthday I turned a
16 by the way and we left out of New
York City so it was super cold the first
couple of days but anyways I went with
my friend Maddy my parents let me bring
her which is awesome because I'm an only
child and a lot of the times it can be
really boring if I'm just with my
parents so that was really cool and it
was kind of like a birthday present for
me because it was the day after my
birthday that we went so we had a lot of
fun we went to Cape Canaveral Florida
which is by Cocoa Beach then we went to
Nassau Bahamas where we went parasailing
that was awesome
and then we went to Freeport Bahamas
where we were supposed to go it's not
Blaine and then it got cancelled and I
was so sad because apparently it was too
windy or something so I kind of just
hung out on the boat that day but it was
really fun there was a ton of kids my
age on the boat because it was winter
break and a lot of you guys kind of got
confused when I was talking about winter
break I have a do summer break near
Christmas I also have one in February
and I never won a boat which is spring
break so if the clears things up but
yeah there was a lot of kids my age we
didn't exactly make friends until like
the last three days which
kind of sucky and awkward but you know
whatever it was a eight day cou seven
day cruise
yeah but it was like fun and if you ever
get the chance to go on a cruise bring
our friend if you can because it'll
probably be a lot more fun and yeah okay
next thing I wanted to talk about was my
birthday and nothing really happened I'm
her birthday very much
we found this icon out and got ready to
leave I turned 16 which means I can get
my permit to drive I don't know how it
is in other states but in New York you
get your permit when you're 16 and then
you have to wait six months after you to
permit to what take your driver's test
which yeah but whatever I still haven't
taking my permit test because I took her
practice wha my and I failed so I'm
gonna have to read the book or something
which really sucks cuz I it's like this
thick but anyways yeah I'm going to
learn how to drive soon which is kind of
exciting and you guys probably asked me
what I got for my birthday and I will
show you obviously I got on a cruise
with my friend which is awesome and this
was my birthday present I wanted this so
bad and they actually had it on the
cruise which was crazy I finally got a
Michael Kors watch don't mind my nasty
nails but I got this one
it's the rose gold I don't know the name
but it's just kind of planned and I
didn't want I didn't want one there was
like all bedazzled or anything that's
just not my style and I love this one
and I got it like 10% off because we
want the cruise I don't really know and
there was no tax or anything so yeah
take a gander at that you want it's like
hard to see because my lights but yeah
I'm so happy thank you so much mom and
dad and I love this underwear like every
day except not right now cuz I was just
chilling in my pajamas until this video
so now that I'm 16 I really want to try
and get a job coming out until the
summer but if you guys know any stories
like in the mall that hire 16 year olds
let me know because I have been offered
jobs at Abercrombie and Hollister and
stuff before but you have to be 17 to
them so I can't work there I heard
American Eagle Harris sixteen-year-olds
but I'm not really sure so if any of you
guys work there or when you know let me
know because I really do want a job um
but if you know any other stories
they're like in most malls that you
think would hire me
please tell me because I don't want to
be bored all summer yeah and I really do
want to get a job so yeah let me know
about that awesome let me know about
like movies
you liking because I've been into
watching movies lately but I have no
idea what to watch and then I always end
up just watching movies I've seen before
so if you guys want to tell me some like
really funny movies or anything let me
know I like a lot of movies um romantic
comedies are always good but I like
funny movies like The Hangover and I
can't even think if it was like that but
you know I'm basically open to a lot of
movies so yeah you can tell me some of
those recently I have been obsessed with
the show catfish on MTV if any of you
guys have seen it it's basically based
off a movie which was you know it's
about people who have like online
relationships with people on like
Facebook but they've never met her in
person and so this guy the guy that runs
this show like helps them meet and then
like 99% of the time they're not the
actual person they say they are and one
time this guy thought he was talking to
like this wicked hot girl and he goes
and it's actually a guy he was been
talking to the whole time which is like
I know it's kind of sad but it's really
funny and I don't know I just find the
show like really interesting and it was
actually based off a movie there was a
good documentary and it was like this
crazy story that happened to this guy so
definitely watch catfish and then the
show because I'm kind of obsessed you
guys watch that I don't know I just
think it's crazy that people people are
so gullible sometimes like come on I
could tell it was a fake facebook from
like a mile away but yeah okay I'm just
kind of
gambling right now I'm thinking of doing
a scarf collection because um I can't
even tell but there were some of my sky
was I kind of like a scarf quarter and I
might do a scarf collection I still need
to do like a styling pattern pants
leggings video I have a whole list of
videos on my phone but I just haven't
done them yet
I'm sorry I stopped you play if I'm
Taylor cuckoo
I really don't even know what I want to
talk about so I'm probably gonna go once
again let me know of like movies um
places to get jobs and if you watch
catfish down below I'm obsessed with
catfish we can like talk about episodes
together my personal favorite was the
one with the guy that found out the girl
he was talking to was a guy and the guy
was kind of hot too so I felt bad for
him like I'll take him but yeah okay I'm
really humbling now I'm gonna go yeah
