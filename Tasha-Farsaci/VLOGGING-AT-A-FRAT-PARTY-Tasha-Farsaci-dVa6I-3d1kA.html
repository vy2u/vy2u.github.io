today I just wanted to do a little daily
vlog because I feel like I haven't
talked to you guys and so long like just
talking and like a vlog type video so
yeah I'd only have much planned for
today but I know anne-marie and I she's
my roommate / a youtuber I'm about to go
get lunch I don't know where we're gonna
go either so yeah we will figure it out
but I just thought it'd be fun I did
like a little Twitter poll asking you
guys if you would want just like a
random little vlog and I think like 80
something percent of you said yes so
yeah my room and my hair is a disaster
so ignore that but I'm wearing this top
from Free People and then these jeans
from Topshop and then these little
booties by Steve Madden I literally need
to vacuum so badly but yeah you should
oh I'll try this one we explained it one
okay so basically I don't really know
and apparently no one else does either
this is consistent like with the
ketogenic diet which is like the Olli
time based in science that's all I know
how to explain it but it's like there's
like a ton of butter in it it's actually
I tried the normal one the other day and
I thought it was pretty good yeah and I
think that one's disgusting oh wait the
lighting right here is great yeah okay
so Ann Marie tell them where you're
going
so this Amazon like college store opened
and it's the most convenient thing ever
for Amazon across a lot of college
campuses yeah so I was not aware oh it's
so dark okay I was not aware that you
didn't have to like print a label to
return stuff yeah apparently just bring
it these are this bright X gloves so
we're gonna we're gonna test it out I
guess you've done it before but I'm
gonna I'm gonna look at it look how
pretty this building is guys I love it
so you do print it and then give it to
them okay yep now she has to get the bag
look at this is will it fit
no no it's definitely not gonna fit no
way waste of the bag thank you okay bye
would you not deduct it okay guys who's
campus because everyone always says they
want to see campus more but this isn't
only the cute part that's okay it's
decent we're walking into Ann Marie's
car we still don't know where we're
gonna get food so we're gonna Yelp
something but yeah campus is kind of
dead sit Saturday but yeah what did you
choose so sugar fish is like a super
popular sushi place and people like it
because they have like a really limited
menu and you like cannot ask for any
substitutions or anything and the people
who made sugar fish also made a burger
place and they have two burgers you
can't like ask for any substitution 30
of - yeah they have like a meat burger
and then like it's either vegan or
vegetarian and it's supposed to be like
Shake Shack but it's supposed to be
really good
so I've been wanting to go yeah
yeah she like has to be also got some
pickles
okay Tosh's transit coffee bulletproof
coffee that I gave her a different
version of and it was really bad but she
liked it yeah well yes but my first
really good our dough
it wasn't so much better from what I
remember like it's not sour at all like
it's way better right
because that's there's no way that can
be healthy for me I'm not doing the
ketogenic diet it's like just butter I
brought you Marie to my favorite place
they have it's so good you guys have to
try it I have one in Santa Monica and
Beverly Hills and I always get the
chocolate yeah I've tried it she got the
honey hey guys so anne-marie and I just
got back from Santa Monica like I showed
you we went to that burger place and
then I brought her to go Greek because
it's honestly one my favorite places if
you guys like frozen yogurt try go Greek
I'm honestly not the biggest frozen
yogurt person because I feel like it's
not as good as ice cream but go Greek is
so amazing so test it out but now we're
just hanging out I'm gonna try and get
her to go to a frat party with me
tonight just because I think the theme
is fun it's like kind of like EDM themed
early kind of like any it's called like
a wonder way under whatever so I'm gonna
try to go to go but yeah honestly like
haven't been going to that many parties
lately I'm kind of like kind of in in a
slump
I'd only know how to explain it I like
try to explain it and then let me know
if you guys have felt the same way I
don't know I kind of just like really
hated all my classes this semester I
just I just didn't enjoy any of them at
all and then I'm kind of like kind of at
the point where I'm getting over like
frat parties and that kind of stuff I
don't know it's just like all the same
thing I don't know like I just feel like
go to parties everyone's just like super
drunk and you don't really need anyone
to make any like meaningful
relationships out of it so I don't know
I've just kind of been annoyed with that
I've kind of been more focused on
like career building things I've been
applying to internships for the summer
and stuff like that but I don't know I
just like really want to change so I'm
hoping with like Thanksgiving break and
Christmas break coming up I'm going to
Paris with Gretchen I'm really excited
got you and Lucy so I don't know I'm
hoping that that and then new classes in
the spring will kind of be like a little
bit better but yeah I don't know I've
kind of just been like bored and it's
not like I'm unhappy or like upset or
anything I just like having I don't know
I'm kind of just like getting over like
the whole like yeah like college prep
party as I'm like saying I'm gonna go to
one but yeah I don't know I just really
need to change guys who suck sometimes
I'm like feel lonely and then I'm like
Tasha you have so much more to like look
forward to you don't need that but it's
still like I don't know so that's kind
of where my life is but nevertheless I
want anna-marie to come out with me
tonight so we will see
so today it's the next morning I kind of
just wanted a chance to end off the vlog
I wish I could vlog more today but I
literally have a 10 a 12 page paper due
tomorrow and I'm never the type of
person to procrastinate work especially
papers but for some reason I who
literally left this one to the last
minute luckily it's due at midnight
tomorrow so I have like more than just
24 hours but yeah I need to get on that
but anyways one more thing I want to
show you guys this sweater I got because
I think it's so adorable I got it at the
bookstore people always ask me where I
get my USD stuff and like it's from a
variety of places but a lot of the stuff
I get is from the bookstore so this was
super pricey but I think it's adorable
and I know I'm gonna be wearing it a ton
but yeah it was actually like in the
men's Christmas section but I think it's
amazing so anyways yeah I think I'm
gonna like head to the library or a
coffee shop or something and do my paper
but I hope you guys enjoyed this vlog I
hope it gets you excited for vlogmas
because I will be doing vlogmas this
year and I'm gonna try and like break
out of my shell and vlog more on campus
and like in public so we'll see how that
goes but I love you guys so much and as
always thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
