know you guys might be excited about
because I know a lot of you guys like my
vlogs my eyes are watering right now I
apologize
anyways you may be thinking Tasha why
are you vlogging well I am driving to go
and visit Gretchen and Lucy so Gretchen
looks beauty and then her twin sister
Lucy would you guys may or may not be
familiar with um I love them so much me
like hang out every summer so they only
live about two and a half hours away
from me so I'm driving to their house
and then we're going to Governors Ball
day two together in New York City and
then the day after that we're just
hanging out in New York City together so
I think I'll probably split this up into
a few vlogs but I'm on my way there now
so I thought I had to preface the vlog
um I'm really sick like if you guys
watched I did a haul video my last video
before this one I was really sick in it
and I'm still really sick I feel okay
but mic off is really bad and my nose is
totally stuffed so hopefully I don't get
them sick I don't think I'm contagious
anymore but we'll see so yeah I'm really
really excited to see them I love them
so much it's like funny because I met
Gretchen off of youtube and then
obviously Lucy from Gretchen but I
consider them some of my best friends
like not even YouTube friends just like
best friends so I mean it's so awesome
how I had the chance for that to happen
but yeah I'm actually at McDonald's
right now does this surprise you guys
yeah this is also funny because Gretchen
and Lucy are probably like the
healthiest people I know and yeah I'm at
McDonald's I'm gonna get it a nice
coffee cuz this is my favorite and I'm
really tempted to try the mozzarella
sticks because I know they have
mozzarella sticks now I don't know guys
I don't know we'll see you know when I
come back I'll see what I did
okay update I did not get mozzarella
sticks because they didn't have them I
tried I swear McDonald's has mozzarella
sticks now so I don't know if mine is
just lame but I got my medium caramel
ice coffee this is heaven like I've been
to all those fancy la coffee shops you
know Alfred's all that jazz
yeah McDonald's is my favorite oh it's
so good and I don't really get the large
because it's so cheap like all the
coffee's so cheap but I know I'll pee my
pants and I don't want that to happen so
yeah I'm off next time I vlog I'll
probably be with Gretchen / Lucy and
yeah let's hope I don't get in the car
accident bye look who I found
and then there's someone else
he looks fake looks like a stuffed
animal so Gretchen's uploading a vlog
and you know so when something else
happens
oh my gosh you can show them when we go
get salad hello okay so I forgot to vlog
like all day I didn't really forget it
just there was nothing I mean I could
have logged it dinner I guess yeah
sometimes just man yeah I mean I'm gonna
mush all these together and then make a
new one for like gumball I think so it's
fine these are like mush you know but
right now Lucy went to bed I know
everyone's gonna comment toshing you
hate Lucy that one knows their friends
they don't hate each other literally
like I posted a video on crutches
channel regression posted one it was
like a haul and me her and Lucy and
everyone like decided I hated Lucy yes I
hate Lucy sauce that was like who's like
this whole conspiracy I'm like clearly
she hates her she invited her to her
house yeah okay yeah no Lucy has like a
super early shift in the morning yeah so
she fight to bed yeah
so got to the I are about to watch Sean
Lowe season of The Bachelor because I've
seen like every other season but that
was like a toe yes so we went to dinner
at Bonefish Grill and you know what I
don't know if you guys know how much I
hate cilantro but I got a dish because I
just did sure a dish I got a chicken
teriyaki bowl which I thought sounded
you know innocent enough because there
is no cilantro on the menu and then oh
the rice is chocked full of cilantro
so that's just great you know bad Tasha
was like to buy does anyone else hate
cilantro I feel like it's a pretty
common thing to not like but like I
can't eat it like I can't did you smell
it are you just like I yeah I can taste
like even if it's like the last
ingredient and like a sauce I can still
taste it like I hate it event like at
Chipotle like I can't get the rice I
have to get like ask for special rice
without this lobster age hack you can
ask for it with me true okay so probably
gonna peace out for tonight but then I
will continue vlogging tomorrow good
morning not the Bradley you can't put
the video on your phone again hey guys
so we are about to go to the pool with
Gretchen and Lucy work and I want to
show you my bathing suit so this is from
Midori it's a good my first ones I don't
remember which top this is but it's just
like they're green with like the coffee

lifeguard and I'm excited to get tan

that kind of tan but I want to tell them
look at what I figured out about my top

ghost Elgin yeah except Gretchen has a
nice blogging camera and I'm on my phone
