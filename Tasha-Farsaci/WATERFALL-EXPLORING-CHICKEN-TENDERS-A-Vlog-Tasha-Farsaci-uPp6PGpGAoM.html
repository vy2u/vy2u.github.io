just like force myself to get up because
I decided to vlog today and oh my god I
look horrendous oh my eyes are like
watering sorry um yeah and I haven't
been able to sleep lately like I've been
falling asleep at like 4 a.m. every
single night I've been like trying to
take like sleep aids to fall asleep but
I don't want to take them too much cuz I
don't want to like rely on them or
whatever and I don't know why I haven't
been able to sleep but I have literally
been up to like four every single
morning and I've been like setting
alarms to wake up earlier and then it
just does nothing so I'm exhausted but
the reason that I wanted to vlog today
is because me and some friends I'm going
to a waterfall that's probably like an
hour or so away from here I went last
summer but it's just really fun there's
like cool photo opportunities and I
thought since I'm doing something kind
of fun I'll like take you guys along
with me um yeah there's no promising
that I'm a good a vlogger because I'm
probably not um but yeah oh my god I
look horrendous so yeah I'm gonna shower
and put some makeup on and then I'll
come back and talk to you so I don't
have to scare you in my face anyway so
I'm back I've showered as you can tell
and I'm standing in my closet because
the lighting is nice so basically I just
want to talk early quick like why I
haven't vlogged I mean I think I've
logged like twice but I don't even know
if they're still on YouTube because I
remember that they were very bad um yeah
so basically the main reason is I don't
live in LA I don't live anywhere
particularly exciting I live in New York
State but I don't live in a city and I'm
like five or six hours from the city so
yeah I can't just go there you know
whenever I want like I need to get a
hotel sorry I'm gonna expense my hair
doing this yeah so I don't live in a
very fun place I mean some people might
think it's fun but personally I don't
enjoy it which is why I am going to
school in LA so yeah hopefully once I go
to school like I'll have more exciting
things to do especially because I think
my last class on Friday ends at 12:30 so
I'll have like the whole day and all the
weekend to do cool stuff but um yeah
so that's why I don't leave la gaucho
also um I'm not like your typical
youtuber I guess I have an actual job
that's not YouTube um I work in our
company and Fitch and you guys might
know that I used to work at Wegmans
which is a grocery store but I've always
had another job other than YouTube my
parents make me first of all but they
don't really make me I guess like I kind
of want one I don't know like I could
easily just have YouTube as a job but I
feel like I should get the experience
I'm a real job too
I don't know so yeah I work at
Abercrombie now that takes up a lot of
my time sometimes like my shifts like
five hours so if I do that like I'm not
gonna vlog the day also like my friends
here aren't youtubers clearly um and
they don't really want to be in late
flogs it's just like sad so I don't know
if no one is in my vlog today other than
me that's why I'm gonna try and get
people in but I don't know I don't want
it to be awkward
so yeah that's why I believe vlog a lot
but oh and also when I'm blogging my
iPhone because I don't have a blog in
camera I was hurt so bad actually I do
have a camera that I could use for
vlogging people used to use it before
they got like the cool flip screen one
but I like to be able to see myself when
I take a video so I don't know but yeah
I'm going to the waterfall today you
guys might know which one it is if you
live in New York State or if you've been
to before
it's not anything crazy it's not like
Niagara Falls it's pretty small but it's
cute to take pictures okay sorry I had
to rest my arm from it
but yeah it's like going to take
pictures and I'm like Instagram obsessed
okay so honestly I'm gonna do a
shameless plug right now like if you
guys don't follow me on instagram that'd
be so so cool what I just gonna see like
soap super cool if you did because
honestly I'm at this place right now
where I keep like losing the amount of
followers and I gained and then I'm not
moving anywhere yeah my instagrams
fierce etosha and I don't know if it's
because like I don't have a theme like
I'm not like every other youtuber once
again that literally does square
pictures so they look all cute and like
do the same color combination like now I
post the pictures that I like I like
taking panoramas so I'm not gonna square
pictures like I don't know I don't have
a theme or whatever
I think I'd take pretty cool pictures I
don't know I try to so yeah definitely
go following me if you're not that'd be
awesome but yeah I'm gonna try and take
some cool pictures today we'll see how
that works out yeah I'm gonna change
into what I'm gonna wear I'll show you
like the bathing suit I'm gonna wear
because I got yesterday yeah and yeah my
normally don't get bathing suits from
Victoria's Secret just cuz they're like
really expensive but it was 30 percent
off and whose video wasn't watching I
think make up by a page XO was her name
and she got this bathing suit and like a
different style so I went to Victoria's
Secret like right before work and I
wanted to see if they had it and they
did in but I saw they had this style and
it was in my size and I absolutely love
the design on it
it's Paisley which is like my favorite
thing ever I love the colors this is
like the push-up top but like I do I
have boobs
so I don't really push me up at all but
there's like a ton of padding in it
so I mean like it does a little bit but
like it's hard to push stuff up if you
don't have boobs like small boob girls
will understand and then I wasn't gonna
get the matching bottoms I was just
gonna buy like white bottoms somewhere
but since thing was thirty percent off
they were like the same price is like
white bottoms would be so I just got
matching bottoms and I think they're
really cute so yeah I'm gonna wear this
today okay so I know this is like
potentially weird of me to show you guys
the bikini on but whatever I figured I'd
show you so like if you have like the
same size boob Disney this is a 34 a
then like yeah you can see it's really
not that pushed up but like a little bit
I don't know and then your the bottoms
okay I have scoliosis and I've talked
about this before that like this hip
goes out a little further so yeah you
can you can see that here uh-huh
I don't know I'm kind of like
self-conscious about it so yeah but yeah
this is the bikini on it's super cute
like I love the back and yeah so I
really like it and I got it for 30% off
I don't know if I mentioned that I
probably did but yeah so that's what it
looks like okay so I realize that some
of you guys are probably like what black
is scoliosis like what is she talking
about
and yeah I should probably say what it
is um it's basically when you have like
a curvature to your spine and I have it
so basically my spine is like an S so at
the end one side of my spine like juts
out and that's why my hips are uneven
and I don't know like I'm really
self-conscious about it but it's really
not as bad that I would need a break it
could be a lot worse and you really
don't notice it unless I pointed out I
guess I don't know that's what people
tell me but yeah so that's what
scoliosis is it's pretty common and it's
also why I'm so short I'd be a little
bit taller if I didn't have it so yeah
it kind of sucks in that respect but um
my mom had it like whatever I'm okay
with it doesn't really hinder my daily
life so if that's the only thing that's
wrong with me
I'm okay and I guess I'll show you what
like my outfit looks like it's not that
cute or anything I but yeah whatever by
the way my tapestry is from eBay just
search tapestry like I get this question
every video but yes so next time I up to
you I'll probably be in the car of my
friends or alone if they don't want to
be in it welcome to my zoo
yeah
reaction
I'm not afraid to do the Lord's work
you said vengeance achievement
go ahead
they
so the meatballs were way too rapid to
go in because it's been raining a lot oh
my god so we found these smaller ones
and we're gonna try and go in those and
yeah they're like going down in so I
probably will die vlogging this but got
to do what you got to do oh okay
I'm gonna be like scaling this wall okay
I'm gonna put the camera around
hey guys so we're currently at the
summit the summit's of the fall
people behind me hey guys oh yeah put
your thumb enjoying the view
so we're currently getting a chicken
tenders that feed us to confirm to
please pepper but it's called Tully and
you live in New York or like you might
know of one but if you're to come by you
have to go because they're amazing and I
will vlog them when they come so this is
the beauty we've got some nice tenders
or honey mustard yeah their own honey
mustard and hold on I take my first bite
yeah I want to like get this on video
all this gonna be awkward how do I agree
I immediately regret that decision
oh yeah
I'm gonna go in now okay so I just got
home a little bit ago and I sat down to
start editing the vlog footage ed I got
them today and I realized there was a
lot longer than I thought because I was
literally blabbing in the beginning of
the video so I'm just gonna end off the
vlog here I mean know if you guys liked
it if you liked me vlogging if you want
me to do more because I mean I try to do
some fun stuff once in a while so if you
