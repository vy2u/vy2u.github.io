um I went to bed at 4:30 a.m. again
because of the time your time zone
change um yeah I go to bed late as it is
in California like 1:30 clearly because
I'm like awake at 4:30
um it's currently 10 o'clock and my
parents woke me up because we're going
to cut a tree um yes my dad's friend has
like a little mini tree farm kind of
thing so we're just like going there and
I was like oh really like you can just
pick one like I don't have to go but uh
I'm going so I figured you know I might
as well wear this because how many times
can I really wear this plus I was too
bad and like the least effort I have to
put into my my outfit before I go the
better so yeah I'm wearing this with
little lemons probably gonna put a hat
on probably gonna put it definitely
gonna put a jacket on um gonna put
Hunter boots on looking outside right
now it's snowing a lot you can't even
see that it's snowing oh hey Dad um but
yep it's it's definitely snowing uh yeah
so can I go get a treat I am half awake
oh let's do this
guys it's really snowy and I'm just
sitting in the car but I know I'm gonna
have to get out soon but it's so cold I
don't know what that purple thing is on
the window ah so snowy
oh you guys even see the snow cut it cut
it cut it
timbers way to hat you need to Cuddy
well guys the bikini snow photo is about
to commence I'm already cold just
standing my room so I can't wait to see
how cold I'm gonna be when I'm outside I
hate myself so much if you guys didn't
watch my vlog from yesterday basically
I'm doing a giveaway with red card I
swam it's like the company that this
swimsuit is by and I have to post a
photo tomorrow announcing the giveaway
mine the bathing suit and I'm living in
New York currently for Christmas breaks
yep I'm going in snow ah I'm gonna be
cold be we'll see how this turns out I'm
probably gonna look really stupid the
things girls do for Instagram vlogmas
you get a sneak peek of the final
product it was actually so cold and I
had to take this photo and like I had
like barely any photo options cuz I was
so cold I was like mom take like five uh
yeah I had my mom take this so shout out
mom honestly it's not as bad as I
thought it would be so please if you see
this on Instagram go like it because I
guarantee it's gonna get like two likes
okay so I'm about to go to Target and
Wegmans with my mom I want him to target
because I think I want to do a little
holiday giveaway on my channel just like
something small I'm like just to give
back to you guys
and then Whiteman's it's a grocery store
around here if you guys are from like
the Northeast you're probably familiar
with it and missing it we're gonna get
some groceries cuz I act like there's
nobody knows so yeah I do that I will
bring you guys with me of course I
changed out of my Christmas sweater wait
I don't even know if you guys I show you
it I think I did earlier yeah I'm
wearing the same turtleneck I wore
yesterday but in Burgundy it's faux my
website called dazzle and then my jacket
I got it from a store in downtown
Syracuse called bounce some of you guys
were
so yeah guys we came to Kohl's because
my mom remembered that this was here and
this is a this is going to happen most
likely so if you live in the Syracuse
area if you haven't been to
possibilities you should go but they
sell this spicy spicy spicy hot tomato
oil at the stores and that's what they
give you with their bread at
possibilities and it's so so good so I
totally recommend trying it if you
haven't already mom what are you making
I am making stops oakiness with a
sausage she says don't get her face so
that's why I'm not um and what you have
to do is you have to take all the
zucchini out of the side and cut them in
two and then you take all the zucchini
on you cook it with a hot sausage and
onions and then your we're going to
restock them and I will show you later
what the funny boy is not showing your
face so it looks weird yum yum yum yum
hey guys so I just ate dinner and then
I'm came upstairs to just kind of like
chill for a little bit I put my
Christmas sweatshirt back on because
this sweater was kind of itchy by the
way I did get that bah humbug sweater
earlier but the only small they had left
was missing the pom pom on little Santa
hat so my mom's gonna sell one on for me
so otherwise I'd be wearing that one
right now but anyways I was just
watching Gretchen's blog Gretchen loves
beauty like my youtube friend and she's
doing vlogmas and they were talking
about socks and it just made me
flashback to middle school and I don't
know if this was just like my middle
school or if I was just weird but like
the cool thing was to wear two different
socks like preferably neon like a neon
pink sock and a neon green sock and then
we're like the adidas slide on you know
the ones with like the little rubber
bumps like all I remember is that was so
cool so comment down below if that was
like a thing for you in middle school
like you like six years ago or eight
years ago however long ago middle school
was
um because just just embarrassing okay
guys so this lighting is like really bad
and I'm not looking my best I'm just
gonna end off lug miss here I don't
remember the last time I've logged but
basically we put our Christmas tree up
and I kind of decorated it a little bit
with my mom to be honest I like I love
getting real trees
I'd like getting Christmas trees and
stuff but then I hate decorating them
it's like I'm the only person like I
like the idea of it but then I just get
like really lazy this tree is like
massive though it's quite large so we
like kind of decorated it I literally
always end up with my nose we add in
vlogs and I think it's cuz I always end
off the vlogs in bed and I'm like warm
and then I've determined when I'm more
my nose turned red so disregard that but
I think I might end off vlogmas here I
hope you guys enjoyed this I hope you
weren't finding these too boring but
yeah thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
