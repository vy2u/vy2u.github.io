the long-awaited what I got for
Christmas video for the 2016 year I know
this is up a lot later than most
people's people were literally getting
theirs up at 10 a.m. on Christmas but I
was waiting for a few things and I
figured you know it's better to do it
afterward after the whole rush of like
tons of the videos anyway so hopefully
this is still relevant to you guys and
hopefully you still want to watch it
before I start I just want to do the
disclaimer that everyone does obviously
Christmas is not about the gift it's
just so much more about family and
friends but nevertheless these videos
are super requested and popular and
there's some of my favorite videos to
watch so I'm doing it before I get into
showing you what I got for Christmas if
you're not following me on social media
you guys totally should it's a super
personal outlet for me I'm super just
like myself on them so my Instagram is
fierce etosha and then I'm gonna put my
Twitter as well as my snapchat down here
you guys should totally go and follow me
okay so the first few things like after
Christmas are gifted to me from the app
dote I've talked about what dope before
and I love everyone that works there
they sent me a few things for Christmas
which was so nice of them and I want to
show you guys what they gave me
if you guys aren't familiar with dough
I'll go over it really quickly basically
it's a shopping app so it's an app
except the cool thing is that it has so
many different stores on it literally
all my favorite stores are on it like
Free People or in Outfitters brandy
melville revolve Shopbop Nordstrom
literally everything is on there and you
can just shop all on one app it's so
convenient to be able to shop on your
phone you can shop all these different
stores all at once instead of having to
like go to one website and go to another
website so it shows super convenient and
the best thing is that if you guys use
my invite code Tasha you get five
dollars free and free shipping so I'm
literally basically handing you a $5
gift card to one of your favorite stores
so yeah if you just want $5 totally
Unicode and sign up for the app doe I'm
going to link all that stuff down below
and if you guys do end up liking the app
go I have a whole wishlist saved down
there so you guys if you're ever
wondering like what I'm wanting and all
this stuff is in the wishlist as well
anyway - so if you want to find the
stuff that I shown this video or if
you're just wondering like what I am my
and you want to check it out I will have
my wishlist linked down below okay so
the first thing from dough is the Urban
Decay ultimate Naked basics no naked
ultimate basics palette I've been loving
my eyeshadows matte eyeshadows are all
I've been wearing recently that's what
I'm wearing now I'm wearing this palette
actually and this has 12 yeah 12 matte
eyeshadows that are super natural this
is just a look at the colors on the back
as you can see they're super neutral and
just really pretty so I've been loving
these the next thing from dope is this
little pair of brandy melville shorts
I've wanted these for so long because
they're so comfy and just perfect to
throw on to lounge in or sleep in or
whatever
I have been obsessed with the
off-the-shoulder trend recently so I got
this top from Lulu's from doped and it's
just this kind of dusty rose pink color
and it kind of folds off the shoulders
and it's a crop top so I just thought
this was adorable
also from brandy melville off of dota I
got this flannel because for some reason
I've wanted this flannel for so long I
just love the colors in it and I've seen
people wearing it and I've always wanted
it and thank you to doped for coming
through so it's just this really nice
oversized comfy flannel I really wanted
a fur vest or a faux fur vest because
they're really in for this season so
don't send me this really beautiful one
by jack by BB Dakota I've already worn
this I think it's so cool and so pretty
don't actually send me a few more things
for Christmas but they're kind of stuck
in the mail right now the mail has been
going super slow lately you guys know
around the holiday times things
literally get stuck who knows where so I
just want to tell you about the other
stuff because they didn't tell me what
they were sending so I'm getting two
really really cute hats from Topshop I'm
gonna put the photos of them here I'm
obsessed with them if you guys want them
totally go in my wish list you can check
them out and then they're also sending
me this Calvin Klein kind of comfy
pullover sweater from PacSun so I'll
show you as a photo of that here but
yeah I'm really excited to get those I
just didn't want to wait any longer to
film this video because I feel like it's
kind of late already as it is but yeah

these things from dough like I said the
wish list that has all of these as
other things that I want it is linked

studs these ones I don't remember the
exact stone but they're kind of like a
blue they might be sapphire I'm not

just wanted these to wear with
athleisure outfits you know so if I'm

on because I think they're stylish but
they're also like comfy sneakers you
know what I mean my parents also got me
this sweatshirt I actually technically
got it for myself but they gave me the
money for it
love that as well as money for a pair of
shorts that I have from the USC
bookstore but I left those at school so
I can't show you those but it's just
this USC sweatshirt it's really cute it
has like stripes on the sides what
sleeves and then it has children's on
the back really cute this is like super
oversized and comfy I want us to the
airport which is why I have it here now
but I love this I'm obsessed with
college apparel oh my gosh
literally I could live in the USC
bookstore okay this is really funny they
gave me they wrapped up my passport and
gave it to me because for the longest
time they wouldn't give my passport
they're like Tascha

want you to go to Mexico ah
but yeah I'm going to Cabo for spring
break
women will come so uh yeah they gave me
my passport this is also funny they
wrote me a little note with a picture of
pots and pans on it so they're going to
order me some pots and pans for my
apartment at school you know you're old
when you start getting
pots and pans for Christmas yeah but
basically all the pots and pans that
were in my apartment when I moved in
we're kind of old there weren't that
many there so it'll be nice to have so
nice new ones so that I can cook my own
food like an adult okay and then I got a
Starbucks gift card which is not on here
