is it horrible I'm filming a different
camera and letting in my room is awful
as you guys may have picked up on by now
but I'm really trying to find a better
lighting so let me know how this is
anyways today I have no idea what type
of video to film but I really wanted to
so I decided to default on the Q&amp;amp;A video
so normally I ask you guys to ask me
questions on Twitter but I don't really
have a lot of you guys following me on
Twitter so you know if you want to
experi Tasha FYI but I don't have a lot
of followers on Twitter so I never
really get a large variety of questions
so I decided to ask you guys on
Instagram because I do have a lot more
followers on there and I got a ton of
questions so I'm going to be answering
the most asked ones as well as a few
that I liked by far the most popular
question and the namesake of this video
is where are we going to college so if
you guys don't know how old I am I am 17
I'm a senior in high school which means
in the US this is my last year of high
school before I go on to college or as
people not in the US Colored University
so I'm sorry I let you guys down but I
have not received any acceptance letters
on the other hand I haven't been denied
either so basically I haven't heard back
with any colleges the reason for that is
I didn't apply a really action or early
decision anywhere and there isn't
through that it is my top choice college
which I'll get to in a minute does not
offer early action or early decision
which kind of sucked and I didn't want
to do anything earlier than I add to for
a college that wasn't my top choice so I
just decided not to anyways even though
I haven't been accepted to college yet
I'm going to tell you the colors I'm
applying to and my top choice so in case
any color does I watching this because I
did talk about my youtube in my
applications I hope all the colleges
that I applied to they're all awesome
and that's why I'm applying to them but
my top choice is the University of
Southern California if you guys have
watched my videos for a while you may
know this I love USC and it might be
kind of weird to some of you because you
know I live in New York a lot of people
tend to go to college in the same place
of fameless' but for me I hate the snow
I hate the cold and there are a lot more
opportunities for me especially being a
youtuber to live in LA than to lay up
here in New York I don't live in New
York City by the way so there's really
nothing here
anyways so USC is my top choice but I
did apply it to a few other colleges I
applied to UCLA Georgetown Boston
University Syracuse University and I'm
applying into a Loyola Marymount
University all the colleges I'm applying
to our pretty selective so I'm kind of
nervous but once I find out where I'm
going I will most likely tell you guys
next question is three pet peeves okay
so I didn't really plan out my new
interns before filming this so I'm just
going to name two I think because two
are the only ones I can really think of
right now which is odd because I have a
lot of pet peeves first pet peeve is
unreliable people I hate when people
fail on plans will like not answer you
will get you will be late like I'm I
think I'm a pretty reliable person and I
would never do that to people and it's
so annoying it's like you'll have a plan
for someone that was just never talk to
you or like you need to plan something
out and people have no initiative to do
it and then I end up planning everything
I don't know it just really bothers me
and I think it's just because I ever
will have a person that bothers me so
much but you're any of you guys have
this same fat pain because it makes me
so angry
my next pet peeve is when you give
people your clothes tomorrow because I
asked you and then you never get them
back
I really honestly don't let people
borrow my clubs very often because I
know I'm never going to get them back
and I do spend a lot of money on my
clothes and it kind of sucks when you
don't get the back and then they're
passed throughout like a bunch of your
friends and like everyone has them
you're like oh my god and then you keep
asking for them back and that person
normally unreliable the areolar again
just doesn't give them back or makes
excuses and yeah so if I give you my
clothes please give them back and I
probably trust you anyways but yeah it
just sucks okay a lot of you guys asked
what I really want for Christmas or
what's my top choice that I want for
Christmas and I really didn't want a lot
this year because I do make my own money
I have two jobs so I do make my own
money and I kind of spy the things that
I like but I do really want to do camera
obviously I want a new camera for
YouTube because I really don't have the
best quality ever this camera I'm
filming on is actually not my normal
camcorder it's actually like a picture
taking camera that I know it because the
quality is better but I really do want a
nice camera so I have great quality for
you guys and that I can take it with me
to college and just people are
successful because I know you guys would
much rather have me you have both Molly
and play videos so I'm hoping to get
that actually I'm pretty positive I'm
getting that so after Christmas my video
Paolo you should be a million times
better tell me what you guys want for
Christmas and their comments down below
because I love seeing what everyone
wants it's super fun and my birthday's
in February so I can get some ideas okay
so how long you have me and my boyfriend
been dating and how old is he so yes I
do have a boyfriend if you guys don't
know I haven't done a boyfriend tag just
because I think that's kind of personal
I don't know but he is 19 I'm 17
he is one great older than me though
he's a freshman in college and I must
saw
or what now I'm a senior I'm a senior in
high school he's a freshman in college
so it's a one-year HGF except he's 19
but I'll be 18 in like a few months so
yeah and we have been dating eight
months so yes you know putting it pretty
substantial amount of time okay so the
quality might be different and the place
made me to trade because my camera just
died yay okay so next question it is so
what is your worst fear I have addressed
this in previous videos but I'm going to
dress again because when I see this
question I can only think of one thing
it is a phobia it's not even a fear it's
a phobia so I have a phobia of throwing
up throw up other people going up me
coming up I know no one likes throwing
up well I mean some people might be
weird but kinda majority of the time
people don't like throwing up but
literally guys I have a phobia someone
that could tell me oh I feel so safe
like my stomach's upset like oh I could
throw up right now and wait like I will
rhyme guys I will ride if someone has
been sick that I've been with and like
they're sick like the next day I will
freak out I would calculate in my head
if it's possible for me to like get sick
oh my god I do have this one story so
this was probably two years back I was
riding the bus to school and I forgot my
headphones that day so movie that didn't
happen I don't have my headphones I
wouldn't even hear what was going on but
that day I forgot my headphones so
almost
and I hear like this weird like gurgling
noise next to me I'm pretty sure I was
sitting alone so this wasn't the next
seat over and all of a sudden literally
the person goes off on him
I hear the whole thing like I keep
happening I knew it like hit it was
right next to me guys and I literally
was shaking I couldn't breathe like I
was so scared and that person threw up
twice and right next to me and like I
was gonna have a step over to get off
the bus Lee one of the scariest moments
of my life people I don't know if this
is a common phobia like I've heard other
people tell me that they have the same
thing but I don't know it's really bad
and it's especially gonna be bad in
college with parties and stuff because
people will be throwing up all the time
and I'm honestly probably going to poop
my pants
with fear not just like random pigment
tell me your phobias I refuse down below
because they're kind of funny to hear
about how even if they're not funny to
you they're funny you probably some of
you guys were laughing at me what's my
workout slash diet routine so to be
perfectly honest with your eyes I don't
do anything
I must have very high metabolism because
yeah I I don't have a diet workout
routine I'm not as toned as I would like
honestly I would love to be one of those
like really toned and people you see on
Twitter and Tumblr and Instagram or
whatever I'm not but you know I'm skinny
I'm fine with my body
I like eating Chinese food a lot so well
now I am don't really have a diet or
fitness routine and that's probably not
what you guys wanna hear but the truth
what's the best piece of advice you
would give to a teenage girl the best
piece of advice by far is to be
confident in yourself if I could give
advice myself back in the day this is
what I would say if you're confident in
yourself and who you are you will be
happy because if people are being mean
to you you won't even care because
you're proud of who you are you're proud
of what you've done and you're proud of
what you're going to be in the future
don't let other people get to you I know
there's some days when you're having a
bad day you feel really ugly and you
look at pictures of really good-looking
people and you feel even worse but
you're beautiful in your own way should
be thankful for what you have and proud
of yourself so kind of pointy but that's
definitely what I want to tell each and
every one of you because I have adopted
that mindset and I have been so much
happier ever since so I think those are
all the questions I'm going to answer in
this Q&amp;amp;A I hope
kind of interesting answered some of
your questions I'm sorry for the quality
change honestly it's very annoying but I
promise after Christmas I'll be having
good quality be sure to leave a comment
down below because I read all of them
and it's really fun when they have lots
of comments to read respond to so if
you're even thinking something go go
comment it if you want more of me go
follow me on Instagram and Twitter I
know it's a shameless plug what can I
say but they're both fiercely talkshow
you know obviously FBC touch Allah on
Twitter but here's the Tasha if you guys
have any video requests to me because
I'm on winter break now so I'm gonna
want to film some videos be sure to also
comment those down below I love you guys
so much and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
