hairstyle for you it's just the
waterfall braid I know there's a ton of
tutorials on this but I figured I'd do
one and basically it looks like this
it's your hair and then you drop pieces
so that kind of come down and like a
cool waterfall style I guess and you
just need to know how to French braid
for the beginning of this hairstyle and
then it's pretty much easy this does
take a lot of practice it's easy to do
when you have another person with you
but I used this to do it on yourself
technique and I put my hair in my mouth
so I voiced over some of this but yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this this is what it
looks like once again and then in the
back you could go back further but I
didn't go back super far I just kind of
braided it and secured it but once again
you can go back as far as you like and I
really like this it gets all your hair
out of your face and it's really great
for school for dances for anything so
yeah keep watching if you want to learn
how to do this okay the first thing
you're going to want to do is purge your
head on one side so I just did a nice
straight part and my hair is on this
side of my head so what you're going to
want to do is you're going to take a
little section from the top of your head
not too big like an inch inch and a half
and you're going to start French
braiding until you get to about here on
your head so I'm going to do that right
now and then I will be back from
speeding it up when I'm down the death
okay so once you've gotten to about here
you're going to take this piece and put
it in your mouth instead and then pick
up a new piece to use in place of this
one so I'm going to do a voiceover from
now on but you guys will still be able
to see what I'm doing okay so I'm
holding that piece in my mouth and
taking a new section that is the same
size as that piece and using it as I
would up with that piece if I didn't
drop it and then I'm just continuing
with the French braid with the top
section and then as you can see I'm also
taking that section and putting in my
mouth so I'm basically just repeating
when you get to the front you put the
section in your mouth or you have
someone hold it for you if you know
you're doing that and then you
incorporate it into the French braid add
some pieces in from the back section
take the front section put it in your
mouth and grab a new section from
underneath you want to make sure that
it's the same size or elta might look
kind of funky with a bunch of different
size pieces hanging on the side of your
face but you know doesn't really matter
so as you can see I just add the man it
gets kind of hard to hold them all but
it looks really cool at the end so
that's all you do it's pretty simple and
you can just kind of watch me now
okay once you go to here you can let
your hair down and then just take the
rest and bring it down normally as far
as you want and once you the part as far
down as you want to go you can just tie
it off with an elastic
I don't like to go all the way down but
if you want to that's fine so once you
have it like this you can see that it's
really cool-looking because all the
pieces that you will hold in your mouth
fell into like a really cool kind of
water call and that's why it's called a
waterfall braid I like to take the part
that I tie it off at the end bring it to
the back of my head and just secure it
with a bobby pin so it looks like this
from the side
and you can see the reason I have
french-braided at the beginning was so I
don't have a ton of pieces hanging on my
face up here and so they start out
farther back
and this takes a lot of practice it's
not going to be perfect on your first
try but it's really awesome to do what I
love doing it you get tons of
compliments and it's really great so
this is also great for dances and stuff
because if you're standing on the side
you have like a really nice like
hairstyle on the side and stuff so I
hope you guys enjoy this I know you are
asking for more hair tutorials and let
me know if you tried it out so yeah bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
