exciting I mean there's some people but
not that bad at all so we're in this
cute bathing suit from you guys so it's
actually the last day that we're here
the day we're leaving I didn't vlog
yesterday because I got really really
sick sometimes I get these really really
strong abdominal pains that literally
feel like I'm being stabbed and that
happened to me and I still feel like
pretty sick today
but I really did nothing I like laid in
bed yesterday so I didn't vlog today
we're going back home so I'm kind of sad
that I got like I had wasted a day and I
feel bad that I like wasting one of
Mel's days cuz she like obviously wasn't
gonna go just do stuff alone but today
we were going back to that little
wholesale convention center thing we
went yesterday too so we'll probably
show you what we got yesterday too but
we're going back again cuz they add
stuff every day and then we're gonna
stop at chick-fil-a obviously so yeah
and I've worn this shirt literally so
many times on this trip because I didn't
bring a lot of just like t-shirts and
shorts and like when I feel sick
obviously I'd only want to dress cute
plus we're gonna be in the car so yeah I
just wanted to update you guys on what's
going on and why I didn't vlog yesterday
so we're back at Wawa because you guys
told me to use these screens to order
drinks and then another one of you guys
recommended the smoothies so I just had
a smoothies and we're like literally
dripping it's the hottest weather we've
ever been in and I heard two your lives
right now my dad
when in case you guys didn't believe hi
di you but we got our peach mango
smoothies and they're really good so
whoever recommended me thank you so it's
actually the next day now and we came to
the mall because Lulu is having some
sale thing and we didn't think it'd be
bad look at this
let's not every work that
Hey look my old place of work okay so it
was so busy the line was probably two
hours and I didn't really want anything
all I wanted with speed shorts in like a
different color than black but they
didn't even have any on sale or any in a
different color than black but it was to
the point when we waited in line so long
that if I didn't get anything I would
have hated myself so I just got this
pair of cropped leggings they were on
sale and then an additional 20% off and
they just have like this cool like
pixelated watercolor print and I like
them because like they're just black on
the back and they have some like match
these are Izzie stop I don't know I
didn't need them or anything but it was
literally to the point where if I didn't
get anything I would have waited in line
for two hours for no reason so
