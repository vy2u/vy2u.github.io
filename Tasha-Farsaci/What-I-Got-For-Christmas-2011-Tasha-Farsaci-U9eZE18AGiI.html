a long way to Christmas video it's what
I got for Christmas the reason that I
could get haven't done this already is
because I was actually waiting for my
aunt to give me stuff or give me my dips
from her because she always gets me
really great stuff but I don't really
see them that often so I don't have that
stuff yet yeah so I just decided that
I'm through this video without it
because who knows when I'm going to get
that but um yes so I'm gonna just say
the same thing everyone says before they
start this video because I know some
people will probably comment about it if
I don't um I'm not trying to brag I'm
very grateful for everything that I got
you know I'm grateful I didn't even ask
for anything this custom is just because
I was really happy with everything that
I have but obviously I did get stuff
because I've done this video and yeah so
I did this because it was very highly
requested and yes so I'm gonna get
started
I did get some a few things like before
Christmas that were given to me then I'm
kinda gonna count I don't have them
upstairs right now but I did get track
spikes because I run track and they're
just like the little flats with the
spikes I don't have them up here right
now but I will take a picture and I will
put them right here
so yeah so so I got those and I'm really
happy I got those because they make me
one faster and next I'm gonna start off
with what my friend got me
I always exchange gifts with one of my
friends and it should we change this
year and this is what she got me so she
got me a premium pure spray from pink
and it smells really really good so I
love this and it's really nice she also
got me an OPI nail polish that I've been
wanting for a while and it's in the
color pandemonium pink and it's like a
lilac II baby pink color like it's a
light light pink but it also has like
some lilac hues in it so that is what
that looks like and I love OPI I'm
trying to like start a little collection
so that's cool
then I got three other OPI nail polishes
and I picked all this stuff out most of
stuff that I got for Christmas I
actually picked out because I didn't ask
for anything my parents aren't that
great like picking out clothing items
for me so I knew all this stuff before
Christmas but anyways the nail polishes
I got are eight fairies in the Canaries
by OPI and this is like the coolest
color ever it's like a magenta purpley
it's so cool I'm so excited to use this
one the next one I got is my private jet
and I've been buying this for a while my
mom if she surprised me with this one
but it's like a brownie color it has
like shimmer in it and it's just really
pretty I can't really describe it but
this is Kim Kardashian's favorite color
I guess whatever and then I also got
Linkin Park after dive which I thought
my nails right now and I love wearing
really really dark purples it's a kind
of almost look black mess I'm doing
right now obviously and some of you guys
might think it's black but it's actually
a really dark purple color and I love
this so much so those are the OPI nail
polishes I got I'm not showing you
everything I got just because I don't
think that's necessarily I'm not going
to show you that the candy and all the
socks and like bras and that kind of
stuff but I will show you two pairs of
socks I got okay these this first pack
is really cool that's what I want to
show you what they're these under
everyone's and they have like neon Under
Armour of science there's like hot pink
and blue lime-green and all over that so
that was cool and then I just got like
black Nike socks though who's gonna
brighter than my normal socks so just
showed you those ones I picked all these
clothes out myself we bought them before
Christmas and so I already knew
everything I was getting but that's okay
so I'm gonna start off with forever 21
so my mom actually got these are
surprised they're just fingerless gloves
and things like this on
and yeah so nice I like them because I
know the gloves all that often but these
are really cute so she got me knees okay
these next two shirts remind me of
Gossip Girl I am obsessed with Gossip
Girl like over break that's all I did
was watch Gossip Girl so this these
shirts might not be everyone's taste but
I really like them so I got this one
it's in a light light pink with like a
foamy purple color it has like a few
buttons up the front and then another
button here and then it just goes down
straight this looks a lot better on it's
not looking too great at the moment I
promise to it looks really cute on and I
really really like this okay and also I
was wanting to shoot that kind of had
like a bow like a tie in the front for
awhile so I got this one it's kind of
like a minty seafoam green kind of color
it has like a bunch of ruffles at the
top and I has that little tie in the
front like I wanted it has buttons it
goes down and it's kind of cropped in
the front so it's actually pretty short
in the front and it gets longer in the
back and this is just really really cute
and I love this okay in the last two
things I got from forever 21 were two
sweaters and I love sweaters so I got
this one of the large just because I
like having sort of big and stuff it
looks like this it's kind of like this
oatmeal color it's cable knit it goes
down the sleeves are really long so I
pop them but it's still really cute and
really more room and I love it okay the
next one I got my mom actually got me
two she got me this one and then another
similar one so I could pick which one I
like better but she left the receipt for
the other ones so I kind of had to keep
this one and it's just a white cable
knit sweater it was only 12 dollars so
you know it's simple and this is in a
large as well because I like my sweaters
big and loose next I got one thing from
Ann Taylor Loft
and I really don't have that many
cardigans and I love them so I got this
like plummy purple colored cardigan and
then it has pockets in the front and the
buttons and it's really really really
cute so I absolutely love this and I'm
really excited to wear it then I went to
Urban Outfitters which is my favorite
store Urban Outfitters it's just my
favorite store hands down but it's
really really expensive so I'd only shop
there that often but I did get three
things so I got a purse from there and I
only really have one purse and it's
brown so I wanted a black one that I
could wear when I was wearing like black
outfits okay so it's just like this kind
of snakeskin looking material black
leather and then it just has some gold
detailing and zippers and all that stuff
scraps are short but it came with
another strap and I love this I'm so
excited about this and it's so soft next
thing I got moving Outfitters is another
sweater and it's kind of like this navy
purple color it looks more purple than
Navy but if they says it's maybe on the
tag so whatever and then the reason I
got this was actually because the elbows
it has like little elbow pad things and
this one just has like a suede kind of
hand elbow pad which I'm really excited
about because I think that's super cute
so I got this sweater okay the last
thing I got is probably my favorite
shirt that I find now I'm obsessed with
it if you guys follow me on Twitter if
you don't the link will be down below
but if you follow me on Twitter you know
obsessed with royal blue and I've said
in a few my videos so lately royal blue
favorite color to wear but anyways I
also love lace so this sure when I saw
it I was like I gotta get this so it
looks like this it's this royal blue
shirt the sleeves are like cuffed and
they're like tied there then it has like
a huge release thing down the front it's
shorter in the front and longer in the
back and then the sides also have lace
on them and this shirt is just like
amazing I'm so happy I got this and I
love this
okay next
Abercrombie kids basically you guys may
or may not know I'm only five foot one I
am tiny I was born three months early so
I've always been really small and the
only jeans that fit me well are ever
combi kids jeans in like biggest size
they have so I get 16 or 16 Slim's I
could probably fit into four teens but
those would be pretty tight so they're
my favorite jeans and I got two pairs of
those for Christmas I got one pair in
just this light wash my favorite are the
super skinnies and it's like a light
wash and it just goes all the down and I
also got them in a dark wash and I have
them in like a mix between those two
watches so I just wanted them in
different colors and then Hollister it's
kind of like Abercrombie you know same
company over the summer all I wear for
bottom's is like Hollister and
Abercrombie Schwartz because I don't
really address that fashionably in the
summer and cutoff shorts or like my
favorite things to wear and those are
the only ones that I like like that fit
me and stuff people might think they're
really short but I really like them so I
just got a pair because they were on
sale at Hollister and it looks like this
so yeah I got those ok the next place is
hmm ok so if you guys have been watching
my videos for a while and you're
watching my half of the week's you know
that me and my friends on your Fridays
we do flannel Fridays so we were like a
flannel shirt on Fridays not every
Friday every other or something but we
do that and I was kind of running out of
flannels and I love flannels they're so
comfortable and they go with like
everything so I wanted to get one of
those for Christmas so I picked this one
out and it's just like my dog Navy is
royal blue and black and looks like this
has big pockets in the front
and it's kind of like a boyfriend one
it's like the smallest size with fair
but I still pretty loose on me which I
like and yeah it's just really really
cute I really like the colors that's the
back and yeah so I got this
okay the next shirt from H&amp;amp;M I saw it
and I don't know it's not my style at
all
like at all I have been getting more
into like edgy things lately but I never
thought that I was like skulls he's like
the whole body death thing kind of
creeps me out but this shirt for some
reason I don't know I can't explain I
think you'll either love it or hate it
it's not like in-between and it kind of
reminds me of tumblr if you follow like
hipster blogs on tumblr you might I I
really liked it and my mom said she'd
give it for me so yeah okay it has like
this skull on the front it's just a tank
top but it's not a scary skull it has
like it's made out of like hearts and
flowers and it's really pretty colors
and I think this would be really cute in
the summer just over like a bathing suit
or something is like a cover-up I don't
know I really like it for some weird
reason I really like it
but yeah so it's really soft material
too so I love this
okay and the last thing from H&amp;amp;M is
actually a pair of shoes I would all of
a sudden was like obsessed with
snakeskin and all of a sudden
everything's in snakeskin so I think I
might have like guessed that trend but I
just got these shoes and they are flats
and they're snakeskin and I love them
it's really weird hmm there's shoes I'm
not really a seven but these are five so
definitely try them on before you buy
them but I love these so that's all the
clothing I got I also got a hundred
dollar gift card to TJ Maxx and
Marshalls for my grandma and my mom also
gave me fifty dollars to like a local
place where they make like sweatshirts
and stuff for my high school and they
have like they embroider that my stuff
because I don't have anything like my
high school on it so she got me that and
then also I have an also gift card for
fifty dollars from my cousin and like
her family so yeah thank you for that so
that's like all the clothing gift card
that kind of stuff now I'm gonna get
into the kind of weird random things as
my mom got me since I didn't ask for
anything it was just kind of like random
stuff but it's still cool so the first
thing if you know me you know I'm
obsessed with rice I could eat brace
every single life I can eat like white
rice
my favorite is like the sticky rice that
they uh that you get like with Chinese
takeout and stuff I just love rice and
whenever I try to make it I always
birth-name
so my mom got me this is kind of like a
joke she got me this rice cooker which
is just plain funny like you know it's a
rice cooker like but I actually tried to
do good night and the rice was like
amazing honestly get it rice cooker
because the rice is like perfect and
yeah it was good right so yay okay the
next thing I got I am so excited about
okay so it's this pillow
okay it's like flokati I think that's
what it's called and it's like really
fluffy like fur not real fur but you
know and it's so soft
and I love it I've been eyeing this at
Target for the longest time and I was a
surprise my mom got it for me so yay
thanks mommy
okay kind of going along with the pillow
stuff my mom got me this like saying
that you're bad or whatever to kind of
help you sit up and the reason for that
is I'm always sitting on my bed like on
my laptop or doing my homework so she
got me this because I like back problems
so yeah and then she also got me this
like thing to put on my bed that like
holds my laptop and stopped so I can sit
on my bed and use my laptop like sitting
up I don't know but this is also good
for doing my homework on my bed so I'm
sitting up more I guess the next thing I
got is actually my room already so I'll
show you that now okay so I got this
jewelry holder and I'm pretty sure some
target she got it for me
my mom most of this stuff is my mom and
my dad I mean my mom picked it out but
you know so I already put like rings in
it and stuff and some long earrings and
then it has like all these drawers I
wanted to go out with them and I just
put some stuff in them and it's really
cute it's fits nicely in my room and
yeah so I'm pretty sure that's all I got
for Christmas I might do a separate
video on my aunt gets me depends on what
it is but yeah I hope you guys like this
