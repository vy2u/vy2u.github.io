me what I got for Christmas video I'm
not trying to brag the only reason I'm
doing this is because I love watching
these videos and I got an overwhelming
about requests from you guys to do one
of these this year was one of the best
Christmases I've ever had my parents
were extremely generous even me it means
so much to me because as some of you
guys may know it's my last year here I'm
going college next year so it was just
kind of like sentimental be here and
this Christmas I don't know nothing I'm
not gonna be here for Christmas next
year but I just want to say I'm so
grateful for everything normally I start
off with like the stocking stuffer
things but I want to start off with
probably the most obvious gift as I'm
hoping you guys can tell so I did get a
new camera I'm filming with it right now
hopefully you guys can tell let me know
if it looks better I got the Canon Rebel
t5i and I am so grateful to get this I
needed a new camera for a long time I've
needed one for myself and obviously for
you guys and I'm just so excited to have
a new one to have better quality and the
t5i is amazing it's definitely an
investment and I'm so thankful that I
could get this business so yes
I really glad about the quality I hope
it's awesome
probably my most exciting gift moving on
to what my boyfriend got me he made me a
little Phil the bear which I thought was
super cute and it's a little baby put
him in a onesie because I always like
joke about getting him a onesie yes so
he got me that and then I'm actually
wearing the neck skip she got me it's
just a little Alex and Ani bracelet
because I love these and it has my
birthstone in it just a little purple
stone for February and that's super cute
okay moving on to stop and stuffers I
got a lot of candy because let's face it
guys I love candy I'm probably gonna
gain at least 20 pounds you know in the
next week eating all this candy I got
three of the milk chocolate oranges by
Therese and if you guys have never tried
these they're amazing you have to try
them there's literally my favorite candy
and they're so good they're only around
Christmas time so stock up I also got
one that's the Trader Joe's version and
it's dark chocolate so this is gonna be
super yummy my dad got me for little
truffles in this cute little box so
these are gonna be fantastic guys this
tree hurts so bad I got the Lindor Lynch
truffles in know chocolate I asked for
these specifically because these are
happen we don't like these I don't know
what's up with you but these are amazing
I got some travel starburst because guys
topless divers and me are like this I'm
obsessed of tropical starburst they
literally kick regular starbursts but
they're amazing I love the orange kind
the best so tell me what your favorite
is I got some Jack Link's teriyaki beef
jerky because last time I got this my
dad ate all of it
so I'm Trader Joe's peppermint hot
chocolate two nail polishes these are
the Sally Hansen gel and I actually
picked these out and they're really cool
because you don't have to use a white
and they're supposed to wax like gel
nail polish does and you just get like a
color and then the top coat so I'm
really excited to try this I'll let you
guys know how I like
next thing is just this Burt's Bees
ultra conditioning a lip balm and Leslie
stocking I got this
five pack of vos lip balm it has a nice
array of flavors and I'm excited because
I've never tried passionfruit okay out
of the stockings and onto regular gifts
I got this natural daylight in you
because I've been doing my makeup in
this Lake smudgy like crappy little like
small mirror and I saw this at Costco
and I was like oh my god this is
life-changing so I've been using this to
do eye makeup I did it today it's
honestly I'm amazing there's like a
stupid zoomed aside and it's kind of
scary you know if you're breaking our
like you look with your eyebrows but
it's amazing like I don't know how I've
ever done my makeup without this so if
you don't have one of these I definitely
recommend checking out Costco I don't
know if I've told you guys about my love
for Taco Bell but it's pretty strong so
I gotta talk about a gift card I love
Starbucks just as much as I love Taco
Bell so I got this really pretty like
teal colored tumbler and this is perfect
because I left one of mine at school
once and someone stole it like what the
heck someone stole my blur so yes I
got this really pretty water and I'm
super excited and then it came with this
cute little gift card on it which thank
you so much mom and dad and Santa
because that's awesome and it matches
the cuff so what more could you want my
favorite perfume by far as people
ahjussi it's amazing if you've never
smelled it and I read all the time
everyone it's like everyone's favorite
when I wear it so I got this little set
and it's from Target I actually picked
this out so I know how much it was but
it had like this on point 5 fluid ounce
0.174 dollars you know
and I have just the point five from
announces and it's probably like $40 and
this whole set was only like 30 33 so
it's an amazing deal I don't know if
they still have it at Target but I am
really excited so now I don't have to
like use mine so sparingly okay this
next thing makes if I see some time like
a beauty guru but I don't have good
brushes and I never had I have the most
random brushes to do my makeup with and
they're they're really cheap and crappy
so I really wanted some nice brushes so
what I got were the Sedona lace brushes
and I've heard great things about these
I heard they were very comparable to
Sigma brushes so I got the 12 piece set
here and I got the pink one so this is
what it looks like it's like every
makeup person's dream if you're looking
for something again for someone who
likes makeup or we should starting out
this is awesome and I haven't used these
yet because I want to show them in the
video but I'm so excited to use them
it's definitely gonna meet a big
difference I think when I'm doing my
makeup so I will normally only get one
Baker for Christmas it's wrong that what
happens I'll get like one big gift but
you need my camera and then I'll get
smaller things but this year was just
amazing um I got you a Becca make off
mini Mac I wanted this for I'm not lying
like for years I just never knew a color
I wanted if you guys know me in person
or power you can know my videos I love
the color maroon burgandy it's my
favorite color ever I love wearing it I
love just looking at it so when I saw
they had a burgundy mini Mac I was like
I need this in my wife and I thought
this was just gonna be one main gift for
Christmas but I ended up hitting the
camera so I'm beyond thankful but yeah
it's miss burgundy color and I'm
obsessed with it I've just been carrying
a wallet around because I don't even
have a nice bag to carry so yeah this is
amazing I don't know if it's limited
edition the color so definitely check it
out if you like it but it has just like
this nice long strap and I'm
so excited to use this the color is just
perfection and yeah okay guys I had to
save the best gift for last so the
search started about two years ago I
wanted the mousse pillow Pep of course
pillow pets stopped making the moose
pillow pet so if you really bothered it
you needed to pay like sixty dollars on
eBay and I was not about to pay $60 for
a moose pillow pet so last Christmas
past I didn't get the moose pillow path
this Christmas came look what we have
here guys this was one of the most
exciting gifts I received I'm not gonna
lie it's probably the most adorable
thing I've ever seen if you don't think
this is cute then um maybe you need
glasses
I'm obsessed it's so squishy it's
beautiful I'm I I don't have words to
describe this beautiful being and if you
want to help me name it you know leave a
name suggestion in the comments because
guys I'm obsessed so that is what I got
the Christmas this year I know it was a
lot I am once again I've probably said
this a million times but I'm so thankful
for everything I want to know what you
guys got because I love hearing that
people got and sometimes obviously not
everyone makes these videos so you guys
leave your comments in the downbar tell
me what you guys got everything I want
to hear give this video a big thumbs up
if you liked it and please please please

also you know if you want to stalk me or
whatnot my guests came and my twitter
