Christmas haul what I got for Christmas
video so to be perfectly honest I was
not going to do this video because as
you will see it's kind of gonna be short
um basically what happened was I asked
for one thing for Christmas is here I
asked for a new phone because I have the
iPhone 5 and I kind of just wanted the 6
not a necessity but I'm sick by the way
none of the city but I kind of just been
wanting like a better camera on my phone
so I asked for the 6 so basically I have
Virginia mobile as a phone service
provider I know Brandon I do and we
found out they only had the 6s in 16
gigs and I definitely even need the 64
because I have 32 now and I run out of
space so basically Virgin Mobile doesn't
have the 64 gig iPhone 6s yet so we're
just waiting for it to come out and then
I'm gonna get that for the lated
Christmas but because of that there
wasn't really much for Christmas this
year which is fine like I'm in college
now it's not like a big deal to get
gifts but yeah I still thought I'd show
you because I already had people
requesting it and I did have a few
things mostly candy but it's still fun
good show okay first I'm going to show
you what my best friend got me so first
of all she got me this really cute comfy
shirt from a rikiya which is one of my
favorite stores they have it in New York
City so I go there sometimes my G is
coming it's a purple color and it's
really loose and flowy it kind of
reminds me of the wild fox
Betty Beach jumpers just not quite as
soft but it's really comfy and this goes
off the shoulders so it looks really
cute with like the halter bro let's head
over all the time so it's really cute
one of my favorite colors and I wore
this like last night an award to bed so
it's really cute Thank You Mel and
she'll tell me one more thing which is
adorable and she put in this really cute
little box so I'm gonna show you a few
guys are new to my channel you know that
I go to college in California but I'm
from New York so my friend got me this
adorable necklace okay so hopefully it's
this focus but as you can see it says
California and just really really cute
cursive and I thought that was adorable
like that's the cutest thing ever so
thank you Mel
okay so from my aunt and uncle and
cousins first thing about me is this
pillow and it says she wants to say
she's fierce
yeah um obviously you fiercely hotshot
they know so they got me this pillow I
thought that was so cute I'm gonna bring
this to college put it on my dorm bed
because you know they see Tasha they
also got me a gift card to Lululemon
which is awesome because I love the
whole lemon I've been trying to work out
more especially because I have a gym at
my school and I'm definitely gonna buy a
jacket with that because it's a jacket
I've been eyeing in there and the last
thing about me I'm in love with if you
guys know me you know I love free people
everything and they knew that so they
got me this really cute like tunic and I
actually wore this in an Instagram photo
so I'm gonna put that here if you want
to follow me on instagram it is KC Tasha
and it starts my Twitter if you want to
follow me on that to put that be awesome
so anyways it's this really cute tunic
I love boho prints and they know so it
just looks like this really cute I love
it it's so comfy it's Chloe and once
again it looks really cute with like one
of the halter well that's who knew so
yeah I love this thank you okay and then
adore me actually gave me like a little
coupon code for like a gift for
Christmas so I ordered myself that's
really cute pajama set if you don't know
what adore me is it's basically like a
monthly subscription kind of thing for
lingerie like bras and underwear and
then they got pajamas and like
loungewear and I really like this pajama
set I thought it was really cute so I
got it for myself and the top looks like
this it's just axilla key black with
some pink lace and then I really like
the shorts they look like this that's
the back yeah they look like this and
then they have like the little pink lace
okay moving on to the stuff from my
parents get ready for lots of candy I'm
gonna gained like 20 pounds okay so I
actually picked these ones out for
myself but these another Ghirardelli
chocolate squares and I love the pop of
my broad ones if you've never tried them
you have true they're so so good so
they're not these and then I got the
dark chocolate with raspberry because
I'm obsessed with chocolate and
together so so good so I got these the
only thing I love more than chocolate
and raspberry is chocolate orange and
I'm obsessed with these if you watch my
other Christmas haul videos I'll link
them down below if you want to go watch
them I get these every year they're just
like the chocolate oranges isn't this so
good I'm obsessed with them so
definitely try these if you haven't yeah
I seem to went a little bit overboard
with the chocolate oranges so as you can
see I have four of them so homegirl is
going to gain probably like 40 pounds
at this rate so wooden chocolate-covered
potato chips from Trader Joe's very good
some miscellaneous items from chocolate
shops these are really good truffles and
I'm excited for as you can see my family
really enjoys chocolate some Starbucks
hot cocoa mix because I love Starbucks
what can I say this looks fabulous I'm
probably to make something right after
this video I got this little kit thing
with two mascaras and then eyeliners
which is great because I'm always
running out of mascara okay last but not
least I got this ornament and I'm gonna
come up close because you have to see in
the details okay so if you guys have
been following my channel or you follow
me on Twitter or even Instagram you know
that I'm obsessed with pugs and I really
really want to plug but my dad's
allergic and I'm in college now so
that's just not possible but my mom got
me this pug ornament anyway so I kind of
technically have a pug so how am I gonna
bring this to school playing in my room
and pretend I have a pug because I love
them so so much okay so that's
everything I have for this video I just
want to say I'm not trying to be like oh
my god I didn't get anything for
Christmas because honestly guys like I'm
in college my parents are paying my have
vacation like I live in California now I
have to get plane tickets all the way
back here but I'm not cheap at all so

didn't need anything for Christmas so
