so today is my annual what I got for
Christmas video I literally wasn't gonna
film this today but I decided I might as
well just get it up and out of the way
for you guys so this year I really
didn't ask for much I asked for like one
thing which you can kind of see here
because as I get older and I make my own
money I really don't feel the need to
like ask for things if I want something
I would rather buy it for myself
nevertheless I still have a few things
to show you here but as I always say in
these videos Christmas is not about just
the material items it's about family and
I'm not trying to brag or anything I
just know these videos are super super
requested every year the PJs I'm wearing
I'm so obsessed with these are from Old
Navy they literally have little cacti
all over them with the Santa hats and
I'm obsessed is this little hat it
doesn't really match but I've been super
in love with it I got it when I was in
Paris and it's really fun and yeah I
will be trying to link everything that I
show in this video down below in case
you guys want it and I will have my
social media handles down below as well
in case you guys want to follow me on
there okay so the big gift and the thing
I really really wanted this year was a
new luggage set because I have been
traveling more and I want to travel more
in the near future so I already use
these because I went to Paris so I got
these a little bit early but they're
basically the Cal pack marble luggage
this is the carry-on size but it also
came with a larger size as well I will
insert a photo but I've been getting so
many questions from you guys because I
have these like in my snapchat and stuff
at the airport and I love them so much
so nice and sturdy because they're hard
and I just love them they're super easy
to wheel around
they're so cute you can get the perfect
like airport instagrams in them but yeah
I seriously love them they don't have
them I mean they don't only have them in
the marble powder and they have them in
a bunch of different patterns and
designs so if you guys aren't into the
marble no worries but I will link the
marble ones down below they're super
super cute I'm obsessed with them
the next thing is just some underwear
from Victoria's Secret because I was
running out of underwear and they had
the cutest underwear right now I think
got it like seven for 27 so there's just
some just some undies I made somewhere
because I hate underwear lines so much I
also got some gift cards which is super
convenient the first one being an uber
gift card this is life-changing for me I
use uber everywhere all the time
at school because I don't have a car and
ubering in LA is it's super convenient
so this is gonna be perfect I also got a
Starbucks gift card sorry I had to like
hiccup there a Starbucks gift card which
is also awesome being a college student
I coffee all the time obviously what is
that noise the stupid Bluetooth thing is
making weird noises so yeah I have this
comment on below what your favorite
Starbucks drink is because I'm always
looking to try new drinks so yeah and
then lastly I got a movie gift card this
is nice
I love Gordon the movies especially
because movie theater popcorn like I
will literally want movie theater
popcorn and I'll go to the movies
specifically to have that and I'm also
just got in the movies and just bought
popcorn and left I also got some socks
I'm really picky about the socks that I
wear so these are just black little
ankle socks these are the ones that I
wear like all the time they're not a
specific brand or anything but I swear
my socks go missing
like crazy like if there's one thing I
lose the most its socks like I can wear
them once and then they just disappear
or I'll only have one so I always need
even your socks and I feel like people
always joke about like not wanting socks
for Christmas like socks and underwear
but like Here I am this is what I wanted
I also got this little ring my dad's
friend owns a jewelry store
he also made me this ring to put in
between these puppies but yeah I'll put
his Instagram down below because if you
guys want to follow him I'm sure he
would love that but it's just really
pretty like pink sapphire ring and I
think the color is so so cute so I love
this and I always love like stacking my
rings don't mind my one nubby now it's
like ignore that but yeah the last few
things are gifts from my friends at DOS
shopping they're the best
okay first are these super dope platform
sneakers I have them in white and I wear
them all the time
but I really really love them in black I
think I might even like the black ones
more so they're just these platform
sneakers people always ask me what these
are when I'm wearing them and I love
them I think they're really comfortable
and the platform is really cute I love
any platform shoes right now and yeah
these go with everything like I said I'm
a fan of the white and the black
basically all colors that they have I
think they're really really cute so yeah
thanks dope for these they're the cutest
and then they also gave me this super
cozy warm like Sherpa coat this is from
Urban Outfitters I believe it's really
like cozy I was just wearing this
because it's so cold in my house but
yeah this is so cozy it's really big
this is a small and it is like pretty
big on me so keep that in mind but I
like it that way so I can layer it and
look super cozy so these are really
popular right now just like these bear
coats these Sherpa coats and I like the
black ones because they match the most
of the stuff that I have okay and the
very last thing is something that I
bought myself
Merry Christmas to myself it's from
brandy melville I just got this little
oxford t-shirt I do know someone that
goes there so I'm not a total poser
but I was envisioning this with like a
little gingham miniskirt that I have and
either like mice to progress Nico's or
maybe some over-the-knee boots I think
it would look really really cute maybe
with like a black little denim jacket -
yeah I just really really like this it's
kind of cropped not too cropped but
nevertheless really cute I got this when
I was in peri
oh and I cannot forget like every year I
got some candy my favorites being sour
gummy worms I don't think I'll ever be
too old for these they're like the best
ever
some Andy's chocolate mints amazing
that's okay I need as always but it's
always welcome yeah so that's everything
I have to show you guys in this video
I'm super excited about everything
especially the luggage I love it so much
it's like my child comment down below
and let me what your let me
can't even see let me know what you guys
got for Christmas or any holiday that
you celebrate I know not everyone
