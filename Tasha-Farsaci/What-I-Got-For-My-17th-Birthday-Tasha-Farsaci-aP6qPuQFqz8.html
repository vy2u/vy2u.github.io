17th of February and I decided I would
show you guys the stuff that I received
for my birthday these are things for my
friends and my parents and I didn't
really ask for anything in April I'm
going to California to look at colleges
so that's obviously a huge present for
me considering I live in New York so
that's like big for my parents so I just
asked for a few things and I'm going to
show you first thing I got one of these
pair of grey fans because I have a pair
of maroon bands and I really like them
so I wanted these gray ones and I don't
know the exact color but I know they're
the ones with like the black hold over
it things so yeah I really like these
and I recommend getting us half size
down because I have my true size and
then rune and they're too big so I got a
have Suns down in these and they you
guys might know those earrings that I
wear all the time that look like these
ones I wear them in like everybody else
you guys probably know the ones and I
lost them I lost one of them cuz I never
wore backings and that was really
upsetting because I got them at like
some weird random balance noise so my
parents found very similar ones online
and they're pretty similar if you know
the other ones so yeah that was exciting
because I was so sad to lose my other
ones oh I also got another Alex and Ani
bracelet it is this one and silver and I
think it's like called the path of life
or something I have this other one and
it's the tree one but I just wanted a
silver one and I like how they look like
stacked so yeah some chocolates that's
what happens when my birthday is really
close to Valentine's Day I actually got
a new tripod which I am filming on right
now because I have gone through like
three tripods they've all broken and
this one is hardcore heavy duty I would
show you but it's you know
use a pill moment so I got a tripod I
got an aux cord for my car well my
parents car that I shared because I have
my license now if you guys I don't know
if I told you guys or not but I got an
aux cord so I can play stuff from my
phone but I ended up getting one that
doesn't work with my car so yeah well my
best friend's Mackenzie got me this
super super pretty
like kimono thing and we have the same
style so I knew she would get me
something awesome and it's impacts on
and it's black and it just has some like
white detailing on it I don't know it's
so cute and this is such a my style so
yeah thank you my friends um like
Pittston together and got me Taco Bell
gift card a which if you know me I love
Taco Bell so this is uh this is a great
gift and they got me money two packs on
because that's like going my favorite
stores my friend Matt I got a bunch of
sour gummy worms because you guys might
know from like my what I got from
Christmas that we always give each other
these they're the target ones and
they're the best ones and I've already
opened like a pack of em so she'll be a
Starbucks gift card because I'm a basic
white girl so that explains anything she
got you some gum and then she got me two
Essie nail polishes because I love nail
polish they look like this
this one is it's genius and this one is
resort fling la la so that also Maddy
thank you so much is what I got so far
but I did order some stuff myself from
Toby so I guess I'll just show you that
stuff everything is always so wrinkly
when I get it from there and I also
think this is inside
no okay so everything was 50% off which
is great so it's just this cream shirt
and at like the elbows it has crochet
and then like flares out this is so
wrinkly so yeah but it's really cute and
I really like this along with that same
color scheme I got a cropped kind of
cream sweater because I really wanted a
cropped sweater so it looks like this
and until I saw and this would be really
cute with over dresses or with like
skirts and stuff so I ordered another
shirt from Toby but it went out of stock
I guess when they tried to ship it to me
so to make up for that they send me this
like necklace for free and it says love
on it and cursive can you even see that
it's probably not booboo those are
things I got from my 17th birthday I'm
very thankful it is awesome I'm
surrounded by great people in my life so
