before I even get into an intro I'm so
sorry about the lighting I have been so
unbelievably crazy busy I haven't had
time to breathe let alone film so
clearly it is nighttime right now and I
don't have the best lighting in my room
I need to get better lighting so I'm
really sorry about that
anyways this video is going to be the
long-awaited sorority recruitment
sorority brush outfits video these are
the outfits that I wore when I was going
through the crewmen and guys this video
almost didn't happen I literally almost
dropped out of procurement it was not an
easy experience for me if you guys want
a video of me talking about like what
happened because some shit went down
people yeah let me know so anyways this
video almost didn't happen but here we
are the clips are kind of short I was
pretty rushed every day and I was like
really sweating whatever but basically
the first two days we just wore a
t-shirt that Panhellenic provided us and
we could style it however we wanted and
whatnot and then basically the other
days the outfits just increased it like
dress enos every day so yeah we
definitely have a strict dress code or
whatnot
basically whatever we wanted just like a
little bit nicer each day and I do
attend the University of Southern
California USC and I was a junior this
year in case you guys are wondering if
you want to know anything else about me
or you wanna like stop me or whatnot
I'll put my Instagram on the screen and
all my other social media handles down
below okay I'm gonna stop blabbing and
let's get on to the outfits okay so this
is the shirt I was talking about that I
had to wear but I actually think it's
super to you and it's really soft
I just paired it with a black bralette
and some necklaces and then I wore my
black ripped skinny jeans and some
little black mules that are actually so
cute and comfy I will be linking as much
as I can down below I just wore some
rings and then here's me showing my face
because I never do that in outfit videos
here I'm wearing a super cute wrap style
dress from princess Polly I love this
one so so much and then same
same necklace and then these little gray
sandal things by Steve Madden super
great for rush in my opinion this day
I'm wearing this for loving lemons dress
one of my faves I think it's so adorable
I love it and then I'm wearing those
same that same necklace and then those
same little sandal cheering so I'm Steve
Madden okay this was the last day and I
was so sweaty this is after everything
was over no bra whatever I took my shoes
off because my feet hurt so bad the
dress is by lovers and friends and then
