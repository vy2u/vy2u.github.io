video I know I've been doing so many
college videos and I feel like my
channel is turning into like half of a
college channel but I just keep getting
more and more requests for college oh so
you guys seem to like them I know
they're helping a lot of people out
because I do know a lot of youtubers
don't go to college so I feel like I
kind of have some insight that a lot of
other people on YouTube don't today I'm
going to be doing what not to do at
college parties because over this summer
I did a what to wear to college parties
I did a what not to bring to college so
I kind of like combined them and I
thought this would be helpful because I
know at least when I was in a freshman
going into college or even now it's like
what do you do what what's a college
party like what what do you do I do know
that not everyone goes to parties in
college I know that not everyone drinks
alcohol or does whatever else you know a
party's so I know this might not apply
to everyone but I really wanted to do
this video just to kind of like look out
for you guys because you know college
parties can be potentially dangerous or
just you know you can get yourself in
some sticky situations and I consider
you guys my friends and you know I want
to look out for you guys this video is I
don't mean saying like you can't do this
at a pro tier
don't do this like I'm not trying to
like neg you I'm just giving you you
know my point of view all these things
have either occurred to me or I've seen
them occur to other people so I I can
you know I'm pretty sure I can say like
oh these probably are the best things if
you knew my channel and you don't know
anything about me I go to USC the
University of Southern California I'm a
sophomore but I did transfer from LMU so
I have videos explaining my whole
experience college all that stuff like
why I transferred I'm going to link them
down below and you guys aren't
me on social media you totally should I
think I'm the most active on Instagram I
post a lot of stuff like about my
personal life you know it's not just
like oh I posted a video it's like hey
this was me a party last night um so
yeah if you guys want to follow me that
would be so awesome seriously would mean
the world to me and then my snapchat and
Twitter it's still like super personal
just what I'm doing on the day-to-day
okay that was a lot of talking I'm just
going to get into it now what not to do
at college parties I wanted to start off
with the one that I wanted to emphasize
me most it is do not leave your friends
so I know that you probably have no
intention of leaving your friends at
Brody's um but if you're like standing
there and a guy like that you like or
something like pulls you away and you
leave your friend there alone oh I feel
like this whole video I'm making all
these sounds like this has happened to
me I have been laughing a party and it's
one thing if you leave your friends with
other friends but if you meet them alone
that's just it's so bad I know you
called me in the moment like do not mean
to you or you're drinking you don't even
realize but that may be dangerous to
your friend depending on what state
they're in and also they'll just feel
like super awkward I know like when I
was left at the party once luckily I was
not drinking so I just heard myself home
but it's just super uncomfortable if
you're alone in the party you don't know
anyone you're walking around if you feel
like going to a party where you're going
to meet up with someone else or leave
the group that you're going with make
sure you're going with a bigger group so
that you're not not leaving someone
alone in the group kind of going off of
that one
I wouldn't go to parties alone I don't
particularly know anyone that does
frequently go to parties alone I've
definitely gone alone and like met up
with people there but in terms of just
going alone I wouldn't do that
um you know you want to try and least go
with a group of people look out for each
because if you're alone you know weird
things can happen and you just don't
want to be in a bad situation okay the
next thing is if you do plan on drinking
at parties do not take a drink from
someone that you don't know that you
didn't get what you didn't see get
poured I don't know I feel like it's
such an easier way to say that you guys
know what I'm saying like this one is
super popular you hear this all the time
like don't get a drink from someone that
you don't know what's in it or what not
obviously if it's like your best friend
like okay that's a little bit different
but if some random ass frat boy hands
you a Red Solo cups like woo like girl
home girls don't don't drink that uh
yeah I mean date rape and putting stuff
in drinks is talked about a lot and it
actually does happen frequently like it
happens a lot it's not just like
something people say to scare you like
that does happen so you need to be
careful and especially if you're already
drunk like I know your party's gonna be
like oh yeah we more but you really need
to watch out for that okay the next
thing is don't wear anything that you
care too much about I have a whole video
on what to wear to college parties I
will link that down below but basically
most college parties are dirty I'm
pretty sure every cardiac wanted this
year someone thought it was a great idea
to you know shake up a four loko and
spray in the cloud like yeah great I
really I did my hair to get four loko in
it that's what I wanted don't wear your
like $300 cute booties because you're
going to get strange substances spilled
on them or someone's going to like drop
a cigarette on you like honestly I were
a cute close the parties but I'll get my
clothes from like forever 21 or someone
like cheap so I can still look cute and
feel confident in what I'm wearing is
going along with that one is don't bring
valuables and don't bring like your
wallet or your credit cards if you do
it's really smart to get one of those
things back your phone I don't have one
I'm such a hypocrite okay I really need
to get one I'm just like oh my phone
case looks so cute I don't want to stick
something on it but you should get one
they're like little sticky things and
you can put your cards in it that's
perfect for having your like student ID
maybe like one credit card I wouldn't
bring too much money because you could
lose stuff literally last year at a
party I lost my school ID and it was
found two weeks later shoved up behind a
poster so you probably won't get things
back that you lose at parties okay this
next one is don't drink too too too much
so you puke okay obviously this is like
an obvious one and no one is like going
into the night being like oh yeah like I
want to peel tonight like no no one
wants that but basically I'm just saying
like watch what you're drinking you
don't want to be that girl that's like
unconscious at the party and you really
don't want to be that girl that's in the
grimy gross bathroom puking like Oh
first of all that's just foul that's so
gross like those bathrooms are so gross
I don't even want to like look at the
toilet let alone might have to be in
there for more than like five seconds
obviously I know that everyone has those
nights you know it's gonna happen to
everyone
everybody has those days
literally the other night this girl
wandered up to you at a party so so
drunk her friends had left her and I go
to the bathroom with her and she's just
throwing up weight I'd never met this
girl in my life and I literally just
like walked her back to her apartment to
sleep like I don't know what she
would've done and she was alone like
that's just so scary just don't be that
girl okay is the next thing I have is
don't go home with a guy or anyone for
that matter without telling your friends
they might be looking for you they might
be worried about you you know just tell
someone where you're going plus if you
end up going to someone's apartment or
doing or whatever and they're like a
sketchball you want your friends to know
where you are you know okay my last tip
for this video is don't forget what you
are or don't forget to find out where
you are I know sometimes you'll be like
party hopping or you're just like hop in
an uber to go to the next party or
something and you won't even know where
you're going and I I mean I guess I know
you can like pull out your phone and
zoom in and find your dress or send your
location or whatever but I think it's
important to know where you actually are
like whether it's a dress or like I'm a
tall like Sigma Chi but a little bit
like whatever frat you're at or sports
house you're at just know where you are
because if someone asks you if you need
to get picked up if you're in trouble
like if your friend wants to come meet
you just know where you are honestly I
don't even know if these tips were
helpful I feel like they were super
obvious but maybe that's just because
I've been in college and I've seen all
this stuff happened I just like no but I
hope this helped you guys out I really
just want you guys to look out for
yourselves and be safe because I care
about all of you so much and I've just
seen so many bad things go down to
parties and I do
about to be you if you are sick of my
college videos I will be doing more
videos I'm planning on doing a haul and
some other stuff but yeah right now this
is a hype though I hope you guys liked
it once again hope it helps you out if
you did like it please give this video a
thumbs up and leave me a comment down
below because I love reading your
comments I love hearing your feedback
also if you are in college or you're
going to college or you want to go to
college let me know where you go or
where you want to go I'm super
interested to hear ok I love you guys so
much and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
