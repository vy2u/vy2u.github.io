bring to college video because I
recently did a what not to bring a
college video and it actually got a lot
of views and a lot of you guys were like
oh my god doing what to bring to college
video which I was actually planning on
doing anyway so here I am today filming
that before I get on into the video yes
I am wearing colored contacts if you're
in my channel you probably didn't even
notice but yeah I'm one green contacts
and I accidentally got circle lenses
which means the diameter is bigger so I
don't know if I look good or if I look
like a reptile but yeah I'm wearing them
I just think they're fun to kind of like
switch up once in a while
so before I start if you are not
subscribed my channel please subscribe
it would mean the world to me and it
just takes one little click and if you
want to follow me on social media to
keep up with my wife I'm gonna put them
right here as well as in the description
box okay so just to do a little
disclaimer like I did in my last video I
know there's gonna be someone for
everything on this list who is going to
say oh you don't need that for college
like I never needed that I have that I
never use it I know everyone's going to
disagree with me and if you do want to
comment something about how you disagree
with me just please try and say it
nicely I don't like having good comments
or negativity in my comment sections so
if you do disagree with something that I
say feel free to voice your opinion but
just try not to be rude and like
abrasive about it so the things I lists
are not going to be the obvious things
to bring to college like a laptop and
bedding and stuff like that these are
going to be the things that you might
not have thought about so yeah obviously
there are other things that you have to
bring but these are just the things that
a lot of people would forget or possibly
not know to bring also these apply to
people who are living on campus in a
dorm room type setting a lot of people
were commenting well this doesn't apply
me like I commute this college and
that's like not what this video is
really for these are for people who are
living on campus and living in your like
typical dorm setting
okay the first thing that I would say is
mandatory to bring to college our Tide
Pods so it's hype odds are are there
like a little like squishy pod that you
throw in your washer to do your laundry
and I use these they are so much easier
than lugging around a big thing of
laundry detergent honestly like everyone
uses pods are the best thing ever
they're like really cute and squishy and
they smell good
and honestly I just 100% recommend pods
over carrying around your big thing of
detergent anywhere everywhere they don't
spill and I just think they're super
handy and great for college the next
thing that I would bring is you go
wrinkle remover spray or a mini steamer
I had a mini steamer but my friends had
a wrinkle remover spray basically
something to remove the wrinkles in your
clothes because who wants to bring it I
own an iron ironing board to college not
me and honestly the mini steamer worked
wonders my roommate and I showed it and
we both used it all the time I guess
this next thing depends on where you go
to school but for me I go to school in
LA I go to Loyola Marymount University
and we do not have air conditioning in
the dorm rooms so when you're moving in
it was close to 100 degrees and it was
like that for probably the first two
months of school so it was so hot so you
need to bring a fan to school I mean I
think for most colleges it'll probably
be hot you know in the beginning of the
year and if you have air conditioning
this probably isn't really necessary but
if you don't bring a fan bring a nice
high-powered fan you're gonna need it it
was so hot it was like impossible to
sleep without a fan so yes I definitely
recommended bringing some sort of fan to
college
this thing that I would bring is room
spray so most college dorm rooms do not
allow candles i smoke a candle in don't
tell anyone but you know if you a strict
RA you're probably not gonna want to do
that so just bring room spray you can
get it at Bath &amp;amp; Body Works that's where
I got mine and you know just spritz
around I wouldn't really spray two guys
dorms because they smelled horrendous I
would spray it in my own room honestly
room sprays great because it's not a
fire hazard but it's still keeping your
room smelling fresh and not moldy like
it probably is okay the next thing I did
not bring to college but I wish I did I
know friends that brought it and I
really needed one it's a drying rack so
basically I did not dry a lot of my
clothes because they shrink or it's a
material that really shrinks like I
don't dry blue lemon or some jeans or
just certain materials in the dryer so
my clothes are soaking wet and I had
ended up like hanging them on my bed
posts hanging them all in my room and it
would have been so much easier to just
have a little mini drying rack I know
they sell them at IKEA and probably like
Target and stuff like that okay the next
thing our plastic utensils slash paper
plates so this includes you know plastic
forks knives spoons and then paper
plates and bowls and cups and all that
stuff because there was a lot of times
where I wouldn't want to eat in the
dining hall or even I bring back food
from the dining hall or I'd make food in
my room and I really needed Forks and
stuff and we didn't have any so my mom
and I bought a huge bulk thing of like
plastic utensils and it was so helpful
the same goes for bold and stuff if we
wanted cereal or I have like fried rice
in our freezer like stuff like that it
was really handy just have like a paper
bowl or a paper plate so I totally
recommend having those rather than like
actual silverware like metal spoon
and my porcelain or whatever plates
because then you have to wash them
that's really a hassle I honestly think
as a college student without a kitchen
in your room you know it's just easier
to have disposable utensils the next
thing that I would recommend bringing is
for all my fellow lazy people out there
it is a extra set of sheets so like I
said in the beginning of the school year
it was so hot but I never even slept
under my covers so my sheets really more
dirty for a while but it got to the
point where they were on my bed for a
long time so I had to wash them and I
was really lazy and I didn't want to
watch them so luckily I had brought
another pair of sheets or another set of
sheets so I just kind of switch them out
I did end up washing them obviously but
at that point it was just so much easier
to just put on another set while I was
washing and drying the other ones and I
didn't have to you know like have one
set and wash them and drive and put them
back on it was just easier to have an
extra set so you know if you're lazy
like me that's a good option the next
thing that I would bring to college is
medicine I'm not talking drugs ladies
and gents I'm talking advil nyquil
emergency because you're going to get
sick in college I was so sick this year
like I was more sick in my freshman year
of college and I have been in like last
ten years I had strep throat I had like
a constant cough it was really bad so
seriously I lived off of Advil and
emergency / airborne those types of
things and then you know you can always
use nyquil because there was times when
I have such a bad cold I was dying so
definitely stock up on those things
bring them to college I think it's
really important to have a comfortable
dorm room in order to adjust well to
college you want to feel like safe and
comfortable and at home so I think a
mattress pad is something that is really
helpful because let me tell you doing
beds are not comfortable without a
mattress pad I got you know mattress
topper it's just like you know a squishy
thing you put on top your mattress
before you make your bed and such and
make sure that more comfortable because
dorm beds are about as comfortable as a
brick so mattress pad I think I got mine
at Bed Bath and Beyond or something like
that you can get them anywhere just make
sure you get a twin extra long because
that's the size of most doing embeds the
next thing that I would bring to college
are earplugs so for me I'm a very very
light sleeper
someone can look at me and I wake up is
anyone else like this like literally
someone can be staring at me and I feel
like I sense it and I wake up so anyways
I'm a really light sleeper and letting
other roommate I love my roommate don't
get me wrong but living with a roommate
you know I would wake up at the
slightest things I would wake up from
her alarm so I did write your plugs a
lot of times when I don't have an alarm
set and they're just really handy even
if you're studying in your room or
studying anywhere and you just wanted to
be quiet I definitely recommend your
plugs because you will find that in
college it's really hard to get alone
time um I mean the library is always
good and quiet but if you don't want to
be in the library
there's always going to be people around
you so I definitely recommend getting a
nice pair of earplugs okay and the last
thing that I'm going to mention today in
this video are power strips so basically
those long things with different outlet
plugs in it I probably sound so stupid
right now but I know I had one that was
bendable I think I got it at Christmas
tree shops or something I when I was
bendable and that's honestly a life
saver you need that if you want to plug
in a bunch of different things because
most dorm rooms honestly don't have that
many plugs so you definitely gonna need
like power strips and extension cords
and all that
I had my dad set that up because I
didn't know how but it was a lifesaver
especially if you want your dorm to look
cute and have string lights and all that
stuff like don't forget to get extension
cords and power strips okay so that was
everything that I wanted to put in this
video today like I said there are so
many more things that you should
probably bring to college but I just
didn't have time to list all of them in
this video so if you have
recommendations once again just leave
them in the comments and you can help
other people out if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up so I know you
liked it and if you have any more video
requests please leave them in the
comments because I'm trying to film a
lot of videos this summer thank you guys
so much for watching and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
