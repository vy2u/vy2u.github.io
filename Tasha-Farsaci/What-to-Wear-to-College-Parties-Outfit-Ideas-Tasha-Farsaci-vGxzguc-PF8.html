video that was a very real question from
a lot of you and something that I
thought would be helpful if you guys are
new to my channel feel free to subscribe
but basically I am a college student
last year I attend a Loyola Marymount
University and this year I'm
transferring and I'm going to be a
student at the University of Southern
California so if you guys are in college
or if you have been familiar with
college you know one of the big parts of
college is college parties and going out
in college I understand that not
everyone wants to go out or likes going
to parties or even plans on going to
parties in college but I know a lot of
people do and I've been getting tons of
questions asking me what you should wear
to a college party or what everyone else
wears to college parties so I know that
everyone has different styles and every
school is different and everyone feels
comfortable in different types of
outfits but I thought I'd show you what
I wear when I go out in college or what
I've seen lots of other people wearing
because I've gone to parties and a bunch
of different schools not only the
schools I was attending but I go to
other schools or I'd be visiting friends
and I go out with them so I've kind of
got to see what a lot of people wear or
you know just kind of test out new
things that I like wearing but like I
said you can totally tweak this to what
you feel comfortable wearing or what
your school people like wearing or just
what fits your personal style these are
just the things that I have that I like
wearing or kind of things that I see a
lot of people wearing a lot of college
parties are themed so it's kind of
easier to pick out and all the wonders
are themed but these outfits are for
parties that do not have a theme okay I
only know how I'm going to set this
video up but I do want to start out with
shoes because shoes on one thing that I
love buying but it's really difficult to
pick what shoes are going to wear when
you go out because at least for the
college's I've gone to no one really
wears heels and you can kind of
guarantee that your shoe is going to get
ruined or very dirty
not only from just walking in dirt and
mud bucketing like beerus told on them
you're not going to want to wear your
really nice cute expensive shoes and i
know you want to because you want to
look cute but they're going to get
destroyed so unless you want to destroy
your nice expensive shoes I would
recommend sticking
a few pairs like this so I know most
classic college party shoes are just
some converse any type of sneaker is
great and what I want to say about these
is if you wear your white converse like
every day you know with cute outfits I
would not recommend wearing them to a
college party if you have any money to
spare I would totally recommend going
and buying another pair of your favorite
shoes and having one pair for you know
going out and going to parties and stuff
and one pair for just normal youth
because they will get really dirty and
you don't want your nice pair getting
really dirty so if you do have the money
to spare I totally recommend going
getting a separate pair but you know
white converse go with everything this
is what I see everyone wearing to
parties you know you go converse or
something that I've been liking lately
is just adidas superstars you know once
again they're a little bit pricey but
not super expensive so that if you do
have the money to spare once again and
you buy one pair for just wearing one
pair for parties or if you don't mind
cleaning them honestly superstars are
cute they go with lots of outfits and
they're comfortable they're closed-toe
so no one's stepping on your feet you
know white is not the best but white
goes with everything so yeah I just
think a nice pair of comfortable kind of
cue sneakers is something that you
totally need for me a lot of the outfits
that I ended up wearing out looked
really cute with black please and I have
really nice pairs and like Steve Madden
and stuff but I don't want to wear those
to parties you know for obvious reasons
so if you're like me and like wearing
black booties or any color booties with
outfits I would recommend getting a more
expensive pair that aren't real weather
that you'd only mind if they get beat up
and you kind of wear them for parties so
I think this pair is from boohoo comm
they're not real leather they're still
nice and cute but I don't really care if
they get stuff so long you know so I
would wear these to parties so my
outfits can still look cute but I'm not
destroying you know like hundreds
dollars of pairs of shoes I would
recommend getting a cheaper pair go to
like forever 21 or something like that
and you're all set okay so those are the
shoes I'm going to be styling all these
outfits for and those are the shoes that
I think are most commonly worn to
college parties it leads to where I have
been I know some people in comments on
my other video
I said they were heels to college
parties but none of the college parties
that I've been to have been like heels
appropriate like no one was wearing
heels so this is just what I've seen a
lot of obviously what you're wearing
depends on the weather you go to school
for so I think I have a few picked out
but kind of you can tweak for weather I
go to school in LA so it's pretty nice
out most of the time but I know if you
go to school somewhere where it snows
these are probably not going to work for
the wintertime so the first outfit that
I have for you it's just like you know
what basic I have a pair of high-waisted
jeans my favorite ones are from Topshop
I totally recommend them these are the
Janie jeans they're high-waisted and
then they're like
ankle length which i think is really
cute so these are just a nice basic pair
of jeans that they do have a rip in the
knee I prefer wearing jeans with like a
little grip so I think if you wear just
a nice pair of high-waisted jeans with a
crop top I love wearing crop tops if you
don't you can just wear a normal top it
doesn't matter but I do see lots of
people wearing high-waisted jeans and
crop tops so this is just the one I
picked out this one's from Topshop as
well but anything you have any sort of
crop top of jeans is perfect but yeah
crop top jeans perfect combo okay the
next outfit is kind of like the first
one but this is shorts so I know the
beginning of the school year last year
for me was so hot you could not wear
pants so just a nice pair of
high-waisted rip shorts I prefer high
rise but you know if you don't whatever
you want just these are just some Levi's
distressed black shorts and then I have
this really cute kind of crop top it's
just black and white stripes you can't
really see it ah it kind of crosses in
the front you'll see when I try it on
put this with you the black booties or
you know some white sneakers or whatever
kind of sneakers is really cute and I
think this would be great for a party
okay moving on if you like to be a
little bit dressier this is something
I'd wear if I want to look a little
nicer so I have another pair of jeans
from Topshop except these ones aren't
black and they have the same rips in the
knees super popular right now I really
like it I think it makes it a little
more casual so if you want to be more
dressy just go without the rips but once
again to the Jamie jeans there
I rise in this top I called my classic
party top because I would wear this when
I did not know what to wear I would wear
this because it's kind of like a nicer
top but it's not you know super dressy I
have this in three colors so it looks
like this it's just kind of like a baby
doll top but it goes kind of low-cut
this is good if you have boobs because
you can like show them off if you want
for the party and it's also but if you
don't have boobs cuz it's cute I'm not
boobs but I still thought it was so cute
so just this with some jeans is adorable
I got this from angle and I have it in
this burgundy color I have in black and
white so it's a classic for me I just
recommend you know like a nice dressier
top maybe some black jeans it's always a
good thing as well again if you want to
be a little dressier for parties I love
wearing skirts so I would wear like the
top I'm wearing right now which is from
Free People tucked in to this skirt I
like this curve because it's not super
tight but it's still really cute so I
could like breathe in it and like squat
down and not worry about it like popping
off me this one is from Paso and it's
just like a black denim kind of a line
skirt I think it's really cute and with
like a nice tight top like this or
you're gonna body sue this would look so
cute okay and the last kind of outfit
tip that I want to show you is a flannel
so sometimes you know it's cold outside
but when you get to the party it's super
hot so I would recommend getting you
know a pair of denim shorts or a pair of
jeans and just like a basic top I like
crop tops because I wear a lot of high
waisted bottoms so this one is just a
black halter crop top I think it's from
garage or something like that but I
would wear this with you know some jean
shorts or jeans and then you can put the
flannel on you know while you're walking
to the party and if it gets too hot you
can just tie it around your waist I
think it's a great option because not
only does it look cute but it's really
practical and yeah this final is drifted
I got this from a thrift store I
1,000,000%
recommend going to a thrift store to
find flannels because they're so
expensive in stores and I prefer
oversized flannels so I'll going to the
men's section and get really cute
flannels for like three
it's like I got this one in the men's
section for like three bucks it's so
cute and you can probably find some
there your school colors okay so I hope
you guys found this video helpful I know
it's not the same for every school like
I said before some of you guys might
like wearing dresses and stuff to
parties I personally don't I normally
stick to like a pant top combo combo
combo what am I saying yeah but if you
guys want to recommend more outfit ideas
for people totally leave them in the
comments below because that'd be helpful
for everyone else if you're not
following my social media accounts I'm
gonna put them right here totally follow

soon like two weeks so you guys could
