a what's in my backpack video exciting
right I'm I actually got a request on my
last video to do this and it got a bunch
of thumbs up so I decided why not I'm
not one of those people that has really
interesting stuff my backpack
I don't bring makeup to school or
anything fancy but yeah I decided I'd do
this video anyways this is my backpack
umm it's from brandy melville you might
have seen it in my school haul thing in
the beginning of the year um it's pretty
big again but I stuff it pretty full it
doesn't look very cute because I put so
much stuff in it I don't know if I
really recommend it just because this is
what happened in the bottom umm the
fabric like completely wore off and I'm
not even that rough with this so I
really no but um I'm pretty sure this
was like fifty five dollars at brandy
Melville I don't really think it's worth
it but it's really cute it just has this
floral print and then a leather flap and
the little handles or whatever so yeah I
got this a while ago like over the
summer but I think you can probably
still get it online so pretty much this
has this one flap right here and then
another pocket down here and then it's
just like a big sack on the inside um
I'm not one of those people I don't
understand how people buy like tiny
backpacks and use that like I actually
use my backpack I put binders and stuff
in it so I don't get how people fit it
obviously this is not everything that I
am my book so everything like I have
tons of books I made most of them in my
locker so what's in here kind of changes
everyday but yeah whatever
once again this is probably not gonna be
very interesting but we will see so I'm
gonna start off with this like top flap
so first thing I have is my phone I have
the iPhone 4s and I'm really wishing
about black like I kind of got the white
now but I have the white and then I just
have this Galaxy case from Urban
Outfitters and yeah that is my phone and
then I just have the headphones that
came with my phone in here because I
always listen to music on the boss and
stuff and then I have a pack of gum this
is trident original flavor
my friend got this for me for Christmas
and I just whipped it out so shout out
to Madi thanks for the gum yeah the last
thing I have okay this is kind of weird
but I'm in chemistry and my future is
really funny so in class we had to make
like we didn't have to but one day we
just made mole pencils and if you're in
Cabul know about mole is it's like a
unit of measurement
it's like 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd 6.0
to 6 whenever you one of those so if she
made us pencils would like these little
pom-pom moles on them yeah and today we
had a test and if we like brought these
and we got extra points or something
yeah that's why I have this moving down
to the bottom pocket down there little
one I'm pretty sure I just have like
pads in here yeah dad that's all I got
in there you guys know what they look
like probably so yeah we're gonna leave
those in there
okay now opening my bag I have my
lunchbox
it doesn't really have anything in air
right now because I am kicked out but I
have the Vera Bradley this print I don't
really know I'm not a huge Vera Bradley
fan I don't know the name of the print I
kind of just have this because it's hard
to find cute lunchboxes and I do not buy
the school lunch because it's not even
food next I have my mug I drink coffee
every morning my mom makes me like
french vanilla or whatever and I spring
it in this and I didn't even finish it
this morning but yeah I really like this
I got her from Target I think it's
really like just classy I guess classy
that makes no sense but kind of have
some dents in it because I kind of drop
it all the time but yeah I really like
this little mug thing I don't know why
our teachers let us like with my school
in general I have no idea why I like
kids bring in like just things to drink
because I'm pretty sure half my school
probably spikes there's like come on not
me but just saying okay now for my
actual books I have my agenda that has
my name on it so I'm gonna cover the
front but it's just like this teal color
then on the inside it looks like this
and stuff and let's see what homework I
have today shall we hmm
lots and lots of homework mekka well
yeah so I use my agenda I used to never
use agendas and I do not know how I did
that because now I have so much homework
and I always forget what I have so I
definitely recommend getting one of
these I hope you didn't just see my name
next I have my everything full room um
we're not really supposed to have and
everything folder it's basically where I
throw all my homework slash things that
aren't hole punched because yeah so I
don't know how long it's been since I
seen this thing out I really am not
organized I know I should be I try to be
it just doesn't work so I try and like
fill this as much as I can until it rips
and then I get a new folder but yeah a
pet peeve when teachers tell me to get
binders and then they don't even hole
punch them so I have to like throw a
magnet something like this
okay today I had Spanish homework so I
brought home my Spanish binder I'm in
Spanish 3 and I really don't like it but
I'm gonna take it up to Spanish 5
because in my senior year when I'm in
Spanish 5 I can go to Spain which is
really exciting
uh-huh so that's why I'm taking it plus
it was a food unit or a cooking unit or
something and I liked my food so yeah um
Spanish binder okay then I have my
little pencil pouch case thingy in the
front I just have I'm going to
mechanical pencil I always use pencil
like I cannot write in pen I don't know
why and then a little soft lips
chapstick and then inside I have my
graphing calculator oh yeah I got pink
obviously yeah this huge calculator I
have a pass that I got today because
basically when I'm walking in the
hallway teachers actually don't ask you
for your pass if you see them if they
see you like holding one they don't even
ask
so basically I didn't really fill this
one out it's kind of blank and I just
felt like a key on it and I'm gonna
carry this around if I ever want to be
like to class then I have what is this
oh wow
a nice stained schedule beautiful that's
just good look at that
what and then I have a crapload of pens
because I hate pens and I don't use them
okay then I have a book that I'm reading
for English we didn't get to choose it
my English teacher chose it and it's
falling leaves by Ed Elaine yanma and
it's like an autobiography about a
Chinese girl and at first when I got
this I wanted to like jump off a cliff
like it sounds awful but I am like this
far through it and it's actually really
good it kind of gets me a little
emotional it's really sad but it's
really good and it's not too awful so
yeah and I also got lucky because
the person that had this before me
laughter there were notes in it so if my
teacher asks for me to like have notes
and the final thing in my backpack is
this quarter and I was looking for this
the other day for the vending machine so
yeah so that's my backpack I have this
nice coffee stain in here Wow that's
gross
uh-hum yeah that's everything that I
keep in here it's really boring I know
I'm not cool I don't have anything cool
in a backpack but whatever this is it
I hope you guys found this somewhat
enjoyable probably not probably pretty
boring but yeah that's it if you want to
do this video leave it as a video
response down below and I will
definitely accept it and yeah you can
leave me any other video requests down
below I have like a whole list of ones
that I want to do but this I just never
wind up doing that I'm bad but yeah I'm
gonna try and do more so once again I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I love
you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
