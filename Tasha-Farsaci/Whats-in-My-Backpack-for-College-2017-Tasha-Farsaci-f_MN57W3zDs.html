this background is a little funky
basically I had no plans on coming today
I am currently in the process of moving
from my apartment to a new house and I
was supposed to have a group delivering
furniture today and then they ended up
being like four hours late so I'm like
okay how does the televideo but that
room is definitely not ready there might
be some holes in the wall behind me the
air conditioning is broken and it just
keeps going so if you're a strange
gurgling that's what that is my hair is
dirty so dirty so you know Here I am
anyway yeah I'm just trying to apologize
for me looking like a trash bag so yeah
anyways today I want to do the what's in
my back to school backpack video and
this is obviously for college because I
am a college student and I thought that
could also be helpful for kind of
showing you guys what it calls didn't
need to my backpack like obviously is
different for everyone but there's just
the stuff that I find myself using the
most I didn't put something here that
will actually use obviously I'm not
currently using this because it's summer
for me but they want show you the
backpack and stuff that I use in it and
we'll be using this year also really
quickly if you guys are not following me
on social media and want to keep up with
me on what personal level I will put it
here on the screen and I will also put
my other handles down in the description
box okay I'm sure you guys are all
wondering what my backpack is and
basically the main thing that I've
learned throughout the years is to buy a
backpack that is functional I remember I
school I would buy backpack solely for
the looks of them that was the ruling I
resigned them to just um look and they
were literally good for tear or break
within the first month of having them so
I kind of transitioned out of that phase
and I'm not saying I'm buying the ugly
backpack but I'm buying backpacks that I
think are practical and will hold all
the stuff that I needed to hold because
in college you carry around a laptop and
that's heavy so this year
I'm so heavy this year is using to be
North Face backpack I think since the
woman's recon recon when I out put the
name on the screen and I got this from
bag comm arrived or erected basically
once a and they have all the best back
in school backpack brands they have bags
accessories whatnot anyway that's why I
got this one the prices on there are
seriously the best and they just went
down below I will also link them down
below yeah but seriously guys if you are
on the hunt for a backpack for
back-to-school and you want a wide
variety and you want the best bread
check out genetics great series we have
such a wide variety and they have really
really good quality backpacks so you
know once you get a real last you a long
time so anyways I chose this North Face
backpack because I think it just it
looks nice and it's basic and it's
amazing quality and I just know that
this will never really like go on a pile
all my not like this it's literally
black with the white logo so I guess I'm
just going to go through it and show you
the stuff that I keep in I'm gonna start
off with this main top pocket which is
the laptop compartment in this backpack
so I love is the back of it it's flat
and hard so it's made for laptop just in
my laptop I'm not going to take it out
of the case right now I have a macbook
15 inch is that's the biggest one I have
the biggest one it's a few years old
this little folder is from society6 I
will link this down below I love this
it's perfect they come in different
sizes
it's padded cute it's great and even if
you do have a super sturdy backpack like
that one you will want a laptop case
because these puppies are expensive
because it would be main thing I bring
to class because black helps are
necessity in college at least the
college's I am convinced so yeah so yeah
as you can see here this is like a
specific pocket for your laptop but this
whole back thing is very straight and it
will keep its shape
okay we're going on into this next
compartment this is where I have my
school supplies okay to the island
arrive
I only use a lot of tools supplies
because like I said I mainly use my
laptop but the to school supplies that I
use is just it are the two school
supplies are you are just a brain folder
because if I get any loose hand out
there why not I pop them in here
honestly that could be more organizing
this they kind of tend to pile up but
this is just what I've used forever it's
kind of deformed use of doing and then I
also always have a five star and Oakland
or just some sort of big notebook with a
lot of loose-leaf notebook papers so
that if I do need to buy anything on
paper I just pull this out I don't have
one needs to be twelve because like I
said everything is really done on the
laptop so this is just you know used
once in a while and really this is from
last year and you can see like how much
I have so here's these a ton but I like
to have them because I've used on once
in a while okay also in here I have a
pencil pouch this is also consider I
will link it in two then sold as a
pencil pouch you can get these in a
bunch of different sizes but I just use
it as a pencil pouch so once again I
don't use pens and pencils too often I
would say use them more than I used on
other team so yeah normally I would keep
a few tens and pencils in here son fact
I prefer pencils I always use mechanical
pencil I feel like my handwriting better
a pencil I don't know I feel like I'm
the minority in that so everyone's pens
but yeah I'm here I throw kind of a
pencil and then I also have my
calculator which this is kind of why I
really haven't used this I haven't had a
big mouth in college but you know it's
always nice to have it and I have it
somewhere cool so why not okay the last
few things that I would keep in this big
pocket would be my charger that being my
macbook charger an old man iPhone
charger which is charging over there
somewhere I don't have it but yeah
actually I didn't really bring this a
lot last year and I want five percenters
ready because you don't know how many
times I'm on the class and open my
laptop it has Explorer percent so
definitely bringing a laptop charger
are kind of bulky and heavy but
seriously it'll be a lifesaver okay
moving on to this little top pocket here
it's Emily I just have first of all some
band-aids I have a lot of shoes and I
like wearing cute shoes to class and I
know it's stupid wearing a new pair of
shoes to class and walking to class and
getting clothes service but like I'm not
gonna not wear my shoes oh I always
bring band-aids because I'm always
having blisters on my feet or you know
any other fan base necessities are good
to have I also have a little thing of
hand sanitizer a distant
self-explanatory it's women ships from
Bath and Body Works it's winter candy
apple which is a while ago now but I
still have it so I'm strong it smell
good and you know it's just something
that you always want to have on your
hands and so gross and then I have
chapters guys this is probably my most
important thing all over my laptop I am
all those people that needs chapstick at
least once an hour my lips are so dry
and if I don't have chapstick on my lips
I feel wrong like something is not right
comment on below if you guys feel the
same but literally I need chapstick so I
need to have one more in my bag at all
times over here in this bag is so many
pockets but I almost forgot to show you
what I have and these ones this is also
be like second biggest compartment and I
just put in this this one here okay yeah
in this a little bit compartment I just
put like feminine products so I just
have like tampons panty liners and then
I also have ibuprofen I remember in high
school if you were caught carrying
knives open around you was in so much
trouble but in college they don't care
and I get divorce cramps that really
horrible cramps so I always need to have
ibuprofen and it's always good to have
you know if you like a headache so if
your friend either what I well um yeah
okay who's going on this front pocket
this is where I would keep my phone so
yeah so this is kind of just where I
keep the things that I need to have like
brighten hands reach so I would also
throw my wallet in there this is the one
I'm using currently it's just this
little Tory Burch wallet and
I'll link it down below if I can find it
because it's just like small you know
and also has a spot for cash you need it
but I just like really small well I had
a really great Marc Jacobs one and I
just could never use it especially
because all my bags or small certainly
fit so this one is great and then in
here and also cheap headphone I only
have two pairs of headphones in here
interesting yeah I'm always listening to
music when I'm walking from class to
class or if I'm alone on campus and I
feel offered sometimes I'll just buy
iphone bang or I'm editing a video or
watching video or anything it's just
like headphones and necessity as well so
you would be in my front pocket using on
to people's time pockets they're super
loud I have supposing a mints
you know mints or gum i everybody dumb
on me when I was packing this backpack
but I did have made so yeah just
something you know if you're talking of
a cute boy on campus like what not and
on this side and all necessarily know
this is where I proceeded but Institute
arrows sunglasses - guys I've no idea
what parodies are I pulled the nod when
the boxes I had here so let's see okay
you got my club master one I don't want
even so long I don't know if they look
around me anymore I don't know let me
know what you think
anyways I always want to like always
money for that one thing and secondly
you know for me I always run into people
that I don't want to be on campus you
know always it's a one person I don't
want to see it I see them I feel like if
it weren't sunglasses they won't know
that I see that and I often tell myself
that if I'm wearing sunglasses people
won't recognize me
not like recognize me from you - I just
mean like people I doubt my not with me
so maybe that's a weird reason I don't
all of you know here the same way yes so
that is everything in my little North
Face backpack once again I've got a bag
will be linked down below I really like
it I'm really excited to use this I know
this is something that will be great for
just like overnight trips as well the
quality of so many things I don't even
know if I showed you the back of it but
it looks like this they have this in a
bunch of different colors so I'll be
left flooring the knee and you want to
get black there are lots of colors and
we can't win let me know you're right
this is have to be for your backpack for
College because maybe I'm forgetting
some things we'll let me know otherwise
I love you guys so so much and thanks
