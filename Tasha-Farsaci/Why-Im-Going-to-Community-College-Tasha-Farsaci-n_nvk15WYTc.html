update video because ever since I posted
my I'm transferring colleges video I've
gotten a lot of questions about what I
decided to do and just kind of life
updates so before I get into that I'm
just going to mention when I'm wearing
quickly because I always get questions
so this choker necklace I actually made
this lace bra is from Free People this
Thomas on Free People
and then this flannel I thrifted so I'm
going to link what I can in the
description box and also very quickly
before I get into the rest of the video
if you're not following me on social
media totally follow me if you want to
keep up more with my life and my
personal life and if you're not
subscribed to my channel please
subscribe it would mean the world to me
okay so if you did not see my I'm
transferring colleges video I will link
it down below but basically I attended
Loyola Marymount University for my
freshman year which was last year and
then I was accepted as a transfer
student at the University of Southern
California but the little hitch was that
I was accepted as a spring semester
student and not a fall semester students
so a lot of you guys were curious as to
what I decided to do for the fall
semester and that's kind of what this
video and I just kind of wanted to give
you guys like a life update so I decided
to not attend
LMU again a lot of you guys thought I
would just attend LMU for the fall
because I was already going there but
for me I did not want to do that just
because LMU is very expensive and I knew
that I was going to be leaving there so
I wouldn't want to be there I just
wouldn't feel like immersed into the
school so what I decided to do is I got
an apartment by USC I'm not going to say
which building it is you guys might
figure that out later on but it's not
associated with the school it's not like
campus housing but it's like a half mile
from campus and it's basically like all
students that live there so I'm living
there for the fall in LA I'm not staying
at home here in New York I'm going there
and then I will be attending Community
College so there's a community college
it's like a half mile
my apartment building los angeles
technical training college i think la
TTC so i am going there so i'm taking
classes at a community college that will
transfer to USC as gen ed so i'm taking
like a math science and English things
that i need to transfer for USC i wanted
to do this first of all because it would
save a lot of money going to Community
College and I really did want to live by
USC so I could go to you know events and
parties and football games and stuff and
still kind of feel like a student other
than you know going to class but if I do
live as close to campus as I am I can
still you know go to the libraries and
hang out on campus and I'll be close to
people that you know go to USC I'll be
living with people that go to USC so I
can still kind of you know put my foot
in the door and meet people without
actually like attending the school until
the spring so yeah that's kind of what
I'm doing I didn't mention in a video I
don't know which one it was that I
couldn't rush because I'm a spring
student and rushes in the fall and a lot
of you guys said oh you know you
probably have informal Russian stuff and
I looked into that I do have informal
gosh USC does have some informal rush
but the thing is not every sorority
participates and there's a few that I
had my eye on and I don't think they
participate so it's kind of hit or miss
whether or not you know they'll do you
in for more Vash based on how many girls
they get so yeah I still don't know if
I'm going to be able to brush at all or
join a sorority at all next year so yeah
that's still kind of like on the edge so
I am moving out of my house in New York
on August 20th and I'll be moving in and
I don't start classes at the community
college until the 29th but yeah I'm only
going to the Community College until the
spring and then
you know officially a USC student a lot
of you guys have been asking me about my
major because I was a Communication
Studies major at LMU and then I got
accepted to USC as undeclared I didn't
get into my major yet I'm not really
gonna answer any questions about the
major because I've only taken you know
one year of it so I don't really know
that much um you know maybe once I'm
like a junior or a senior and I've
actually got into the major at USC I can
talk more about it but from now you know
I'm pretty inexperienced so I can't
really help you on that but I'm sure if
you guys just like Google communication
major Communication Studies major you
can find some stuff oh yeah something
else I didn't mention is that I'm
actually only going to have class on
Tuesdays and Thursdays
for the Fall I jammed all my classes
into Tuesdays and Thursdays so I'm gonna
have a lot of free time to film totally
leave me requests because I'm gonna be
filming a lot okay I think that's it
hope that cleared some things up for you
guys and I love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
