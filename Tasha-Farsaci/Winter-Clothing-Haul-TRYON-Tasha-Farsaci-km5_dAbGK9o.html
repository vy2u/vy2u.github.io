another haul video I know I do these a
lot but the reason for that is I do
order online frequently I love watching
home videos and I know a lot of you guys
like them they're really easy to film
pretty easy to edit and upload because I
like having content quite frequently on
my channel I try to upload as much as I
can and sometimes if a whole video is
easy to film I'm gonna put that up more
than like a video that takes some time
and I want to take my time editing so my
location is kind of weird I'm in my
closet right now because it's getting a
little bit dog you know it's hitting
that like 4 o'clock mark and my room has
really bad lighting to begin with so I'm
sitting in my closet which explains the
clue was behind my head so yeah sorry if
this location is weird but I figured you
know better lighting was better than
like a nice plain wall so here we are
first place is she inside I love she
inside I get stuff from there all the
time
so right now it's really in China huge
blanket sconce which are basically like
big scarves normally plaid that are
literally this size of a blanket so I
got this one from she inside it's really
soft I would see the day you'll be
seeing it in an outfit the week but it's
awesome it's a Prius hello plant ever
this match of so many things guys and
it's huge
so you know if you're cold you can just
take it off and it's blinking next to
she inside I got this really pretty
dress and I know some of these things
are pretty seasoned but I am going to
Hawaii in a few weeks over my February
break so I'm gonna be wearing this kind
of stuff there so I got this green dress
and I don't have anything this color I'm
really not agreed persons that's why I
chose this color and it's
like a crocheted lace look as you can
see and then it just kind of flows out
it's not a tight dress by any means it
just kind of flows and I'm really
excited to wear this it's definitely a
different color for me and I like that I
like going out of my maroon comfort zone
this zone yeah also be inside I got this
a great turtleneck sweater I thought it
was gonna be more of a cowl-neck but
it's really more of like an actual like
hardcore turtleneck and I don't know how
I feel about them yet my mom wears
turtlenecks with everything but I don't
know if I can do that just yet so we'll
see about this it's just a really like
big chunky sweater with the chunky
turtleneck but this would be great for
cold days so we'll see I also got a vast
bushi inside and this isn't too big on
me I want to say it was one size fits
all but it's just a little bit bigger
and I would want it's a black faux fur
vest because these are really I like
these a lot right now but this one is
just big I look like a gorilla in it so
I don't know it's really soft the
material is great I just wish it was a
little smaller because being super short
like me it kind of follows me up but
it's really soft and it's really nice
quality I wish it was a little smaller
moving on to a website called lay in the
box
I got another proof vest um long story
short the progress that I had in my last
haul video maybe the package got lost so
I didn't think I was gonna get it and I
ended up ordering this one and then that
package came so now I have another like
brown fur vest this one is a different
color though it's more of like a tan and
this one is also a little bit bigger I
think I got a medium and this one
actually so I could wear with sweaters
and this one definitely not as big as
the black one but I really like this one
it's really soft I got this runa shred
it's more breadth in my room and I think
it's sad like lying on the website but I
think it's closer to Brad it's another
one with a cowl neck sweaters except
this one's more of a cowl neck then I'm
turtleneck and I says cable knit and I
thought this was gonna be like sweater
length but it's definitely more of a
dress length even with the slits on the
side it's more of a sweater dress so
I'll probably wear this with like
leggings or tights and
it's super warm next to the sweater that
I've worn on Freddie it is moon and gray
striped and the best thing about this is
it has little pockets in the front and
it's just really like boxy and baggy but
I really like this one I got this Daisy
tank top and I think I order this in
black but it came in this blue color I
ordered these things so long ago like
they're processing time looks like a
long time for this website so I can't
even remember if I ordered this in black
but I still don't like you in the blue
it's just kind of like a baby doll flowy
kind better tank top I got this really
pretty kind of navy blue sweater and as
you can probably see it has like
colorful flecks in it so there's a
better look at that I got a lot of
compliments on this when I wore it but
yeah it has some cable knit in the front
and on the sleeves and it's nice alright
so I ordered this stuff before Christmas
I may have this Christmas sweater that
had a pug on it with like reindeer
antlers and you guys know I love pumps
you don't know you don't know I love
pugs so I ordered it and then
unfortunately the stuff didn't come
until after Christmas but instead of the
pugs sweater I got this I don't know if
they ran out of the pugs footer and gave
me this instead oh look what but uh I
find this a little bit scary to be
perfectly honest I'm a little bit scared
by it I mean it is soft but uh I'm like
I'm a tad scared last two pieces from
light in the box are necklaces so the
first one is this statement kind of
necklace it's really pretty it kind of
looks like leaves but I just really like
the colors and I think it was really
unique so I wanted to pick this one up
and asking my people that's helped on my
necklace that I'm wearing right now I've
really been liking layering necklaces or
necklaces that are already like built in
as layers so I got this one you can
light in the box
if I can get it untangled that's what I
hate about necklaces they just get so
tangled okay here we go so as you can
see it's just this layered necklace I
have three layers and the top one is
just a little so called the middle we've
got like a strand of pearls and on the
bottom it's just this little like I need
thingies last place in this hall is
lovely wholesale and I've ordered from
there numerous times see you guys might
be familiar with them starting off I
actually got some bathing suits because
like I said I'm going to be going to
Hawaii and I'm really excited I'm hoping
to fill lots of videos there anyways I
know triangle bikinis the brand triangle
are really popular right now but I
didn't want to suspend the full price I
want and I wasn't totally in love with
them where I would sew on what people so
they have a lot of like replica bathing
suits so I saw this triangle one and
it's awesome it looks just like triangle
you know it's teal and stuff the problem
is I don't have boobs and this is a
small but you know it's not really small
like I don't fill this so unfortunately
I can't be wearing this but I also came
in the bottom of which are tiny so how
do they expect me to have big boobs and
then like fit into this I don't know I
don't understand but the bottoms are
really small I haven't even tried these
on just because I I really don't think
they'll fit the next bathing suit I got
it is actually a small I mean it doesn't
fit
it still has like kind of fake like boob
areas which could be as small but
whatever so it's just this plain black
one and I like it because it's simple
but it still has I got some shape to it
it has a cute little tie and then I like
this one because as you can see it's
adjustable in the back and around the
neck so you can make this as tight as
you want this one also came with bottoms
they're also kind of small but these
ones at least have tags on the side so
you can adjust the bottoms as well how's
the flu the wholesale I got it this
round brand it's probably my favorite
thing in the whole entire haul
so it's amazingly beautiful I'm probably
gonna wear it in Hawaii most likely so
it's gonna be hard to show you but
you'll see in the Tryon it's basically
like this kind of like wrap front romper
and it's just this really pretty floral
pattern and then the bottom little
shorts have cute little ruffles and this
just looks so cute I'm obsessed with
this and I cannot cannot cannot wait to
wear this one since when where and when
I'm on vacation next I got this kind of
glaze or anything but it's kind of like
a sweater cardigan I don't know it looks
like this it's I don't even know what
you would call this print for material
like I don't know but it looks like this
um in the website these like little what
are these called lapels they're pictured
like out like this kind of so I think
I'm gonna get like some fabric tape or
double-sided tape or something like that
to kind of keep them back but anyways it
looks like this I just thought it was
cute if I wanted to kind of look put
together but it's not like as structured
as a blazer so I don't feel like to
businessÃ­
I don't know what I thought it was cute
I just like the way it looked also from
lovely wholesale I got this awesome
statement necklace and if you follow me
on instagram you might have seen my post
with this it has some really pretty
colors in it it's black cream kind of a
grayish blue color and then just like
your plain crystal and it's really
awesome I want is for the love a jacket
it looked awesome and this was really
inexpensive last but not least some
lovely wholesale I got a coat so I got
this a green colored coat but it looks
it's like a really dark army green it's
not like it's green it's like black army
green so it's really puffy and under the
arms here we've got like some great kind
of material that looks like wool and the
coal goes down and the cool part is at
the bottom here you've got some ones
that gray looking wool and some haha
what some pockets with zippers and
you've got some pockets up here
it unzips it's nicely lined so this is
going to be a very one coat and you
definitely need it living in New York
like I do so yeah it's really pretty
gets really puffy and this was pretty
inexpensive I believe that is everything
