long time no haul is what I'm gonna say
because I'm filming a little haul video
today and I haven't done one in quite
some time and that it's odd for me if
you guys follow my channel at all
so yeah today I'm doing a haul it's not
that big but it's just stuff that I've
kind of collected in the last month or
so that I wanted to show you guys really
quickly before I get into the video if
you guys don't follow me on Instagram
and you want to shameless plug it's on
the screen I post here all the time but
if you guys want to see more of my life
totally follow me on there it's super
personal okay so the first thing that I
want to show you guys is something that
I've been getting a lot of questions
about and this is a Gucci belt I've been
wearing this on a lot of my Instagram
posts and you guys have all been asking
me how I found it because it's out of
stock everywhere and I must have just
got in a super-lucky so yeah it is out
of stock everywhere I tried to get it in
store in Paris and like a bunch of
different stores and it was sold out in
my size everywhere in case you're
wondering I am a size 70 I believe so it
was sold out everywhere this is the thin
Gucci belt and it was sold out on my
website and then I came across someone's
haul video hauling this belt from
net-a-porter it might be net a port a
I'm not completely sure how to pronounce
it but I knew of this website because I
watched Project Runway a lot and they
used to have this as a sponsor for their
show and it's basically like an online
luxury department store basically
I'm guessing that's what it is I know
it's not an american-based website so I
could be wrong if you guys know more
about it
totally comment down below but they had
my size on there which is crazy
and I know it's authentic it's like a
really reliable website but yeah if they
still have it I will link it down below
I think it's super cute kind of kind of
obnoxious but not so much because I got
the smaller one and I still think it's
cute and it adds a lot to my outfit so I
picked this up okay the next thing
that's kind of a random thing to throw
in here but if you guys watch my vlogmas
I bought a pair of red jeans and I asked
you
if you thought I should keep them
because the fit was a little bit off and
most of you said no and I'm glad that I
listened to you guys and returned them
because I found this pair that I liked
so much more I got these from Lord and
Taylor but they are Levi's and they are
the wedgie fit just basically just like
a high rise I guess it's supposed to
like go off your bottom make your butt
look nice or something but they are just
these red kind of like straight leg
girlfriend/boyfriend fit jeans the
bottoms are raw hem but I did cut them
more because I'm only 5 1
however they were like literally exactly
like this so I didn't feel bad cutting
the hem but yeah I really like these ok
next I have some stuff from this new
fitness brand that I discovered called
coral I believe it's pronounced coral it
might be pronounced Corral but I'll put
it on the screen here this top is really
really cute and amazing quality I've
already won all of it but one thing and
I love it so far so the first thing is
probably my favorite they're these white
leggings I wore these in an out for the
week that I recently posted so if you
guys haven't seen that I'll try and link
it down below but they are super super
thick and they just kind of have like
some paneling I'm sure you guys can see
but these are amazing quality these are
the best quality leggings that I own by
far their just amazingly thick you will
not see under work of these at all just
buying like super dark I don't know
okay I'm apologizing if this lighting is
weird it looks kind of weird on camera
but maybe it's not horrible anyways I
got another pair of leggings from them
these ones are more like a liquid
legging as you can see here these are
super cool once again they're just black
leggings they're really comfortable but
having more of like that
like a leathery effect I think is really
cool okay okay hopefully I just fix fix
my lighting a bit but the last thing
from quarrel I actually haven't won this
yet but I'm really excited to it's this
white little tank top it's slightly
cropped but not to crap which is good
because I like wearing crop tops with my
high ride stuff but sometimes they're
like kind of aggressive for like class
and stuff so this is perfect like I said
it has a kind of a mesh appearance and
it's a little bit longer in the back so
I really really like this this will go
with everything okay and the last store
I have things from is steli I've talked
about steli in a few videos they're one
of my favorite Australian websites
honestly Australian fashion it is my
favourite fashion ever I think it's so
cute the one thing though is their
seasons are flip-flopped from us so
everything I got is pretty summery
because it is summer there right now or
like spring summer and I'm just guessing
summer but if you guys live in a warm
area or if you guys are shopping for you
know like spring break or anything like
that I still recommend these because I
love them so the first thing I know a
lot of you guys are gonna want I wore
this in my most recent and get ready
with me video for going out it's this
black bodysuit and I think it's the most
flattering perfect body soup ever first
of all it's like a really stretchy
spandex material that just looks really
really nice it has it deep me but it's
not like incredibly deep when it's on
and then I also really like the sleeves
go down far so if you have any sort of
boob you might have some like nice side
boob action I have no boobs at all so I
don't get that but I still think it's
really really
loitering and then the back is super low
and open which once again a very
flattering and then it is in a thong
cheeky style which bless up because I
hate buying body suits that are very
panty bottoms like I wear thongs for a
reason I don't want to be wearing a
thong and then a crane eprint a bodysuit
defeats the purpose
not having one over lines something else
I wore recently an Instagram post is
this little crop top thing it's funny it
looks like a Gucci like I mean it's
definitely a Gucci inspired but it's not
go G clearly but it's really cute I love
the straight-across neckline and it's a
really nice stretchy material actually
wore this with the red jeans and my
Gucci belt and I thought it was really
really cute so yeah and I know they have
this and a bunch of colors as well ok
moving on to the super summery stuff I
love yellow you guys may or may not know
this about me I used to hate yellow but
you know recently my mind has changed so
this dress is so adorable
it's this little yellow dress and then
the bottom how is a little ruffle it's
super wrinkly right now but I know once
I steam it Toby is so adorable I guess
going on with the yellow trend
here's another cute dress stelios the
cutest dresses ever
this one is a yellow dress with some
florals some roughly sleeves and then
some rough leaves on the bottom as well
as some little ties to suit you waist so
super flattering really really adorable
and then the last two items are dresses
as well this one is an adorable baby
pink plaid dress hopefully you can see
it but it's just kind of like a shift
dress and then you can tie it in the
back so it's like open back with some
ties really really cute as well I've
been meaning to wear this one and then
lastly I'm in love with this color I had
to get it in a size up then everything
else I got all this stuff in a
Australian size 6 but I had to get this
one in an 8 because they were sold out
of a 6 and it's a little bit baby well
it's not really big it's more so long so
you'll see the Tryon I think I'm gonna
get it
probably just because I don't like the
length of it I feel like it's a little
bit long for the style of dress it's
more like a casual dress but I'm
obsessed with this color it's kind of
like this
minty like sage green color really
really cute deep v in the front and the
back and then the bottom has that cute
little ruffle on it I just think it
should be like a few inches shorter so
yeah I might bring this to get it hemmed
but it's so adorable and I love it
yes that is everything in this haul
video as you can see this lighting is
not getting better so I'm glad I
finished this video or when I did it I
hope you guys enjoyed it please leave
Mike please leave me a comment down

guys want to shop any of these items I
will be trying to link them all in the
