holiday Oh for your eyes I know I do so
many halls but a lot of these lights
love them and say they're my favorite
know they're your favorite videos that I
do so whenever I get stopped I like to
do hauls you don't like them don't worry
I have other videos coming but today I
have a good amount of I don't want to
tell video so I thought I would do it in
case you're wondering live where it
sounds weird I have been sick with a
cold so probably like two weeks now
honestly over two weeks it's just
starting to go away and starting to feel
better but my voice and my nose are
slowly kind of weird so if you guys
notice what I found odd that is why also
my hair is not look good I didn't do my
hair today sorry it's out father to you
about one more thing before I think this
video if you guys are not following me
on social media you guys totally should
a but it's honestly such a personal
outlet for me literally if you guys want
to know me on a more personal basis
Tommy on there just literally like way
way personal so my Instagram is fiercely
cha-cha and then ultimate Witter and
snapchat here as well in case you guys
wanna follow me that would be great okay
so I'm going to put it off there this
video is sponsored by Ellie whenever I
had bought their videos I really really
liked the company some people get very
buffer about sponsored videos but I
would never do a sponsored video for
something that I don't genuinely like
and want to share with you guys so you
guys don't like all the videos I'm sorry
but this video is sponsored by Ellie
what you're going to show you what that
is in a minute I literally love it I
honestly think it's amazing so just wait
okay so Ellie is an active wear
subscription box and I know it's people
like us subscription boxes are so many
but I honestly think this one is the
best value I have ever seen in a
subscription box it's really amazing so
every box contains five activewear
Fitness finger bear is atop a Sports Bra
legging and then two pieces of fitness
equipment and that is all from 49.95
that is really insane entire outfit and
then two pieces of fitness equipment for
49.95 like what so basically it's not a
surprise box either you will see what
you're getting before the month and if
you want to skip it you can so if you
don't like something in the box you
don't have to pay for it or get it for
things that's awesome
well and with your first box you get a
free water bottle which I will show you
which is also an amazing deal because
it's a super nice water bottle literally
the best but I don't okay so you guys
are probably all wondering what is in
the box which is a February box so we're
going to be showing you sorry I also
cross mention that everything in the box
is meant to match or be able to be used
all together which is awesome so the
first thing is this sports bra it's
black and neon green love this it's
super fun and it's tired so you guys
don't have to miss at the gym and then
the top I actually wore this out the
other night because there was a theme
party and it was like neon bright colors
so there's like dirt on this lamp all
done but it's just me on agreeing it
tank top and slowly it's so nice the
bath looks like this really really great
quality and then the lighting of the
cameras are so fun I love patterned
workout leggings Amis are super soft
there's a few black white and gray
pattern legging
so there's full length they look like
this once again so soft and I think that
all looks super cool together you're
going to a spa with a gym okay so the
cloth also came with a jump rope which
is great this can be used in my room
probably so if you're like a college
student you can probably use this in
your dorm room with kind of like a
anything Oh for y'all that's super great
jump roping is a great exercise and then
it came with a foot massager away and
that is nice my mom obviously wanted
there so badly so I think next to my
senior I'm going to give this to her but
it alleviates foot pain and soreness and
you see basically rub your foot on it so
this is great because why would you not
want why would you want sore feet yeah
okay and the last thing in the box was
the water bottle because this was my
first box so it looks like this it's so
pretty it's like a rose gold bottle it
looks like those popular ones out right
now and it says Eliana is spiritually
amazing amazing quality and it's just so
cute like who would want a really cold
water bottle so yeah I am really excited
about this yeah so I think it's pretty
obvious that this box is an amazing
value and everything in it is so great
so I'm going to put all the information
for Ellie down below you guys should
totally
we check it out so yes thank you to them
for sponsoring this video okay so moving
on I have a bunch of stuff from Chien
and I get some xi'an quite often um they
do send me these things but they don't
pay me for it so it's just like biggest
media item and I like doing videos with
them because a lot of people don't know
if they're like a good website order
from but Shion is my favorite website of
the Asian wholesale websites I know
people that are not youtubers that chop
on Shion and they get the same exact
products an idea so it's definitely my
favorite one I think it's most reliable
one so I go to then it can't speak guys
oh my gosh I mean appointment on me
being sick yes why do you think it's
totally reliable and I like showing you
guys you know what I get from there cuz
it's super affordable and really really
trendy okay I'm gonna start off with my
favorite item that I got from them and
it's this gray top I got it from them in
black as well this was in a previous
call video and I loved it so much it's
the perfect top to wear going out it's a
tight long-sleeve crop top anetha Xena
the Vienna is pretty deep but I don't
have boobs so like I'll push abroad and
it was like the perfect amount of room
because I don't have boobs if you do a
big group this might be a little
aggressive but like girl you can you I
just think it's a perfect top for going
out it's not too crops
it's just copied off and I love this
like I said I have it in black and gray
okay another one of my favorite things
is this denim jacket it's kind of an
oversized destroyer or jacket to look at
super trendy right now and it looks like
this I just think it looks like it would
be a lot more expensive than it was I
honestly think this is like maximum
$30.00 probably only looking it was that
when there's not a ton over to it it's
just like along the bottom here and then
on the sleeves and stuff and yeah I just
think she looks so cool and it's like
good for layering really tiny right now
if you don't wanna shop like $100
literally I recommend okay I got this
sweater from them I happen in a throat
orange color and I love it I thought
this one's a little bit shorter so I
probably want to wear this with jeans
because I kind of like funner to be long
went away to move jeans but I think this
will look so cute with like a denim
skirt or like I'm a scrutinising so it's
just hand lace of sweater and the sleeve
kind of like flare out a little bit and
super cute these are also very trendy
right now so
like this I've been loving like shooing
jacket I feel like Schilling is kind of
a trend right now so I got this faux
suede so shearling jacket this is
honestly so nice and to you and it was
really really cheap it's gray and it
looks like this it's going to be kind of
hard to show I haven't won this yet
because I'm in LA and it's been kind of
long but I think it's so pretty and cute
for like the fall and winter ok I got
these jeans and I think they're great I
just didn't like the fit I thought there
were many boyfriend jeans and I got them
under more of a skinny jean I'm not
fully in love with them but that's just
because then I'll just say I wanted so
these black jeans and then they have
this awesome it's Laurel embroidery on
the legs so it is super super on-trend
right now so that's a real awesome like
I said I just wanted you to be more
loose but still really good quality the
embroidery is a little amazing and these
look very similar to a pair that you
could get at Topshop ok guys this next
thing I really don't know why I ordered
it because like I said I live in LA and
it's not cold and this is literally
giant it's one of those big white fluffy
jacket thing except this one is the
largest one I've ever seen like I think
how good weighs as much as I do I don't
even know how you okay this is the hood
it's big it's really large misses an
extra small I think ooh this is so cozy
so maybe if it gets cold in LA I will
ribbon but yeah this is very very large
okay I got another cold weather thing
this is because I thought it was going
to come I ordered this stuff to my house
in New York originally it office is
going to come while I was home in New
York but it didn't so now I have it in
LA so once again if it gets cold I can
wear it but it's a really nice cheap
jacket it's just just kind of not what
you would call this so I don't fall in
pepper kind of thing and then it has
like different sleeves like army green
trees and some pocket to go down or it
goes down pretty long have some like
cool zipper detailing on the sleeves it
kind of like a way through bomber jacket
kind of thing
but yeah this flick super cool I just
like I said I don't really know what I'm
gonna wanna okay this water is going to
be difficult to show you I go like this
I just thought it would be shorter it's
really really long on me it really swell
with me I might we're in a port address
we will see it's basically this cream
flutter and I really liked it because
the hood or the husband that had like a
zipper so it looks like this when you
wear it and then the side also has two
buoys
I don't know I just thought it was funky
and like cool and hopefully I can make
this work in the photographs because it
really just followed me above water to
stone we will see okay I got another
sweater dress this is amazing all of you
guys it is this black turtleneck sweater
dress this is so thick and so soft
oh my gosh and it goes down on the 19th
once again this is really really great
quality and I've been loving turtlenecks
lately almost done I got that skirt once
again this is amazing body I'm pretty
sure it's a Duke boys are a skirt it
looks like this it's black and then it
has these cool ties with like these
grommets or are going to know what you
call that but kind of crosses over the
front and then it's a different closure
in the back this is just really elegant
and cute okay guys the last knot I'm
really bummed about so I wanted a pair
of over-the-knee like sigh high boots
you know the really popular ones that
everyone have it's kind of tough for me
I'm like really short and I had really
small legs so sometimes there was ways
we can elect me and these could perfect
they look like this you know they
probably look okay right now I would
have once I warned them out and the heel
came off I don't know I mean do you have
a really good review and they're really
cute and like very nice but like I don't
know if I can like working there for our
parties uh but like I came back and they
he look like this so I don't know
