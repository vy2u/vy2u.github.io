City for my friend's Christmas present I
bought us tickets to New York City I
live in the Syracuse area when I'm home
so it's like a five-hour drive so I
bought us tickets to go to New York City
for Christmas present and I thought I'd
do a haul because I got a few things
while I was there and I had some things
from before that trip that I had to show
you so I'm kind of just going to be
adding in things I got before the trip
with the New York City stuff and I
thought I'd show you in a haul and it's
gonna be trying on cuz I know I for
those Tryon halls as you can tell I'm
back in my room at home I'm home for
like another week before I were back to
college as you can tell by the tapestry
I know I'm gonna have questions it's
from eBay
she just searched tapestry on eBay a
bunch will come up and you can probably
find this one also something I want to
note before I got in the hall
I drove a lot of clothes as you can see
by all of my holiday aahs and I do not
keep all of those and I don't wear all
of them which is bad I should but
because of that I've been selling a
bunch of things on my Poshmark
especially when I'm home from college
I've just need to get rid of a lot of
the stuff that I haven't been wearing so
if you don't have a Poshmark account
basically it's like an eBay just for
like clothes and accessories I swear I'm
not sponsored by them at all it's just
like a website or it's an app that a lot
of people use you can also use that on
the computer but it's just really
helpful and it's great to buy stuff on
I've bought so many things on Poshmark
from other sellers that I've been
looking for for a lot cheaper anyways my
use anyone passport is Tasha for saj I'm
gonna put that down below but if you do
not have posh work I'll put my invite
code as well because you guys get like
$10 I think when you sign up with it so
you could use that towards my stuff hint
hint
or like anything else I just figured I'd
clip in there once again not sponsored
or anything but everyone gets one when
they sign up so if you want to use mine
and that would be awesome
okay so I'm gonna get into some things
before I have the stuff from New York I
have some stuff from Shia and romwe
and you guys helped me know that I have
hauled from them numerous times in the
past and they always send me the items
they love working with youtubers and the
thing with the website is that they have
a lot of really good items but they're
very questionable because a lot of the
time the images on their websites are
not the actual items so I get all
excited I'm like yeah I'm gonna work
with them they have some awesome pieces
and then like
in the mail and I'm like oh they're not
the same some of the stuff I do really
like but some of the items I really do
not like so just wanted to throw that
out there they sent me these things they
did not pay me to make this video but if
you put in an ordering from Sheehan or
romwe I definitely recommend being like
weary weary you said a word leery it's
like don't expect the things to look
exactly like the pictures and if you
want anything that I got at least you'll
be seeing them now so I'm gonna start
off with the stuff from she in I
actually don't like anything but um yeah
by the way if I don't try any items odd
it's because I really don't like how
they fit or I just don't like them in
general so that's why some things will
be try on and then some things won't be
okay the first thing from Shion is this
black and white dress and I would like
it except the material is a very odd it
ties in the middle I have a dress like
this but I wear all the time but this
material is like spandex II I don't know
it's kind of weird and it's like
awkwardly long on me this goes to like
my knee and this type of dress just on
me a short person does not look cute to
the knees this next item from Shion I
don't hate it all I might keep this one
I don't remember what it looked like on
so we'll see I think this one was a
little long too it's just like a t-shirt
dress kind of thing it's long-sleeved
grey and white and the back was like
cool cuz it's like a V cut once again
I'm pretty sure this was a little bit
long but this is good material it's
thick it's nice this one's fine I just
remember it not quite fitting how I
wanted to sew and Bronwen she and have a
lot of free people inspired items on
their website and the thing is they'll
use the images from three people's
website so you never really know how
they're gonna turn out and I found a few
things that are really great and then
those things that are just not great so
I got this dress that is nothing like
the three people one and I actually
wanted the three people one and so when
I saw this I'm like okay I'll try it out
it's really not bad it's just the
material that they use it's just like
not my favorite material and plus this
one like cinches in the front whereas
the real one doesn't once again too long
on me too big on me not a bad
dress it has like some cute patterns
it's just not flattering on me so
probably not going to keep this one this
next dress would be cute if it was the
same color as the website it was like a
burgundy kind of plum color on the
website but when I got it it was red so
it's just it's really cute it's just not
the color that it wasn't the website
which is just annoying thing you look
like this back has some like open
cutouts I'm just not a huge fan of red
so if you like red this would be great
for you I just I just didn't think it
would be bad last but not least I do
like this top it just fits on it's
supposed to be like a top that wraps in
the front and you tie in the back and I
just remember it fitting kind of weird
there's nothing wrong with it yeah I
don't know it looks like this off and
then you're supposed to like tie these
things around your body and tie them in
the back those are the artists machine
she inside I'm gonna link them all down
below if you're interested in any of
them okay moving on into romwe I do like
a lot of this stuff there's a few things
that I don't like but for the majority
this stuff was good okay first thing
from runway I've won a few times
actually I really like it I think it's
cute it's this navy blue sweater and
then it has like this little like
snowflake pattern on it it has a little
bit of a high-low hem which I like the
sleeves are like this the next thing
from runway is another hit it's one of
those big scarves and this material is
actually really soft it's still a big
plaid one like raw edge hem I think the
worst thing that I got was this actually
definitely the worst thing first of all
it was right on line I really like those
dresses that are like sheer on the top
and then have like floral lace covering
the boobs this is not at all what it
looked like it might show up a little
right on screen but I promise you this
is like neon pink and this like
lightning oh god I don't know I really
do not like this this material isn't
that nice
just I don't know this part is nice if
this was black it would be a lot better
it's just that it's neon pink and but it
was read online so yeah next thing I got
is this jacket it's not bad I'm just
really don't like it that much um looks
like this it's more the blaze there kind
of thing it's really not bad it's just
not totally my style it has some like
stitching going on and then back looks
like this next item is one of the three
people look-alikes that actually works I
have this in blue and I love it it's one
of my favorite dresses but I washed it
and it shrunk
I got it even dry I just put in the
washer and it shrunk up to a nice shirt
so I went to go get the blue one again
but they didn't have it they only had
white so I got the white this is a
little bit long on me I got my last one
hum but as you can see it looks like
this it's just like a shift kind of
dress and then it has like this floral
embroidery neckline with like a really
raw hem I don't think I've ever seen the
people one person so I can't tell you oh
it's exactly the same but the material
is definitely more of a free people
material it's not that weird material
like the other one I got this t-shirt
dress this one I like more than the
other one it's kind of like a ribbed
material I think it's gray and black I'm
pretty sure that's black but it's just
striped 3/4 sleeves goes down this one
is a good length on me right where I
want it and it's really cute so I like
this dress a lot I got a pair of jeans
that unfortunately do not fit me but
they're really nice jeans so they're
like a black kind of color really dark
blue I don't really know but they have
those slits in the knees which is really
popular home almost done I got this gray
sweater it's a really fuzzy kind of
thingamajig the sleeves look really
short I haven't tried this on actually
the sleeves look really short kind of
smells funny but you know you expect
that alright
second-to-last from romwe is this
cardigan I actually really like this I
saw this in someone else's video and I
decide
it's like a cream color cardigan sleeves
open it some pockets house a hood and
then the back I really like cuz it like
is a different texture at the bottom I
don't know I thought this one was really
cute it looks cute doesn't smell weird
it's good okay last thing from romwe was
a pair of over the knee socks I just
don't know where I put them they're
black over the knee socks they're good I
approve so that's everything from those
stores
sorry that was a ton of stuff they just
sent me a ton of stuff which I don't
want to complain about but as you can
see it's really hit or miss so yeah okay
moving on to what I actually got in New
York the first thing I got or a pair of
oh this which is crazy to me because I
haven't worn Uggs
since like ninth grade and I'm a
freshman in college now but I really
like the style dogs and basically what
happened is I wore heeled booties to New
York City I don't know I'm crazy I want
to look cute but I died and I needed
flat shoes and I was wanting these uggs
anyways just to wear when I'm wearing
like college clothes right in the
library so I bought these they are the
mini a belly button
hugs in black and these were actually on
sale I got them at David C's which is
just a shoe store in the city here these
were on sale online to our website so
they might be stalled my if you're
interested but I think I'm really cute I
really like the mini ones um just with
like leggings and t-shirts they're cute
they're warm it's not that cold in
California but at night it gets a little
cold I'm like i sat up and going to the
library this is really nice so I like
these I changed into these and more than
were on the city so that was a lifesaver
to my feet Nesmith stuff is from
Lululemon and I kind of obsessed with
Lululemon now I've been working out more
because I have a gym in my school so you
know this happened and I had a gift card
so yeah okay first thing I got is a
jacket it's the define a jacket I'm
pretty sure it is really cute I'll show
you what it looks like just a black
jacket I like this one because it's not
very long I have a jacket from Lulu
that's super long and it's just like I
can't zip it up because it looks like
awkward this one is a really good length
the back has a little logo there yeah
it's really cute I got this in a four I
used to be a to it Lulu I think I'm a
doing some things at four and others so
make sure you try stuff on because
they're sizing kind of weird but this is
definitely a fitted jacket so the two
suffocated me a little bit but it's
really cute I've already worn this a few
times next thing I got is a tank it was
on sale so that's nice it's just a black
strappy tank I'm trying just it here
looks like this in the front I was a
little bit of a v-neck which I like and
then the back looks like this I just
thought it was really cute and I needed
a black tank for it working out so next
thing I got was also on sale I'm so in
love with this I've already worn it like
a bunch of times it's just a zip up half
zip kind of shirt it's really soft it's
almost like a sweater material just goes
down has the long sleeve and then the
bottom the back looks like this it's
really soft it's really comfy I like
wearing this I haven't worn it to work
out and I've just worn out lounging
around but I love this okay and the last
thing that I got are these thin flow
crops they are burgundy they were also
on sale they look really weird when
they're off but I promise you they look
normal on you'll see the logo on the
back I really love these ones these are
for I'm actually normally a 2 in bottoms
but before was the only one left so I
got them in they're fine
- might be a little bit better but
they're still like perfectly fine so I
love these I hope you guys enjoyed this
