the gym I'll show you what I'm wearing
uh-huh but you're gonna see my room in
the background of the mirror my room is
really not cute especially right now
considering I have pig sheets on my bed
um but they're flannel sheets in their
warmth and there's no reason for me to
like make my room exactly how I want it
anymore because this is the last time
I'm gonna be living in it
my parents are planning on moving soon
and I'm not coming home for the summer
so don't mind my own Q room in the
background or the show I still haven't
unpacked when I show you my outfit in
the mirror okay so I'm just wearing this
black tank from fabletics I think sports
bra from Nike some of my favorite
leggings from Lululemon they're just
crops like so and yeah I wear Nike
Roush's to the gym spot the pig sheets
and the box I got from she and last
night don't worry I'm gonna do a haul so
yeah okay so I just got back from the
gym and then had my business call
but I just wanted to show you this ice
cream okay I just ate my leftover pasta
from last night but I'm gonna have a
little bit of this I'm sure a lot of you
have heard of halo top cuz I think it's
pretty popular but basically the big
number on the front is the entire amount
of calories in the whole pint and 320
this is like one of the most caloric
flavors but they have a bunch of flavors
I know some of them are like 250
calories I think in the entire pint
which is not a lot considering you know
the calories in like Ben and Jerry's and
stuff this is not sponsored at all
literally just my friends at school like
recommended it to me so this is the
peanut butter cup it's really good I
thought these would taste gross because
I tried Arctic to zero which has like 75
calories in the whole pint and it was so
gross it taste like protein powder but
this is so good and I also have one at
school I think it's like chocolate mocha
chip or something and it's also super
good and creamy so I honestly think this
is like the only ice cream I'm going to
buy from now on just so I don't feel as
bad about eating it but I totally
recommend it if you
have tried it come on your favorite
flavor down below because I want to try
new flavors I'm just like I love peanut
butter and chocolate so yeah
this one is really good I'm gonna eat
some of this and then I think I'm going
snowshoeing with one of my friends Liz
so I will take you guys along you guys
I'm just looking at my window right now
and look how fat this squirrel is I
think this is the fattest squirrel I've
ever seen like is it not massive I
wanted to move so you can see oh my gosh
it totally sees me it's so fat ah little
squirrel big squirrel this is what I do
in my spare time oh hey introduce
yourself to vlogmas we should follow me
on my own joy youtube don't follow is
she made a youtube channel and like
senior year it was not a youtube channel
we're trying to snowshoe I think last
time we snowshoed we got lost right we
are at the beautiful Beaver Lake Nature
Center if you've stalked me and try to
find where I live I'm only living here
it's my last time so have fun yeah maybe
not
alright then we go well we haven't even
walked like a tenth of a mile and both
of our snowshoes are falling off but I
thought this was like super pretty so ah
snowshoes fun just winter things well
they kept falling off our feet so we're
just gonna walk like normal
oh well bye snowshoes we'll get you
later okay watch a focus on you okay
yeah we made it to this pretty spot my
camera's gonna die but I thought I'd
show you it's pretty it's also really
cold so I'm like sniffily but
yeah whoo-hoo
hi guys my vlog camera is like a bout to
die so hopefully it doesn't die while
I'm filming this but I basically just
showered and got ready it's a lot later
now it's like 8:20 but I'm gonna go over
to Melanie's house and then I think from
there we're going to this place called
row G I hope I'm pronouncing that right
Virgie tea lounge in downtown Syracuse
some of our other friends might be
coming as well but I've never been there
before and she says it's like really
cool and it's open until midnight so
yeah I think we're going there I'm
wearing this sweater that I just got
from she in I'll probably I'll be
putting it in a hall and then this
choker I got from the Melrose trading
post in LA and then my hair I just kind
of like let it dry I like blue drone
blue dry what blow-dried it a little bit
but yeah so we'll update you guys it's
the killer wallet why can't I speak if
the quality is not as good later on it's
because I'm using my phone because my
camera died but yeah you guys want to
sell we got rose tea rose this
is really good so I'm back now I didn't
vlog a ton but basically we went to the
veggie TT lounge yeah
Roshi teen lounge it was really cute I
really liked it a lot umm I posted a
photo on my Instagram so I'll put it
here if you guys don't follow me
you should go follow me um yeah cuz I
post a lot on there and then we went to
Holly's which is the best place to get
chicken tenders ever and like I wasn't
even hungry and I ate some of them I'm
like really trying to be healthy so it's
not working but you know I worked out
today twice so that was okay but now I'm
just sitting here I think I'm gonna
watch something on Netflix because Tyler
the one who was just in the vlog told me
that Chelsea Handler has some like
really funny stuff on Netflix and I love
Chelsea Handler like I literally feel
like Chelsea Handler is mean me of the
future like I'm not even kidding
her personality is like what I wish mine
could be like I don't I don't know like
what she says I think but like I
wouldn't be able to say it you know what
I mean I just love her so yeah I think
I'm just gonna watch some of that I'm
really cold I didn't wear a jacket and
it's like 12 degrees out but I just hate
jackets because they literally ruin
outfit you know like this was so cute
but if I wore a jacket you would even be
able to see this off the shoulder so I
was freezing it was my fault okay so I
thought there was one about Rob
Kardashian but I'm not seeing it so I
mean they're gonna watch the one with
Cameron Dallas because social media
theme or Jennifer Aniston because who
doesn't like Jennifer Aniston</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
