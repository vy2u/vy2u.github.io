for you and I don't think I've ever done
nail tutorial before so this is the
first and I just kind of thought of this
I've actually never done before I did it
in this tutorial so if it's not the best
don't hate me uh-huh but anyways I did
in yang nails and it looked like this I
didn't do them on all of my fingers just
because I felt like that'd be really
time consuming and I just didn't want it
to take too long so I just did it on my
thumbs and my ring finger nails and then
I just did the rest white obviously you
don't have to use black and white you
can use any colors you want I just kind
of wanted to use the classic colors for
mine but um yeah you know do whatever
you want and it's actually really really
easy and you only need a few things so i
will show you what those on now okay ask
for nail polishes you're just going to
need a base coat i mean i guess you
don't really need this I just like
putting on base coat so my nails don't
get stained um and I use the instant
artificials a one and a key you can get
this from Sally's and I really love this
um it makes your nails really hard and
keeps them from breaking and you're
gonna need a white nail polish I really
just any color of your choice once again
if you don't want to use white this is
in LA colors it's really not good this
is like a cheap one but I don't like
white on my nails so that's why I don't
have a nice quality one but any white
nail polish will do the last nail polish
you're gonna need is just a black
striper and if you don't know what a
striper is it's basically just a nail
polish with a really thin brush as you
can see and these are really great if
you're doing designs on your nails so a
black one of these that would be ideal
the last thing you're gonna need is a
dotting tool I'm cheap I don't go and
buy fancy dotting tools or whatever so
I'm just using the end of a bobby pin
you know with the little rubber things
on them um yeah that's all you need and
then you need like a little piece of
paper or something to put the polish on
when you're going to be guarding it I'm
just using like this tag about you know
you can use whatever you let everything
you need to these nails and I hope you
guys enjoy this I don't recommend doing
a top coat by the way because I tried to
do a top coat on this nail and it
smudged the black and I had to like go
over and yeaa is bad so I don't
recommend it
coat because it might sneer your colors
together and you don't want that but
yeah so if you want to learn how to do
this band watching using your base coat
apply this to all of your nails this
will keep your nails from turning yellow
and getting stained from your polish
next take your white nail polish apiece
and apply this to all of your nails do
as many coats as you need I needed about
to taking a black striper draw the
yin-yang design it's really easy you
just do kind of a swirly diagonal line
it's almost straight but it has a little
bit of a curve and then you're just
going to fill in one side of the line
which made
now when we got them just take your
black striper and put dots in the white
section it's really easy and it creates
a nice dot for you
add to nail polish on to your little
piece of cardboard or tag or ever you're
using and then just if you're dying to
open it and simply it up a little dot on
the black side of your design and you're
done I hope you guys enjoyed this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
