as you can probably tell by the title
this is going to be a haul video from
zach cool calm which is one of those
online Asian websites that you see all
the time on Facebook so pretty much what
happened is zaple contacted me Nia asked
me if I wanted to do a video for them
and at first I wasn't going to just
because you guys probably know with
these Asian websites sometimes the
clothes you get don't look like the
pictures that you see online so I was
like okay well like why would I want to
do this for a brand that might not be
like reliable and then I thought about
it and I thought okay well a lot of my
viewers might be wondering if they
should order from example or what some
things will look like so I decided I
would do the video with them that way I
wouldn't have to pay for the items and I
could kind of show you guys the quality
and things in correlation with the
pictures so I got like a bunch of
different types of things I got some
shoes some bathing suits and jewelry and
some clothes so we can kind of see like
the whole realm of things example and
I'm also going to do is when I'm showing
you the item I'll put up the picture of
what it looks like on the website so you
can kind of like compare and see but
yeah I'm actually pretty happy with
everything that I got which is
surprising because most of the times
when I do do you hauls from these types
of websites there's a few things that I
really don't like but I like most of it
so I'm just going to show you I thought
this video would be kind of helpful and
fun to watch oh by the way let me know
if you like me filming in front of my
tapestry or if you like it better when
it's just a blank wall because I might
take it down I'm not totally sure yet
cuz if you guys if it's like distracting
and you think it looks better with a
blank wall then I'll take it down
because it's like the best for me to
film here with like lighting and stuff
but let me know what you guys think so
anyways I got two jewelry items the
first one are these earrings I'm
probably not going to take them out of
the bag but I'll show you them all
closed it's actually already broken I
didn't even notice that this earring is
already broken so okay
you okay so this is what it looks like
and as you can see this white Jam was
already falling out of its spot it's
literally like supposed to be in there
and it's falling out so that sucks don't
get jewelry whose Apple the next thing I
got is one of those like popular body
chains I haven't even taken it out so we
can do it like right now and hope that
it's not broken
cuz I think these are super cute ah this
is okay so I think I figured it out I'm
pretty sure I really don't know how this
works but it looks like it's all in one
piece so this one looks fine this was
like really cheap and it's one of those
like body chains you'll see in the
picture but yeah once I figure out how
to use this I'm pretty sure this he's
fine okay so moving on I got a pair of
shoes from Zappala so these are like the
really trendy kind of pointed toe flats
that I've been seeing everywhere that
like lace-up and the first thing I
notice is that these smell really weird
um just like really artificial but
they're really cute and they fit me and
I think they're nice so they look like
this I can kind of like get over the
scent um as you can see they like tie up
I think these are so cute and I've been
wanting a pair and these actually look
like decent quality I mean they're
obviously not like amazing but I think
they look pretty good I got a size 37
and for reference I'm about a six and a
half or a seven so if you're looking to
purchase these I really like these they
look just like the photos online and
yeah okay I got two bathing suits and I
know bathing suits are a really popular
item on sale because they have a ton and
they're all really cute and trendy so I
was very interested to see how they
would like match up with the pictures
online so the first one I got I really
like and I think it looks almost just
like the one online it's not just like
it
so it's this burgundy color top I've
been seeing this all over different
types of websites let's like style top
and yeah it's really cute the back is
kind of like weird um it has like two
straight across straps and then it has
like this and the straps were a little
bit big on me I got a small and they're
a little bit big and then the bottoms
are really cheeky so if you're not into
cheeky bottoms
I wouldn't recommend this there's a
little bit of a string coming loose on
the bottoms but you could easily fix
that and as you can see they're just
really cheeky I really love this
material the next suit I got it actually
sold on Poshmark just because it didn't
fit me like how I wanted it to it was
like a triangle style top and I don't
really wear those a lot because I have
no boobs but I took some photos of it
before and I did really liked it it was
a cute suit it was a nice material but I
believe it looked a little bit different
on the website I'm not totally sure but
you'll see the two photos here I flicked
the straps were different I don't know
it wasn't so different that I was like
opened it and was mad but it was
definitely a little bit different but
still a cute suit okay the next thing I
got from example is a little bit frankly
but I actually really like it it's a
dress now I think on the website the
material looked a little different I
could be wrong but other than that the
dress is the same it's just a red and
white like boho pattern dress and it's
really cute I like it it's super wrinkly
I feel like the material online looked a
little bit more like a free people
material I don't know how to explain it
not quite this material but this is
still cute the only thing about this is
it's pretty short and I'm only five foot
one and it's like short on me so if
you're ready taller than me and you are
interested in this it'll probably be
like a tunic on you but yeah I still
think it's cute and I'm happy with this
purchase it's like lying as well so
that's nice full girls are really trendy
now like overall shorts and stuff and I
wanted to pick some up but I didn't
really want to buy any because they can
be kind of pricey so when I saw them
example I was like okay so the first
pair I got are these white pair of just
like overall shorts
and I think they're really cute they
have some distressing on them and
overall I think they're really cute and
nice the only thing is they are a little
bit small on me I got a small and I'm
pretty small I don't know how the medium
would fit I'm always like nervous about
sizing but the straps are adjustable so
pretty much I adjusted them like down
most of the way and they're not super
small so they're pretty good I would
recommend maybe getting a size up and if
you're like in between sizes definitely
go up but I think they're really cute
they have some nice distressing and
pockets and overall I'm happy with these
going along with the overall trend
I got an overall style dress which I
thought was really cute and unique it's
not only buckled right now so I'm
buckling it but it's like a black down
color so as you can see it's just black
denim like a little mini dress this is
really short once again so if you're
tall I don't necessarily recommend this
but yeah I think this is really cute and
I was overall happy with this item okay
next this is the item that I think I'm
most upset about other than those
earrings because I didn't know those
broke but this dress was not this
material on the website at all so this
is what I got it's uh it's like a cotton
not even kind it's like a spandex II
cotton dress with like straps like that
and crossing straps in the back let me
come closer and show you the material
okay so hopefully you can see that it's
literally just like a cotton II like
t-shirt material okay
okay so I'm like 90% sure that on the
website this was like a chiffon material
or more like a fancy material okay the
second to last item from Nashville is a
disrupter on a bunch of different
websites or a bunch of different stores
I saw that LF when I was in Elif and I
saw it
and Shoko and I really liked it and then
I saw it on Zappos so I was like okay
and I haven't tried this on yet but it
looks pretty good it's just like a black
and cream laced romper and it goes down
like this it looks like a dress but um
they're shorts and yeah I mean it's not
as like sturdy as the one I saw it LF
but it looks just like it and I'm it's
not like you always every day so I'm
sure with like they use that I'll be
getting out of it it's fine but the
baxley cool and like it's all crisscross
II uh see this did not come lace so I
had the laces myself but like that
wasn't a huge issue okay so the very
last item i got from example i am very
happy with so basically on these asian
websites a lot of times they'll like
remake free people items and most of the
time they don't really look like them
the materials off and that's it I saw
this romper and I figured it would be
like the same kind of situation because
I saw in four people I wanted it didn't
get it saw Don's Apple so it looks like
this really really cute looks super nice
and then you look at the tag okay if
you're familiar with free people like me
this is literally like a replica of a
free people tag so I don't know if these
websites are getting really technical
with their free people dupes or what but
this is literally a free people tag I
mean I'm almost positive this is not
actually free people because that
wouldn't make any sense but I just
thought it was like very interesting
that they had the tag and everything and
this looks like identical to the wine
store like the materials really nice and
yeah I don't know I really like this so
I'm not complaining I just thought that
was something interesting so yeah that
is everything that I got off of zaple
calm since I called a lot of different
Asian websites before like she in and
way I kind of know what to look for and
know what to stay away from on these
types of websites so I don't know if I'm
just good at picking out what to get and
I stayed away from the bad things but
for the most part I liked everything and
I think safe to choose from anything
that I showed you yeah so I just want to
make it clear that although they don't
send me these items for this video
everything is 100% honest I'm always
honest Levi's I never lie about products
and yeah like most of them with the
exception of a few of those items but
