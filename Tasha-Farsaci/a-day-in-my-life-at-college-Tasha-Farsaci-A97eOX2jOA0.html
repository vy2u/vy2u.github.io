today I am filming a college man life
because I haven't done one of these in a
hot minute in case you guys are new to
my channel I am a junior at USC the
University of Southern California and I
am a communication major so that's kind
of the basis of my college status yeah
so today I am doing a day in the life
sometimes I do week in the lives so
please let me know which ones you guys
prefer down below because I feel like in
day and alive I can get more in depth to
each day but we can lives lives lifes I
kind of skim over each day more so let
me know what you like more and also
please let me know what content you like
seeing in these videos because obviously
I want to film the stuff that you guys
like seeing so yeah totally leave that
down below okay so I basically just woke
up and got ready I'll show you guys my
outfit in a minute but today I just have
two classes it's kind of a long chunk of
the day though it's like a 4-hour chunk
and before that I am going to get lunch
at all 50 my sorority so I'll show you
guys that when I'm there but I'm
currently just packing up my backpack
for the day putting stuff in it and I
want to show you guys this new snack I
found okay so I don't know about you
guys but when I have super long blocks
with classes at once I get really hungry
in between but personally I don't really
like buying food on campus because at
USC it's really really overpriced
especially when food is included in my
dues at alpha fees so I like to go there
as much as I can but if I'm on campus
and can't leave campus obviously I can't
go to alpha fees so I just found these
new bars I have like the box right here
there are X bars okay so I'm sure you
guys have seen these before I think
they're pretty popular and they're like
super aesthetically pleasing so this is
what they look like and thank you so
much to our X bar for actually
sponsoring this video that's awesome
because I literally love your products
okay if you guys follow me you know I'm
not the healthiest either on the planet
but I really do try and eat healthy when
I can especially when it's just snacking
in between classes and rx bars are super
healthy and honestly the ingredients are
just
so simple their core ingredients are
three egg whites two dates and six
almonds I believe which is just really
all a good stuff they come in eleven
different flavors so you're bound to
find one you like and they are soy free
gluten free and dairy free yeah but like
I said I think these bars are the
perfect thing to throw in your bag for
class or if you're just running late in
the morning I think my favorite is this
peanut butter chocolate one I must
sucker for peanut butter and chocolate I
think I'm gonna bring this blueberry one
and I do have a special little code for
you guys if you guys go to our X bar
comm slash Tasha and use the code Tasha
you can get 25% off so you're welcome
you guys should totally try them I think
they're awesome and they're perfect for
a college student or if you're not a
college student they're still really
good so I actually switched backpacks
I'm now using the JanSport that I got on
midday and this is the perfect spot for
my bar so there we go
okay guys as for my outfit today it's
like pretty simple but it has a little
bit of extra detail I guess so I'm just
wearing this black bodysuit from brandy
melville it's super simple super comfy
wearing these jeans from redone my
little Gucci belt and then I'm wearing
these super fun shoes from Steven by
Steve Madden they're just these little
cheetah print mules I thought they just
added a lot to this outfit and then I'm
wearing my new Ray Ban sunglasses I
think these are the round double bridge
ones I'll try and link as much as I can
from this outfit down below now I'm off
to alpha fee to get some lunch I will of
course insert a photo of the lunch here
because I remember you guys like that
from when I was doing vlogmas so yeah
introduce yourself yeah
I'm Tasha big I'm pretty cool I'm pretty
much the what do you want to know
about me I don't know just
well one fun fact as I Drive my car to
the RO because I'm too lazy to walk so
which I should be about so close to
literally so close it's pathetic like
Tosh Night Live probably a pool and it's
to all drive here and it's like maybe
three more bar three I've never filmed
on my iPhone X before and it's such good
video quality it's a good quality
yeah Devon we're driving with Brooke
Brooke and I have what do you I don't
even know what the class is we have a
class together
it's an awful size it's pretty bad I
wouldn't recommend it but it's also
required for us it's like communication
and statistics and and like research
yeah so Brooke drives to the road and
then back home and then we'll walk that
what's going on here's the road I is
this is a nice way to get a view
it's also really hot today like the
weather fluctuates so when it's really
hot you'll find me in my car is hot I
like worked up a sweat it
it's a great tour of the row have you
ever shopped around your videos I mean
only while I've been walking so it
hasn't been like
it's like a fast forward version without
fast forwarding hey guys so I just got
back from class it's around 4 p.m. right
now I'd really film any of my Spanish
class just because it's a really small
class that would have been super awkward
but basically I had my comm class that
you guys saw a little bit of and then
right after that I had a two hour
Spanish class which is honestly a lot of
Spanish like I took Spanish in high
school and the classes were like 40
minutes we're like 50 minutes or
something so sitting in there for two
hours is a lot but I only have it twice
a week I couldn't either
I either could have done four times a
week and an hour each class or twice a
week for two hours so I picked the twice
a week for two hours let me know what
you guys would choose because I know so
many people choose the four times a week
for an hour and now after I've been
taking it for two hours I kind of wish I
did that but I'm also really glad I
don't have it like four days a week so
yeah let me know but basically right now
I'm just about to chill and probably
watch The Bachelor for a bit but I got a
package in the mail this is not like
sponsored or anything they didn't ask me
to put this in but a website called The
Rose Shire they send like beautifully
packaged roses they emailed me and they
were like hey like do you want some
roses for Valentine's Day and I was like
yeah like I'm not gonna get them from a
boy so please I love flowers so much I
get that for my mom and now I need to
find a vase somewhere because the oume
vase here I might honestly go to the
fifth store and find a base because I
looked at the target here and it's like
a mini target so they didn't have one so
I might check out Goodwill okay guys so
this is the box I put my phone over the
shipping label just so you couldn't see
my address obviously but this is a huge
box so I'm so excited oh my gosh guys
look how pretty these are
these are like the prettiest roses I've
ever seen
oh thanks rose Shire oh my gosh I love
these yeah so like I said I missed the
bachelor last night so I'm about to
watch it on Hulu and then I'm gonna go
get some dinner at Alfea
I really know what I'm gonna do tonight
I don't really have too much work to do
but I think Ann Marie and I are gonna
work out at the gym at some point so
yeah let me know what you guys think
about this season of The Bachelor if
