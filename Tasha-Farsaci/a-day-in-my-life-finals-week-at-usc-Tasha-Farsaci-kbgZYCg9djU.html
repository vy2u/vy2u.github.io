basically just woke up and then edit a
to vlog mix from yesterday uploaded that
and then got dressed
I don't want makeup on yeah I'm gonna do
that in a few minutes but I just want to
take it up and make some coffee and some
toast first
I'd only know exactly what I'm gonna do
today I know I want to finish writing my
final paper for a class and I need to go
back a t-mobile I don't know I guess
I'll figure it out but yeah sorry I've
like these days I've been getting kind
of boring it's just like a lot of like
last-minute studying and planning and I
definitely need to start packing for
Paris as well so yeah i'll show you my
full outfit after i like it completely
get ready okay so i'm going to attempt
to make iced coffee
normally when i make iced coffee i make
it and then put it in the fridge until
it's cold and then i sit but i'm too
lazy for that right now I don't have
time so I'm literally using the cup from
yesterday and then I'm gonna try and
just do it in there with ice I know it
probably won't be that good and the ice
would just melt and it'll be watery but
you know a girl's gonna do what a girl's
got to do
okay guys so I just put a little bit of
makeup on and I literally found out it's
like 80 degrees out so I don't think it
would be wearing this sweater I'm
probably gonna change after this clip
but today I'm opening my dude gift for a
day ten I'm gonna make sure I say this
on every blog in case you guys are new
and don't look
don't know what do't is there an online
shopping app they sent me a gift to open
every day of vlogmas that is something
you could buy on their app they
basically it's like kind of like an
online or mobile mall they have like a
ton of stores in there and you can just
order from them all on your phone all in
one place it saves your card so just
look super easy if you guys want to
order from there I'll put the link in
the description if you use the code
Tasha at checkout you get five dollars
off and free shipping so that's super
great because a lot of those stores
don't have free shipping you know what I
mean so I'm giving you that and then
five dollars with the code Tasha so yeah
day ten okay day time
oh this looks fun what is this oh this
is a fuzzy cropped sweater this is a
really cute I don't have anything that's
like super bright pink color but this is
really really cute like I would be
wearing this today if it's not
apparently like eighty degrees but it's
from forever 21 and it's just like a
super neon coral color and its really
really fuzzy one of my favorite trends
right now is the whole like fuzzy
sweater fuzzy coat trend cuz they're so
comfortable but they're also like really
cute so yeah he thinks don't okay so I
changed into this alpha' fiche shirt
it's just from the social life yeah and
then I have these jeans on from Topshop
and then my new pinky nude and white
checkered vans so yeah hopefully this
works out I went through yesterday
anyway
a whole hassle so yeah let's see guys I
was wondering why these vans help bigger
than my other ones and I looked and I
got a men's six and a half instead of a
women's so these are legal women's eight
so they're kind of big but they're not
like falling off so I guess I'm just
gonna keep them well I'm literally so
dumb I don't know why I assumed they
were women
guys I'm literally so shook about my
shoes I'm also so confused why they fit
on my feet and aren't falling off
because I'm literally a six and a half
and these are an eight okay so like two
hours later I'm finally back from
t-mobile that was a disaster
basically they were just like so many
little hidden charges and things that
they didn't originally tell me about but
I ended up just like paying for it
because I really really need to have
service well I'm in Paris yeah that was
a hassle when I'm like switching my
phone number over from Virgin Mobile
Virgin Mobile like didn't want me to
switch and they were giving me a hard
time
oh I'm finally back I hate doing that
kind of stuff
I just post mated lemonade hi this is so
annoying because we have a lemonade on
campus but it's not open on weekends so
the one time I actually really want
lemonade I postmates it but luckily we
still have free delivery for post mates
so yeah i'll show you what i got when
that comes but yeah i kind of wanted to
go to campus to do work but since it's
finals it's so packed and there's never
a space to find to do work in and
there's definitely never like any
outlets nearby so that's kind of
annoying because like i kind of want to
go to campus but i might just stay here
and like finish my paper here because
now i have post mates coming here oh my
gosh guys
false alarm post needs texted me and
they're like oh we don't have what you
ordered so i just canceled the order so
now I don't know what I'm gonna get I
guess I could just get something around
campus but I don't know I still want
five guys but I'm trying to be somewhat
healthy today okay update so I ordered
from this random cafe that's kind of new
USC called bird's nest cafe and I got a
kale Caesar salad and truffle fries I
didn't just want a salad like when I was
ordering from lemonade I was gonna get
mac and cheese and then like their salad
stuff but one of the salads I really
wanted was sold out so this is balanced
people I'm getting a kale Caesar and
truffle fries okay guys so here's this
salad and then oh my gosh the truffle
fries are huge like I thought it would
be like a side but there's so many
so oh well you guys just to give you a
representation and this is my hand and
this is the thing of fries oh my god
of course I was like oh I'm gonna try
and be healthy and get a salad with a
side of fries and the fries are like the
size of my head like I should have just
gotten five guys at this point final
verdict the salad is not good I don't
like it I don't know there's something
off about it but the fries are a plus
okay guys so I just wanted to put this
in here really quickly I'm reading
comments on my blog from yesterday and
people are getting like really offended
or not even offended but they're saying
that I shouldn't like put myself down or
call myself like ugly or like a trash
can I think yesterday yesterday I said
pail roadkill and okay obviously it's
like joking like okay clearly when I
wake up in the morning and feel really
gross and have like marks on my face to
my pillow and I'm like greasy like I
don't look as good as I do and don't
feel as confident as I do you know what
I already to go out but I kind of do it
it's like comic relief like oh I look
like a cabbage like it's just like my
way of like saying things like if you
ask my friends I'm always like aw I look
like a toe and I'm not actually being
like oh my god I hate how I look it's
just like it's just like me that's like
what I do obviously I don't think I look
great so I'm like you know just claiming
that but I'm not trying to like put
myself down or make anyone feel bad
about themselves if you guys thought I
looked good which like if you did thanks
because but yeah when I say that stuff
about myself I'm not like you know
trying to actually like feel bad about
myself I think it's just kind of like
funny but yeah so I'm not trying to not
trying to offend it's just trying to get
some laughs out here ladies and gents
guys I thought I should try on my little
do't vlogmas gift from today so here's
this footer I think it's so fun I
literally never ever wear this color but
yeah that's so fun and they're getting
me to go out of my comfort zone I
literally feel like Barbie or something
or
like I'm in Legally Blonde or something
like that
it's so cute I would literally wear this
tomorrow but it's been like 80 degrees
in LA so que la but yeah it's so fuzzy
let me know what you guys think and if
you think pink hot pink as a color is it
look for me because I just kind of stay
away from it I feel like with my blonde
hair I would look too much like a Barbie
