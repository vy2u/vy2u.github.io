I sent you
okay so the store I'm going to start off
with first is Urban Outfitters okay so I
got some denim from Earvin which I am
really really excited about so these
ones are super cool I've never had a
pair of jeans that are this color they
are the girlfriend high rise and they're
kind of like an ivory they look white on
camera but they're an ivory color and
then they go down they have some rips
minis the bottoms are distressed which I
really like and they kind of have like
almost an acid wash I don't know if
you're going to be able to see on camera
but at the bottom they have a little bit
of like a flattering the fact it's
really hard to see but it's definitely
there and these are really cool they're
very unique
so I'm excited to style these next is
the mom high-rise and they're just like
a washed black color they're not super
darts they're more like a grey which I
like and there's kind of like your
average boyfriend mom style Jean the
bottoms are cuffed and you can just call
it so comfortable and I love
high-waisted pants I literally only wear
high risk' pants because they just cover
the food baby you know all those rolls
okay
these jeans I am open in love with I
didn't take the tags off yet I wanted to
wear these but I wanted to leave the
tags on for the video but these are the
mom high rise once again except these
ones are destroyed and these are so such
so passionate
these are so high-waisted I love them
and then they have some little grips on
the back as well last pair of jeans are
the girlfriend Jean these one I'm not
probably on yet but I think they're just
going to be more like a skinny fit but
not like super super tight so maybe just
kind of like a maybe mid medium wash
denim there high rise which is amazing
and then they just go down like this so
yeah okay another denim piece I've seen
a few youtubers haul this okay this
jacket is super cool I actually wore it
in some pictures that I took on the 4th
of July I'll put those here but it's
awesome it's basically this like
different colored denim tone jacket I
got a side extra small and it's kind of
just a cropped but also Lewis this is
just so fun and it's just very different
I really like it and I think it's like a
fun kind of statement piece but it still
goes with like so much I have an
obsessive stripes lately this is on a
size small it's this really cute little
striped crop top from urban love this
this is going to go well with so many
things basically in my staple outfit for
going out or doing anywhere is a little
crop top with high risk genes so this is
great going with the trend right now
once again with a little crop top trend
this isn't this beautiful tomato red
color I am in love with red right now I
think it's so flattering are you
something to look to go bad on me but
now I've changed my mind
I think red looks good on everyone so
it's this really cute little cropped
smock
off the shoulder top this leaves our
adorable laptop in urban is this cute
little floral off-the-shoulder baby your
water just call it a baby I hate myself
anyway if the shoulders are kind of
poopy but it's really cute right now I
just think this is going to be great
once again a nice little crop top to
wear ok moving in to the dresses and
rompers I got this white romper I
thought was a match with so much it's
just this little like mock wrap dress
romper and I got in white because like I
said I'm at a ton it kind of ties in the
front and looks like a wrap dress and
the material mmus is so so soft so I
definitely definitely recommend this I
know they have this in a bunch of color
i goaded into jumpsuits lately and I
love that a lot of jumpsuits are cropped
because I'm so short so normally I can't
go with a jumpsuit trend but because
they've been cropped lately I can
totally jump on the bandwagon so I got
this black jumpsuit but it looks like a
washed black so it's not straight like
jet black but anyway it looks like this
it has these thin straps that same
really soft material and then it just
goes out into these flared cropped pants
this is going to match with so much and
it's going to be so comfortable and airy
and breezy for the summer and the back
is kind of low and strappy so I think
this is just like a staple piece if you
want to try out to jump your trend this
one's pretty basic but it's so soft and
it'll go with so much going along with
me things I like the cropped jumpsuit
trend I've also been loving mini dresses
I don't know I used to think they were
such a weird length but lately I've been
obsessed in them so I picked up this
floral midi dress and it's just really
really flowy super loose super girly and
then the back has this really cute
detailing these little um ringing on the
straps I don't know I just thought that
was a little something okay and the last
thing from Urban is probably my favorite
I wanted it for awhile and I think it's
so cute it's another jumpsuit so yeah
it's a straddle jumpsuit it's hinges at
the waist and then it goes down into the
same kind of cropped pants I think this
will look so cute with a denim jacket
and I'm loving the colors together in
this okay moving on I got some stuff
from misguided and before I forget I do
two coats always guided it's Tasha 30
and that is 30 percent off everything
excluding sale so that's a pretty good
deal I'll put that here as well as in
the description you guys should totally
absolutely check that out okay first
thing I got are some nipple petal
pasties I love these things these are
great for small boobs because we only
need a bra for support but if you don't
want to miss because I don't know about
you guys but I constantly am missing I
can be hot and I'll be nipping so these
are great of 25 uses lovely I'll show
you the shoes I got some misguided so
first are these little babies I've been
wanting a pair of shoes like this for a
while these are just black both suede
heel with a little ankle strap I think
these match so many things I have a pair
like this and new that I wear a lot so I
thought I would pick these up and then I
also grabbed these really really cute
studded sandals they're just black
sandals with some gold studs on them
just a little a little something more
than just a plain black sandal so I
thought they'd be really cute okay guys
so I did something a little bit crazy I
got the same set from misguided in four
colors I can explain okay first of all
it was petite which means it'll probably
fit me because I'm really short second
of all I just thought it was really cute
and it's going to be perfect for going
out and third of all all the colors were
amazing
so I guess I'll show you what it is
first
the first color I'm going to show you is
the craziest color it's done our comfort
zone but yellow is really in and I
really like it so basically it's just a
bandage set so it comes with a bandage
top okay and then it comes with a little
bandage skirt to match so I just think
this looks so cute together you know for
going out or for like events or whatever
because it's really really flattering
you can see a little bit of skin and
this color is so fun I need to be like
really tan before rooibos so of course I
had to get it in black here's the top
and then I'm really dumb and
accidentally got to of the skirt but
here's the skirt I think my favorite
color that I got
and is this new blush pink color so
there's the top and then here is the
little skirt oh we are not done one more
I got it in red because like I was
saying I'm loving red right now I think
it's just such a statement color and yes
here is the skirt so this is not a
thickest bandage material I've ever felt
it's not you know super thick and like
sucking you in like most bandage things
are but what a price this was a super
affordable I think it's fine and it's
still really flattering and I like it a
lot
oh my gosh I got another stripes
jumpsuit what a surprise okay so this
one is it's black yeah black and pink
and white stripes is a little like
roughly thing up here and then once
again the little cropped jumpsuit legs
this is so light and airy and once again
it's going to be perfect for the hot
weather I picked up this skirt mainly
through work I work from home so I don't
really have to dress from work but
sometimes like I did a few weeks ago I
went to San Francisco to work for weeks
so I wanted more like professional
clothes or just things that are more
conservative because I do wear a lot of
like mini dresses and mini skirts and
crop tops
so this skirt was just like a little bit
longer than my normal first it's
basically this black skirt and then it
has this really pretty sequin embroidery
on it I just thought it was something
different and it looks a little bit more
fancy and it is a longer length so yeah
I know some people are probably going to
be like that's still really short but it
is longer than what I have and I think
it's appropriate for the office but I
work in okay I got this dress probably
for you know going out or events if I go
to like invites or whatever in college
but it's this faux suede dress with
these silver stubs on it really cool
really flattering the materials look
pretty sick on this one which is what I
like with tight-fitting stuff and
there's still the sequins or not the
sequins like a studs on the back one of
my biggest pet peeves is when things
have things on the front not the back
after that skirt is like that but
I'll get over it the last two things I
not ours right this one who know I feel
about it I'm not obsessed with it
there's nothing wrong with it I just
don't don't love it
let me know what you guys think it's
this little romper it looks like this it
needs to be ironed but I have kind of
with a little overlay and then it goes
down and shorts
I think this want to run a little bit
small it's a little bit tighter on me
than I would want
I got a zero so yeah I would get a size
up I'd say and then the back is just
normal okay
another strike to romper it looks like
this has little off the shoulder sleeve
and then goes into shorts the material
on this one is really really thin but I
think if I were nude underwear it'll be
fine because still really cute last
thing from excited I got like a three
pack of grey socks because I'm always
losing my socks like I always lose one
sock okay the last store and this home
ayo is necessary clothing and I got so
many stretch things oh my gosh you guys
probably think I'm insane
alright so first is this awesome I'm
going to say awesome not cute striped
romper white and light blue and then
these little got in the front tie I
thought this was so adorable so yeah and
this one has built-in pads so you don't
need to worry about broth or nipping or
whatever okay I also got this denim
skirts necessary clothing I actually
wore this yesterday on the 4th of July
I'm trying to button it so it's this
two-tone denim miniskirt this is so cool
and so shiny right now I love it
it has a light wash and a dark wash and
it's just a dress and stuff so yeah this
was super cute for the fort and just
really good with a lot about fit oh boy
more straight another stripe Trumper Who
am I
this one is cool as well it's more
structured it's black and white stripes
it has this little cutout guy in the
middle and then these little
off-the-shoulder ties and then the bass
tips and this one also has pads so no
need to worry about the nips ladies
oh by
some other another strikes robbers I
hate myself so I really don't know how
to show this when I pulled it out of the
package I was really confused as to how
this is supposed to work so yeah we'll
see once I try it on I don't really know
what's going on here but I squared lips
tune online so we'll see if it looks
cute on me I picked up these two tone
genes necessary clothing I haven't tried
these on yet so I'm hoping they're not
too big but they look super super cool
kind of like a skirt but just like the
Jean version so yeah I'm super stoked
about these all right last type thing in
this haul is this little pair of striped
shorts
they came to the top I didn't come at
the top you could have bought the top
but I didn't because I just thought I'd
wear like a white top of them but the
top of them would be so cute as well so
they look like this they have some ties
which I love on shorts and yeah I just
think people go with a lot and as you
all know by now I'm loving starts right
now
so yeah almost done I found me really
cute shorts and I want to be is because
they remind me a lot of one he's do in
short there's a pair of 1 teaspoon
chores to look very similar than use but
they're so expensive and I didn't want
to pay a lot for something that was like
and ordered like this in trendy you know
so I got these
they're basically black and we have
floral and what I love is the floral
extend the back on the back pocket once
again I just think that's a great detail
oh my gosh I just realized that one
started missing hmm maybe it's just
sitting in my bed somewhere I'm gonna
have to look okay and their very last
thing in this haul video is another red
crop top I love this so much
I think it's so cute I know it's kind of
similar someone from urban but like I
said my staple going out outfit is
high-waisted pants and a crop top so I
can never get enough crop tops this one
is just red has some really cute repple
and this one appeals really nicely made
it feels like it's really nice quality
so yeah I'm really really excited to
wear this little guy
yay so that is everything in this haul
