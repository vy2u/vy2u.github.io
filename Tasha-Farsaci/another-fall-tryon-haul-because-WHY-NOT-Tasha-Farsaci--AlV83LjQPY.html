money and make sure to click the link in
the description box to sign up for Yoona
days it's super easy and I totally
recommend it ok so now on to the stuff
that I got from Princess Holly I am
super excited they have the cutest stuff
okay so I've actually really been into
camo lately I know I'm kind of late
that trend but I grabbed this little
camo t-shirt I liked it because it's
like a regular tee so it has you know
the lining on the collar and the little
sleeves so I think this is really cute
I've worn it like tied up in a knot and
I've also just worn it by itself so I
really like this the next thing I got
I've also already worn I have so many
compliments on it it's this red floral
dress it's gonna be hard to show but
you'll see it in a try on it's basically
like I'll grab dressed with some red
flowers on it but it's so pretty it's so
girly and you'll definitely get
compliments because I did so I really
like it and I've been loving red lately
I think it's so flattering on everyone
okay the next thing I got is this yellow
top and it's super cool it's kind of
like a see-through material and I was
thinking of wearing like a black bra
under this I thought it would be pretty
cool so I got the ice it's just crapped
really cute I don't know about you guys
but I'm still not over gingham I still
love gingham so I grabbed this yellowy
gingham romper it's kind of wrinkly
right now but it's really cute like I
said I love yellow so yeah and robbers
are like my favorite things to wear I
think they're just so easy you don't
have to worry about your skirt riding up
because that always happens to me
whenever I'm wearing a backpack and
skirt or dress it really rides up and my
butt cheeks are definitely out so with a
romper that's not a problem I also got
this really adorable polkadot little
dress from princess Polly looks like
this and then in the front has a little
tie super adorable and so easy to just
throw on I'm in love with overalls I
think they're so cute so I love this
pair it's just a pair of light baby pink
corduroy overalls and they look kind of
oversized which I think will be really
cute maybe with just like a black tube
top or a tight black crop top something
like that okay so I have a lot of denim
jackets but all of mine have rips in
them it's super weird so I wanted to
grab one that doesn't have rips so I
picked up this Levi's denim jacket and I
think it's like the girlfriend fit or
the boyfriend pair or something but it's
just perfect it's medium wash there's no
rips I've already won this a bunch of
time
denim jackets are one of my favorite
things to wear so I love this it's great
quality it's never really gonna go out
of style
so yeah I picked up this red bodysuit it
looks like this it just have a little
tie in the front I'm gonna have to see
what bra or like sticky boob things I
can wear with this because the material
is super like slinky it's probably thin
it's just like a slinky material that
makes sense so I feel like you would
definitely be able to see my nipples in
through it but nevertheless it's really
cute I thought this with some like
boyfriend jeans would be really really
pretty
this next top I think is so fun I wore
this when I went to Puerto Vallarta
it's basically this floral top with
these super-fun sleeves and then it just
ties in the middle it's really cropped
you'll see it more on the Tryon but I
really like this I think it's so cute
for going out you know wearing with some
black jeans or black skirt and whatnot I
really really like it I grabbed these
shorts and princess Polly and I really
like them but they're a tiny bit snug
I'm hoping that they'll loosen up but
they're just he's denim shorts I can
never find perfect denim shorts so I'm
always on the hunt and I really like
these but like I said they're a tiny bit
small
okay last clothing item from princess
Polly I got is this snake print
miniskirt and I like it I haven't tried
it on yet I think it's like a little bit
longer than I thought it would be I am
super short so sometimes if miniskirts
aren't like really mini they like
awkwardly long on me but once I try this
on and let you know I really like snake
print and I thought the lace of detail
like was fun Plus
okay and the last thing from princess
Polly is this pair of heels I think
they're so cute I'm not gonna lie
they're pretty uncomfortable though I
have like dust on them right now I wore
these in Mexico as well but they're just
these chunky heel plain
strap sandals these match of sandals
heels heels sandals I guess but these
are really cute they match everything
like I said they're not the most
comfortable because there's not really a
huge platform but I think they look
really good so that kind of makes it
worth it in my opinion yeah so does
everything I got from princess Polly let
me know what your favorite thing was and
