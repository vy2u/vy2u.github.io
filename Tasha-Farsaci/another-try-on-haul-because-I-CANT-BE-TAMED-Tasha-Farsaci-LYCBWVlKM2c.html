channel so today I have another haul
video for you I know I've been doing
hold on hold on hold on hauls but I just
got a package in the mail from Princess
Polycom which is why like a new favorite
websites it's an Australian based
clothing website Australian clothing
websites of my absolute favorite I've
done a haul to them before so I want to
show you guys this new stuff I know you
guys love hauls but don't worry I have a
bunch of other videos and with Arnold
after I get all these halls up because I
just want to like show the stuff that I
got in the mail so I can like put it
away and you know if he done with it
anyways before I get into the clothing
haul if you guys are not following me on
social media namely Instagram it would
mean the world to me if you did I both
fly like Al Capone Rose it just photos
my friends it's just like my one
Instagram I don't have a separate
Instagram from YouTube and personal life
it's just all on theirs if you guys want
to see me on a more day-to-day crystal
basis totally follow me on there to be
awesome okay and I do have a coupon book
for you I don't know wait and write this
in staying put I will put it on the
screen as well as in the description box
so if you guys want 20% off how I check
that out I think it's a great way to
obviously save money and the stuff super
cute so I know you're going to want it
okay the first thing is this floral
romper I think it's so cute it goes off
the shoulder it has these little off the
shoulder sleeve and then it has kind of
like a front ruffle and then it just
goes down into these little shorts but
also have little ruffles on the bottom
so cute and so girly and this is going
to look so good if we can in the summer
so I'm absolutely obsessed with this
next is another lomper they have the
best rappers and robbers erotically some
of my favorite things because they're so
easy to just sew on and I've really
really been loving so lately so I saw
this one and I thought it was so cute
it's once again off the shoulders right
now
this one's just like a tube it's not off
the shoulder I don't think yeah it's
just like a little tube I like that so
it looks like this and that has little
shorts it's kind of like a mauve and a
pan stripe on white this is so cute I
think it would look awesome with some
lace-up new sandals so I'm really
excited to wear this one next is another
bumper surprise surprise but this one's
a little fancier and this one
run very small I had to get it in a size
up I originally ordered it in a six
everything I got is in a UK six and for
an Australian size six I don't know if
it the same it was way too small so I
got it in an eight instead but it's this
red off-the-shoulder romper it's more
like a fancy material I would say so
this would be go to like a dinner or
something and then it has these little
officer shoulder sleeve the top is kind
of structure and I have with this little
sticky ban so it doesn't fall down and
then just goes down into some shorts and
the back looks like so there's a zipper
I think this is so pretty this was like
some wedges or just some heels or
something for like a dinner like you
know Chris one of Oklahoma's Christmas
why can't I speak why speaking of red I
actually wore this the other day when I
was in San Diego I have a blog in there
if you haven't seen it I'll link it down
below but I want a dress and I got so
many compliments and I know why it's so
cute so it says smocked top dress a
little off the shoulder and then it's a
maxi it's a maxi on me so I filling on
most people would be a midi dress
because I'm five foot one but I don't
know and then it has these like little
clips in the front show some leg I love
this it's like really really cute
and like I said I got so many
compliments on it this next dress is my
favorite from them this is like my
favorite dress that I have right now
it's the game print
mini dress I'm obsessive game omeka how
you say it you know it also this little
like checkered print and it's just a
black and white checkered print mini
dress I'm obsessed with it I'm obsessed
with this pattern as well as stripes I
really like patterns right now so this
is so cute it's really short though so
just be wary if you're taller but I love
this the last dress I got is this one
it's another white dress and this one
does have some super cute embroidery
sorry I already wore a lot of these so
they like kind of wrinkly but anyways
yep I have some like brightly colored
floral embroidery down the front and on
the bottom and have some ties my friend
some little sleeves
and then the back just looks like this
so cute this was great to throw why if
you're going to the beach if you're like
going to dinner after the beach or if
you just wanna look Bohe how this will
look really cute would like this bra
left anyways okay it wouldn't be a haul
for me without a bathing suit because we
all know I'm obsessed so I saw this one
from APink on their website the dress
I'm wearing it now is also miming pink
so that's funny so this one is unlike
any bathing suit I have it's an
off-the-shoulder one-piece and it has
this really cool kind of swirly abstract
print on it looks like this screech iki
which is what i like and then the back
is like all open like this so I just
thought this would be holy crap I can't
talk oh my god I just thought this was
really cute and it can be worn as like a
body suit or something it's a guy that
actually has speakers was getting so
annoying this could be one of the
bodysuit that's what I'm trying to say
so I thought that was unique and it's
not like any sub suit I have so I wanted
to test it out ok the last few things
that I got some princess Holly are not
clothing items but I want to show you
anyways so I got this brow brow pencil
by Barry M and I actually don't really
like this for the main reason that it's
not like retractable and I knew that
when I got it so it's my own fault
but I do usually like retractable like
smaller brow pencils so it's more
precise this one is just this one looks
like an eyeliner so it's not really
precise at all I guess it's ok if you're
just filling in main parts of your brow
but not for like any precise area so
yeah I don't know the color is good I
got it in light/medium but it's not
really good for what I want it for the
last thing I got is a ring so I'm gonna
have to come closer to show you this one
ok disregard my nails and also disregard
you can hear any weird singing on my
window my like neighbors or whoever
lives above me is literally blasting
music I don't even know it is it sounds
like yodeling so yeah please disregard
that anyway it's this really pretty
silver ring with some little flowers on
it I think I got this in the smallest
size and only
my thumb but I'm still really really
cute and dainty and I really like it
yeah so that was my haul from princess
Polly I hope you guys enjoyed it I hope
you guys I'm sick of hold yet but if you
want I'm sure there will be more in the
near future because I was shopping at it
like I said I do sell a lot of my
clothes and services to top of Poshmark
so I will my posture count down below in
case you guys are interested I love you
guys so much and thanks for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
