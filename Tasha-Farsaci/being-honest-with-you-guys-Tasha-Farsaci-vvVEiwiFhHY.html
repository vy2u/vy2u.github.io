today I wanted to do more of like in
audits hurts my video on my channel
because I've been getting a lot of
requests to do videos that I'm more
personal and show my personality more so
basically I went my Instagram and I
posted a photo and asked you guys to
comment your questions if you wanted me
to answer for this QA so you guys don't
follow me on Instagram and you must be
involved in these things or if you just
want to keep up with my life totally
follow me I'll put it on the screen here
as well as in the description box so
from all those comments I just chose the
ones with the most likes or the ones
that started popping up a lot so those
are the questions that I chose for this
video okay so the first topic I got a
ton of questions about or just questions
on in general is if I'm joining a
sorority or just about Greek life at USC
so basically to answer the main question
yes I do plan on going to a recruitment
in this coming fall semester for USC I
do want to join a sorority basically the
reason that I haven't joined one up
until now is because I love transfer
student EFC as a sophomore but I
couldn't transfer in until the spring
semester and sorority recruitment is in
the fall so I'm not allowed to rush as a
spring semester student so I had to wait
until this coming year I will be a
junior it was kind of different I think
most people will be freshmen but yeah
I'm still really excited for me I really
want to rush because Greg Glen is pretty
big at USC and being a transfer student
especially a spring and it transfers to
Dave it was really really hard to meet
people and make friends and don't get me
wrong I have met really awesome people
and awesome friends but I just know I'll
be able to meet a ton more girls if I
join a sorority I'll be able to go to
more events I'll be able to you you
notice you more involved on campus and I
think that's what I really want
yeah so that's the main thing that I
want to come out of it I just really
want to make new friends and meet people
that I think I will get along with so
I'm really excited about that
I don't found vlogging my experience but
I was thinking I'm filming the outfits
that I wore for each day so if you guys
would be interested in seeing an outfit
of the week kind of thing for
recruitment let me know in
put that together for you guys okay so
the next question that I want to answer
is how I ever been in love okay so
basically the answer to that is no so I
dated a guy for about a year in high
school and the whole time I just I
didn't really feel it and don't get me
wrong I really liked him and he was a
great guy but I was looking my friends
or his people that I knew in
relationships and the way that they felt
toward their significant other and just
how they always wanted to be to them
always wanted to be talking to them it
just like that wasn't me and at the time
I just thought that was normal like I
was just different because I really I
always have been someone has trouble
opening up to people I literally trust
like less than five people um
I don't like showing emotion I just
thought it was kind of my own fault that
I didn't feel that way accordionist and
you know looking back now I know that's
not the case he just wasn't the guy for
me and I just wasn't going to get there
I could have you know probably opened up
so much more and done so much more but
he just wasn't the guy that I needed to
be with if that makes sense so yeah I
don't know I've never been in love and I
feel like that's fine I'm Roy 20 yeah I
think your thing to look back on
experiences like that because at the
time you know I would say it back and I
was feel kinda weird because I really
feel like that but I felt like that's
what I should be saying you know what I
mean so yeah I mean hopefully hopefully
he'll come for me hopefully I'm not like
jinx for life but yeah okay the next
question is do I want to study abroad
during college and I wanted to answer
this one because I honestly need your
guys's advice so basically for a really
long time I wanted to study abroad I
wanted to go the second semester of my
junior year I wanted to go to London
and I wanted to do the whole Europe they
explore Europe do all that that was my
plan because I've never really traveled
far I've gone with a country Kandra and
Mexico but that's it I've never gone you
know to your upper a shelter all fairly
renewable places basically though if you
guys are familiar with my whole college
Fiasco I transferred colleges and then I
couldn't start here until the spring
semester I was spring and a transfer and
I just kind of messed everything up in
my whole timeline basically it's just
I'm finally the place that I want to be
I absolutely love my school I really
like LA and like I said if I'm going to
be rushing and joining a sorority I
don't want to leave my second semester
you know I'm just being in that in that
sorority and I'm sure they'll be so busy
with that and I'll be meeting so many
new people and I don't really know if I
want to leave a for that long and be
that soon and then if I don't go out you
know junior year that leaves my senior
here and obviously I'm not going to go
my second semester senior year first
semester I really don't want to miss
because we have football games and
tailgating and it's such a huge part of
your se culture so I wouldn't really
want to go then and miss my last you
know my last hurrah for USC football
games so that's kind of you know what's
going on to me with that and I'm
thinking that I might go next summer I'm
trying to something then but also
that'll be a junior and you New York
summer use like need an internship like
if I don't have one that would be weird
so I don't know I really really want to
go and I know this is like B time to do
it but just like it's just not working
out right and I don't know if you guys
have any advice or suggestions on what
to do with that totally let me know okay
do I have a boyfriend a bunch people are
asking this and the answer is no if I
ever cube a boyfriend I think it'll be a
parent like I'm pretty sure always
posting a bunch of photos
because I am very active on social media
so I think UI but no I'm sure I'd be
mentioning him but you know if I do both
the phone with a guy goes mean we're
dating like I posted photos a guy that I
am definitely not dating so yeah no I
don't a boyfriend
I found that especially a USB I've
mentioned it before but the Ealing
dating culture like really isn't a thing
at least the guys that I have dealt with
um yeah it's not really really common to
be dating and maybe that will change you
know now that I'm in upperclassmen but
yeah that's like my circumstance single
Pringle okay a lot of you guys are
wondering my plans or after college and
I don't really have anything set in
stone you know I don't think I'm just
going to be doing YouTube because if I
wanted to just do YouTube
I probably wouldn't have gone to college
because you know college is not cheap so
yeah I mean obviously ideally my youtube
channel will explode and I could just do
YouTube but you know as of now I'm
planning on hopefully getting a job
something similar for what I'm doing I
love being creative I love you know
beauty and fashion there's a lot of lip
stuff in LA so hopefully you know
finding something with that and then
also still being able to do you two but
that's still you know a part of my life
which hopefully will be I think that
would be ideal and I do see myself
staying in LA just because you know they
do LA does have all like the
opportunities and I really do like it
here I like California a lot if I work
in LA I probably go to like San Diego I
really like it there as well so yeah I
don't know I mean I don't know I'm going
to do wrestle two years of college so so
many things could come up with cookie
now and then but as of now that's kind
of where I see myself oh yeah okay my
roots are really bothering me I haven't
done my hair done in a really long time
and I made an appointment soon but I'm
like looking at them in the viewfinder
and like
Oh God does a youtuber ever affect my
social life in a negative way so I would
say for the most part of you know I mean
YouTube has obviously changed my life
for the better in so many ways but there
definitely are a few ways it can be
weird I think the main annoying thing
that I've noticed is when I'm meeting
someone for the first time and they
already know that my channel which is
fine but a lot of the time they have you
know preconceived notions about me or
they have judgments made about me
because of my channel or they think I'm
a certain way and they kind of think
they know me before they know me and
like obviously on my channel I tire be
is real and to myself as possible but
you know I'm not I can't be my same
exact self like obviously I have to ask
you know a little more going a little
more like you know Wow or whatever and
you know I'm you see you see me like
showing my clothes all day and doing all
this stuff and cutey in fashion which I
do like that but obviously there's more
to me than that so I think a lot of you
will just make judgments you know on
youtubers based on their social media
platforms and who they are online and
they kind of let that cloud their vision
for how the person is you know in their
personal life so I definitely had that I
definitely had weird circumstances when
I know people follow me or I know they
watch my videos and then I meet them in
person and they aspect they don't know
who I am and it's like kind of
uncomfortable um it's also weird
especially being in LA like yeah I'm a
bit amount of followers I don't have
like millions of followers but I have
more than the average person and a lot
of people you know I feel like try to be
friends with me because of that and they
find that as a value about me I'm a
friend so sometimes I can't tell people
are being genuine you know like I said I
don't become a followers if I add like
10 million followers like okay yeah
that'd be different but you know I still
kind of see it or you know people will
just kind of act differently because I
have followers or whatever so yeah
though there would be little annoying
things but I wouldn't take back YouTube
for the world so
the last question I'm going to answer is
how is it working for dope since you
guys don't know I am a summer intern for
the app built a little video about my
internship you want to check that out
I'll link it down below
basically dough is a shopping app and
they have like hundreds and hundreds of
stores on there like literally all
medical stores revolve Urban Outfitters
three people Shopbop Nordstrom like all
the kind of stores around there and you
can shop them all right from the app
it's so convenient you can put
everything from different stores in one
shopping cart and checkout all at once
one time it stays all your info I sound
like I'm pitching them to you guys but
I'm really just trying to tell you what
they are because they're awesome now to
basically you guys are new to go and you
want to download it you can use the code
Tasha for five dollars off and free
shipping from any of those stores which
is great I'm like handing you five bucks
Oh totally take advantage of that but
recently we've just been doing like
social media stuff and branding for them
and its really really great I've been
loving it I've gotten to go to San
Francisco and New York with them which
is awesome and they just really really
value my opinion I feel like they really
care about me I'm not just like the
bitch intern so oh my god I just like
shake off the little hug anyways yeah my
internship is going or very well I will
be going to San Francisco again in a few
weeks so that is exciting because that's
where they're based you know and then
yeah I'll be finishing up once I go back
to school obvious points first anyways I
think those are all the questions I'm
going to answer today if you guys have
any more that you're done to know about
me feel free to leave them in the
comment section and I'll either respond
there or I'll save them for another QA
or just comment down below anything if
you want me to do any videos in the
future I'm always looking for requests
like always thank you guys so much for
watching my video it means so much to me
and stay tuned for the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
