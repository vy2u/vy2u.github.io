so many requests from you guys to
continue doing these and a lot of you
guys so you really like them so if you
don't like them you don't need to watch
this video I have tons of other videos
on my channel but today this is going to
be a very large channel I know I did try
it all a while back and I said that was
probably the biggest one ever
but this one that might be close to a
big so get some popcorn please please
please give this video a thumbs up and
come out in this video because I am
ready trying all this stuff on and that
is super time-consuming and I will be
linking everything in the description as
well so if you appreciate that out
please give this video a thumbs up one
more thing if you guys are not following
me on social media and you want to my
Instagram will be here on the screen and
I will put all my other social media
handles down below if you guys just want
to keep up to date with my life okay so
the first group of things I bought
online and I use a cash back site called
pinch to buy them and I kinda want to
share that with you guys because it
seriously so helpful
and if you guys want to save money it's
a lie pack so on page there are over 800
stores and you can shop for cash back on
the cash back can be redeemed through
PayPal and a mcgann other online
websites and gift cards and stuff I
actually have my very own little link
through their website is Tasha dot pinch
Co if you guys want to shop any of the
items that I got with this website you
can with that link and you will get cash
back on your purchases so basically if
you click on a link you will still be
able to shop through pants you're just
going to be on my website and you will
get cash back once you make a purchase
on their website and it's literally like
you getting paid for online shopping so
let's check it out all these items
I warned you links down below okay so
the first one I got I got these from
Chili's calm and I've been wanting these
for so long they're too progressed and I
remind why it needed a lot but I want to
switch it up as well and try me I've
seen a lot of girls wearing these around
USC and I really like them there's a
superga platform and yeah I don't know I
just really like these I really like the
look of them they're kind of less basic
than the adidas I'm sure you will become
basic pretty soon or can you guys may
think they're already basic but yeah I
picked these out I got them in a UK 37
and I wear a six and a half u.s. so yeah
there were kind of ties it big but when
I tie them I can make them work but yeah
I'm really really excited about these
I've been wanting these for so long and
then I got another pair of shoes I got
these from Nordstrom and I've been
wanting these for a while - they're not
really my stuff yet but they're just the
black van the old school ones and yeah
same thing I've been wanting it for a
while kind of similar to Anita's not
really these ones are more black so now
I'm really excited about these I just
love wearing sneakers with all my outfit
okay next I got this swimsuit from
PacSun but it's by the brand new life
which I'm pretty sure is by planet blue
which is on my favorites or they're so
expensive so I don't shop there a lot
but yeah the basis could be really
really wacky and her to show you guys I
basically this is gonna be my fourth of
July bathing suit but you'll see what it
looks like more on I've been wanting
this for a while I thought on PacSun and
yeah I got cash back on it so it's worth
it
okay next also from Nordstrom I picked
up this little adidas crop top and I got
this because I wear a lot of high
waisted leggings and I'm not going to
lie like if I'm wearing leggings I want
my butt to be showing off right oh I
like wearing crop tops but I want it to
be kind of like a sporty crop top so it
goes to the whole legging located on
science so I thought this was perfect
and I think they sell this at like Urban
Outfitters and stuff too but it was the
cheapest at Nordstrom and yeah it's just
so cute an omen awareness a ton and the
last two things that I bought using my
pinch cash back where to give the same
leggings these are both from beyond yoga
which is one of my new favorite workout
brands obviously passed with lemon I
love
yoga and I actually snatched the picture
of me wearing of these legging that
everyone was going crazy so basically
they are just their high-rise cropped
leggings and these ones are in like the
neon coral space-dye I think this color
is sold out I still doubt like right
after I bought them so I apologize you
want this color but they do still have
this really pretty big blue that we
/summer checked and it's also spaced out
so I look at the size chart and I got
these in an extra extra small because of
the size chart and they fit me perfectly
but the only thing is getting them on is
a bitch like this top waistband is a
super stretchy so it's really hard to
make it me not over my butt but once
they're on they fit fine so I'm not sure
if I should have bought a size up or
what but just keep that in mind if you
have like a bigger butt like I don't
even think I have like a really big butt
but they're just kind of difficult to
get on I don't know if that's just me if
you guys have these let me know and
these are the softest leggings have ever
felt they're so so soft so yeah I really
like these and I know I've been wearing
them all the time probably go over them
to the airport tomorrow
okay the next door I have things from is
Wimmer store and I really like the items
I got and some of them unfortunately do
not give me to the foamer
but I'm going to start off with my
favorite thing I got the espadrille
sandals I wore these yesterday and I got
so many compliments on them bottoms real
dirty sad but they're this new color and
it sticks light on and then they have
like an espadrille platform I'm gonna be
wearing these all the time because
they're so comfortable there so trendy
and they make me a little bit taller I'm
only five foot one so you know homegirl
needs all the help she can get okay my
next favorite some winter store is this
little black backpack I've been wanting
one of these for a while just if I
wanted to go like hiking or do something
right in white area purse but I still
wanted my backpack to be cute so this
one is perfect it's faux leather it's
adorable
I like how its structured it's like the
perfect size I've already won this a few
times and I absolutely
love it so I totally recommend this I
got a pair of these little nipple petal
thing because I had a pair of these and
then they finally lost their stick so I
picked up these I got this really cute
romper I was wearing this in one of my
previous videos and you guys we're all
asking where it's from so it's from
Windsor it's like this mock Imperial on
top and then it goes down into shorts
and then the back is really cute it's
like open and it just ties with these
little ties so this was going to be
perfect for these really hot days we're
happening in Southern California next I
got this little crop top once again to
kind of wear my high waisted leggings I
thought this was really cool because
it's all like mesh so I would just wear
like a cool sports bra underneath and it
look really cute for the gym or just for
like athleisure because I'm totally into
that look but yeah this is super cool
it's like really stretchy and nice so
I'm excited to wear this I got this
white little banjo tube top I've been
loving wearing these with just like
high-waisted bottom I think they're like
really cool and in trend for the summer
so I just got this little white one okay
and the last two things from Windsor I
love but unfortunately they're too big
so first thing top is pair of black and
white striped pants and they're just way
too long on me I try to like pull them
up but just wasn't working out so yeah
these are really really cute and trendy
right now but they're just too long okay
and the last thing from Windsor is this
adorable distressed olive green gem
skirt I got this in the smallest size I
got it in a size small but it's way too
big it's just totally gates around my
waist and falls off so that's
unfortunate because I really really
loved it but yeah okay moving on I have
a box of stuff from Cheyenne calm you
guys know I love Kia I hauled them all
the time and I've worn some of this
stuff in videos and you guys have been
freezing out asking me about it so I'm
going to show you right now okay the
first thing I got is another pair of
espadrilles
these ones are platform espadrilles once
again except they are snake-print and
they lace up I think these are so so
cool I love snake-print shoes I love
snake print in general and I just
thought this would be really really cool
so these are awesome quality I haven't
worn them yet but once I do
totally eclipsing a photo in needs on my
Instagram okay I got three pairs of
glasses two of which I have in mind for
UFC game days like football games
because they're red the first one would
it be only hit out of these three they
look like this I think these will be
super super cool for game bases you guys
don't know USC is like red and gold so
yeah I got these and then I also about
this red pair but they're just huge I
have a really small head
Toby is do not work on me they look like
this they're more like that see-through
kind of trend that's going on but I was
like a bug like I can't pull off big
sunglasses because my head is so small
I'm already giving you a friend and then
I also picked up these just clear
glasses because I really want to be you
when I was trendy people that wear fake
glasses and looks cute but I just don't
think these about flattering on me I
think I think this bar needs to be black
and not silver let me know what you
think but I don't know I'm going to keep
searching for the perfect pair of fake
glasses okay I wear this top in a video
and everyone was freaking out about it
so I want to show you guys I am obsessed
with it kind of hard to show okay so
basically it's a strapless top a kind of
signature I think you could wear this in
this group actually and then it has
these two ties did you kind of tie in a
knot in the front and it looks super
cute the only thing is I think this is
one size and this is really small on me
like this part is really really tight
and it is stretchy but it's still really
tight so if you're not like a small or
extra small I don't know how this is
gonna work which is super annoying
another one of my favorites from she in
this turnaround is this little strapless
dress it has these cute little off the
shoulders please and then I feel like
the sleeves have ties on them
oh yeah okay so that are these little
ties nuke I know Tyler's around this
place as well and it just kind of flows
out once again this is going to be great
for the summertime when it's really hot
out next up my August top which is
really really cute magnificent it's just
not the best quality in the world it
looks like this it's so tiny right now
how this affects the office shoulder and
a little floral embroidery so this is so
cute just a lot of threads are kind of
loose and the stitching is kind of
uneven along the bottom so like I said
it's not the best quality but for a
really trendy piece like this I don't
believe like because I'm not going to be
wearing at the time you know what I mean
so yeah keep in mind not the most
amazing quality but you can't really
tell and it'll still look cute for a few
ways you know oh my gosh guys Oh fun
fact about me I love a cacti I just
think they're so cute I love like cactus
prints on anything I thought this pajama
set on Sheehan and I was like oh yes
after cart so it's this little pink
sedan with that and I have all these
little cacti on it and it's so adorable
I think I got this in a size medium
because that was a smaller size I had
and it fits me perfectly I normally only
works less so when I get a pair of cupid
dream with I feel super put together so
yeah I really really like these I love
this skirt so much or you won it once
it's this little black skirt and that
has like these little athletic stripes
on the sides but I think it's really
really cute and this will look great
with either of the sneakers I showed in
this video okay kind of similar to that
skirt I got this little dress some Chi
in and it's a black kind of bodycon
dress and that has those same white
stripes and a thigh this is really
flattering and once again will look
really cute with sneakers so this is
kind of like a cute out there that you
can make look sporty and just keep it
really really comfortable I've been
obsessed with yellow lately so I felt
really cute dress I apologize it's
really wrinkly right now but it's just
this mustard yellow maxi dress and then
once you get to the bottom it has this
really cool kind of floral stitching
pattern I don't know how well you can
see that but really really pretty I love
this color right now and I just think
this would be really fun okay it's next
up I'm not really sure how I feel about
it I haven't tried it
yet the material is kind of weird it's
like it only looks like a neoprene or
scuba material if you guys know what
that material is but if there's tropical
print dress and then the sides kind of
tie up you can see that and it looks
like this it's just like a shifter so
yeah I'm gonna have to try this on and
see how I like it
it's just the material it's kind of
weird to me but I might like it once
it's on okay so usually I really like
deep v-cut things because I have really
small boobs so it's not normally hard
for me to like keep my boobs in place
and not like still ow you know what I
mean so I normally like the low vika and
I feel like it's really flattering if
you're flat-chested as well
but this dress is extreme like I cannot
even wear this I tried it on I was going
to wear to brunch and I just couldn't do
it it was like I don't know I couldn't
make it work and I thought it was like
not only like deep even like a wide deep
see if you know what I mean so it's a
really really cute pattern and this is
easy and then it just goes down into a
maxi dress with like really cute slips I
don't know it's really nice and cute but
the B is a little much
alright I picked up this midi dress and
I do really like this stupid material is
like so thin and clingy that it
literally shows all of your
imperfections and I am not 100% like
okay with my body I don't think anyone
is if you are seriously like that's
amazing like good for you but this just
like it's like flattering but for me
it's just like I see all the things on
my body that I don't like so I don't
know I haven't decided what I'm going to
do about this but it's really pretty mob
color and then it goes down into a mini
dress with a slit it's just like this
really like slinky clinging material so
I'd only kind of stick to like thicker
bandage dresses my mind like body con
stuff I feel like it just looks better
than like a really stay clean material
but you know to each his own I picked up
this two-piece workouts at from she and
only for the top and that's kind of
power worked out too because I really
want the bottoms but this is what the
top looks like it's this really cool
kind of snake print match workout crop
top really really like this
bottom is still light because they're so
thin and they're white so you can
totally see it your underwear through
them and I'm used to like higher quality
workout leggings so for me these don't
really work and you would definitely be
able to see your underwear okay and the
last thing from Cheyenne having tried to
Sonia it seems like really spin but who
knows it might look cute on it's this
little tiny cropped top thing it's like
a tied halter sort of style so we'll see
how this looks on okay guys the last
door how things from shout out to you if
you've made it through all this is wrong
way so they have a lot of similar items
as she and if you're not familiar with
them so the first thing I got is a pair
of booties I love you so much so these
faux leather black booties and they have
these silver little studs all over them
I think these are so cute the only kind
of weird thing is that they're lined
with like a furry material which is kind
of weird I guess in stores it from when
it's cooler outside but if I want to
wear these in the summer would like a
dress or something or be kind of plenty
on my feet so that's a little bit weird
but overall they seem like really really
nice quality and they're gonna be great
so I really like these the next thing I
picked up from romwe runway and however
you want to say it is this pair of Gucci
inspired sneakers they're just these
white sneakers and then they have like
the floral embroidery down them and then
they have like these little things in
the back so if you don't spend a ton of
money on the Gucci ones for an item that
I believe will go out of trend kind of
soon then these are definitely a good
option so yeah these silly feet in
quality they're not the best but you
know for the price and for the trend I
think they're pretty good the next thing
from runway is a pair of overalls now I
hold turn over all from chien a haul a
few hauls back I think and I like them
looking with a perfect fit and I do
really like the fit of these more
they're more like a boyfriend style I
got these in a size medium instead of a
small so keep that in mind
I saw the model is wearing a medium so I
figured I would try out a medium so the
straps are kind of weird they're like
dangle a lot some polygons we cut them
or like resold them or do something with
it but they look like this they're a
light wash overall
and then the leg is distressed and it's
more like a boyfriend fit which I like a
lot I don't have to worry about having
like a camel toe or anything so yeah I
like these a lot more than the other
ones I think and I'm happy with this
purchase almost done guys I got this -
Pete steps in wrong ways this is really
cute it has these little stripes these
are the bottom little shorts and then
the top is like a little tube top thing
and then these ties tie around your arm
I love tops like this but it's so
difficult if no one else is around to
tie them for you like it's really
impossible let me know if you guys know
a way to kind of tie them but yeah this
is really cute I've been loving stars
lately like I said I've been loving
yellow so I saw this really cute romper
it looks like this it's yellow and
floral and then has some cutouts around
the waist goes down into shorts the only
saying is there's a lot of like booster
at the minute it's not very good quality
but once again it's kind of like a
trendy piece so I feel like I'm going to
be wearing a time--as so I'm kind of
okay with it these last few things from
romwe ago really fit me very well I
expected this one to be more of a crop
top and it's just like not it's kind of
big it's 3:1 expected I felt a really
tight cop top it's not kind of this
weird like almost smock material it's a
beard material and it's a really nice
fit don't like how this one fits and
then this one they actually do from
Azhar apiece I saw this in Zara and it
looks very similar same kind of thing I
thought this was going to be more tight
and cropped but it's just like not
really it has these little ties which
are supposed to tired around you I don't
know maybe I'll have to try this on but
I don't like think this is how I
expected it to be oh my gosh okay
finally we are done with this haul video
