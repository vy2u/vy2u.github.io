want to wash my hair we all do this okay
don't act like you don't hello guys now
the background is different because I am
home in New York for two weeks and I
really never had a good place to film
here so here's my closet basically today
I just wanted to film this really quick
video to explain why I change my name
and if you have no idea what I'm talking
about I am referring to my youtube
username my Instagram name and my
twitter handle so seriously hashas is
dead rest in peace if you guys have not
noticed I changed my username from
seriously Tasha to my real name and my
full name Tasha farts ah cheese so I
just wanted to kind of do this video to
explain why I did this so I know some
people are like sad about it
people were like tweeting me and then I
know my parents are kind of sad about it
like I'm kind of sad about it but it was
time okay so back story into seriously
Tasha so when I first started youtube it
was not normal to have your full name on
the internet it was like before a lot of
social media you know what I mean and
especially on YouTube
no one said their sole name it was like
first name if even that
no one said they're engaged no one said
you know where they lived I remember
people would make like coming out videos
of their age like I really have one of
those like the title is telling you my
age or something like that like
everything was very private if you know
for you know was good at the time but
now everything is so much different with
social media some of the news you see
Tasha I will never ever talked about it
I'm here why I chose it but at that time
I was obsessed with America's Next Top
Model
comment down below if you guys were
obsessed as well and that was when the
host was Tyra Banks I used to watch that
 like all weekend it would always be
on oxygen with the marathon I would
watch that like binge watch anyways so
Tyra Banks always said the worst years
on the show if you guys watched it you
know what I mean she always had that and
I thought it was the coolest word I
thought it was super cool so naturally I
was like okay I
my first name in my user name so people
know my first name
so I kind of just combined Siri santosha
and it became seriously Tasha my hands
are doing so many movements anyways
sorry Susie Tasha on everything and have
it for the last year or so I wanted to
change it for the same reason that I
think a lot of youtubers change their
screenings to their rulings first of all
everyone has those weird screen names
like it's the same thing as weird emails
like everyone has been weird emails be
made back in the day where the time the
screen we name screen into the screen
name was normal and now you're like
literally what the heck I can't even
tell you guys my weird email because I
still use it for like shopping but
please comment your weird emails and
usernames down below I would love to
hear them anyway so that's one thing a
lot of people's username or worse than
my I don't hate you see Tasha
some people were like really funny so
they changed their inviting the main
thing is just because it's more
professional and obviously I did start
YouTube because I loved it and it was
something you know a hobby of mine which
it still is I still do love doing it for
fun obviously but it has become more of
a professional outlet for me and you
know when I do have the chance to work
with brands and they're referring to me
and like posts and stuff I would much
rather them know me and refer to me as
my name tasha farts ah cheese rather
than seriously hashem ice cream man you
know it's just it's just more
professional I'm 20 years old now I feel
like it's time for me to kind of grow up
in terms of my username literally I
remember in high school someone saw my
last name was seriously like people did
people didn't know what my real name was
so actually the only reason I didn't do
this sooner was because I was waiting
for my Instagram handle to will be
available
I wanted the Instagram handle Tasha for
Pacis but Instagram said it was taken
even though there was no account that
would show up and the reason for that is
because it was disabled so I believed I
thought that Instagram you know save the
usernames of disabled challenged for a
year and then after that you were able
to take them but I found out last night
that that is not the case and basically
if account
different account is disabled that
username is gone forever and no one can
ever use it so I realize that I'm never
going to get my username that I wanted
so I instead make my yoga named Tasha
dot and Partho G if I'm wrong about this
and if you guys know how I can get that
username totally let me know because I
would like all of my names to be
uniformed
but the dot is fine for now anyways yeah
I think that's basically everything I
wanted to cover I just kind of want to
explain you guys why I changed it I hope
you guys mad about it you guys can still
call me if your katana sir I will always
do seriously Tasha on the inside anyways
if you guys have any requests for videos
for me please leave them in the comments
down below because I would like to
upload at least twice a week this summer
don't want me to it but I'm really going
to try and if you see comments or
requests you agree with give them thumbs
up because I am more likely to do those
okay thank you guys so much for watching
I hope you guys like the new name and I
love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
