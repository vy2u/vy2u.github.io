like a trash can um it's one day I
really wanted to film a college week in
my life this week and Mondays and
Wednesdays I have a workout class that I
take for credit it's like a class class
but Mondays Wednesdays at 11:00 a.m. I
have a workout class and oh my god I'm
disgusting this is gross I'm sorry I'm
sorry to see me like this but um
currently 10:31 and I guess like if I
was a productive human I would get up at
like 9:00 and do things in my life and
then go but I literally set my alarm for
10 snooze it to 10:30 and then roll out
of bed eventually and then go yeah so my
class is cardio group fitness I
basically it's a one unit course I took
it just so that I would be like forcing
myself to workout because otherwise I'm
like really busy and I just don't think
that I would be working out that much so
yeah that's why I took it I like it I
have a friend in the class but it is
kind of annoying because I then I'm like
super sweaty after you have to shower
have wet hair the whole the whole
shebang
but yes so I'm gonna get up put some
workout clothes on and go to that so I'm
currently walking it to my class I
always wear my sunglasses so when I'm
going to this class because when I get
out I'm so sweaty and I don't want to
see anyone that I know and have to like
start a conversation when I'm like
really gross and sweaty so yeah I'm just
wearing this little lemon top and then
some Lululemon leggings and sneakers but
yeah I guess we'll update you guys or
when I'm back hi guys so I actually just
showered and got ready my workout class
was not hard today we started like the
kickboxing unit so we were just doing
like intro stuff and like learning about
it but yeah I just did some like light
makeup literally I didn't do my hair
showered and did nothing but I kinda had
a dress to sort of nice today because we
have Monday night dinner for my sorority
basically every Monday night the
sororities like together at the house
for dinner and you're supposed to dress
like kind of nice so I kind of dressed
sort of nice I'm just wearing this like
grayish black t-shirt dress with this
burgundy jacket from blank NYC and then
just these little slides from Steve
Madden so I'm actually about to go to
alpha fee to get lunch
I get lunch and dinner there most days
of the week just because it's included
in my dues and I'm paying dues so why
not
and yeah I'm like Lula the lunch there
is really good our chef is so amazing so
yeah I think today is like chicken
tenders which like who doesn't want that
so yeah this is the row for anyone
wondering sorry this is kind of shaky
I'm very walking
but this is where all of the houses are
guys look up shoot the house locks
all degrade
so cute okay so I just finished my class
and I got a pumpkin cold brew almond
milk wanted from the coffee bean and I
have a paper due at midnight that I need
to start writing or like finish writing
so I'm gonna go home and do that because
my laptop died so yeah I'm like on
campus now filming because you guys
wanted me to do that so yeah I'm gonna
go home and write two more my paper and
then I will go to album fee for dinner
okay so I just want to like a VA to
write what I just said because I was
logging on camera campus so I was trying
to go fast cuz I'm super awkward by the
way if you guys do vlogs or vlogger or
whatever how do you get over being
awkward not even in a public place
because I'm not I don't feel
uncomfortable if I'm vlogging in public
when I don't know anyone but it's just
different on campus because they're like
my peers and I know them and like I
don't know it's different for me and
maybe you guys know what I mean but yeah
if you guys have any hints let me know
or just tips because I really do want to
like vlog more like actually on campus
but I just feel like super uncomfortable
but anyways hi finished class and went
to coffee bean is I think I put my latte
I would take it right there but anyways
what I got is not good so don't get it
it's like the pumpkin almond milk latte
or something like that
pumpkin cold brew almond milk latte and
it sounds really good but it literally
tastes so sweet I don't know if they
just made it weird or whatever but I
don't really like it so don't get that
but basically I just came back here
because my laptop was dead and I need to
finish writing a paper that I have do at
midnight tonight my nose is running
anyways I was not being a good student
and I started it yesterday and it's 10
to 12 pages and something about me is
I'm like a really concise writer so I
have trouble reaching word count or page
count a lot so I'm on page eight right
now and I literally have nothing else to
say so I'm gonna try and like squeeze
two pages out of who knows where but
yeah I need to do that
and I have dinner at Alfea at like 5:00
I think so yes I'm gonna do that and
hopefully you finish this paper guys
update it's like a good chunk of time
later and I still haven't brought any
more of my paper because I got
distracted and wanted to upload a video
that I've been waiting to upload I just
needed to get it approved by a brand
that I was working with for it so they
finally approved it and I just wanted to
post it so I've been doing like
thumbnails for that and I posted it and
now I only have like 20 minutes until
dinner and I haven't done the paper pray
for me
okay guys hi I was just talking with Ann
Marie by the way I swear I have friends
and human interaction but like I feel
weird whipping out my camera around
people that aren't youtubers yeah I
concur
yeah so that's why I might not show a
lot of people but I was talking to Ann
Marie about something that happened and
she was like put it in your blogs so I
was like okay I feel like I should get
you in it but then like that lighting
makes me look even uglier so basically
last week I had two classes one day and
I went to the first one cuz I had a
midterm then the midterm was so rough I
didn't go to the next one which like I
don't I don't necessarily recommend but
like the class doesn't take attendance
and I didn't need to know anything
really for that day like anything yeah
parents if you're watching this I'm
sorry but like it was my earthquakes
midterm it was a really rough go so like
whatever I was doing work in the
meantime that I wasn't in class so
apparently my professor decided I kind
of want to like yeah there we go
so apparently my professor put my
youtube channel and Ann Marie's YouTube
channel in the lecture and like put on
pictures up and was talking about like
influencers at USC so thanks god I
wasn't there because I'm the type of
person that that's like my worst
nightmare
literally my worst that's my worst
nightmare like there were definitely
youtubers who would love that and
would like eat that up but that is the
last thing that I ever want to happen
like I hate being the center of
attention and like big groups like that
like freaks me out you did like I didn't
tell anyone about my youtube like all
throughout high school did you oh no I
never tell people they just have find
out yeah no I don't bring it up unless
other people bring it up so like that
would have been so uncomfortable for me
and then apparently someone like raise
their hand and was like oh she's in this
class and he was like I know and she's
not here okay like comment down below
don't you guys think that he should have
asked me if you could like put me in the
library especially if he knew I was in
the class because that's just so awkward
like I know if I was in there my face
would have turned the color of that
fireplace like I would've been so
uncomfortable and I know he would have
liked all my meats like say stuff about
it it was actually know I've like caught
him looking at me in lecture maybe I
don't know maybe I'm imagining a blanket
remark I feel like I feel like he should
have asked me I mean lucky I wasn't
there but now I figure that class
tomorrow and I'm like I don't want to hi
guys
so it's a while later now I think it's
like 11 or something basically I finally
finished my paper it kind of got to the
point where I knew it wasn't a great
paper and it wasn't gonna get much
better I just didn't want to look at it
any longer I was kind of a page count I
was like okay he was a 10 to 12 page
paper and I had like this much on the
tenth page and I was just like okay yeah
that's it and I just submitted it
because I couldn't look at it anymore so
yeah once again not the best thing to do
I'm honestly not being an exemplary
college student in this video but
basically I started to do my laundry
because I also did this thing where I
don't do my laundry until I don't have
any underwear left so now was the time
and it was overflowing and it looked
disgusting in my room and I was just
getting a lot of anxiety so that's why I
don't have a pillowcase on my pillow I'm
doing like all of the laundry but
working on that honestly I don't hate
doing laundry I hate putting it away
because if you guys watched my move-in
vlog or anything you know that my room
is very cramped for the amount of stuff
that I have which is like my fault but
also I'm a youtuber so yeah it's really
crammed so I really don't have room for
all the clothes that I have so I just
dread putting things away and like
trying to shove them in Joy's and stuff
so that's not gonna be fun but I also
have to pack because I'm going home
Friday for Thanksgiving so I'm thinking
that if I pack some stuff then I'll have
room for the other stuff it's really not
a good system but yeah so that's what
I'm doing I'm kind of like waiting for
laundry be done I'm sitting here
watching other people's YouTube videos
and yeah guys my roots look like trash
but I'm getting my hair done when I go
home when I'm really excited I haven't
gotten it done since August so that's
why it looks so bad hi guys happy
Tuesday so I just woke up and got ready
my outfits like super casual today but I
got my period today so I feel like a
bloated mess I literally got the worst
cramps and I'm always so humble Oded so
I'll show you what I'm wearing first of
all I'm wearing this hat I got it from
Topshop I'm not a Yankees fan honestly I
could care less about baseball I know
that makes me a poser but I'm not gonna
lie like I just don't care but I think
the hats cue it's my favorite color
Burgundy and the rest my outfits like
really simple and comfy so I'll show you
that okay so basically sorry my mirrors
so dirty that's pretty gross
um I'm just wearing this black bodysuit
from brandy melville and then these
boyfriend jeans from Urban Outfitters
these ones are the best because they're
super high waisted and they're roomy
which is what I need when I'm bloated
and have cramps and then I'm just
wearing my vans checkered vans with this
look I will try to link my outfits from
at this video in the description if you
guys are interested but yeah super comfy
and simple TBT too when I used to do my
hair
school like I literally never do my hair
anymore but yeah anyways I'm about to go
Q alpha fee for lunch today it's BLTs
your girl is ready and then I have class
for a long time so yeah that is what
today is consisting of a so far guys I
just got this gingerbread
I stink your thought a on campus and it
tastes really bad I don't know what it
is with me and drinks lately but it's
bad but I'm about to run the class
because I'm gonna be late so hey guys so
it's quite awhile later now I'm back I
went to a dinner and then I just put on
a sweatshirt and some leggings because
I'm so crampy and I just feel so gross
and sometimes when I feel really bloated
and gross I just want to eat even more
so I really wanted some dessert and they
put in this ice cream cookie sandwich
place in the USC University Village
which is like a new construction and
they made how the ton of stores and
restaurants and basically they have ice
cream and cookies and you can make like
sandwiches it's called the baked bear I
think they started in San Diego or
something but they put one of those and
and its really close to where I live so
I think I'm gonna go and get one so I
got a peanut butter cookie sandwich
where the chocolate ice cream and I am
so ready yet to eat this guy's something
back to my workout class the reason that
I have makeup on today is because
anne-marie and I want to go to this like
restaurant on campus afterward and I
wouldn't have time in between my classes
to like get completely right after so
I'm just gonna hope that I don't sweat
too much today which like I don't think
I should because I didn't last time but
yeah we'll see I woke up with this super
weird bump on my face I kind of got it
covered but it's like there's not even a
bump like it's not a pimple it's just
like this red super red patch you can
kind of see it I don't know what that is
but yeah I'm just wearing this like USC
Panhellenic shirt and then some
and yeah I'm gonna go to that hi guys so
I got back from my workout class and I
actually did sweat in it a little bit
but not too much so all was well and I
just change into this little top from
Zara it's kind of wrinkly but whatever
and then these jeans from Abercrombie &amp;amp;
Fitch and then my Superga platforms and
Ann Marie and I are about to go to this
a little restaurant lounge thingy on
campus because I've never been and we
thought it would be cute for the vlog
and maybe take some pics
oh my sunglasses are great band people
ask me and I think these are so popular
but I guess some people don't know their
ribbon so yeah hi guys wait you have to
see what and really tell them what's
happening okay so basically hunter boots
was like hey do you want to like collab
on Instagram and I was like sure I love
hunter boots but I'm really bad at like
Instagram and taking pictures like I'm
just so bad and it's also always so hot
and so it is never whining and it's
literally 75 degrees outside and these
pictures are so overdue and so I'm
literally I was gonna wait to you wait I
don't know how to do this it's like
almost 80 degrees I'm shooting a sweater
in the boots how I showed them my offer
so like literally in a Tech Talk
I was like a little too embarrassing I'm
going to class right after so let's go
okay guys I'm vlogging on campus it's
really I'm really scared it does for you
guys yeah so I really want to show you
the like an Statue because it's the game
day waited what I call it conquest week
yeah so the UCLA games coming up I'm
gonna miss that I'm really sad but they
always cover our Trojan statue in duct
tape is that what it is yeah just like
the UCLA kids would come and like mess
with it apparently like USC students
actually like we're the ones who just
vandalize things and tear you guys look
how pretty campus is I don't know why
all these children are here but like
it's so pretty
hi guys so I'm about to actually go out
and you guys are probably like Tasha
what the heck it's a Wednesday but
basically every Wednesday all sororities
and fraternities have like wine
Wednesday with a fraternity or sorority
and yeah I don't know it's just like fun
to go to and I know you guys are
probably really kasha like in your last
blog you said you were over like college
parties and stuff but I'm not like Oprah
I mean I still go like I still like
going out and I like having fun and
going out and stuff but yeah these are
different - they're not like frat
parties they're either like they're like
more low-key this one is at a bar so
it's like less like rowdy but yeah I'm
going it just thought it would be like
fun since I'm not gonna be here this
weekend but yeah I like just cool my
hair super quickly it was wet when I did
it so it's like not looking that great
but like whatever
um but yeah I'll show you my outfit okay
so on top I'm wearing this yellow top
from LF it's actually my bags and I'm
borrowing it so yeah I really wanted to
buy this when it was in stores but I
never got around to it so yeah I've been
borrowing hers and then I'm wearing
these fun jeans from Topshop as you can
see they have like lacing up the front
they're actually super uncomfortable but
I think they're cute and then just these
black heeled booties okay so this
totally might just be me but I had to
ask you guys because I'm so curious so
Topshop jeans are my favorite I have so
many pairs of jeans from them
Jaime jeans and I used to get them I
mean like I always used to get them in
this one size and it fit me perfectly
and they were super comfortable and
those jeans still fit me perfectly but
lately I've been ordered them and
ordering them online in that same size
and they've been like tighter like these
ones they still fit and zip and
everything but they're just like a
little bit tighter than I would want
yeah I don't know if they like change
the sizing and I would say oh I just
gained weight but my old ones still
fine so I don't know let me know if this
happened to you guys but like I feel
like they change the sizing a little bit
or I'm just gaining weight but let me
know if that's happening with you guys
so yeah I am going to leave now I wanted
to show you guys Alfie when all the
lights were lit up so this is it it just
looks super cute and festive
hi guys happy Thursday so I basically
just woke up and got ready and filmed a
giant try on haul for your eyes actually
