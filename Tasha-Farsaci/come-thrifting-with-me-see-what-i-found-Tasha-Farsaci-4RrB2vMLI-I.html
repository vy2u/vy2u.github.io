currently I am home in upstate New York
and today I wanted to go thrifting with
my best friend Mel and I thought I'd
bring you guys with me because recently
I've been watching comma thrifting with
new videos and I think they're super fun
and entertaining it's like you're going
on a treasure hunt but you're just in
your bed and the other person is doing
the work but I really love drifting I
think it's super fun and the thrift
stores here I really like because
they're not as picked over as the fifth
stores in LA so I'm gonna pick up
Melanie and then we're gonna go and
we're gonna get some lunch so this is
gonna be like a vlog slash through me
video and then if we get anything will
show what we gotten stuff but yeah I'm
currently in my driveway it's really
cold know is that I just made the
weirdest noise it's really cold I'll
show you guys my outfit later it's not
the cutest but yeah so I'm about to go
to Dunkin Donuts because I never get
Dunkin in LA because there's only like
two and I miss it so I'm gonna go there
it's on the way to Mel's house and then
I'm gonna pick it up
I got a medium caramel swirl iced coffee
with cream let's see hmm
their coffees so sweet it's like dessert
that's why I like it so much but yeah
now I'm headed off to Mills hey you guys
to pass something no it's turquoise oh
hi
here we are a goodwill I'm gonna turn it
there it is there it is hoping to find
some nice stuff what do we want to find
yesterday I was drifting and I found
these nice vintage Levi's and so I
bought some bandanas they so cute and
you saw it here first I'm looking for
probably more flannels because this is
where I get all my flannels I also
always looking for Levi's and then I cut
I really want a cute coat for a Paris
and I'm like you know maybe you'll come
across something like something funky
yeah maybe hopefully yeah what about you
maybe some super hair goes again
oh yeah Malphite she found platform red
super goes at the third store and I am
salty I may be a Harley shirt check it
out the sweater selections so I really
like my sweaters to be oversized this is
where I always get flannels I don't
think I want this one
but yeah so I found this and I thought
it could be maybe cute if you crop it
really short so we'll see and then Belle
found this
she goes to Syracuse so this could be
dope if you crop it try it on would I
found these on I found these Levi's -
the lighting is really really not good
but I just don't know how they're gonna
fit so we'll see okay guys so I tried
these pants on mind you I tried them on
with leggings and they're just like way
too big like the back
he's like gaping plus they're just like
free too baggy so hi guys currently
driving but Mallett got a shirt the
shirt I showed you but I didn't get
anything so I think we're going to get
some tall eastenders at tulley's and
then afterwards I would Michael play of
the puppy but then I'm going to go to
another thrift store because do it for
the vlog am i right
oh yeah so yeah we'll see I will update
you
okay guys so I just found this camo
thermal and I was thinking that if I cut
it into a crop top very cute and then I
also found this like periwinkle blue
sweater it's like not quite cropped but
a little cropped and I thought this
would be cute and then I still have that
flannel that I showed you so we will see
okay guys so I got some stuff you saw me
try it on I didn't try one thing on but
I'll show you will show you later
everything we got a nice tall we're at a
third location this is the final one of
the day finishing it off because I want
a nice vlog for you guys so oh I never
didn't out for the day I'll try and find
a mirror in there so yeah
wait tell them so I'm looking and I see
these in the little boys section thought
they'd be nice for Tasha see if I fit
also I just found this sweater but I
think it's kind of cute it gives me like
brandy vibes so in the men's I always
like looking at the sweaters - so guys
guys can we just take a moment guys
another interesting find okay so Mel's
gonna show you what she got and then
I'll show you my stuff later okay
there's the shirt yeah I would I drop it
for tailgates like a corduroy like dark
yeah okay let's do my haul it's like I
want you to be in it kind of okay so
what I just got a sister store first I
got this like giant sweater it's like a
three XL men's but I really like like
the fair isle print that's what it's
called
I don't know when it's Christmassy print
but it's softly so soft and I thought
this with like oh it's someone pulling
in your driveway no when they were
backing into it okay I know this with
like over the knee boot it's like black
boots it'd be really cute so I got this
this was seven dollars so like a little
a little up there but it's so soft I
feel like this is like nice okay and
then I got that red sweater because I
took a little bit worn and kind of dirty
but I'll just wash it and it was 70% off
of like seven but yeah you guys like saw
this but jeans did not fit oh yeah and
then I got the three things that I
showed you guys in the first store but
like I'll show you again this this like
periwinkle blue sweater which is really
cute I just need to wear a bra with it
because I look so
please and that I just have piles like
piling on me and then this gap flannel
which is really nice and I just thought
it was like super festive so that and
then I got the camo thermal and I'm
gonna cut this into like a super crab
top and yeah that was four dollars this
was five dollars in the blue sweater I
think was a little pricey to seven
dollars
Oh overall you got a lot yeah so that's
what I got I hope you guys like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
