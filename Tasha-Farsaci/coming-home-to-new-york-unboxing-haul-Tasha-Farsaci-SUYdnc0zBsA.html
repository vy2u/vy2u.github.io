able to go to my bag or my bag
my key it would be fine but I was here
so early I got here at 9:00 p.m. and my
flights not until 750 or 8:50 a.m. I was
here so early that they wouldn't let me
check my bag and they said I can't check
my bag until 6 hours before departure
and I can't go through security without
having my bag check so little even sing
in like the check-in area for almost
four hours now it's like 1:00 a.m. I've
been here since 9:00 and I'm like dying

really great but like I'll show you
I'm currently on revolve but I'm
literally right next to the revolving
door there's a wall here I'm doing
sitting on the floor because this is
where the only plugs were luckily there
was like Dunkin Donuts because I haven't
been able to eat in so long but yeah
once it's six hours before my flight I
am going to go through scooty but this
is so annoying I just want to be home I
just got kicked out of my little area
because they had the back row row
sitting so now I move to a different
floor so cozy so warm you know it's late
when they have like the little floor
cleaners it looks like Zamboni's out
here I literally just want to go through
security over there and I can't I'm so
mad and there's no clubs over here so

with my blog what is this yay oh my god
I needed this so badly I did like make a
little wish list before this so every
time I say like in this video oh my gosh
I really wanted that oh my gosh I say
that to a list I'm not just saying that
to like I actually did make a list for
vlogmas but I'm like dough off of and
obviously like not everything they chose
has been from the list but this was it's
this little trio of batiste dry shampoos
I really really hate washing my hair
because I like to keep the style in as
long as possible
and also for like my coloring I color my
hair I highlight it and I like the color
to stay as long as possible so dry
shampoo has been my Savior lately okay
so the first package I'm going to open
this is actually gifted to me by a
company called weekend advice and it's a
really cute like jumpsuit set open this
I've been wanting like a matching sweat
look so cool okay so a sweatshirt it
looks like this it's black and that I'm
gonna be so much cooler even then it
looked like on vine and then all down
the sleeves there's stars I don't even
know if you couldn't see this and then
this is so fine my gosh okay well
there's like zippers on their sides and
then at the bottom it looks like there's
a t-shirt under it but it's like just
for show kind of thing this is so cool
oh my gosh yes and then the joggers I'm
hoping these are not like way too long
on me I'm really short but they're black
joggers but they have the zippers and
then at the bottom on the backs they
have stars I think it's the backs yeah
the backs which is so fun oh my gosh I
love these I will link them down below I
think I'm also gonna pose an Instagram
for them and these but yeah that's so
exciting
okay and I guess I will open one
more in this video this is a package
from Urban Outfitters and basically when
I was just taking pictures with dope in
Paris Janine tried on these jeans and I
was obsessed with them and they weren't
in my size so I couldn't try them on but
I was like I love them so much I need to
order them right now in my size and hope
that they fit but they literally sold
out the day after I ordered them like
every side whose socks when I ordered
them in the next day they were all sold
out a little bit because they're so cool
autistics Beaufort so they're the kick
flare high rise cropped oh my gosh Jess
these are definitely I think going to
fit they're like oh you washed black but
I love them cuz they're all shredded on
the legs and then they're like slightly
flared but then they're also cropped and
I love to see like buttons I don't know
why this but they're really really cute
so yeah I'll try and Link these down
below maybe they restocked them but I'm
really excited to try these on I will
also try and Link these um this pajama
set down below they have a lot of
patterns as well I actually was watching
a spinto guards or overed Bovard I think
it's over her vlogs and she was wearing
this and like a different pattern which
is also super cute so there's a lot of
patterns and they were so so affordable
so I will link those down below I really
don't know how much I'm gonna do today
because like I said I like just got back
home and I'm chilling I have to vlog
because I've been missing out on vlogmas
well in paris so yeah so i just tried on
these jeans for funsies and they're so
cool they're literally unlike anything
that I have obviously I wouldn't wear
them with this shirt but yeah I'm super
excited about them they're definitely
different I don't have like any flared
pants but I think they're really really
fun so yay hey guys so it's literally
1227 as aina after midnight and i just
woke up i at around like 3 p.m. i don't
even know what time maybe earlier than
that
I was like oh I feel really tired I'm
just gonna like lay down for a bit maybe
take a really quick nap because ideally
I was gonna try and stay up all day and
go to bed like now but I slept until now
so I slept like 10 hours so now I'm
probably gonna be up all night which was
like exact the exact opposite of what I
was trying to do here but whatever I
really need to sleep I hadn't slept in
literally like a full day so yeah I
guess I don't know I think I'm just
gonna like do some YouTube stuff now
maybe read some emails maybe watch some
videos I'm like bundled up in this Co I
got from dough it's like one of those
Sherpa coats this one's from Ruben I'll
try and link link it down below and then
I'm so wearing my PJs but yeah okay so I
also got something else in the mail that
came like this was the thing that came
as I was filming my little haul I
ordered this pair of red jeans and I'm
like debating about them so I need you
guys advice so basically I I'll put a
picture of what they were supposed to
look like on the model a little bit more
slim fit and definitely like a very
cropped and I looked at the length I'm
like I know I'm sure so you guys
probably like posture they're not gonna
be cropped but like the inseam was
shorter than like what I'd normally wear
so I thought they'd be cropped and they
came and they're like they're not
cropped at all they go exactly to the
floor for me and then also they're kind
of loose but I still kind of like how
they look when when they're on and I
cuffed them I'll put in a clip here but
the thing is they're like really
expensive and I'm not sure if they're
exactly what I want so let me know if
you guys like them because if you guys
like them I'll probably keep them but if
not I'll return them and they look for
something in a better fit but yeah if I
do anything else tonight I'll let you
know I don't really know what tonight is
going to consist of hopefully I fall
back asleep but I feel pretty awake
right now so hey guys so it's actually
the next morning now I literally fell
asleep again at like 2:30 I think I've
slept now for like 20 hours or more so
yeah I should be rested up this vlogger
is gonna be really short because I
literally slept all day
I'm so I'm sorry about that but
hopefully you guys still enjoyed it and
stay tuned for the next look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
