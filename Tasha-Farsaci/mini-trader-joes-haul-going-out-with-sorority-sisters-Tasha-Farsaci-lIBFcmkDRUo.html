vlogmas day nine
I think it's nine not totally sure
anyways last night was a long night out
and now I'm just like so tired and I
feel kind of gross I wanted to be
productive today but now I just feel
like super gross so we'll see how that
goes
I'm trying to edit my vlogmas from
yesterday but I took some of videos on
my phone and then week not air-dropping
to my computer so that's super annoying
but I think I'm about to go walk get it
and get a coffee from that new cafe that
I showed you a few of loggs ago because
they have some really cool drinks and I
want to try out more and then I'll
probably eat some leftover of the mac
and cheese that I got from Earth's last
night but yeah I don't really know what
I'm doing today I wanted to go to the
beach but I think it's just too late to
do that now it's like afternoon after
noon it's like after 12:00 and I like
going kata early I know I need to go to
t-mobile today because I want to change
my phone service from Virgin Mobile the
t-mobile so that I have like
international coverage for Paris and you
know any other time that I decide to go
abroad so yeah I just do on the shirt
that dope gave me yesterday with some
just little lemon shorts cute um yeah
and I'm gonna walk over there
know what my skin is doing right here
anyways also I just thought this was
kind of funny I don't know if any of you
guys have ever flown Norwegian airlines
if you have totally let me know because
I'm flying them for the first time going
to Paris but I kept getting emails from
them like pay to upgrade your seats like
pay to get like I don't know whatever
like Niels and like extra stuff you know
what I mean um kind of like first-class
I'm guessing sounds like oh I might as
well look just like see how much it is
literally $600 bye bye I think that's
more than the flight was to begin with
so yeah I won't be doing that okay guys
I really look like pale roadkill right
now um okay so I went to Dolce and I got
a you Vietnamese iced coffee I actually
don't really like it I don't know what I
don't like about it I've never tried it
before but I know it's made with
sweetened condensed milk so I thought I
would like it cuz it would be sweet but
I don't know how I feel the guys that I
had is like four shots of espresso in it
but yeah it's a kind of thick I don't
know how I feel um but then I just
walked into Trader Joe's briefly and I
guess I'll show you what I got people
like that stuff I didn't get a lot I
mainly went in to get a giant bottle of
Fiji normally I'm not this obnoxious and
bushi and I'll just like use my beretta
but this cold from Trader Joe's is only
two dollars which I feel like is really
good especially for Fiji cuz it's
normally expensive so I got this hoping
it'll revive me because I feel like
trash and then the only other thing is I
got risotto it's so good and we and I
both really like it but it's definitely
like really bad for you I feel like
there's so much butter in it but it's
really really good and it's like cheesy
and I just got some like salad Oh
sandwich bread this stuff always goes
bad this stuff always goes bad yeah
really really quickly but it's so good
with toast like I just love making a
toast with it so yeah that's oh my god I
mean I literally have not done anything
all day I still look like trash because
I think I'm going out again tonight with
my both of my bags this time
I went out with Joanna but I think
Brooke is coming tonight too so I'm just
like waiting to get ready yeah so I'm
just waiting to get ready until I get
ready to go out because like why not but
before it gets dark
it's so early it's not even it's only
4:00 and it's already getting dark
that's depressing
anyways I will open my don't love musket
4j9
don't know what this is we'll see if you
guys want to download note the link is
always in the description and if you use
the code Tasha you get five dollars off
and free shipping on your first order
they have tons of amazing stores it's
the best and everything that I've gotten
for don't want with is available on
dough obviously I don't know if that was
like made clear but yeah they sending me
or giving me is available Duke boy huh
oh my gosh gosh
okay so before go Plagne I made a wish
list on don't of just things that I
thought were like in like the price
range for the items so they can have
like an idea of stuff to get this was in
it oh my gosh it's a pug Christmas
pajama set can we just take a moment
guys
do you see this right now hmm oh my god
I don't even know what these all are but
some of them are pugs heads and it's
just like these leggings this is from
boo boo by the way and then with the
pants oh it's oh my gosh
it says Christmas PUD pug so I think
it's loosely like Christmas pudding oh
my gosh this is amazing I'm gonna wear
this tonight okay guys so I am headed to
t-mobile I know how super exciting yeah
I decided to change my phone service
just because I think I'm gonna be going
like abroad a lot more I mean I know I'm
going to like obviously Paris and then
I'm going to Mexico for spring break for
a week and then this summer I really
think I want to try and do some
internship stuff or something
in London perhaps so yeah I just makes
the most sense for me to just switch it
altogether
so hopefully this goes seamlessly I
don't know something we'll probably go
wrong I already tried to go in and do
this like a month ago and my phone was
locked apparently so I had to get unlock
so yeah I'm going now and hopefully it
works out okay guys so I got back from
t-mobile there was a slight mishap but I
don't only think you guys care about my
cellular issues so I'm probably gonna
have to go back there tomorrow but I'm
craving chick-fil-a so badly so I think
I'm gonna go get some and now I need to
get ready because I'm going out and I'm
gonna be so tired I don't want to go but
I know like once I'm out it'll be fun
I'm just like hi guys
so I finally looked like a human oh my
gosh um yes I'm about to go out again I
honestly haven't gone out like two
nights in a row in a really long time
just because I'm just like so grandma
you know it is and I just can't handle
it I really really wanted to hang out
with both my bags clay I never get to
hang out with them all at once and then
another friend Alyssa is coming as well
so I just think I'll be really fun to
help I could girls night but I'm so
exhausted
I literally just like was laying in bed
and fell asleep and luckily I already
did my makeup but a lot of you guys were
asking how I do my makeup like this
because I did it like this before I went
out last night and it's basically just
using the I basically just used the
Urban Decay ultimate basics palette I
use this literally every day
and it's kind of like plop some of the
colors on my eyes and go for it but I'm
literally the same outfit that I wear
lastly except a different top because
one else do I wear these pants I got
these pants are going out pants these
aren't like oh let me away hop on over
to class pants so yeah and my hair is
still straight I haven't like had my
hair straight in a while since last
night and I kind of liked it comment
down below if you guys like my hair
better straight or curl or if like you
think I look that I would the straighter
curl because I feel like curled hair is
prettier but I think some people say
that I look
it's right here so yeah let me know what
you think yeah and then the outfit is
the same as last night except for the
top I actually borrowed this top from
Anna I think this is from Urban
Outfitters but it's just like really
pretty dark teal color and then yeah I'm
wearing the same pants as last night
from Topshop and then the same Steve
Madden booties yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
