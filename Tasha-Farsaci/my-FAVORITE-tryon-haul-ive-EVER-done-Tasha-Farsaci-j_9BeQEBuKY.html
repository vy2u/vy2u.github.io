today I have another haul video for you
this one is month giant of my previous
ones have been but this stuff is
seriously all of my new favorite things
I have worn a lot of these already
because I just couldn't wait they're all
so so cute and they're all from princess
Polly really quick if you guys are not
following me on social media namely
Instagram I post a lot of my outfit
photos on there if you guys are
interested in just keeping up with me on
a day-to-day basis
you can follow me on there and I will
put my other social media handles in the
description just don't want my little
quick thing before I show you guys with
stuff I got you guys are always asking
me how I store all my clothes because I
do a lot of hauls and I am a college
student so I don't have a lot of space
so basically I do struggle with that and
I do sell a lot of my clothes on my
couch market now if you guys don't know
what Poshmark is basically it's an app
or you can find values or even new
clothes from other typical products ok
so this is my Poshmark closet my
username is just Tasha for Saachi and as
you can see I to sum a bunch of items
some are sold but if you scroll down
there are always a lot of items that
aren't sold and I try to kind of share
the ones that aren't sold so they come
to the top but if you guys are checking
it out just know that there's a lot of
items that aren't sold down towards the
bottom so just scroll I'm adding stuff
all the time I try to add things like
every few days so yeah yeah so I have a
ton of my items listed on there feel
free to make offers because I just
really need to get rid of things I'm
moving apartment and I have too much
stuff so yeah totally go on there make
your own closet you know feel free to
share your closets in the comment
section I would love to check out your
items I'm sure other people would as
well you can download Cosmo for free
using the link in the description below
I seriously recommend it I use it all
the time
not only do I sell stuff on there but I
buy stuff on there it's honestly like oh
one of my favorite apps so I totally
recommend it
ok so princess Polly has been all over
YouTube lately but if you are familiar
with it basically it is a store based in
Australia I love it because if you spend
over 75
you get express shipping for free and it
comes in two days literally from
Australia it's like Amazon Prime for
cute clothes so I seriously love it and
everything is so my style I'm going to
fall off with my very favorite thing
from this haul I love it so much I'm
planning on wearing it to beauty con la
so if you guys are going there and you
see me I'll be wearing this it's
actually by make pink so I've been
loving jumpsuits lately especially the
cropped jumpsuits because I'm pretty
sure I'm only 5 foot 1 so full-length
jumpsuits are always away too long I
mean so little cropped jumpsuit thing is
perfect because they're either perfect
length or slightly cropped and I love it
so this jumpsuit oh my gosh I love it so
much you'll see a lot better on
basically it's a black and white polka
dot pattern it has long edge sleeves
and then the front is kind of like you
tie it and then there's a little cutout
which is so cute and then it goes down
into some cropped legs oh I love this
being next thing I actually wore on a
date the other day and before you get
too excited guys the date went well but
the boy is from the UK and he left the
United States so if that's not typical
of my love life then I don't know what
is anyways the shirt is so cute though
basically it's this floral shirt I love
floral and I love stripes you guys will
see that but it's a little shirt and
what I love about it is it's open except
it has these long ties so you tie them
in the car and you'll see I have a lot
of items like that and they call kind of
that jumpsuit was like that you'll see
more what it looks like on but you could
type in a bow you could just tie and not
do your thing I love this and it looks
so cute with high-waisted bottom okay
another item I have already worn I wore
this out there tonight I
it is a straight so rap robbers so it's
not a rap but it looks like it is so it
kind of goes down the front and then as
you can see the front looks like it's a
wrap dress it even has a little tie but
it has shorts so yeah this is so cute
and I have another similar item later on
if you will see but I wore this it's
great this is another one of my
favorites I haven't worn this yet but I
love it once again a floral kind of like
a faux wrap thing going on basically to
dress and if you can see the front has
this like cross over raffish looking
thing out window you'll see on a Tryon
and then the back is adorable as well
it's open and then it just has this
little high so you can adjust that as
tight as you want and I love this it's a
little bit short but I'm quite short so
it works out ok I actually wore this a
few days ago and I posted an Instagram
in it I will show you here it's a two
piece set which are some of my favorites
I just think you look spoke together and
it's going off at harm because you
literally have what you're wearing
together so yellow has been all the rage
lately it's this yellow for alia to
piece the top looks like this it tied in
the front the bottom is a skirt and let
me tell you it's her is pretty dang
short it slowly short I was like there's
no it's going to cover me and it doesn't
but like if you're tall I don't know
it's basically just sort of piece of
fabric with these long strings so you
can wrap it and whatnot
oh and you don't have to win it as upset
clearly you can wear the items
separately so that's something else I
love about that okay I also wore this
clearly you guys can tell I just
couldn't wait to wear these things
because they're so cute so I like this
because the color was just so unique
it's kind of like a dusty rose burnt
orange mixture and it's a good textured
thick material this was another jumpsuit
so it looks like this it's pretty pretty
standard it's cropped it has pockets
which like come on ladies we all know us
the best like my phone fits in here it's
great and then something else that I
just love is the back and open once
again we need little ties if you just
pile it on the back it's the perfect
height
and I just think it adds such a cute
little detail so I love this is getting
compliments on this as well I think it's
just a good unique piece okay going
along with a floral tie front thing
pattern trend we have going on here this
is a green floral romper and I have
nothing really in the serene color I
have a lot of olive green but nothing in
this just like green so it's really cool
it has these ivory colored flowers and
then as you can see the front is open
and you would tie these and a little bow
or not whatever just really cute I love
wearing things like this so yeah this
one is really soft as well this next
number is very similar to that other
striped and wrap romper except it's a
different color I think is like the
colors on this one even more that one is
quite basic it's black and white
but this one is so cool it's for an
orange color and then it has some navy
blue and white if you guys go to
Syracuse University Google colors I
don't and I still love it though yeah
this is so cute once again it has that
little faux wrap with the ties this I
think would be a great transition piece
into the fall with like a ripped up
denim jacket and some booties oh I love
it I love it I love it I love it okay
and then the last clothing piece from
princess Polly is this amazing color
it's kind of like a mixture between an
emerald green and like a teal and I
think it's so amazing the material is so
nice and it's a wrap dress once again
I've been loving these this one is a
long sleeve and then it's just so cute
how many little ruffle at the bottom it
wraps around it's just it's so cute so I
love this I think this can be dressed up
or down okay and last but certainly not
least princess Holly have Beauty things
as well so I picked up a benefit item
because I had tried this before and I
liked it so basically this is the
benefit precisely my brow pencil and
normally I use the Anastasia brow Wiz my
eyebrows but I remember the Sephora once
and I tried this I really like
so I was like okay it's just a brow
pencil I got this in the color number
three and yeah I got it because I like
dark brows you can see my rooster for
brightness right now so this is my
natural hair color it's kind of dark so
I stick to the dark brow but yeah I like
that I've tried it before and once I
finish my brow is I will be just popping
on to this one yeah so that is the haul
