this is like an actual clothing haul so

of these pieces on there as well so if
you want to follow me my username is
just Tasha that would be awesome as well
okay so I have a lot of stuff here most
the stuff I did buy on go to the App
goat this is not sponsored at all I just
kind of want to let you guys know
because I love them and I talked about
them a lot basically dough is a shopping

totally followed me on the app anyway
because I'm always saving things my
favorite list so you can see kind of
what I'm wanting before I actually buy
it okay so I'm gonna start off with
forever 21 I always have like a
love-hate relationship with forever 21
and right now it's definitely a love
relationship I found a lot of really
really cute pieces this first one I saw
on the website and I knew I had to have
it I feel like this would be really
really cute for the 4th of July or
something it's this little red eyelet
lace crop top and I think it's super
pretty it ties in the back okay I also
got this little tank top from forever 21
it's really cute I've worn this in an
Instagram photo it's just super
versatile and it was really affordable I
think it was like $15 by the way I will
be linking everything down below so if
you guys want any of these
down there yeah so anyways I know they
had this and like an orange e color too
but I just thought white or the cream
would be more wearable but it's super
cute okay this next shirt from forever
21 I actually got four sorority
recruitment we have like a little dress
code that we have to wear each today
so it's this cute little black tank top
with this like eyelet lace at the top
really cute kind of cropped and I think
it's gonna be nice this next dress I
also wore an Instagram photo
it's this little striped dress and then
it has a little tie in the front and
then it just goes down it's super
summery you're really adorable and girly
okay and these next two pieces and I
guess last two pieces from forever 21
remind me so much of Reformation that I
thought I had to shut you guys this
first one is a little reprobation dress
dupe because I tried on the dress when
the style was out I think the style was
out like last summer but forever21
totally duped it it's gonna be hard to
see I got it in this like beige Etan
color because I really have nothing in
this color and it's kind of like I guess
out of my comfort zone I mean not really
but it's just nothing I have you'll see
this better than the Tryon but it's like
a little dress that wraps in the front
and it's like the same Lin material that
Reformation is and yeah this is way way
way more affordable I think the
Reformation one is like two hundred
dollars or something and this one is
like twenty something so they have other
colors as well if you're not liking this
like new truly worn but really really
good find
and then this dress I love I don't
really think this is like an exact style
that Reformation had but it just kind of
reminded me of it it's like this little
yellow linen II corset looking dress it
just goes down into like a normal dress
I post a picture and this as well but
it's really cute I think the quality is
really nice and it definitely looks more
expensive than like forever 21 so yeah I
really like this okay this next stuff
you actually can't get on dobe which is
really sad I want them to add a RIT SIA
so badly but Orencia is one of my
favorite stores they just opened one I
think pretty
in Los Angeles so I've gone a few times
and did some damage it's not the
cheapest store which is annoying but the
quality is really great and I found some
pieces and I know I'll be wearing for a
long time all right so I've been trying
to find a cute denim shorts that are
flattering and a good quality for so
long and it's so hard for me to find
denim shorts that fit and look okay I
feel like a lot of people have that
struggle so if you have that struggle
try these out because I love them these
are just the Levi's 501 shorts I know
you can get through 501 shorts at a lot
of different places but I feel like the
ones in a ritzy are way cuter than
everywhere else and I don't know if they
make specific stylist for bhatia or what
but they're super cute so I just got
this kind of light medium wash I wore
these to the beach yesterday that's why
they look kind of worn and then I also
wrap this like washed black one I also
wore these yesterday but I've been
wearing these a time they're so easy I
love how they have like the button up
front they really do look like vintage e
shorts but they're like heyou modern
fits so I'm obsessed with these and the
price wasn't too bad you know for like a
good pair of denim shorts okay and then
I found my new favorite top out of it
see ya I have worn these so much already
it's just these little crop tops but
it's a super thick knit ribbed material
it's so flattering it like sucks you in
but it's really really really
comfortable so I got it in this black
color and then I also got it in my
favorite color this little like nudie
mauve pink which is so cute so I love
these I'm honestly debating getting more
colors because I love them that much and
I think they look good with so many
different things I'm always wearing this
stuff with like boyfriend jeans or denim
shirts or even like yoga pants I wore
the black one with a pair of Lululemon
pants and sneakers and it was still
really cute so love these and then I got
a pair of pants I actually posted this
whole outfit on my Instagram story I'm
just like should I buy it and most you
said yes so I blame you guys but like I
said if you want to see that
stop following an Instagram but these
pants were a bit of a splurge but I've
been wanting a nice pair of patterned
flowy pants for a while and it's so hard
for me to find ones that fit me right
because I'm really short I'm five foot
one so like I mentioned this in so many
videos people coming it so annoyed with
me anyways they look like this I love
the floral pattern and I think they're
supposed to be culottes but I mean they
go like almost full-length because I'm
short and then the back of them has this
little tie and then they also my pockets
so this with the black or the pink top
would be so cute and really just so
comfortable so I'm excited about these I
like wearing them with this hat I know
some people hate these hats but to be
honest my hair should have been washed
today but I didn't feel like it so
that's why I'm wearing the Hat okay
everything else in this haul you
definitely can find on do't so next up
is princess Polly I made the order of
mainly for this pair of shoes because
I've been wanting them for a while I've
been looking at them and I was like do I
need them no but I'm so glad I got them
because I've already won them a lot
they're these like little black mules
but they're by brand sole Sanne I have
another pair of mules and it's like same
shape from Seoul Sanne and I love them I
think they're really flattering on the
foot my hair is accepted and really
comfortable these ones are just kind of
like a straw perforated material but
they go with everything they make
everything look a little bit trendy or
really comfortable and I love them so
I'm really happy about this purchase
okay next one princess Polly I got this
shirt I've been liking this style of
showing lately you'll see I have another
one it used to not be my style at all
but I think it's really cute and just
like casual for now this is just like a
linen II lightweight button-up so I
think this just like you know over a
bathing suit or with like a bra lat and
like some jean shorts and like those
shoes or something it's just like super
effortless and casual I just got the
white one but they have like a few other
colors as well
so I really like this I'm excited to
wear it okay and then this dress is more
of like a going-out dress I guess but I
thought on the website and I knew it
would be really flattering just the way
the material is so it's this like tight
black dress but I don't know if you can
tell it's like all ruched all over which
is really really flattering you can't
really see like any lumps that you don't
want to be seen you know I just kind of
like it's really really stretchy and
comfortable and I love the little thin
straps so I wore this with like a little
cropped jacket and some boots and it was
really cute so you can definitely like
dress this down as well like I did okay
next is Free People
I got this group once again for sorority
recruitment we needed white skirts so I
grabbed this one I'm just like dirt on
this I'm also somehow gotten there on
that but anyways this is a really
popular style skirt BAM I've seen it a
lot and I think it's really cute it's
like not too tight but not too not tight
okay so I just showed you that white
button-up and I also have this one
that's kind of similar from Free People
it's just like this dusty blue color
also kind of just like a chill button up
this one I've gotten a lot of
compliments on it's really soft really
comfy and just like easy to fill on over
anything for this the other day with the
black denim shorts and then those black
mules and it was really cute so yeah I
really like this okay and then lastly
from Free People I grabbed two basic
t-shirts because I never buy basics I'm
always buying all this like random stuff
but never basic tops and I want to just
like a really cute like casual basic tee
so I found this style at Free People I
really like it because it looks just
kind of like chill and like this dress
so I got it in white and I also got it
in black and I've already worn these a
lot of times each definitely recommend
them if you want like a cool oversized
t-shirt from Urban Outfitters I got
another black dress this one is really
cute it's also like a linen material
I've worn this a bunch as well
it has like straight-across neckline
zipper in the back and I just think it's
really really flattering okay and then
from miscellaneous places I wouldn't
this dress off or evolved honestly
forever ago I ordered this potentially
for Coachella and then it was on
backorder so I just got it recently it's
by for loving lemons which is probably
like my favorite brand they're just so
overpriced but I love this dress so much
it's this white dress mm-hmm it's denim
and then it has this like I don't know
what you call it like clasps down the
front I wore this out and I got
complements I think it's really cute and
flattering another kind of random thing
I got these white high-rise jeans from
j.crew was super random I went in there
and saw them and tried them on and they
actually fit really nicely I never go in
j.crew but I love these and I ended up
ordering them online because I wanted
the petite version and they finally came
so they're just plain white jeans and
they're like raw at the end but they're
really nice and really really flattering
okay last thing in this haul video I got
these Air Force Ones
I really like these but I'm kind of
confused because I don't know if like I
would hate these but I do really like
them I got them in a kids size off of
dote it was like a store called Jimmy
jazz or something they were just sold
out everywhere else and adult sizes and
I were a six and a half
I brought these in the boys four and a
half and they fit me great yeah and of
course ones they're really cool right
now I guess and I like them I like how
they look so I got these yeah so that's
everything in this haul video I know is
a lot of stuff so if you guys stuck with
me thank you so much as always I want to
film what you guys want to see you so
