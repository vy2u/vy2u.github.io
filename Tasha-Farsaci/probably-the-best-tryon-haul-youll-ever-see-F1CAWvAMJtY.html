channel if you are new here my name is
Tasha please subscribe if you haven't
already yet that would mean the world to
me so today I am coming to you with
another clothing haul video I know I do
a lot of these but I'm a clothes addict
and you guys always say that you love my
hauls so I'm gonna keep providing if you
guys like my style you should totally
check out my Instagram and follow me if
you like it I post tons of outfit photos
and just photos in my daily life so if
you want to keep up with me more anymore
keep up with me more on a more personal
basis totally follow me on there because
I post there pretty frequently and I
will be listing my other social media
handles down below the description so if
you guys do want to follow me totally
check down there I always like
everything from my hauls in the
description section so if you guys don't
want anything from this video totally
check down there and the products will
be linked ok so the first few items are
actually workout clothes kind of slash
athleisure clothes depending on if you
really do workout or you're like me and
you workout once in a blue moon but like
wearing workout clothes
anyways so we'll work out clothes are
from fabletics you guys have probably
heard of them I love them so much I've
shown some other items and videos before
but if you guys don't know what they are
I'm going to explain it to you guys by
the way fabletics is sponsoring this
video but I want to let you guys know I
love fabletics and I spend my own money
on their products before I am a VIP
member myself which I will explain a
little bit in a minute but yeah I love
them so obviously I'm going to say yes
through sponsorship but like I said I
have totally spent my own money on fat
wedeck's so yes okay so basically
fabletics is in Activ where kind of
website they have really really high
quality clothing that is comparable to
very very expensive athletic brands I
would say the quality is even better
than a lot of really really expensive
athletic brands they do have an optional
VIP membership service which I really
really do recommend like I said I am a
VIP member myself so I do think it's
worth it you pay a lot less than you
would if you were not a VIP member
basically in the beginning you take a
personalized style quiz and then every
month athletics will kind of recommend
their new collection to you with the
pieces that they think you would like
you don't have to pick
from that collection you can pick
whatever or if you don't want to get
anything for the month you can skip the
month and you won't be charged at all I
skip the month a lot and trust me I've
never been charged so yeah I totally
totally recommend the VIP option if you
guys like fabletics because you're
getting a huge discount and you can
always skip the month if you don't want
pieces that month this is the deal that
made me sign up for the VIP subscription
thing in the first place if you guys
click the link in the description you
guys can get two pairs of leggings for
$24 and I am telling you these leggings
are impeccable quality so that's with
the VIP subscription once again I
totally recommend it and these leggings
are insane
so check down there if you're interested
okay so now I'm going to show you the
stuff that I got I really really love
all of it I can't wait to wear it I
haven't worn any of it yet because I
wanted to show it to you guys all fresh
and new but I'm really excited
so the first pair is just a pair of
black leggings I have these leggings and
kind of like a dark teal color that I
bought myself and I love them the
quality is so good I always get
compliments on them so I wanted to get
them in just the plain black pair
because I wear black leggings like every
day of my life these are their high-rise
ones and I believe they're also the 7/8
length I get these because I am 5 foot
one so these hit me at a really good
spot there's no bunching at the bottom
but they're super super thick and guys I
wish you could feel these the quality is
amazing and the fact that you could get
two pairs for $24 it is insane
I would know because I did it but ok
I've been wanting a pair of white
athletic shorts for the longest time but
all the ones I've looked at have been so
expensive so I saw these ones on
fabletics and I think they're so so cute
I'm obsessed with them they're these
little white shorts I like my workout
shorts to be pretty short I'm really
short so otherwise it just looks like
not cute but these ones are adorable
they're white and then they have these
cool little leg zipper details on the
side really adorable I'm so excited to
wear these I think they're gonna look
awesome with the tan as well so really
happy I finally got a pair I grab this
black long-sleeve shirt from fabletics
because for some reason I don't have any
black long-sleeve shirts that I would
wear with like athleisure outfits or
workout outfits none that I think are
cute or flattering and this one is both
it's just this black long-sleeve but the
material is so nice and then on the
sleeves as well as halfway down the
shirt it's kind of more like a wofully
knit match material kind of hard to
explain but really cute
I would wear all these pieces I'm
showing you together so yeah this is
really really nice super great quality
and I know I'm gonna get my rear out of
this for sure ok the last thing I could
not help myself
I needed it it's like my favorite color
ever like a light baby
mauve pink and it's a really really
adorable hoodie this is so so incredibly
soft and it has these really cute ties
on the bottom I don't even see so you
can kind of like make the fit a bit
different you will see this better in
the Tryon section but this is so
extremely soft can't wait to go this on
this is gonna be so cute with those
black leggings and some sneakers like
really really cute really really
comfortable
yeah so that is the stuff from fabletics
once again check the description for
those products linked as well as a
special offer for 2 for 24 leggings so
amazing ok next I have some stuff from
forever 21 and guys I swear forever 21
it goes through phases of having
bomb-ass stuff and then stuff that I'm
just kind of like me and I found the
cutest stuff I want one of these things
in an Instagram photo the other day and
everyone was freaking out I tagged
forever 21 and everyone was like how do
you find something that cute at forever
21 and I'm telling you everything I'm
about to show you is that cute and from
forever 21 so hopefully all this stuff
is still in stock when I post this video
I'm gonna start off with the piece that
I posted in it's a two piece set but the
pieces were sold separately so I think
that might be why some people are
struggling to find it the table looks
like this it's a little striped crop top
really really adorable the side has some
buttons and then it comes with or
doesn't come with but there's a matching
skirt here's what it looks like
unfortunately the skirt
is a little bit too big on me when I
took a photo in it I had the back
clipped this is a size small and I don't
believe they had an extra small if they
did it was sold out but if you were my
size keep in mind the skirts probably
gonna be a little big on you I can just
go and get it taken in or whatnot
keep that in mind however this is so
cute and everyone thought it was from
like urban outfitters or some way more
expensive place so yeah this is a really
good find and I'm really happy because I
can wear these pieces separately as well
okay I got another two-piece set this is
kind of what inspired me to make the
whole order I love cherries right now I
think they're really really adorable so
I grab this other two-piece set this one
fits me perfectly it's this a white
little crop top and the cherries aren't
embroidered which it's just a really
great touch it makes it look a lot more
expensive and it buttons up the back and
then this skirt did come in an extra
small so this one fits me perfectly
the only thing is it's super short if
you guys are tall I don't know guys
this is a really really mini the back
has a cute little zipper and I think
this is one of the cutest things ever so
really adorable love this totally
recommended the quality is great and it
looks way more expensive that is okay
next thing I got is a dress I actually
wore this the other night this kind of
reminds me of a reformation dress only
because I tried to buy a denim dress
from them before it didn't fit me right
so I returned it that one was really
expensive this one it was like 20
something dollars it's this black denim
dress oh gosh those hair on it black
denim dress straight-across neckline
kind of and then it just has a zipper
that goes all the way down this is like
a fitted dress but not super tight so I
think it's flattering it doesn't look
like too skin tight but if you know it
hits the right places if you know what
I'm saying but I really really like this
kind of washed black color they also had
it in a light blue denim color or too
kind of white as well but yeah this is
so cute and I think it was a really good
fine okay and the last thing oh no it's
not the last thing the second to last
thing from forever 21 I don't know why
this stood out to me I really love denim
or not denim I really love overall
dresses and I
the color red right now so I found this
one and I didn't even think of it at the
time but this will be so cute for USC
football games like game days it'll be
really cute
I definitely wear this otherwise as well
but I just think that's gonna be
adorable
so it's this quarter right red overall
dress the back is completely open which
I really like I would probably wear this
with a little like black band oh and
some sneakers but I just really like the
front of it
thought this like a little pull
everything was really cute and I love
red lately so yeah okay not lasting from
forever 21 I actually saw this in a few
people's haul videos everyone was saying
this is a free love and lemons dupe I'm
not positive but I thought it was really
cute as well and I decided I wanted it
and I wore this in my last video and a
lot of people were asking where I was
from it's from forever 21 but it's this
really really girly dress it's a little
bit more girly than I would normally go
but I just thought it was so cute so
it's like a layered kind of fun
roughly dress it's pretty short really
really cute though this was like a denim
jacket I think would be adorable so okay
last story how things from is revolve I
love her ball so much but it's so
expensive the first thing is a two piece
set that I bought for Coachella and yeah
it was super pricey but I know I'm gonna
wear these pieces after Coachella as
well because they are pretty wearable
and I was hoping that when it came in
the mail it wouldn't fit so I could
return it you guys I would do that you
could buy anything that's expensive
and then you're like oh please don't fit
it so I can get my money back
but this fit perfectly it looks so cute
so I'm gonna wear it to Coachella
surprised ruined but here is the top and
it's by the brand lovers and friends
here's the top it's just a really cute
crochet crop top bralette thing but for
Coachella I'm wearing it with this
matching skirt these are sold separately
as well but they look so cute together
and it's just this same like crochet
eyelet lace miniskirt once again and
this would look so cute with so many
little like crop tops so although this
was pricey
I don't wanna wear these pieces again
and it's gonna look so cute for
Coachella
so excited I'm going weekend one coming
down below if you guys are going and
what your outfit is that you're most
excited about because I still need
outfit ideas okay last thing from
revolve I got this on super super sale
so if it's still on sale it will be
linked down below but it says top
Tularosa
it's just a little floral top but I
really really like the tie detailing it
has this kind of like scrunchie tie
thing on the sleeves as well as the
front so you can kind of like adjust it
to be as a cropped or not cropped as you
want which I just thought was really
cute I wore this the other night with a
fun strappy Briella and some black jeans
but yeah I'm a sucker for floral so this
is on super sale and I thought it was
adorable yes was everything in this haul
