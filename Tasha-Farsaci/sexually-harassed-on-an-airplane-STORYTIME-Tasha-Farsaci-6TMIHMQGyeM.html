today I have a story time basically I
mentioned this occurrence on my snapchat
and my Instagram if you guys don't
follow me on there and you want to get
these sneak peeks into my life feel free
but anyways I mentioned this on both of
those platforms and you guys from all
like oh my gosh story time story time so
yeah Here I am I do want to make a
disclaimer before I do this video as you
can tell by the title this video is
going to include sexual harassment I
just want to make it very clear that I
am in no way trying to downplay the
importance and the problem that sexual
harassment is I know it's so so serious
and it may seem like I'm kind of
laughing about my situation in this
video but that's just because it was
very minor it was 20 fold back on but I
am in no way trying to say that sexual
harassment is funny I just want to make
that clear because it's not at all and
just because this happened to me and
nothing bad came out of it and I was
okay that I find it kind of it's okay
for me to like look back on and kind of
chuckle but obviously that's not the
case for sexual harassment as a whole
and I just want to put that out there
okay so basically this isn't going to
just be the story time from that
specific circumstance this is going to
be the story of an entire day and
basically it was the day from hell so
basically I was traveling from Los
Angeles to New York City for my
internship I'm an intern for dope
shopping there startup app and I was
going to New York for some events and
stuff that they were having all right I
think like flight was at like 10 10:50
something like that and when I have to
wake up early for a flight or for
traveling or just anything that I have
to wake up early for an event I get
really nervous and just anxious and I
can never sleep one of those situations
where I'm so tired
my whole body's tired my eyes are
drooping but I can just not fall asleep
I took melatonin I was trying everything
and I just couldn't sleep so basically I
slept for a maximum of two hours before
I woke up to go to the
for Alex being early to the airport I
like being early in general that's why I
got up like so early for that flight but
also lax is always super busy in the
traffic it was really bad so you never
know basically the first thing that
happened was that I went to the airport
the little ramp you go on to kind of get
to be like departure terminal when you
get dropped off was blocked for some
reason I'm like let me know why I don't
know
so my ruber driver just took me to the
level below that was for arriving flight
so he thought that Virgin America which
is what I was flying would be you know
the same above and below so that he he
dropped me off below average in America
I could just go up and be in the right
spot and I assumed that - I would only
argue with him so I just got off and
went up and it wasn't Virgin America and
basically at Virgin America was like a
whole terminal down so I wheeled my
giant suitcase down like a half-mile
anyways I finally got to Virgin America
and I get in there and I'm looking at my
boarding pass and I'm really confused
because my flight says an hour later
than what I had thought I think mine was
supposed to be 10:50 it's at 11:50 or
something along those lines and I was
like what the heck and for while I just
was really confused I thought I just
messed up the time zones and I was like
really stupid or something but then I
figured out my flight was delayed
basically I could have slept an extra
hour but I was like okay it's only an
hour delay I'm fine with it I'll get
some coffee you'll get some food all day
because I had barely slept I felt so
nauseous and I was like anxious about
flights and flying so I just felt so
sick I really got food and could barely
eat it anyways so I'm finally at the
gate I'm about to board I'm standing up
getting ready to board and all of a
sudden Peter who is the real MVP who
works a dope he organized all my flights
and stuff he texts me and he's like hey
I just saw your flights canceled I'm so
sorry like I'm gonna try and figure it
out and I'm like um what I bet if this
gate for a while I'm literally about to
board why would they have not said it
was canceled so like two minutes later
they're like oh like cancel pennants and
throw Peter so awesome and he
immediately tried to get me on a
vergence why
the next version flight and it was false
so he switched me to a JetBlue flight I
was supposed to be in like two hours or
so I think it was supposed to be around
1:00 1:30
so Peter assured me that people at
Virgin America said they would transfer
my bag for me to JetBlue because now I'm
going to hassle for me to have to try
and like go back to the beginning get my
bag from Virgin America rechecking and
we go through security so he said that
he talked to the people and if they said
they would switch my bag conversion to
JetBlue anyways so I walk for like 25
minutes and finally get to the JetBlue
terminal and I'm just chillin and all of
a sudden I do text it says my flight is
now delayed until 5:50 so that is five
more hours I honestly didn't really have
a choice at this point I was going to
leave the airport so I have bought Wi-Fi
and just like one on my laptop but there
was no pause anywhere so my laptop was
on my phone is dying I thought I was
gonna throw up like it was just really
great so sign of the time comes I'm
about to board my JetBlue flight and my
mom was texting me and she's like okay
you just want to go up to the dress and
make sure they have your bag because my
checked bag that's what I mean when I
say my bag I had I had medication in
there and I know I'm so stupid I should
have packed it in my carry-on but I just
figured we're not connecting anywhere my
bag not going to get lost so I literally
had medication in there I had all my
clothes in there like everything and I
needed to say oh I wait in line the
service desk and I went to lady and I'm
like hi I'm just checking to make sure
my bag was transferred I was told that
it was and she's like well we don't do
that you would have had to go back and
do it yourself I was like okay yeah I
understand that but my fellow employee
called and he said that virgin said that
they would transfer to just blue so I
just wanted to see and make sure that
happened and this lady illegally goes
I'm sorry but that's not our priority
right now we have a plane to board and I
was like okay so you're telling me that
my bag is not coming on this plane and
she's like no so I'm all for out
I'm like I'm not going to have any
of my stuff so I'm texting Peter and
he's calling them to figure it out
meanwhile I'm boarding this plane and
basically he says that the baggage
people lied to him and instead of
transferring it they put it on the next
version flight to New York so okay I was
like all right that's fine it gets in
like an hour and a half after mine I'll
just wait at the airport like at this
point I'm already going to be late okay
so now comes the good part
so originally I had a window seat window
seats are my favorite I love taking
those RC plane window photos you know I
was like leaning against it I don't want
to worry about like a leaning on anyone
next to me but it since it was such a
last-minute transfer I had the middle
seat honestly at this point I didn't
care like as long as I had a seat in the
plane was moving and going to New York I
was fine so when I first sat down there
is another girl to my left and then
there's no one in the window seat so I'm
just sitting in the middle seat and then
all of a sudden from behind me
this guy like throws his stuff into the
seat next to me so apparently he had
been in the wrong seat and he was meant
to be next to me you guys know what
normally plane etiquette when someone is
spitting me inside and you're on the
outside and you're already sitting you
kind of get out and then let them get
all this stuff in so I like stood up to
get out there go down next to me and
instead of this guy waiting for me to
get out he like came in as I was getting
out and like rubbed against me and are
you ready to probably thinking oh gosh
your reaction but wait so you're the
rest of the story so that was weird and
you know like some people you can just
you just you look at them and you just
like interact with them for like a
minute and you're like okay something is
off okay so as soon as this guy sat down
he immediately like started talking to
me and the girl next to me was like hey
like are we going to be best friends on
this flight like a you guys fans you
know each other like we're going to be
really great friends and you like
introduce himself and I was like okay
whatever like personally I don't like
when people talk to me on airplanes
unless you're like Zac Efron or
something you know small talk okay but
like you know after the play after we
get on after the initial like
introductions like I don't really want
to talk to anyone especially since I'm
freaking out of my bag and I
this long-ass day like I honestly just
wanted to like chill for this guy
then whips out his laptop he whips out
his headphones and he starts like
aggressively mixing a beat and it is
loud like I'm sitting next to him yes in
my view he is halfway in my seat
we don't have the armrest down so he's
like all in me like all in my feet so
yeah his head is pretty close to mine I
can hear this entire thing and he like
whips off his headphones and meanwhile
he's like this
like mixing the beat and he like looks
at me and this girl and he's like you
guys like like house music you want to
listen to this and the girl next to me
is like oh no I'm like no thank you and
we look what's in me and he's like come
on like listen to it like oh no am I
really okay and he's like just keep
asking me okay like I could already hear
this guy's music because it was playing
so loud I didn't really want to listen
to it but I was like okay if I look into
it maybe decide to stop so I'm like okay
sure it's Riley listen to her for 30
seconds and I'm like oh yeah like it's
super cool and then he shows me the
title he's like oh like what do you
think of the title okay I honestly think
this title might be like offensive I'm
not going to say it I'll like put on the
screen I mean I don't even know if it's
a difference like you guys have to see
what it was I didn't know to say I was
like um okay that's okay
so I kind of I had really avoided
complete eye contact this whole time but
I wasn't like holding eye contact for a
while so as soon as I like go to give
him back his headphones and I make eye
contact he like gives me this weird book
and he goes oh you know what you're like
mad cute yeah you're a hard ten okay so
at this point is where I started getting
like I'm uncomfortable because like
thank you
but like no thank you this guy told me
that he was like 21
he wasn't like old and creepy but like
he was not cute I was not in the
slightest bit interested so this was
just a really awkward and just boy we
hadn't even taken off yet so I was like
oh great this is going to be a really a
a really interesting experience so
basically I just put headphones in I
start watching like the TV's on the seat
in front of me and I can
still hear him like Nixon and beats with
my headphones in but I'm kind of
ignoring him and like every once in a
while he'll like start talking to me
when I could have had phones and so like
take one out and I'll answer he keeps
asking me to listen to his beep at one
point he's like oh you want to listen
I'm literally like oh I can hear it
don't worry so if there's like one point
that's why I'd say this is like midway
through his life and I'm watching bones
on TV and he just starts talking to me
he's like what you watching and so I
tell em I put my headphone back in he's
keep asking me he's like oh so what are
you doing in New York like where you go
in I'm answering about I'm doing like
one-word answers because I would not
having this
so then ladies and gentlemen I think I
can say something and I think to myself
I'm like no there's no way he just said
that like no I'm also pretty wrong so I
take out my headphone and I go what and
he goes can I kiss you can't I kiss you
oh I miss the moment I am just in shock
I literally go no like that exact way I
literally said it like that and he was
like taken aback he was like wow that
was a pretty harsh no I don't know how
like no one around up heard this
everyone had headphones in and it was
like really dark and at this point
normally like a pretty passive person if
something happens I don't really do
anything about it I just like let it
happen and like ignore it but I just
felt so uncomfortable and shoutout
JetBlue they have Wi-Fi on their planes
like free Wi-Fi so I immediately like
text my mom and she's like that's not
okay like you need to leave like move
seats and I thought the flight was full
but I was like okay yeah I can't handle
this this is so so strange oh I like get
up and pretend to go to the bathroom
and find a flight attendant until it
would happen and basically she moved me
and it's like a bigger seat in whatever
so yeah when the plane finally landed
she like kind of stayed near to sea with
me until he got off and let me tell you
like I moved up so this guy was behind
me on the plane
I got off that plane I like booked it to
baggage claim I was like I do not want
this guy catching up with me anyways I
ended up with my baggage for like an
hour and a half
finally got it : over to New York it was
like over a hundred dollars great
finally got in it was almost for I am
but you know I survived anyways that is
my story of getting sexually harassed on
an airplane as you guys any weird creepy
guy or creepy girl experiences just
count them down below because I honestly
find them so entertaining as creepy and
messed up as they are anyways I love you
guys all so much if you like story times
let me know and stay tuned for next
