this video is not going to be my normal
video on this channel so yeah just
putting that out there basically last
night something pretty scary um after
looking back I would say pretty scary
happened to my friend and I and hits
something that I feel like if I told the
story could potentially help a lot of
other girls maybe even guys out there
and a lot of my viewers maybe and even
if it doesn't directly help you I think
it's just something good to have in mind
so yeah this happened to me last night
it's the morning now so this is a really
fresh in her mind I wanted to film this
when it was fresh in my mind and it was
just it really like it took me and took
me aback um so I just really wanted to
film this video
okay so last night I was not having the
best night I was kind of down in the
dumps
so my friend Anna and I decided to go
out just to kind of have some fun like
lift my spirits or whatever
and we decided to go out in Venice
California if you guys are from LA you
will know what Venice is if not it
doesn't really matter I'm just gonna say
where we were in case you guys are from
here and you just want to be more aware
of your surroundings so we were going
out in Venice we had had a few drinks
that's not what this video was about but
yeah just putting that out there
yeah so we went out and we were standing
outside of a bar I don't even know what
time this was this was probably around
1:00 maybe 12:30 but we were around the
corner from a bar standing against the
wall kind of trying to figure out if we
wanted to go some or else if we want to
go home or if we wanted to like get food
or whatever so we were just standing
there just talking to each other so all
of a sudden these two guys come up to us
and I don't even know how I don't I
don't want this to come across as like
offensive or anything but these guys
were clearly gay it was just like it
wasn't even a question in
I had they looked like they were a
couple and they were gay like I if you
were there I'm almost positive you would
have the same response like I don't want
to sound like I'm stereotyping or
anything but that's just like that's the
reality of the situation so these two
gay guys come up to us they're dressed
super cute like leather jacket like
super trendy I would say they're in like
their mid-thirties so they come up to us
and I don't even know if what they
started off with probably asking us like
what we were doing
mind you they hadn't come from inside
the bar they just kind of like a period
out of nowhere yeah and they were asking
us what we were doing and then they go
in to say that they own a boutique in
Venice and if you guys are familiar with
the Venice area that's not uncommon
there's a lot of just little boutiques
around so they were like yeah we own
this really cute boutique we're just
going to go back and have some wine you
guys should totally come and I realized
as I'm telling this story you guys were
probably thinking like tosh.o this is
the dumbest like are you dumb but yeah
in the moment after having a few drinks
it's just like it didn't seem weird to
me so anyways these guys like Joey get
have a wine night like it'll be super
fun you can try on stuff in our boutique
I was just kind of like going along with
it whatever and she was like oh like
what's your boutique like what's the
name and they wouldn't tell us they
didn't tell us the name of their
boutique but they were just saying oh my
gosh meat house like Chanel we have like
tons of sunglasses and at the time I
should have realized that like I don't
think boutiques in Venice have Chanel to
start off with um I mean unless they're
like a consignment boutique or something
yes so I was just like oh like why not
whatever like could be fun and so the
guys are like okay like we'll call an
uber and shortly after they were like oh
the overs here so they walk us around
this corner and we're not in like a dark
alley but it's definitely more of like a
side street so they had Sundy Cooper was
here but one of them is on the phone
with someone and it really didn't seem
like it was an uber driver
I feel like there's a way that you would
talk to an uber driver and this guy was
kind of talking to the person on the
phone like they knew each other
he was just like we're here pull up kind
of thing and I think that's not what you
would say to an uber driver so we're
just kind of standing there talking and
all of a sudden Ana pulls out her phone
and she's like my gosh Tasha that really
cute guy from the bar just texted me
like he wants us to come back and this
is kind of when like a little like bell
went off in my head because we had not
met cute guys at the bar at all and she
had been trying to get away from the
guys at the bar so I knew that she was
like uncomfortable and want him to leave
so in this moment I was like okay we got
to get out of here but I don't want it
to be super abrupt we're just gonna like
act natural in the situation yeah so I
was just kind of going along with the
situation I was like oh my gosh yeah
that guy was really cute let's go back
and she kind of throws in she's like oh
my gosh yeah and he was in real estate
just like kind of to throw it in and
these two guys were like that's so dumb
like real estate that's what everyone
says he's probably so poor and this was
kind of weird that these guys would be
like getting defensive so that was kind
of weird and then we go to walk away and
Ana says to them hey it was really nice
meeting you guys we should meet up some
other time what are your numbers and
this is where they go so cold and
they're like no like we're not giving
you our numbers like bye so ana and I
walk away as quickly as possible and
yeah I just kind of hits us that okay
maybe these were guys just trying to get
us to come to their boutique and drink
wine but putting all the pieces together
a these were either straight guys
completely straight luring us back
somewhere most likely not a boutique who
knows where who knows what would have
happened be they could have been hired
actors um that uber driver could have
been a friend also a not it and once
again who knows where we could have
ended up and yeah I don't know maybe
some of you think that I'm overreacting
that I'm making this all up but I've
never been in a situation where looking
back it just
so off and I hear about these things all
the time and I just never felt like I
was someone who would be in one of those
situations I feel like I'm pretty aware
and I could pick up on cues and stuff
and I was just not
and luckily Anna like picked up on that
if she wasn't there I don't know where I
would be right now anyways we ended up
getting back home fine and I told my
roommate what happened and she told me
that I should probably call the police
so I called 9-1-1 and just alerted them
up what happened what the guys looked
like yeah so I reported it I really
don't know if that did anything but I
think the whole point of this video was
just to kind of just make you guys aware
because I feel like you always hear
things like this that happened but you
never know who they happened to and even
though maybe you guys don't know me
personally I feel like you know you know
me through YouTube
anyways yeah thank you guys so much for
watching this video feel free to share
this with anyone that you know that you
think it could help I just want to be
able to help as many people as I can
yeah feel free to leave any comments
down below if anything like this has
happened to you and maybe we can just
make everyone a little bit more aware so
yeah I love you guys so much
sorry for being on a more serious note
today but yeah stay tuned for more
videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
