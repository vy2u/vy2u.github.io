so today I am doing my morning routine
for the summer this summer I am
basically just focusing on YouTube so my
mornings vary depending on what I'm
doing that day but most days I'm just
waking up and either filming videos
editing videos or just doing that kind
of stuff this video is going to focus a
little bit on how I get ready and what
makeup I use in the summer so if you
guys are interested in that you'll
definitely like this video and I do want
to thank Hawaiian Tropic for sponsoring
this video
I have used their brand for so long and
I think it's such a great company so I
will get more into that later on in case
you guys don't know anything about me I
am a student at the University of
Southern California so I am still living
by campus this year so I do go on campus
a lot and do work still and if you guys
do want to get to know me even better I
will put my Instagram here on the screen
I post a lot of fashion lifestyle
pictures and my friends so if you guys
want to get to know me better like I
said feel free to follow me on there and
I will have my other social media
handles down below in the description so
yeah without further ado let's go okay
so one of my favorite parts about summer
is that a lot of the times I don't set
an alarm and kind of just wake up on my
own accord
normally the light coming through my
window there wakes me up and I
eventually just look on my phone and
finally roll out of bed hello guys so
the first thing that I do in the morning
is usually it brush my teeth
sometimes I shower in the morning
sometimes I shower at night for the sake
of this video I'm just gonna shower at
night
yeah I'm not gross I shower but yes I am
gonna brush my teeth because that's so
important so yeah
okay so after I brush my teeth slash
shower if I'm going to shower I will do
my makeup this is mainly just to kind of
make me feel better about myself and
more productive I feel like when I look
put together I just do a lot more and
I'm not as lazy so yeah stay tuned and
I'll show you how I do my summer makeup
so my morning routine changes every
season but I'm always making sure to do
what's best for my skin and especially
in the summer months the sun's rays are
crazy and I don't think I've ever told
you guys this but my mom actually had
skin cancer so I need to be a lot more
careful and just careful in general of
my skin and make sure that I'm taking
care of my skin so the first thing I
always do before putting on my makeup is
apply some sunscreen to my face this is
the Hawaiian Tropic antioxidant plus
sunscreen lotion this is the 30 SPF but
I also have the 50 I like this one
because it's resistant in water up to 80
minutes and although I may not be
swimming every day I sweat a lot I'm a
sweaty person so even my face is gonna
be sweating my body will be sweating I
do put this on my body as well and this
specific type the Hawaiian Tropic
antioxidant plus is recommended by the
Skin Cancer Foundation to protect
against the sun's rays so like I said
this is really great and even if you
don't have history of skin cancer and
your family I really really recommend
doing this because no one wants a
sunburn and like I said I do put it on
my body as well but for the sake of this
morning routine we're just gonna put it
on my face for this video good stuff
smells really really good as well it
doesn't have that weird sunscreen smell
at all it smells really really nice I
will have a link in the description if
you guys want to learn more about this
so definitely check down there ok guys
so first off is makeup I don't want a
lot of makeup in the summer just because
in Los Angeles it gets so hot and it
just melts off my face but I do like to
look a little bit more put together and
I feel like without makeup I look like a
12 year old so I like to put some makeup
on first thing I always do before I buy
makeup on is but my
up just so I have my clean slate of a
face okay so after I've applied my
sunscreen I do like to conceal my face
I'm not a big foundation where I say
this in most videos where it showed me
during my makeup I don't really wear
foundation but I do wear concealer
because I have a lot of redness going on
and just under-eye circles so I like to
cover those up this is the maybelline
instant age rewind this one is almost
gone I use these almost every day so I'm
just gonna put this on under my eyes and
then just any other areas that I
consider like problem areas that I want
to kind of cover more and then I always
put on my eyelids just to kind of create
more of a neutral base on my eyelids
okay and then taking a damp Beauty
Blender this one is like a fake Beauty
Blender I don't even know what this is
but I just kind of Pat in my concealer
okay so once I blended in my concealer
for the most part I just kind of set it
as well as my whole face with a pressed
powder this is the Rimmel stay matte
powder I kind of switch up my powder all
the time but I do really like this one
and it's really affordable at the
drugstore so I find myself going back to
this one a lot so yeah I just kind of
put this all over my face focusing on
the areas that I put the concealer okay
after powder I always do my eyebrows
this is an important step of my makeup
routine that I could never skip so I'm
just taking this little eyebrow pencil
this is the NYX micro brow pencil it's
very comparable to the Anastacio oh
what is it there little pencil I can't
remember the name of it but it's super
comparable I ran out of that one and
then just went to the drugstore and
found this one and I really liked it so
I kind of fill in my eyebrows I'm in the
front with this and then use the
Anastasio dip brow pomade on the rest of
my eyebrows so I always brush them out
using a little spoolie and first and
then like I said I'd start filling them
in I'm not gonna do too much of this on
camera because
if difficult and I've done my eyebrows
and a lot of other videos so if you guys
really want to see how I do them check
out any of my other videos where I do my
makeup but yeah okay so once I am done
filling in my eyebrows I set them with a
clear gel or clear mascara this one is
really old I get a new one I just use
the Maybelline Great Lash clear mascara
can discuss kind of keeps my eyebrows
from moving around all day so I just
kind of brush them how I want them okay
so I try not to wear a lot of eyeshadow
in the summer just because I don't
really like having a lot of makeup on
like I said but I do enjoy putting on
just a little bit of a shimmery color
all over my lid this is the Becca
palette I'm not exactly sure which one
it is but it just had a lot of really
pretty shimmery shades so I'm just gonna
take the lightest one right here and put
it all over my lid okay after eye shadow
I will apply eyeliner I don't do this a
lot in the summer but the mistake of the
video I decided to do it this is just a
brown pencil eyeliner I'll put a thin
line on my top lash line and it just
makes me look a little more awake or put
together in my opinion so yeah I'm gonna
do this probably not gonna do it on
camera just because it's kind of
difficult to film but yeah just take a
thin medium thin line my upper lashes
okay after eyeliner i will apply mascara
this changes all the time but currently
I'm just using the OG covergirl
LashBlast so I'm just gonna put this on
my upper and lower lashes I use a lot of
mascara because I like bold eye lashes
but it's totally up to you you know how
much you want to use okay so once my
mascara is on I'm feeling like a human
again but I just want to add one more
thing this is me my life is ava collab
with color pop and I really like it the
mirror broke out of this one
but it's just like this lucky bronze
color and then I'll hide
so I've been using those a lot lately
this just adds some color in my face
okay so that is pretty much fit for my
summer makeup and in terms of my hair I
normally leave it natural but it
actually just happened to already be
straight from yesterday so today my hair
is kind of straight but I do like to
leave it natural in the summer and just
kind of use some products so that it
stays fairly healthy right now it's just
kind of wonky from sleeping on it but
yeah that's my makeup okay guys so I
just got dressed this is a super simple
casual outfit and it's kind of cold out
so I'm like a little bit bundled up like
I said this outfits not really cute but
in the summertime unless I'm going
somewhere special I just kind of throw
on whatever so I'm just wearing this
little tea from brandy so I'm Levi's
jeans some shoes from Steve Madden and
then this like throw over a cardigan
from Vince but yeah pretty comfy I think
today all I'm gonna do is like YouTube
work so I want to be comfy but still
kind of cute at the same time so
normally I will make my own breakfast
and my own coffee but I actually just
got back from being home in New York for
two weeks so I have like no food here so
I'm about to go walk into the University
Village and probably get some coffee
and maybe some food and then probably
gonna go grocery shopping as well later
but yeah I'm gonna go into the village
and then once I have my coffee and my
food I'm probably gonna start doing some
YouTube work and yeah I'll bring you
guys with me my little guy okay first
I'm headed to Dulce to get a latte
because they have oat milk here which I
really really like in my lattes so
go
well guys they were out of coke milk so
I got soy but now I'm headed over to
Greenlee to get some avocado toast and
then I'm gonna work on YouTube stuff
yeah so that was my summer morning
routine I hope you guys enjoyed it
like I said this doesn't happen every
single day of summer and it's a little
bit wonky because I just got back from
New York but this is kind of what goes
down and I kind of tweak my day as it
goes I hope you guys enjoyed this and as
always stay tuned for my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
