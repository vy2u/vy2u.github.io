Pasha this is my channel

it before I get to the video if you're
not following me on social media namely
Instagram you guys coalition a because
I'm desperate

basis totally follow me on there and I

have all styled you know you can always
follow me on there excuse Akasha as well
it would seriously mean the world to me
and I open my other social media outlets
like snapchat and Twitter down below in
the description okay and then one more
thing before I get into the haul video
everything that I show in this haul is
going to be linked down below and if it
is sold out I will try and link
something similar but I think I'm going
to be able to link everything so if you
want to buy anything totally just check
down there once I show the item you know
what I'm trying to say okay so the first
store I have things from is misguided
calm and I actually never shopped with
them before I've always liked browse
their website I know a bunch people who
shop down there who do shop on there and
I never did and now I'm totally going to
because I love everything that I got and
guys right now everything on the website
is 50% off not 15 50% off like half off
what the heck and their stuff is pretty
affordable to begin with so honestly
this is the best deal ever if you guys
want anything totally check it out right
now because literally watch 50% off okay
so the first thing I got is actually the
only item that doesn't fit me properly
I'm going to change this because I love
it okay I've gone to Coachella which I
have major FOMO that I didn't but if I
had water Coachella I'm pretty sure I
was worn this I mean I got this after
Coachella like whatever I think it's so
cute it's this blue crop top and then it
has these gold little like rivets or
whatever and then the
back is like this I'm a very petite
person I'm like a size extra small and
I'm really good zero on bottom so I got
this in a zero and I can't even fit fit
so I'm exchanging it for anything like a
four because it's so so small so if you
want to get that definitely size up a
few sizes because it's so small and I
have no boobs at all this is like so
small on me
okay next to misguided I actually got
two of the same tops and I actually wore
this one to class yesterday
so sixsix while you're wrinkly I
apologize this is just a blush pink crop
top and the sleeves are like pre cuffs
which I think you're cute this I got in
the petite line they do have a petite
line at misguided I think they have like
a tall section as well I'm 5 foot 1 so
you know pretty petite so this is very
cropped on me but I like this my wear
high waisted bottoms almost everyday so
I gotta in a pink color okay and then I
also got it in this burgundy color too
burgundy like my favorite color ever and
I just thought this like it goes of
everything okay the next thing I'm
excited is technically a swimsuit but I
bought it to be a bodysuit within my try
it on I was like oh wow this is really
cute assume suit so I'll Bollywood is
both you guys will see an excessive
blush pink lately it doesn't really look
good on me but I like the colors I keep
buying it but it's a ribbed one-piece
swimsuit I'm obsessed with one pieces
once again if you follow me on instagram
you know that so I post a lot of like
swimsuit Beach pictures so it looks like
this in the front and then it's ribs
like I said and the back is really low
and then it's pretty cheeky keeping kind
of like shove it up your butt if you
like Tiki bottoms because I do I don't
know I think it's really flattering it
goes super high cut on your leg which I
like as we will see later on in the haul
video I really like body con and mini
dresses right now with like a slit so I
saw that they had a red one and I'm also
gonna suffer bread I'm repulsive
everything okay guys anyways I thought
they had a red ribs maxi mini bodycon
dress with a slit so I want it it's
really pretty the straps are super thin
I just think it's gonna be like so
flattering I only know what I'm gonna
wear this I picture myself wearing a
date but like what am I going to be
asked on a date is probably never so
yeah if you want to take me on a date
I'll wear this for you
the next thing is from misguided is so
cute it's this black and white little
crop-top it has some fun indeed curling
in the front and then it has these
little like off-the-shoulder with sweet
things so cute this will be great you
know flip the b2 just like a summery day
because in LA it's going to be it's
going to be warm but it's going to be
quite see me in the summer so I think
this will be perfect
oh my gosh I totally almost forgot I got
some brought blood I'm wearing from
misguided so I got this in a size zero
my guy thought I have no boobs at all
but it barely fits like I'm on the the
last hook all the way around the edge so
definitely go up a size but it's so cute
I didn't have a white bra let and I
think this one is so beautiful so yeah
this is some misguided as well totally
recommend the next thing I would
definitely would a sprawl that wave it's
a slip dress I want with a slip dress
trend is still up saying I usually hop
on until now so here we go once again
it's this blush pink color I just like
this one because it has some white lace
sections as you can see I think it's so
beautiful you can dress this up or down
um I would see myself wearing it was as
well lat and maybe some like nude heels
out or something but yeah I'm really
pretty okay I got two more of the same
shirts in different colors and I'm
obsessed with the shirt the only thing
is the sleeves are oddly bomb okay and I
know I'm sure like I said I'm 5-1 but my
arms are really gangly like everyone
like my parents all used to make fun of
me for having really long arms so
normally sleeves like this on issue for
me these are like long but I think
ethicist I can make it work I just love
these and once again these are them so
cute for Coachella but you know so this
is my crochet crop top and then you can
see how long you pleased I like that's
not normal sleep like it should go like
here but anyways they're so cute you can
wear these in a beach cover-up lately
it's also been a time to kind of wear
like a sheer shirt with like a bra
underneath so you can do that as well so
anyways I got it in cream and then I
also got it in black which I really like
the black line I think I like a black
one more like even this was just like a
plain black bathing suit top under it
with like denim shorts I feel like would
be so cute alright so throughout high
school I used to hate camel print I
thought it was the ugliest thing to ever
exist except for those who wore it in
the army uh
I didn't understand it but for some
reason I'm kind of into it now I don't
know what sparked my interest I don't
know it was like a lap because L F is a
bunch of like cool styled camel pieces
and I want on the camel jacket
this one is the most beautiful perfect
camera jacket I've ever seen because
it's like distress so I got this in a
size UK 8 us four so I got this little
oversized I think the things that the
only side left but I'm so glad that it's
a perfect fit for me it looks like this
as you can see there's like some Souls
and stuff in it and it's just like you
know knit chemo jacket this next thing
you guys are already so confused about
okay I have a thing with buying like
Christmas socks like I love Christmas
sweaters and like Christmas apparel and
then you know I was only like a month
that you can wear them but like you sold
the best of it and I felt this hat I'm
misguided and I was obsessed of it and
it was on sale and then the additional
sale and I was like you know what I know
I'm going to wear this next Christmas so
I'll get it
this was not just Christmasy there's
something wintery I saw with so cute
they also having a Christmas tree hat
like it was a Christmas tree oh and
beanie and I almost got that one but
then I thought this one was cuter and I
got floppy red pom-pom I don't know I'm
so cute we think this is the last thing
from misguided
I love cozy sweatshirts lately I always
love cozy sweatshirts who doesn't so I
saw this one I love the colors in it I
was like yes what's happening so it's
the emerald green sweatshirt and it just
as West Coast and light pink on it
because as you know right now I live in
West Coast I'll totally live on the west
coast like probably to rest my life I
love it so much more than the coast no
time to East Coast people I grew up
there like I get it but it's so cozy
this is a small and it's like big so
they run oversized press everything from
misguided once again it will be linked
down below
okay the next door how things from is
shop wildest dreams I include the dental
haul video a while back and I absolutely
loved everything that I got there an
online store everything is so cute it's
really affordable really candy and I
have any order from them so I want to
show you before I get into the clothes
they give me dis Campos
the code Tashia 10 you guys can get 10%
off your total purchase this is great
okay so the first thing I got is not a
clothing item it's actually a phone case
because I wanted a phone case like this
for a while
it looks a lot like subsonic one it's
jobs here and that has with little
pineapples on it I like this one is the
six squishy okay so I got to grow less
from them the first one is this black
one really cute and simple and then the
back looks like this and have some cool
like cutout stuff the next one I love is
so much it's that watch pink color that
I'm going to test with and it just looks
like this so girly and so dainty I love
this next thing I got is just the gray
rib body con t-shirt dress saying I
really like thinking like this because
they're really flattering and you can
also like wearing a lot of ways like you
could dress this down to like class with
like a ripped up denim jacket and some
sneakers or you could literally wear
outfits like tight you know so yeah this
is a grey tight little dress I have yet
to try the choker incorporated into a
shirt trend until now it's this pink
little crop top and then it has like a
little choker thingy okay I love it I'm
just hoping it's not too long on me
because I'm really short it's a maxi
dress it's this olive green ribbed maxi
egg with all the way down and what I
really like is that have some slits in
the sides I think this is so flattering
and just so easy to throw on so you
really really cute with a scroll up
hopefully it's not too long comparing
the last thing from them I love so much
it's a distressed denim jacket but the
difference between this one and the ones
that I already have or I've seen is that
it's like kind of crop and it just cut
off at the bottom and it sprayed think
it's so cool like the color is all
frayed to this dress looking I love this
I think it's so sick yes but a shop wild
dreams I'm going to put the links to all
that as well as more information about
the coupon code in the description box
okay so now I have a boatload of things
from Shion
I love she and I get questions without
seeing whether it's like that she or let
you know because it's one of those
Chinese wholesale websites six super
affordable and it no she is not sketchy
at all I know they send the same things
to everyone my friends that are not
youtuber with order from Chien all the
time like things that I have and there
was same exact quality shipping isn't
that bad at all like honestly I love Kia
I would recommend it to anyone so I have
a bunch of stuff from them so the first
thing I actually wore this the other
night and I post an Instagram photo in
it and I also spilled some pesto sauce
on it so I hope you can see that but
this is only hard to show you'll see it
better on they see it as cool and crop
top it and won't expose over half a knot
I wrapped it and then I realize I don't
think it was to wrap it it has these
times I think you're kind of supposed to
time in the back but nevertheless I
think this is like less than $10 okay
the next thing from she and I already
have I'm so stupid I have this already
things Apple and now I have a cushy in
and I'm probably just gonna like sell it
on my Poshmark I'll link my Poshmark
down below by the way I always felt like
babies you can close your stuff on there
I'm obsessed with this I absolutely love
it I don't know I'm gonna ask why I have
to like whatever so this is what it
looks like it's the best one-piece
bathing suit ever
it's cheeky it's great qualities I
literally love it I showed it in a
bathing suit on haul I did if you want
to see that I'll link it down below
speaking of bathing suits I have another
one I actually just bought this for the
top and it will off the bottom because
there are high waisted and I always
thought I hated high-waisted bottoms but
I actually don't hate these I feel like
if I were to wear high waisted bottom so
they have to be like cheeky
or else I feel like it's a diaper this
is not cheeky it's slightly on the
diaper side but I don't hate them
anyways I wanted it for the top I think
the top is so so pretty honestly I don't
know if I'd wear this as an ending to
talk or just like a crop top with like a
black ripped denim skirt but
nevertheless I think it's so pretty if
this could be one kind of an off the
shoulder or on the shoulder okay I can
never have enough floral wrappers so I
saw this one it looks like this
and it's basically all open in the back
and you just kind of tie it off like a
halter sort of thing you will see it
better in the Tryon but it's really good
quality the materials are really nice
it's something you see it like you know
I'm more expensive boutique for sure
okay I got another slip dress this line
is different though it's more like a
mauve color really good quality and it
kind of looks like crop of them upfront
sort of I don't know I've only tried
this on one I'm going after like figure
it out more and the back is like all
across me and open and then it just goes
down it's really so soft in my gosh and
I want to complete this okay nicely she
and I got this letter through which I
love it kept spelling out on the website
when I finally found it when it was we
saw so it's this leather miniskirt and I
really liked it because it has this like
tie up detail on the side I've really
been into the like athletic sporty kind
of trend right now I thought I would try
this out I think I talked to me very
similar to this at like Topshop not
positive with New York Topshop but it's
like this mesh material pop there's some
loose threads but I can definitely
connect those and then I just have like
a white band here to like cover your
boobs and then it looks like this so
cool I haven't found the chance to wear
this but I think you look so cute I have
like white and black like Nike sneakers
and then with a black legging for even
like black ripped up skinny jeans
think this would be like really cool
going along with that sporty trend I got
this little two-piece and I think it's
really cool it comes with this grey crop
top and on the side has these like white
stripes and then it also comes with mini
skirt so a little longer than I want on
me because I like I'm really short but I
can easily roll the waistband under it
looks fine
and then have those same white stripes
beside I think this is so cute would
like some Adidas sneakers or something
oh my god guys are so much stuff okay I
got this bodycon dress and I thought it
was going to be more with thick material
it's actually more of like a really soft
Kishin material so I still like the
dresses just not really what I expected
anyway this is black dress and have some
like cool lace-up stuff going on here
and while
like throughout like your middle section
through middle section your mid section
what am I saying next thing is this like
maxi dress which is really cool it came
with a maxi dress and the slip I don't
even know if I need to slip underneath
it actually this year but it's this
olive green color and then it has this
like grey said grandma blue it's a
grayish blue embroidery down the entire
front and then what I like once again is
I had like this like opening at the
bottom sort of a little places like a
bag is thrown on you and then like I
said it comes with this little under
slip which you could actually wear as a
dress on its own I would say so yeah
okay guys even my two favorite items
maybe in the hall but definitely chien
so earlier what I showed you that red
mini dress i spended like I was obsessed
with mini dresses those like a split and
it's because of these cute coochie
Annie's are so affordable and they're
the most flattering dresses ever
basically they're these high neck ribbed
mini dresses and then they have the slit
at the bottom so I got it in gray and
then I also got it in black so these are
so so cute once again we'd like a denim
jacket you could dress them down or you
could go anything out to dinner okay
homeless stretch so I wanted this jacket
for awhile I've seen it on a few
different websites and it kept going out
but I finally found it on she in and I
loved it the only thing is it smells
really weird so I need to wash it
basically it is this then I'm a jacket
to be the world is all over the front I
think it's so cute the only thing is I
wanted it oversized so I got a large and
this is fairly oversized like if you
wear a size large and you want oversized
like it's not going to happen because
it's meant to be like a short extended
jacket so this fits like okay I mean I
still wanted more oversized but it's
fine I think it's still like super cute
and then the last thing from Chien is
this curve overall I like always wanted
overall but I never knew how to pull
them off and I knew I wanted something
like a rich and I had like a frayed ham
at the end so I found these ones I still
not worn them
so I think are really cool so I need to
wear them say it look like this and then
like I said the legs they're not like
super tired I said you know more than a
girlfriend fit it look like this and
then the leg hem is cut like this which
i think is like super cool right now and
I think it makes these look more like
trendy ok the last store is wrong way
Romney I know some people have like
different opinions on this one but I do
really like both the things that I got
to mom so I'm going to show you it's
actually wearing this one to a class I
really like it it's this light baby blue
t-shirt anyways light baby blue t-shirt
and it has this little like flower
embroidery right here on the on the boob
they have this same embroidery at Bernie
Melville I hope they have it in the
Kishin with this but I know they have on
a sweatshirt and I almost bought it you
know I didn't and I call this anyway if
it's really cute I like it a lot kind of
like a shirt my career I would wear but
I'm into it oh my gosh guys I forgot
something from Sheehan because the next
item from Huawei is the same thing from
Qi in a different color so this is mushi
in I have this mean black as well from
Cheyenne and I really liked it so I got
it in gray it's one of the cropped
hoodies it's dope this one's a lot
thicker than the black one the black one
would not be fine but this one is so
it's a grey cropped hoodie super trendy
right now and cute I really really like
this and then going off of that from
romwe Robin Chan basically had like the
same kind of stuff I feel like she in
has a lot bigger reflection but anyways
Rami they have the sweatshirt and I saw
it in this olive green color and this
one is so soft it's waste often the
black one or the gray one either made on
the outside this one is the softest for
sure but it's the same kind of thing
just a green like raw hemp crop hoodie
