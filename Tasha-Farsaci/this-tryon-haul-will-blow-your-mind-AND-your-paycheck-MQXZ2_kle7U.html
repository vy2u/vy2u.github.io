today I have a haul video for you I'm
super excited because I love hauls so
much and I know a lot of you guys love
my hauls so here I am before I say
anything else if you guys hear cheering
in the background of this video I
decided to film this video today which
is USC commencement so literally
graduation is going on pretty close to
my house
so I can kind of hear it so hopefully
you guys can't really hear it but if you
do I apologize for that and I hope it's
not too distracting if you guys want to
keep up with my life more feel free to
follow me on my Instagram I'm always
posting outfit photos and just photos
from my daily life there so like I said
if you guys want some more of me and
want to see me wearing these pieces
totally follow me on there and I will
have my other social media handles down
below in the description if you guys
want to stock my life and know more
about me okay so I've been doing a lot
of shopping lately I was actually going
to do one huge haul but I decided to end
up splitting it up into two holes
because I just had so much stuff so in
this video it's going to be stuff from
fabletics and Levi's this video is
sponsored by fabletics thank you so much
to them there's seriously one of my
favorite websites and brands ever I talk
about them a lot so yeah this video is
going to be that and then coming up in
the near future I will have another haul
video so stay tuned for that all right
so with that being said I'm going to get
right into the video here so much
cheering right now I really hope you
guys can't hear that okay so first I'm
going to show you guys the stuff I got
from from pub step from fabletics
fabletics is an active lifestyle brand
they have a ton of really really amazing
high-quality athleisure pieces you can
wear them if you're working out or just
lounging around like me because let's
face it I don't go to the gym that often
and one of the reasons why I love
fabletics is because they have so many
different sizes I believe they have
sizes extra extra small all the way up
to 3x which is amazing and they also
have customizable length so I'm a really
really short girl I'm five foot one
believe it or not so I always get like
they're 7/8 length but I can also get
like their short length or petite length
and you can also get long I believe so
that's super super helpful
okay so fabletics does this thing where
you can be a via
P I'm gonna explain it a little bit here
because I know some people sometimes get
confused about it so I'm actually a VIP
this is 100% real I sign up for it on my
own I really did on my own before it
ever worked that lettuce before I
shopped with them and I am a VIP member
is still to this day so basically the
whole point of being a fabletics VIP
member is you get way better deals you
get huge discounts on all the pieces
it's a lot more affordable than what you
would pay if you were not a VIP member
so basically you start off just by
taking it kind of personalized style
quiz and then every month based on that
style quiz fabletics will kind of create
a special little list for you to kind of
choose off for the month you don't have
to choose from that list but it kind of
is fun to see what they'll pick for you
but the important thing to know is that
you can always skip once so if you don't
want to buy anything that month you can
just skip the month and you won't be
charged or you can be charged and you
can use that credit any other time so
don't feel like being a VIP means you
have to buy something every single month
you totally don't I skip month all the
time because I have a lot of clothes and
I don't need stuff every month but yeah
keep that in mind you can totally skip
the month it's super easy but I do want
to make sure you guys know you can only
skip between the 1st and the 5th of the
month so if you wait past the fifth you
can't skip any more okay so the first
set I actually wore already so there's
no tags on it I apologize but this is so
pretty I think the color is amazing so
this is what the top looks like it's a
little sports bra and I love this kind
of dusty purple color and then I love
these leggings so so much they're these
super high rise leggings which if you
guys know me I only wear high rise
leggings so these are perfect for me and
I really like them because they have
this like little mesh section at the
bottom which i think is just a really
cute little detail okay and then all the
rest of this set that I got from
fabletics are all from Demi Lovato's
collection which is super cool since you
guys are a demi fan totally check these
out or if you're not still check them
out because they're really really cute
all right so I'm probably gonna start
off with my favorite this is my favorite
color so I guess I'm kind of biased but
it looks like this this is the little
top I like this because it's longer so
you can totally wear that it's just the
top like a crop top or your stuff
sometimes I feel kind of weird going out
wearing like a sports bra and leggings
but they
says like a longer sports for us so I
think it's really really cool and the
leggings are seamless which haha
seamless leggings are the best they're
really really cool they look like this
they have some cool texture on them
really really awesome and back has this
little detail which is super flattering
on a booty okay next up is some more
pink this one is a bit of a wild pink so
if you want to make a statement
I recommend this so first of all this is
the little bra top once again it's
longer than normal which I love as you
can see it's this really really vibrant
coral color and then the set comes with
this little gray tank which I love it's
like slightly cropped which is great I'm
always looking for tanks like this to
wear with my leggings because like I
said I don't always like wearing just
like a crop top with them and then the
leggings are seamless one check once
again I can't speak to that guys oh my
gosh once again they're seamless these
are so fun I'm actually obsessed with
them yeah this is the back it look like
this once again they have like this
really cool texture on them along the
bottoms and stuff so I'm really really
excited to wear these they look so comfy
okay next up is this really fun olive
green set this is what the top the
little bra looks like really cute mesh
detailing and then the matching bottoms
these are so thick guys the quality on
these is insane it was green army green
color and then something really fun is
the bottoms have this super cool like
textured mesh okay and then lastly this
one is super fun I haven't tried these
leggings on I hope they're flattering
they look super weird off you like can't
tell what they look like but basically
they kind of cross over your body we'll
see how they look in the Tryon but
they're just black leggings which I
really like I think this adds like some
flare to your normal black leggings but
they're that super thick material that
fabletics has that I absolutely love and
then I have another top in that same
green color to go with those it looks
like this really really fun and then the
whole back is open so that's everything
from fabletics
and if you click the link in the
description which I believe is tablet
XCOM slash Tasha you can get two pairs
leggings for $24 which is actually
incredible or you can get a full demi
lovato outfit starting at just $19 so
totally check out that link down below
check out fabletics I love them so much
okay and next I have a bunch of stuff
from Levi's Levi's is probably my
favorite denim ever I feel like it's so
classic and the quality's amazing I
personally love denim to be thick and
kind of stiff and just nice as opposed
to like a thinner jegging that's not
really my thing so I love Levi's so much
okay first I got two of my favorite
jackets that they have this is my
favorite kind of denim jacket that I
have I get a lot of questions on my
denim jacket that I'm always wearing
I'll put a picture of me wearing it here
but it is one of these jackets in a
different color so I wanted to get two
more in different colors because I'm
psychotic so the one I have is kind of
like a medium wash so I wanted to get a
light wash in a dark wash so I grabbed
this medium or light wash one it's kind
of like an acid wash which i think is
really really cool it looks like this
this is I believe the ex-boyfriend
trucker style so it's kind of like an
oversize but it's still a woman's jacket
so it's still like pretty flattering I
think I get these in a size small
instead of an extra small because I do
like my jackets to be a little bit
bigger and I like to layer a lot these
literally last forever I have my dad's
Levi's denim jacket from high school
when he was in high school I have it and
I still wear it which i think is so fun
and so cool but that's just proof that
how long they last because my dad is
like almost 60 so yeah that's insane
okay next I wanted to get a dark wash
one like I said so I grabbed this one
it's like a perfect dark wash I love
this
it's a classic once again okay and the
last 7 jacket I got from Levi's is
really really cool this one I think they
called it like the reconstructed one
this is just a white denim jacket but
it's been kind of like I said to
reconstruct it as you can see the collar
is gone and it's all frayed the arms
have this really cool zipper detailing
on them as well as like the sides in the
back and then it's a raw hem I think
this is just a really cool statement
piece but also something you can wear
all the time if that makes any sense but
yeah I'm really really excited I got my
hands on it this okay you guys probably
know that Levi's is known for their
jeans the classic jeans that everyone
wants like I feel like everyone wants a
perfect pair of Levi's they can be
really really hard to find at like a
vintage store or a trip store so I found
the perfect style of limas jeans that I
think look like they're kind of vintage
II but they're the perfect modern fit
that I want I'm actually obsessed the
style is called the wedgie skinny
anyways the first pair I got or in this
washed black color it's almost like a
grey but as you can see they have that
awesome back like the look of the back
but the vintage ones do but these are so
flattering on your butt guys oh my gosh
you need to try these out so this is
what the back looks like and then they
go down like this but yeah these are
amazing I already worn these and I've
gotten compliments and then also in that
same style I just got a pair of like
medium ish dark wash he was the back
once again these ones are a little
longer than I want and they're also a
bra hem so I'm probably just gonna cut
these a little bit shorter to what I
want but yeah I know I'm gonna wear
these all the time I'm so happy I
finally found the perfect pair of Levi's
and you don't need to go digging because
they sell them on their website so and
then I got one more pair of pants from
Levi's these ones are not that same
style these ones are the these ones are
the 501 skinny so the vintage kind that
you guys probably see all the time are
the 501s
so these ones are the 500 ones but a
little skinny here which is how I like
them so these are just a really really
soft pair of white denim I'm either
gonna cut the bottoms of these or COFF
them because they are a bit too long and
me I haven't really decided yet but you
know these are really really soft they
still have that like really classic back
look to them okay the last thing I got
from Levi's I'm slightly disappointed in
but I think it's my fault I didn't like
look at it online correctly it's just
this denim skirt which don't get me
wrong is super cute but I thought it was
gonna be like a raw cut hem so I think
I'm just gonna like cut the hem myself
but nevertheless it's really really cute
and I love denim skirts so much I don't
have a suit
wash one like this so I'm definitely
gonna be getting my wear out of this
yeah so this is everything in this haul

said I will be linking everything down
