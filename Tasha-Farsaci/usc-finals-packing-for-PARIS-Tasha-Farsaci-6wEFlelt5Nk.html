I am about to go take my earthquakes
final did most of my studying in the
last like 30 minutes so yeah I just I'm
like excited for it to be done because
I'm officially done with finals so yeah
let's get this over with totally just
split my toe open on my bike luckily I
have band-aids in my bag but it was
literally bleeding everywhere so that's
great well guys I just got back to my
final it was awful so hard but I'm so
happy I'm gonna file because I literally
destroyed my big toe so basically my
bike it's like a little bit tall for me
but it's it's like it can't be lowered
anymore but it's fun I'm riding it but
it's just a little bit tall when I try
to stop so sometimes I like stumble a
bit and I was wearing flip-flops and
that happened and my big toe like
literally the tip of it like came off
like that's a little dramatic but like
the skin like flapped over and then I
was like gushing blood everywhere
now I had to wait till I got to campus
and could park it and go to the bathroom
and like luckily I still had band-aids
in my bag because I always get blisters
on my feet from my shoes so I like
patched it up but it was like throbbing
throughout my final so that's super
gross luckily me wearing cold closed toe
shoes cuz it'll be cold but yeah I just
ate lunch at alfea they had quesadillas
and now for the rest of the day I think
I'm gonna get my nails done at some
point and then I'm just gonna pack for
parents okay guys it's a bit later I
finished editing blog much from
yesterday and now I'm just gonna open my
goal all make it for day 12 I was gonna
get ready today and do makeup but I just
don't feel like it I can't be bothered I
don't think I'm gonna go anywhere there
was like a really slim possibility of me
going out tonight but I don't think it's
gonna happen because I have a flight
tomorrow but anyway
go flog miss day 12 if you guys haven't
been keeping up with this though is an
awesome awesome shopping app they have
so many stores on there I will be
linking them down below you guys should

something that you can buy on their app

shipping all right so it looks like it's
gonna be a sweater up son like this
color oh this is a dress it's just this
like knit bodycon dress yeah this is
really really cute I think these are
obviously super flattering and I love
wearing things like this with like denim
jackets or just jackets in general over
them and this is just a really pretty
like fall in winter color yay awesome
thanks doe you guys Rock so I'm just not
to go get my nails done this is my
current nail situation everyone has been
asking if my nails are fake and they're
actually these are my real nails um of
course they're not focusing except okay
this one basically what happened is my
nails were growing out really long and I
never really used to grow my nails out
just cuz like wanted to always break but
for some reason lately they've been
growing super long and then one pinky
nail broke when I was getting my luggage
from like the luggage belt like a
baggage claim but it only broke a little
like it wasn't it didn't like come off
or anything so I like temporarily glued
it with super glue which was super
ratchet and then when I went in they
basically like put acrylic powder over
it
just to like strengthen it so this is
like my full nail length it was just
like a collect patter over it that's why
it looks slightly deformed but yeah
these are my real nails and people
always ask me what nail color
I get but my nails are always gel
manicures just because my nails chips so
fast if I just do regular polish like I
used to pay my own nails because I'm
pretty good at like painting nails but
they would just chip so fast and I never
really wanted to buy the gel kits myself
so I just always get gel manicures now
so when you guys asked what color I have
like people always ask about this color
but I don't know what it is it's just
like you know what nail salons they have
like the inka swatches without the names
so I just pick pick colors that I like
so I don't know I normally get like
colors like this I don't know either
I either get like nudes kind of like
this or really really dark like
Burgundy's or Purple's which I think I'm
gonna get like a dark burgundy today
because I did like a little Instagram
poll and I was gonna get like either
light nude or dark and you guys voted
dark so yeah I'm gonna get my nails done
um just because okay so I go to paint
and polish it's by USC and it's honestly
with my favorite place I've ever gone
like I've gone so many places especially
at home in Syracuse I go and they're
like janky like my nails look like trash
and paint polish or polish and paint I
always I get it confused but it's so
affordable like I think it's like 25
dollars for a gel manicure which is
really really good compared to like most
places I've gone to even places in
Syracuse and they do a great job every
time like these are almost three weeks
old they still look pretty pretty decent
they're just kind of certainly catching
my hair and I'm like going home and
going to Paris and I don't want to get
my nails done and either those places so
that's why I'm going today but yeah
they're awesome and if you guys go to
USC I definitely recommend it because
it's the best so yeah I'm gonna do that
I'll obviously show you the update I
really don't know what they're gonna do
about this puppy the one that has like
the fake acrylic powder on it but yeah
we will see okay my outfit is not cute
at all today this is literally my board
to my quick final but you guys always
ask so I'm just wearing this black alpha
B shirt with the black bra that I got in
my do't gift yesterday and then I'm just
wearing these teal leggings from
fabletics and then
chequered vans so yeah not not the best
not the best guys but yeah well hi guys
oh my gosh I look like slightly naked
okay I just got back to the nail salon
and okay so you look at this hand and
they look so flaky
Canales be flaky anyways they look Bom
then so I told you I had like a Crillon
powder on my one nail well she took that
part off cuz it was like kind of coming
off anyway so now I have one knob I
don't think it's that bad cuz it's like
a pinky finger if it were like a middle
finger like one of these and probably
worse but it's just so knobby it's so
sad but I'm thinking that the next time
I go to get my nails done in like three
weeks
um this one will be growing out of it
and I'll probably just have them cut
them all to be this length but yeah
that's so sad so if I'm going to show
people my nails I'm gonna use this hand
but I just got a package in the mail
from brandy melville I ordered one thing
so I guess I'll do a little live
unboxing and then also I just went to
Dulce everyone was pronouncing or
telling me I was pronouncing it wrong I
was saying Dulce which is apparently
like the Italian pronunciation but it's
Dulce so what - Dulce when I got an iced
vanilla latte it's really really good I
liked it a lot more than the other the
but Vietnamese iced coffee that I tried
there so yeah okay so if you guys watch
Gretchen Gretchen Garrity on you to like
on my best friends you guys probably
know that she always copies what I buy
and just like everyone in general that's
like her thing and she like jokes about
it all the time so this is funny because
I copied something and then I saw her
we're in and out for the week sorry I
ate a piece of my hair sticking up
anyways I saw her where and I was like
oh damn girl that is cute so I pulled a
Gretchen and I copied Gretchen so this
is from brandy I got it on don't though
shout out don't you guys are the homies
let me open her up and if my mom is
watching this she's maybe like Tosha
maybe you don't need it I love your
denim jacket because I'm kind of a denim
jacket I like to throw them on over
everything but I don't have one like
this so basically let me pull her out
this is a like washed black denim jacket
but it's like cropped it's cut off and
the only other black denim jacket I have
is really long and oversized and it's
more of a dark black rather than like
this wash color so I justified it and I
just thought about this with layering
like over sweaters and flannels and I
just thought it'd be so so cute so yeah
I got that and thanks Gretchen for
inspiring me so in case you guys wanted
to see it on here it is just with the
outfit that I was wearing
honestly I'd probably wear it with this
I think it's good you can put it over
like a chill outfit or even like a cute
outfit and yeah I'm really really happy
with it I will link it down below in
case you guys want to buy it
hey guys so this is so funny I just had
to share I just went to alpha theme
because I needed to pick up these
paddles I guess the thing to like paint
on these and make them cute and then
give them to your big but since I have
two bigs I have two paddles and I was
carrying this back from the RO and some
guy was like are those violins like dude
I know they look like the shape of
violin but like I just thought it's
funny and people keep commenting asking
me why I have two bigs and I answer this
in a vlog and like one of the first
vlogmas videos sorry I have like my
luggage right here and I'm trying to
step over it um I answered it in one of
my first vlogs but like obviously I know
you guys probably don't watch every
single one or that person or the people
who keep asking don't watch all of them
but basically I have two bigs because
sorry I'm like really struggling one of
my bags is a senior and was graduating
and she would have feel bad if I only
had a big for like one year you know and
then
and on my other bag as a sophomore and
broken and I are friends they both
wanted me as their little so instead of
like fighting over me they were like why
don't we share her so they did and
that's why I have two bigs and it's the
best because I love both of them yeah
it's the best of both worlds so two bigs
two paddles
that's the deal I'm gonna start packing
now I kind of started so once I packed a
lot of the stuff I'm going to show you
what I packed it's just so difficult
packing because I'm packing for Paris
and for home in mind and I want to look
really cute in Paris when I'm home I
don't really dress cute like unless I'm
going out somewhere and like wanna take
pics it's more like comfy cute or as
Paris I want it to be like cute cute hey
guys hey so I've just been sitting here
kind of just browsing the interweb
requests I can't talk procrastinating
packing I'm kind of frustrated slightly
because I really want to post my blog
minutes from yesterday but I did make a
collaboration with a brand in it so they
need to prove it before I can post and I
really like posting like early in the
day and I feel like I've been doing
pretty well with that I normally either
edit like right before I go to bed and
then post as soon as I wake up or I edit
when I wake up and then post so they've
all been going up pretty quick but the
brand had me changed something in this
video so I submitted the change and I've
been waiting for their approval for like
hours so I feel like it's not gonna get
approved until tomorrow so I'm gonna be
late on one so I'm sorry about that I
don't know if you guys really care but I
care I feel bad because I feel like I've
been so good at like uploading them and
stuff but yeah whatever I mean if they
just don't approve it until tomorrow
I'll be posting to tomorrow but I feel
like ever since vlogmas began I've been
saying how I want five guys and I was
just gonna eat dinner at alfea tonight
but I wasn't like loving the dinner
selection and I was like okay it's my
last night in LA like I'll go get dinner
so then I
like all my friends and everyone's
either home already or busy so tonight's
the night that I'm just gonna post me
five guys so I thought I'd tell you what
I get
honestly this is also kind of funny
because I didn't like burgers oh my god
my hair
I don't like burgers again until
recently so basically I you see burgers
all the time growing up and then one
night I ate a burger and I didn't get
sick from the burger I know I had like
stomach flu but the next day I had like
the stomach flu and at the time growing
up even like still kind of now but not
so much now I might literally had a
phobia of throwing up and so even though
I knew I wasn't like throwing up because
of the burger I always I connected it
and then like told myself I didn't like
burgers after that so it wasn't until I
came to LA and then like started eating
in a No and then I went to five guys and
I like five guys even more than in and
out plus we have one like we're back
campus so now I like burgers again but I
don't I don't like them to be really
rare I like them to be like well-done
know when they're like too juicy or when
they're paying Gately freaks me out so
five guys is perfect for that
but I thought I'd tell you what I get in
case you guys are dying to know so I get
the little cheeseburger because I don't
need the full one with let me see
ketchup lettuce and mayo mustard onion
and pickles and then I always get the
little Cajun fries and their species are
so good but I always get the little ones
and they give me like a pound of fries
so protip never get the normal sized
ones get the little ones because they're
so cheap and they give you like a
mountain so I'm gonna order that now and
then I'll show you it when it comes oh
my god my little pinky nail guys this is
so funny my five guys just came and I
asked them to put some ketchup in the
bag and they gave me like three of these
big like tub so I guess they're not big
but they're big for what I thought I
thought they just put like like ketchup
packets in but so excited also this is
what I mean about them giving a lot of
fries like granted the burgers under
those but I think that's a lot
for it being little for those of you
that asked me to do what I in a day here
you go guys
okay guys I'm facetiming melon she just
told me the funniest story ever you're
talking about guys being a weird and
booty calling girls okay so my friend um
this guy do you think likes her and he
invited her over for it's like dinner
and so she gets over there and he's like
making hamburgers which he pulls out of
his freezer and he starts cooking them
and they're legit hockey puck they're
hockey pucks she cannot eat them and
like they feed them to the dog and she's
like do you have like any hamburger
rolls and he's like no I don't have any
hamburger rolls and she's like okay well
how about like ketchup or mustard music
no but I'm gonna frosting and legit puts
frosting on the burger I realize I never
ended off the vlog um I was just like
finishing I'm packing tonight but I
think I'm going to show you like what I
packed in tomorrow's vlog um I got my
eyebrow what the heck um but yeah I'm
not go back to bed now thank you guys
