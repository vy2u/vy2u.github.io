honestly am NOT positive basically it is
my first full day home or like I guess I
got home kind of early yesterday but
I'll accept the whole day so it's super
gross out right now hopefully you can
see how nasty it is I look like really
really bad I didn't feel like putting
makeup on yeah I'll probably doing that
later
or doing my hair I want to do braids but
I don't have any little hair ties here
so I need to get those basically ever
since I've been in Paris I've been
craving like a fast-food breakfast
sandwich and like you can't get that
there so I'm going in McDonald's with my
dad and getting that and then we're
gonna go to the grocery store quick and
yeah that's what's occurring but I'm
wearing my new hat that I got in Paris
and then I'm wearing this like jumpsuit
thing it's really cute it's from shoot
what's it called
weekend Vice yeah they like sent me this
sweat suit jumpsuit and the pants have
stars too so I'm wearing that I kind of
look homeless but you know that's what
you do when you're home and you don't
care what anyone here thinks of you yeah
we're gonna do that
and today's hoping to be pretty bland
because it's so gross out literally okay
I know I'm home when the sky is the same
color as the ground like how sad is that
I can't but also it's nice cuz like I
like being lazy and like not doing
anything and I don't feel guilty about
it when it's like gross out so excited
to eat my breakfast sandwich today
camera okay guys so I basically just
like put me some makeup on it's not
because I'm going anywhere but I
honestly just couldn't look at myself
anymore
I what's the new thing I started
comparing myself to shoot I thought of
something really good it wasn't a
cabbage that's my normal thing damn I
don't know I just like I just couldn't
look at myself I anymore I wasn't
looking great so I put some makeup on
put my hair into these little Amanda
Stanton braids things that she inspired
me to do and I thought I would open
my love miss day 23 I'm also sitting on
my McDonald's medium caramel ice coffee
I forgot to talk about this in so many
vlogs but this is my favorite ever it's
like honestly probably so much sugar
that I can't even classified as being
coffee anymore but like it's so good so
anyways don't blow miss day 23 that's
always the link to download option down
so well that's my $5.00 off and free
shipping to come over so also how fun is
this hat I'm actually obsessed with hot
pink this is fun okay so what's this
like purpley bodysuit thing huh that's
actually funny I just like ordered two
body suits from forever 21 that are like
kind of similar to is not really I guess
will only grab them and show you but
this could be fun for like going out
awesome thanks doh
yeah so I didn't show you guys these in
my unboxing from yesterday but basically
my big Anna for this one bodysuit when
we went out together and I was like oh
my gosh where'd you get that and she was
like literally at forever 21 and
basically they're like you know those
body suits that I like lazy lingerie
looking but people wear them out with
like jeans and like a jacket and they're
super cute so I saw who are in this one
it just like this burgundy lace bodysuit
but like the problem with most of them
is they're normally like sheer with a
boob is so I'm like how to have to you
wear those but this one is literally
like a pad where the boob is so you can
wear these out so she was wearing this
burgundy one and the back is just mesh
and I thought it was so cute so when I
went online to get it they also had
black and I was like okay that's like a
classic so I'm thinking like if I work
this with like some boyfriend jeans or
like a denim skirt so cute and then this
one with like black jeans so yeah these
really 20 bucks each which I don't think
it's bad and yeah I'll link them down
below if they still have them but shadow
Anna because these are so cute and
that's kind of this reminds me of a
little bit yeah so it just started
snowing like kind of a lot
I was outside earlier and it was like
freezing rain like helping let me see if
I can show you I feel like you can't see
how watch it's snowing but it's actually
like a lot yeah so I have like no desire
to go outside really no desire to do
anything I just posted my vlogmas from
yesterday and I'm staying inside all day
this is like what happens when I come
home I never really do much good it's
like so gross out but it's kind of nice
because being in LA it's always nice out
so I feel kind of guilty not doing
anything so here I just have my time to
like chill and relax especially now that
all my classes are done and everything's
done by the way guys I got a 3.6 GPA
which I was so happy with it and I also
passed Earthquakes whoo-hoo you guys
have been keeping up with vlogmas I was
taking that class pass no pass and the
way to final went I really did not know
if I was gonna pass but I passed
so yeah I'm done with classes right now
so I really have nothing to do so I've
just been like chilling but I was
sitting here and I'm actually like
pretty bored I just don't feel like
leaving because yeah it's snowing pretty
hard and I'm lazy so I was thinking that
I really want to start watching a TV
show and then I want to watch catfish
but I realized I've seen all of them so
then I remembered this show that I
discovered on an airplane once that I
think is so funny
it's called 90-day fiance on TLC and
it's basically like people will get
engaged to someone that does not live in
the United States and in order for I
think like the person outside of the US
can come to the US and live with them
for 90 days
before they have to get married so they
have 90 days until they have to get
married and then if they don't get
married they're sent back to their
native country and if they do then they
get to like stay in America so for the
majority of the cases it's pretty clear
that the people are only doing it to get
in American new visa which like is
pretty sad but it's like really funny
and sometimes the couples like actually
like are in love but like the majority
of the times it's like really fake but
like one party does not know that you
know what I mean so I just went on TLC's
website and I saw that they have a new
season posted so I know what I'm doing
and yeah I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked
right now comment down below if you guys
have seen this I honestly never even
knew this for the show until it was on
on one of the airplanes I was on once
and I like watched it the whole flight
so yeah let me know what you guys if you
guys have seen it hey guys so the reason
I look like this is because I fell
asleep again I got really really tired
at like 5:00 p.m. or like 6:00 p.m. and
I was just like okay I'll like take a
nap for it like an hour and I couldn't
get up and now it's 11:30 7 and I'm
still really tired I guess I'm just like
really not adjusted to the time change
yet but I think I manage fine except for
a bit and maybe eat some snacks I like
literally didn't eat dinner or anything
so I was just like fell asleep oh I feel
kind of bad I feel like slightly guilty
except like waste the day but then again
I was just watching 90-day fiance so I
got this doughnut earlier at Wegmans and
it's literally at 640 calories so rest
in peace me but I'm gonna eat it
do you guys like my shoes well literally
Vogue right hi guys so it's actually the
next day now surprise surprise I fell
asleep before I named the blog again
yesterday but thank you guys so much for
watching hopefully this one wasn't too
short but yeah love you guys and stay
tuned for the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
