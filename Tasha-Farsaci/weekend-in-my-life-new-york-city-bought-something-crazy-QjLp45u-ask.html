I am doing a three day of vlog because I
just got to New York City with Mel say
hi yeah so we just came here for like
three days we got an air B&amp;amp;B we just
arrived at the air B&amp;amp;B and I'll show you
it but yeah I'm really excited because I
never come to New York City a lot during
the warmer months I normally come when I
come home for Christmas break so this
should be a nice chain oh my god sorry
I'm like pretty sick I've been taking
dayquil like all day I'm not feeling my
best but I'm trying to push through it
but yeah I'll show you our Airbnb so
it's this super cute little studio we're
showing this bed and then here's the
little living space the kitchens over
there the bathroom like this
and then there's like the little fire
escape balcony oh wait I really like the
cactus but there's like this little fire
escape balcony and I'm pretty sure I
have a code for $20 off your first
Airbnb stay this is not sponsored
I think everyone gets that but if you
guys use it I think I get $20 off too so
that would be cool
but I'll putting your on the screen as
well as in the description cuz I don't
know it off the top of my head but yeah
we're just finishing up getting ready
and then I think we're gonna go eat and
like shop I'm starving I haven't eaten
all day
so oh okay guys so I actually just
checked and you guys if you use my
Airbnb code get $40 so yeah I'm putting
it on the screen once again use it oh
yeah actually use it
yeah I'm so excited
came from there so I got a lemonade I'm
still like really not feeling well so
I'm gonna try and find the drugstores so
that I can get dayquil
but we're walking to somehow now so you
can do some shopping and yeah I wanted
to blog
in the thick of it though
hey guys so I'm feeling a lot better now
I took medicine and also don't mind this
the pimple next to my mouth I just
popped it in case you're wondering but
yeah we're still shopping and so how I
got some stuff from necessary clothing
but I forgot to show you so I'll show
you later
there we go and yeah okay we're going
into a with you now about to dig in now
take them off well guys two grandmas
fully in at like 10:00 p.m. I've got
some Mario Badescu drying lotion because
I had that weird
herpy looking zit on my face no not
herpes and no and melons got a nice
charcoal mask and our Airbnb host has so
many books here I used to love reading
so much and then I got into college and
I had to read like the most boring
articles of my life so I stopped reading
because I was reading those but I just
started reading this and I actually
think it's really interesting so far I
know there was like some scandal with
him but I'm trying to ignore it yeah
I'll update you guys tomorrow
it's supposed to rain tomorrow a lot so
that should be interesting good morning
guys we are currently on the fire escape
to take Instagram photos and I'm holding
my phone literally over this ledge right
now kind of freaking out but this is
what we do for the ground and it's it
was just a rating it's about two for
today so we're doing this while we can
but yeah let's do it okay so we just
finished taking some pics I'll insert
mine here but I got dressed I literally
didn't bring an outfit for today I meant
to buy something yesterday but I didn't
because it's supposed to downpour today
so I didn't really want to wear anything
super cute but I ended up just like
torrents been together with stuff that I
brought
it's definitely so serene like an hour
so that should be interesting
I don't really know we're gonna do today
we're gonna go get some breakfast slash
brunch and then try to do some thrifting
so that should be fun anything to say
what doesn't rain too harsh I know we'll
see I found a lot today with oat milk
we're here at the gray dog I'm honestly
not that hungry but
going in hey guys lighting is absolutely
probably the worst thing I've ever seen
because we're inside actually pouring
rain outside but we came to Chacho macho
camacho place and it's totally cute I
want to show you they had really cute
black eyes but I forgot to water this
super cute
and then my favorite part is right here
yeah let's go stay here for a little
while hopefully the rain guys down a bit
okay hello guys we're currently back at
the air B&amp;amp;B because I made some
purchases and it was raining really hard
and we wanted to just chill for a bit so
I decided I'm going to show you what I
got I wasn't sure if I wanted to because
it was a splurge purchase and I don't
want to come off like bragging or people
will be like I can't believe you spent
that much on it it's not only do
splurges a lot so yeah I guess I'll show
you guys I got these boots from Louis
Vuitton and I think they're the desert
boots yeah I think that's what they are
but they look like this I'm obsessed
with them I've seen them so many times
and I finally tried them on and there
was one left in my size so I got these
I'm really excited and I can't wait to
style them so yeah I got these and then
I went to Brandi I haven't got anything
from there in so long but I got this Los
Angeles hat I know I'm getting like all
LA stuff when I'm in New York but I got
this hat I really like the graphic and I
got this hoodie that I love it's white
and then it says Los Angeles and like
these little colored letters but I
actually don't have a lot of hoodies so
excited toward that I honestly my robot
now because it's pretty cold and rainy
out
yeah we're gonna go probably fit dinner
soon and maybe some like Buffalo
Exchange even digi stores how are you
good yeah we're going to I'm not sure
how to pronounce it so comment down
below I know how um I think it's called
khaki Oh EPP I think it means cheese and
pepper in Italian yeah I hope you know
that he's trolling okay guys I put the
sweatshirt on because we're headed back
out and I actually really really like it
I mean I slightly look like an egg right
now but I really like it
Mel just literally popped a blister it's
like the size of my thumb
see how we're gonna go hit up a buffalo
exchange hopefully find some stuff and
then the restaurant we're going to is
right next door and it's one of those
places where they like mix the pasta in
the cheese wheel and I've always wanted
to go to one of those so I'm so excited
so yes stay tuned my friends okay so I
wanted to show you guys this is vintage
shop that Mel found called El train
vintage they had tons of - some vintage
items like jackets and shorts and
t-shirts and it was all really really
affordable which is kind of hard to find
so I just wanted to show you guys a
little bit of that it was really cool
and I got a scarf there
the last day in New York I'm sad but I'm
gonna blog my camera battery's kind of
close to dead so this might end up being
on my iPhone but we just kind of cleaned
up the Airbnb and packed I'm wearing my
boots today I'm very excited I'm hoping
I don't step in anything I'm actually
kind of scared cuz New York streets are
really dirty but yeah I'm also excited
because we're meeting up with my
roommate from last year Stephanie today
at like a rooftop bar so that should be
fun yeah I'm really excited and let's do
