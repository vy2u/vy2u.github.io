are testing out the craziest high-end
sparkly makeup that I have ever seen and
this really kind of made me go what we
have to chat about today is a glitter
topcoat for your lashes this is what it
looks like in the past I have seen top
coats for mascara I've seen golden top
coats I've seen silver top coats and
they always have a mascara wand now when
I saw pictures that you guys were
tweeting to me online I kind of was like
what is that lip gloss or is that really
intended for your lashes because it has
a doe foot applicator you guys what on
earth I mean you could put this on your
lips maybe we'll try that too I'm gonna
do check-ins and I am wearing this now
I'm just gonna be glitzed and glammed
and we're doing this we're gonna see how
it wears but I really feel like this
product you could put anywhere and it
would be fabulous I mean it's kind of
cool that it's intended for your lashes
so it's called the crystal lash topcoat
it says turn your lash turn on those
lash lights mm-hmm they're trying to be
cute I don't know how I feel about that
liquid pearls Surround lashes with
multifaceted lighting effect it adds
extra sparkle to your eyes sweep on over
mascara after it dries use over lashes
or only for special spotlighting kind of
like you can use it a little or you can
use it a lot just use it how you want to
I can't even remember what video it is
that I shared a very embarrassing story
that I'm gonna share again
I've always loved makeup it's been a
long journey I've always been fascinated
with makeup and one of the things that I
have loved the most
as far as makeup goes is glitter now
back when I was 12 13 years old
accessing glitter cosmetically was not
really the easiest thing and I used to
do my sister's makeup like I thought I
was a pro makeup artist by age 10 and I
would always do their makeup I have
three sisters and I had this vision like
I would sketch out like my different
looks and my
and I really wanted to see what like a
glitter eyelash would look like I was
like fascinated with this and borderline
obsessed
so disclaimer right here if you were a
child watching this if you are anyone
watching this what I'm about to share
with you is a bad idea don't do it you
could go blind I had the brilliant idea
to put glitter nail polish on my
eyelashes I got in big trouble with my
mom it was shortly after that happened
like my mom didn't notice and we went to
the make up forever counter and I got a
makeover and I was allowed to pick out
like one or two products it was a big
huge deal I want to say it was for like
a birthday or something cuz we didn't
have a lot of money so it was just a
huge deal that I was getting a makeover
by a professional and I remember she was
trying to take my eye makeup off and
she's like what on earth do you have on
your eyes like is that glitter and she's
like trying to like get it off and she's
like did you put glitter gel on your
eyes like what what is this it's not
coming off and I'm like oh no it's just
makeup should come off and then I was
starting to feel like really squirmy and
like uncomfortable you know how you can
go to the doctor and be like so I'm
asking this for my friend that's kind of
what I ended up doing I was like my
friend put nail polish on her eyelashes
once isn't that weird
and she kind of just looked at me like
okay psycho child anyway long story
short I didn't go blind I told my mom I
got in big trouble
eventually my eyelashes grew back in and
I didn't have glitter eyelashes anymore
but it was kind of a permanent state for
my lashes for awhile and that's why when
I saw this I was just like oh my god
if I was a child I would be begging I
would be saving a babysitting money I
would be doing anything to get this and
we're gonna try it out together so we're
gonna see if this works or if it doesn't
what the big hoo-ha wow is with it this
is a 25 dollar item that's not crazy
crazy expensive but it is a lot more
than the drugstore and for what it is
just glitter in a tube I'm calling it
WTF okay so I'm gonna scoot you guys and
let's get to applying this glitter to my
lashes all right you guys we're going in
the glitter on this is intense I'm going
to start with the outer lashes
now mind you I already have my mascara
on obviously and it's dried down so do
anything
feel like I'd like more glitter but what
we're dealing with is this is Estee
Lauder this is not tacky this is
sophisticated we don't want to look like
a ho I'm kind of into this you guys this
is the kind of glitter that you could
wear to church you could wear to meet
your boyfriend's mama for the first time
it's not too in-your-face but it is
there all right let's do the other eye
you kind of got to go with the tip love
the tip who the hell am i right now I
need to stop I like this so much more
than I thought I would I did not think
that this would work you guys but this
leaves like the slightest most angelic
twinkly kind of a glitter on your lashes
and it dries down the magic isn't the
dry down like on my hand here it's just
not moving at all which makes it safe to
put on your lashes the glitter is not
gonna fall into your eyes I feel like
this is really really cool and this is
exactly what I was looking for back when
I was like 11 years old so Wow
glitter lash topcoat totally random
totally not sponsored I am going to make
sure that I capture all of this glitter
eNOS in the actual daylight just to make
sure that you guys can see how cool this
looks because it just catches light it
doesn't take away from the mascara where
my eyes aren't framed from mascara it
just adds this little bit of shine that
looks really cool I think it's very
pretty
and right now I'm like yes this is like
a fun holiday kind of a thing so there
we have it I will see you guys in the
sunshine in a little bit you can't
really see it so much out here but it is
really beautiful in the daylight I think
this does look better actually inside
with light on the lashes it really picks
up all the little glittery bits but it's
not showing up on camera as much as I
wish it would because you guys this is
really really pretty I haven't had any
of the bits fall down on my face and
it's been several hours now so yeah
that's where we're at I think it's
really cool I hope you guys can see at
least like a little bit of that
I like it so we're gonna do another
outfit of the day this is something I
have not worn and forever I was
organizing my closet and it was one of
those kind of hidden in the back
surprises that I love I actually bought
this downtown LA I got it for like 15
bucks it's just like a cute little I
don't know vest long vest it kind of
feels like I'm wearing a dress over my
pants but I like it a sleeveless of
course because it's like 98 degrees here
in California today it's been super
crazy hot so I just have a white tank
underneath and then I'm wearing my jeans
from Laura's boutique again I love these
they're super comfortable and my Stuart
Weitzman shoes that I always wear so
that is about that I keep trying to find
an angle where you guys can really like
get the full effect of this I don't
think I have found that yet but I'm kind
of like if I like wave my head up and
down you kind of get a little bit of the
magic maybe it kind of I'm gonna keep
working on it I'm gonna find light where
you guys can see everything that is just
like it's kind of like Christmas lights
okay all right so James has run in to
pick up a takeout order and I'm chillin
with this one who is freaking out over
every little thing like barking at
children barking at anyone walking by
actually I think he's still just not
back to his normal self maybe I don't
know he's always kind of grumpy so who
knows with KUKA can you guys kind of see
like right there Oh glittery that is I
just really think this product is very
fun and I really like it Pook is in a
mood let's all ignore that mommy's okay
so I am being so weird
I have dreamt about you I all day long
wanted pasta and to just chill out I'm
gonna eat pasta in bed and watch
housewives I watch up here by myself
90-day fiance Real Housewives New Jersey
and OC this is all really old I kind of
never gotten to Riverdale love friends
it was kind of into this for a minute
yeah I think I stumbled upon an area
where maybe you can see some of the
glitter either way you guys know by now
I am really impressed with this product
25 bucks up there but not terrible for
Estee Lauder I think it is something
different and maybe wait for a gift with
purchase time maybe that helps but for
holiday I think it's really fun and if
you don't want to do like the whole big
glitter thing but you want just like a
touch of something very festive then
this is something really cool and I'm
gonna wear it again and again and again
because it just made me feel pretty and
I liked it and I liked little sparkly so
that is that I'm gonna watch my
housewives eat my pasta and call it a
day I love you guys so much thank you
for hanging out with me and I will see
you all in tomorrow's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
