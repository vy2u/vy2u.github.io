gonna be going through the entire
Maybelline and Gigi Hadid collection I
have the jet setter palette right here I
haven't touched it's washed it none of
that business with any of this actually
I have the East Coast collection the
West Coast collection I am missing the
lip liners but I have everything else so
I'm gonna do a try on first impressions
and then swatch the rest of it for you
we're gonna dive straight into this I
have a lot of good things to say about
it and some things that kind of made me
go hmm
Maybelline why did you do that so we're
gonna chat about it all this was sent to
me and I actually had an opportunity to
review this two weeks prior to the
launch but just being real with you guys
they wanted me to sign a nondisclosure
that I was not comfortable with that had
some terms and conditions that
potentially could be harmful to my
channel if I stepped out a line and the
only reason I'm sharing that with you
guys is if you are a smaller Channel and
you don't have a lawyer I'm grateful
that I do have a lawyer kind of looking
after me and making sure that I don't
sign things that could potentially be
you know trouble for me make sure you
are reading everything I guess I want to
put that out there it's easy to get
wrapped into be like wow that
opportunity it sounds so cool but you
know just make sure that you are in
agreement with everything I tend to be a
very outspoken channel and I like to
keep it that way so I just decided to be
patient and wait for you know the PR to
go out to everybody and knew that I'd be
sitting down doing the first impressions
the moment that it landed in my lap so
here we are yeah that's all I have to
say about that it's packaged really
really beautifully I want to start there
like is this just the theme of the year
this is very trendy packaging it has
holo on the label which is pretty cool
kind of Gigi Hadid isn't a little bit of
a holo thing and even the sleeve on the
jetsetter palette is hollow I like that
the first thing we're gonna test out is
the tinted primer this comes in two
shades you have a light medium and a
medium deep well light medium actually
looks kind of dark and then that's
medium deep so I think that's pretty
good as far as the color selection I'm
gonna take the light medium obviously
very pale these days okay so we're gonna
go in with the primer I am using a flat
foundation brush just to kind of paint
this on holy sue monks oh my god wait
what that's that is the medium one right
are you for real I'm so what confused
right now
is this a liquid bronzer or a primer for
a foundation what the hell is this now
I've read the ingredients on this primer
and it's not really like a thick silicon
based primer it is more something to
hydrate the skin that you could wear on
its own or you know to prep your skin
for foundation but this is just feeling
really strange to me I don't know if I'm
into this you guys feel like I'm rubbing
pudding all over my face I did read the
directions to I went on Ulta calm and it
just says that this is a primer where
alone where underneath foundation
something about it helping your contour
I don't really know how it helps your
contour because this is just kind of
strange I mean maybe it kind of wait no
that looks horrible oh my god it looks
like I just rubbed dirt all over my face
look how much lighter my neck is okay so
I'm just gonna kind of rub this out a
little bit Gigi shares her secret weapon
for her perfected freshly contoured face
use a tinted primer that's at least two
shades darker than your foundation apply
this lightweight tinted base to contour
before applying foundation I can kind of
see like if you use this just to contour
like just underneath you guys know I
have told you about Scott Barnes
technique how he will actually take a
darker cream underneath foundation and
that's how he does his work on JLo and
it's beautiful it's a very beautiful
technique to contour the face with I
think this is a very confusing product
because it says tinted primer does it
say tinted contour to use underneath
foundation it just says tinted primer
and now I have smeared it all over my
face to keep with the drugstore theme I
am gonna take a little bit of wet and
wild photo focus Foundation and bit and
fifity Boppity boo I'm buff bisque I
think I just earned a goal
star for actually saying that correctly
okay I'm gonna apply this and then we'll
be back for more
Maybelline okay cool so my foundation is
kind of okay that primer I'm gonna go
ahead and say for me it's a pass I just
don't think you should use that all over
your face and I feel like it is a more
advanced technique to contour underneath
your foundation it was just kind of a
tricky thing so we're gonna move on to
the Gigi Hadid jetsedder palette this is
$29.99 this is a high priced item for
maybelline you do get a lot of product
in here you get a blush bronzer
highlight you get two darker shades
right here that you could use as liner
if you wanted to you get some beautiful
eye shadows here two concealers two lip
colors and two brushes a mascara so you
do have enough to do a full face the two
concealers are relatively light so if
you have deeper skin tones you're gonna
be counted out on the concealer front
that's something I noticed right away is
they didn't really have different
options for different skin tones we're
gonna give this concealer a try
like that's not a bad concealer and
actually Maybelline kills it with
concealer they have some of the best I
am gonna go ahead and use my age rewind
look like how empty I am on this one
this is one of my absolute fave just
because I feel like I want a little more
coverage before I move on to powder I do
want to try out one of the new Gigi
Hadid liquid strobes now these are
pretty much identical to the master to
the master strobing liquid there is a
price jump and I'm gonna explain that
with most of these items there is a huge
price jump and you definitely like it's
not even a question you are paying more
for the collaboration for Gigi's name to
be attached to the product the master
strobing liquid is $6.99 the Gigi Hadid
is 1199 now these are limited edition
colors so again your you know not just
paying for the name but also you know
it's a limited edition product that is
actually very pretty it's kind of like
a peachy iridescent type of a thing
reminds me a little bit of the milk
makeup peachy kind of iridescent thing
and I like these so I'm just going to
pop this on the high points of my face
and blend it in it's a very subtle
highlight I think that the original is
much more like bang bang bang this is
the original much more pigmentation and
they have a light medium deep there is a
difference there this one is much more
natural and sheer and it makes sense
because Gigi is known for more of a
natural natural beauty type of a look
I'm going to go ahead and set my face
really quick with a little Cody airspun
and just keep some of the potential
shine at bag crap is this stuff just
always so messy though I really kind of
feel like that primer jacked up the look
of my foundation I'm not thrilled with
it the illuminator does come in one
other shade and it is gold gold is more
pigmented than the first one that I
showed you the iridescent they're both
pretty we are going to bronze up the
face with the bronzer that is in the
jetsetter palette I wish that they had
maybe put the bronzer as than the
biggest one and then the blush is the
second biggest and the highlight as the
tiniest because that kind of is how I
use my pants like I use the most bronzer
second I used the most blush and then I
always use just a tiny little bit of
highlighter like I almost never go
through highlighter that's going on
really nice I haven't even dipped back
in and it still has a lot of pigment and
it's not bad alright the good thing
about this bronzer is it's blending out
really really nicely the bad thing about
the palette is it is so hard just to get
your bronzer and I don't even mess
around with these brushes you guys like
this no this is just can you imagine me
trying to do all of that with this
there's no way I wanted to give this a
chance with my own brushes that I use on
the daily and this did blend out really
nicely let's take a stroll down blushing
why why do I try to be cute like that
like stop and talk to you it's a little
bit dusty
hmm okay this is beautiful so I'm down
with the blush I'm down with the bronzer
let's see about that highlight I'm gonna
take a fan brush and I'm gonna go into
the highlight really pretty I'm really
impressed with this highlight the color
is spot-on it is that perfect light
pinky peach type of a thing without
being harsh lately when I put on
highlighters I go to edit and I'm like
like that was a little bit too I see it
almost looks gray
whereas this just gives you like this
nice soft type of a thing this is the
cup that James didn't break it's a
coffee cup and it's surrounded in
bubbles I've had it balances thank God
and yesterday's unboxing who remembers
that so we're gonna move on to eyes and
I actually want to take a break from
this palette right here and go to these
right here now these little palettes
these are these city mini palettes it is
a bit of a bummer that there is a $5
increase for the collaboration I think
that's a lot of money if you go on Ulta
the ingredients to the other palettes
that are $9.99 and the ingredients in
the GG palettes are the same line for
line the same so you're not paying for a
better version of the formula you're not
paying for anything different you are
literally paying for the collaboration I
think I'm gonna use the more cool tone
palette just to kind of go with my
outfit today a little bit more but these
look like yes like they're gonna be very
very beautiful they do also have these
smaller palettes that open up and look
something like this the sizing on them
to me was a little bit weird I just feel
like they could have done like a bigger
pan with the space they have with this
palette and these aren't cheap they're
$14.99 as well you do get a lighter
shade to maybe use as your base and then
you get a bunch of shades to kind of
contour the eye width they're not
shimmery they're more on the matte satin
side there's a warm one and then there
is a cool one so I'll probably be using
a little
of this cool one to accompany this
palette right here but let me zoom you
guys in so you can see all of my
wrinkles so there are two brushes that
are available within this collaboration
they're $14.99 a piece and we are going
to test them out this looks like it's
gonna be a great brush for all over the
lid we're gonna try this one out a
little bit in the previous maybe I don't
know um but first I am gonna take a
fluffy brush and I'm gonna work with
this cool tone palette take that lighter
shade and just fluff this all over the
lid - do you guys that primer just
really jacked up my makeup so hard like
I want to wash my face and start again
we're gonna go into this guy right here
and I am going to take this shade on a
Mac 224 and just start building up the
crease now I'm going to take the purple
shade and we're gonna go in with this
brush right here this kind of purple
shade and I'm just going to press this
all over the lid
I'm gonna take the darkest shade and
just go on the outer edge it's not
translating very dark it looks very dark
in the pan not a lot of fallout which is
great I'm going to go back into this
matte palette and take the black shade
just on my fingertip really try to
emphasize that outer corner okay now dot
that is painted I'm now gonna wet my
brush and we're gonna go into this shade
right here and I'm gonna go all the way
into the inner corner now that's really
pretty yeah this one has a lot of
fallout it's surprising even when you're
using it damp alright so I am gonna
smoke out the lower lash line I'm gonna
take an itty bitty brush and we're gonna
go in with the first shade that I used
in the crease and I want to go into the
lightest shade in here and work on the
inner corner something about these
though you guys is they are incredibly
powdery be warned I think that's where
the fallout issue is coming from they're
really really pigmented and they are
very very beautiful but there
very powdery this is the liquid liner it
is $11.99 and we're just going to line
the upper lash line the line went on
really nice I do like that a lot so
let's you know try to use as many
products as we can
there is a waterproof liner right here
and I'm just gonna pop that in the
waterline very very rich I really really
like that I hope it stays good and then
they do have a couple of mascaras one is
a new formula the other basically is the
same formula a different package
they both say gigi hadid one is called
the lash sensational mascara I think
we've seen that before this is just a
different package more expensive the
regular formula on this is 629 the Gigi
version is 1199 and then this is a fiber
mascara for $12.99 I'm gonna use this
the same way that I used those fiber
kits that I recently did a video on
where I'm gonna do the mascara first the
fiber and then more mascara and just
hope for the best this mascara is really
nice we're gonna go in with the fibers
and pray to God
alright that is impressive I really
really like that it did not transfer it
to my lid it's giving me a lot of volume
it's giving me a lot of emphasis to my
eyes and big lashes that are kind of
clumpy but not too clumpy I am into it
and you know what I'm gonna do you guys
cuz I keep looking at my makeup and it's
driving me literally crazy my under eye
area just everything looks so dry that
concealer the first concealer I laid
down just really creased so much that it
didn't matter what I put on top it just
looks very cakey and my under-eye area
never looks like this and the foundation
is gathering in weird ways and I use
this foundation all the time the only
thing different was how blotchy and
grabby the primer was so my whole face
just feels very dry and uncomfortable
I'm gonna take this off I'm not gonna
use the primer and I'll be right back
I just redid my makeup I used my tart
shape tape
I used my tart primer but I'm still
using the wet and wild foundation put on
all the GG powders the highlight bronzer
blush and I think this is so much better
so we're onto lips right now and there
are six matte shades three for each
Coast and let's just go through the
shades I'll show you swatches of each
right now for the West Coast collection
there are three Reds they're all matte
there is Cajero austin and lanai for the
east coast collection it is much more
neutral we have Erin Torah and McCall
normally a color sensational lipstick is
gonna run you $5.99 these ones are $8.99
so a little bit of a price jump and I am
gonna go ahead and line my lips I don't
have her liner on hand but she does have
corresponding liners this is also a
Maybelline lip liner that's a really
pretty color this is magnetic mauve and
I'm gonna go in with Erin it's actually
a really nice match now it does say on
line that these are matte but it feels
to me like they have more of a slip to
them so it's a very comfortable matte
it's not a dry matte at all I'm gonna go
ahead and pop Tora in the center just to
see how they layer I love the color
selection in both groups I actually
think this is probably my favorite of
the whole collection I think the colors
are just very very beautiful
everything's opaque it looks really nice
I'm into it and I want to try on one of
the Reds I am wearing a red lip liner
from L'Oreal this is in matcha waited
with you number 102 this is really
pretty
L'Oreal and Maybelline or sister
companies so similar formula actually on
those two lip liners now we're gonna go
in with Austin I think this is what Gigi
is wearing right here and I love this
shade I think it's such a beautiful
fiery red and I just got really really
excited about this color when I first
got this in the mail so it looks really
pretty I really really love this
lipstick so much that I would pay the
premium
these colors that they curated are so
beautiful that I definitely feel like
I'm not mad about paying the price jump
with the lipsticks but we're gonna run
down the entire collection I think along
the way you guys probably know what I
think but let's just rapid-fire through
it alright the jetsetter palette as much
as I love that highlighter in there look
how beautiful it is it's gorgeous on the
face the blush was nice the bronzer was
nice the concealer was just not for me
it creased so badly that that was part
of the reason that I redid my base
makeup and I don't necessarily love the
setup of the blush bronzer highlight
business it kind of all jumbles into one
another and I'm not a fan of that the
brushes in there we're kind of like no
thank you and the gloss is in there
they're okay they're not like that great
I guess the thing that I'm running into
is I'm like thirty bucks at the
drugstore that's so much money at the
drugstore like why it's a lot of money
and there are problems with the palette
so even though there are elements that I
do appreciate about it I think that I
would say I'd pass on that one I would
get excited about other things that are
within this collection like the
eyeshadow City minis yes they are $14.99
but maybe you wait for a sale at the
drugstore at Ulta they have a 350 off of
10 unless they're excluding that coupon
from this collection but I do think that
the color setup in these is beautiful I
think you have to watch out with the
shimmers having fallout but beyond that
they blend really nicely they wear
really well and I love the color
selection I think that these are really
well done from there I'm gonna go ahead
and say I'm not a fan of these though I
think the packaging is kind of weird
like there should have been a mirror in
here maybe this could have been a bigger
pan it just doesn't really make sense to
me it just looks like these little
things are so small and then there's
this giant base shade it's just I don't
know why I can't get into this it's just
not for me
$14.99 I'm just not into it lipsticks we
already know a plus love it as far as
the strobing highlighter the liquid
illuminator
if you want more of a punch go with
their original formula and light medium
or deep if you want that peachy
iridescent that maybe you're gonna put
on you know natural skin you're not
gonna use a lot of powder then I think
it's a beautiful shade and you know it's
worth a look it's not a bad product the
primer not for me I am curious to hear
from you guys if any of you have played
with it what your thoughts are we'll
leave that in the comments below I want
to hear what you think I just thought it
was very weird okay moving on from there
the mascaras I like the fiber duo I
think that is so cool I'm actually
loving the way it feels and nothing has
flaked nothing transferred I think it's
really well done as far as this guy
right here just buy the original save
your cash the only difference is that
this says Gigi Hadid okay so as far as
the liners Maybelline does liners so
well I love them this has not really you
know moved around in the waterline and I
have had it on for a long while now
being that I redid my foundation and I
think that is it so we're at the end oh
the brushes no by morphe brushes less
expensive they're at Ulta now by
Ecotools Real Techniques this is just
too much $14.99 I just did not like it
but I did like a lot of it so I hope you
guys enjoyed this review if you did hit
the like button and be sure to come back
tomorrow because tomorrow we are testing
out a glittery crazy product that is
actually high-end so you don't want to
miss it alright I love you guys so much
thank you for hanging out with me and I
will see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
