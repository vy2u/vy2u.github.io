video today I have my I see here that
I'm gonna be styling today and let's get
ready with me and as the title states I
try to do a 5 minute makeup challenge in
the midst of having to really get ready
to go somewhere so anyway this is I see
here this is their Brazilian straight
hair I made a video showing you guys how
I got chopping layers and blow dry the
hair I ended up cutting it to the
mid-length led that I made for myself on
this unit so their information will be
listed in the description box below but
we bout to jump into this bobbin and get
ready with me and have ever loved so I
wanted to incorporate my 5 minute get
ready with me makeup look in this video
for I see hair because I have to be
somewhere in literally like 5 minutes so
I just want to see maybe like 15 minutes
but I just want to see if I'm able to
get ready in 5 minutes
so you got to talk to underneath my
20 min and was like anybody can't get
ready in 20 minutes let's see what you
can do in 5 minutes because I was hyping
myself up in that video and I was really
really impressed with myself but of
course I've always got to be those
goblins underneath my damn video trying
to you know shade me so we must jump
right into this okay I'm really really
nervous I think I can do it because I
feel like I have products that I can you
know snatch myself up with in in five
minutes okay so yeah I'm nervous I don't
even want to start because I'm so scared
I'm trying to like get some water around
here a little bit cuz I don't want to be
knocking my freaking cups over that I
have my Beauty blenders in cuz you know
I use them damp and I had like this
little concoction that I need to make
with my Sasha Buttercup powder that
should be alright so we're about to
start this this is gonna be the quickest
situation ever because I just don't know
what I'm gonna do I'm not trying to make
it look like the last one but at this
point what can we do in five minutes but
we're gonna start so let me go ahead
start this top this timer I have your at
five minutes and about to start so I'm
gonna use concealer first because you
guys know if I'm doing makeup I have to
have my concealer it's about that time
for me to get a new one
and I am going to use my marc jacobs
foundation okay
whole the brush um I have to use my
Beauty Blender because I don't know Oh
found it okay cool alright so I'm gonna
use this brush to a lie my little
foundation over any dark marks that I
have on my face just to get the
complexion right a little on the sides
or down my nose just to balance it out
all right anything else I'm just blended
in let's see where we're at we are at
three minutes
so when it look like this is usually
gonna be nothing but the skin because I
don't even have time as long as I don't
have any discoloration peeking through
or anything like that I'm okay we're at
two minutes at 57 seconds I'm gonna use
my Briana stick
and I'm going to add a little bit
concealer you guys know I need my
concealer popping I'm not even gonna be
able to bake with the powder that I
usually bake with because it's not gonna
look good someone have to use my Laura
Mercier powder I'm at two minutes and
nine seconds I feel like I need a little
bit more foundation okay I might have to
use my brush to get the most coverage
I'm not gonna make it follows is a dub I
mean my skin looks good but I don't have
mascara on impossible
1 minute and 57 seconds
this is how is looking what I can do is
go ahead and set my face if I can't open
this just lightly I didn't have time to
do brows girl it's not you a little baby
brow situation
wherever yet 16 seconds and closing them
up
this is how it looks so far but least
the skinless drone impossible so we're
going to keep up this makeup Liz I need
a dress I just wanted to see if this was
possible and I already knew not to play
myself like if five minutes I'm not
contouring or anything okay so that's
why I put foundation pretty much all
over my face it's impossible to contour
five minutes I'll let you just do a
powder contour and like just doing like
a bronzing kind of look or something
like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
