video today I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to get this affordable ponytail
look and it was only $1 to achieve this
look so I'm so excited to share it with
you well because I use to pack into the
$2 level at the same time you can't beat
that so I already have my hair slicked
up in a bun so I'm gonna use some
outright hair this is some braiding hair
that you can get from your local beauty
supply store so very simple so as you
seen soon as I took it off the pack it
actually came with like a rubber band in
the middle I'm gonna use that rubber
bands who secure it around my little
baby bun and I'm gonna also wrap some of
that hair around the baby bun so I can
hide my hair and use the braiding hair
so everything can look like it's
supposed to be there now I'm gonna take
another pack of that hair and do the
same thing so it comes like that you see
that rubber band it comes like that so
I'm gonna use that to wrap around my bun
and all that extra nest going on up
there and just so I can secure that and
just so I don't have to braid the hair
onto my hair this is the most easiest
way to do this and it's so easy to take
off and it's a really protective style
it's a really cute style and the reason
why I like using outre hair is because
it's the most realistic synthetic hair
in my opinion it looks like you know it
looks really good after day 2 after day
3 it doesn't get crazy it doesn't like
it tangle or anything like that and it
kind of mimics my hair to be honest with
you guys so yeah if I didn't wash my
hair it would really look like my hair
but I wash my hair before I put it in
the ponytail so it's kind of wet still
so what I did was just pull apart the
top area so everything can look like
it's you know belongs once again and
yeah that's pretty much how you get this
look so I just was like I might as well
continue doing you know my face beat
with you guys I slightly recorded my
face bead but I really did record my eye
tutorial look for you guys so you'll see
that in a second but I'm just using a
little bit of this Eco styling gel just
to smooth my hair up and now we're gonna
go into this makeup looks
I'm gonna go in with my mac prolongwear
foundation in NC 52 you know get my base
and to make everything look poppin and
even this is my complexion for the day I
really like this foundation actually so
if you haven't tried the mac prolongwear
foundation definitely try it out I'm
gonna go in with this tarte concealer
and medium beige and that was just
because I was looking for really
highlighted look you don't have to use
this bright of a concealer but I'm doing
it because once again is to highlight
and to conceal so I'm just gonna blend
all that foundation out and blend that
concealer in and then we're gonna work
on the eye look because I felt like you
know you guys know the rest that I
usually do so I'm gonna go with this
neutral shadow just to place on top of
my lids so when we start blending these
other colors out everything is seamless
and you can kind of see the shadow color
you know so I'm going to use this chain
called Coco bear I think it's from
makeup geek and I'm just gonna put that
above my crease just for a transition
color so you know everything can blend
in seamlessly when I start working with
these orange shades so I'm gonna go in
with my magic palette from Zhu Ava and
I'm gonna take this you know cocoa brown
orange whatever shade and I'm gonna put
that in my crease you're gonna see me
point at it in a second that color right
there so I'm gonna place that right up
in my crease area and blend that out
swiping motions and packing motions if
you pack one you get the most color
intensity if you swipe you kind of start
getting the the blowout effect so yeah
so that's just personal preference how
intense you want it is definitely up to
you so I'm gonna go in with my naked 1
palette and use that silver shade in
that palette but before I place that on
my lid I am going to put some concealer
on my crease area just so the pigment
can be a little bit more brighter but
I'm just doing that because I am gonna
go in with glitter and if the glitter
does fall out throughout the day I will
have this shimmery shadow underneath
this so no
won't look too crazy you know but to
prevent your glitter from falling off
your lids you do want to use a glitter
glue so I'm gonna go in with NYX glitter
glue and I'm also going to take some nyx
glitter to pop on my lids so this look
can look really really pretty and
sparkle and shine you know so yeah so
I'm gonna take a little bit of that
worin shade again from that magic
palette just so everything is seamless
and there's no harsh lines because we
don't want that
okay so glitter glue first that's what
I'm packing on and then I'm gonna pack
on the glitter and then I'm gonna do my
wing and my lashes off-camera I will
list them in the description box below
but that was pretty much it for the look
the lip was a clean color liquid matte
lipstick and a lip gloss right on top of
that so it was very simple easy and I
hope you guys enjoyed this look thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you babies in my next one bye
what about the way
