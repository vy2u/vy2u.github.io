finessing this wig and you see it looks
crazy and it's because you know I'm
normal honey so when takes her wig off
she snatches her wig off and she throws
it across the room I show you how to get
your hair from this to this and I hope
you guys are ready to jug and finessed
it how I made my way down is by my salon
graphics professional freezing hair so
this is exactly how I like laying my
units down it works for me I would
suggest you guys put it directly on your
forehead not your edges because the
whole point of this is to make sure
we're not snatching out any edges even
on hairspray let me take these lashes
off even though this hair spring right
so it's not gonna do that it's not gonna
break off anything long as you use water
to remove this product don't just like
snatch it off so you can do this method
when wigs frontals closures like it
works trust me like I am a advocate for
this spray I was so happy because that
got to be glued hairspray that got to be
glued glue it was just a hot mess like I
just felt like it was messy it was
leaving my frontals in my um weights
sticky doesn't leave my hands sticky was
making my forehead look crazy and this
doesn't do any of that so basically this
video is just gonna show you how I know
revamp my wigs to make them look poppin
again just go throughout the unit right
part it I actually bleached these nuts
on this unit so that's that's why it
looks really visible when I parted so I
like parting it in the frontal area just
to get that secure feeling when you're
wearing a unit you know I actually
created this unit on a dome cap sewed it
down and all that jazz so this is like a
some unit that I made for myself make
sure you're starting from bottom to the
top coming out your hair so what that's
gonna do and just minimize your shedding
when you're trying to detangle your hair
if you start ripping out from the top
my hair will fall out
the hair is really nice I do want to let
you guys know that so today is just
gonna be like a quick style because I
don't want to do much for this hair cuz
it's a lot of hair so I kind of just
want to put the frontal up and work on
the bottom half just because it's about
85 degrees outside I don't have time for
hair to be in my face today but this
hair is super soft I really really like
it if you work with this company let me
know
well actually no I think I like it like
this
but what I'm gonna do is just kind of
like stab this a little bit more but as
you can see it blends with the hair
really good ice once again off leash the
not suggest so the parting can look like
scalp but when you do that when you make
your bleach formula like with the
developer and bleaching powder you need
to make it super thick so it won't bleed
into the hair cuz I used to do that all
the time and I used to have to go back
with brown dye and then fix it and then
some of the Browns I will get in the
lace and it would just be a hot mess so
I'm gonna go in with Mizell professional
Wong curler I got this from TJ Maxx I
love this long curly just because it
gets really really hot I kind of want it
like fat Wong curl it's like true Wong
crows not waves so what you want to do
is just leave wrap it around the barrel
but you want to keep your hair kind of
in a chunk leave it on for about 10
seconds like twist it around so don't
get sick so it doesn't get stiff on the
barrel and let it go but let it sit in
your hand for about five seconds and
drop it just like this who's gonna be
really hot so be careful and then drop
it like that so that's what we're going
to do today you want to go in small girl
do your thing but that's what Tati is
not going to be doing today I used to do
that back in the day sit in the bathroom
for hours long curling my hair just
because I didn't have anything else to
do with my life but girl I have things
to do now
you can calm these out but I'm not gonna
comb them out I'm gonna kind of keep on
like in its coyly State
so make sure you hold it you know long
enough that you feel comfortable that
the curl is going to be the way that you
wanted to you don't have to make all of
these curls like uniform but what I
suggest you do is make sure they're not
like you know really loose because it
will fall faster than the other ones and
then you're gonna have to go in and fix
it by breaking up the piece of the hair
that you curl and um like we make kind
of like the pieces a little bit smaller
trust me I used to do this enough that I
know what not to do when working with
want curlers so you just want to kind of
keep twisting the hair around the barrel
like I said leave it on there for about
10-15 seconds move the wand color around
after baby like ten seconds and then let
it go depending on how thick the piece
is I'll leave it on a little longer
so I don't want these curls to be
uniform and make sure you're curling the
pieces in the direction you want them to
lay just because you don't want to have
to go in and like really touch these
curls afterwards just because you know
once again it's time-consuming and you
don't want to break up anything you
don't want anything to fall you don't
want anything to get frizzy because that
is one thing wonk rollers can do is just
make your hair look frizzy if you go in
and touch it too much after combing your
make sure you use a comb just to comb
through the hair so there's no frizz
ease : third is just gonna get any
pieces that don't belong in your hair
that don't belong in that curl out of
that curl
please be careful with a wok curler also
just because this thing gets so freakin
hot
I don't know about yours and it's not
like like it's like a one heat type of
situation it doesn't like turndown it
doesn't get higher it just gives them
blazing hot and because I
haven't mentioned it already I got this
from TJ Maxx it came with four different
barrel heads this is a medium size and
yeah I love it I love it and love it
love it so definitely check out TJ Maxx
because they had a few of them in there
actually this piece is really important
just because it's gonna fall in the
front of our face ya know so make sure
this one is curled really really good no
loose booty like that okay there we go
so that's pretty much what I'm gonna do
all over my head you guys get the point
now I've kind of tried to do this front
for you guys just because the back will
be a little harder to see of course I'm
going to be doing bigger sections in the
back and I think I might break the back
up after curling it just because I don't
want it to be like too perfect I don't
like what my curls are too perfect
anymore like back in the day I didn't
mind that look but no it's just like I
want it to kind of look after this when
I go in and curl here so I'll do one
piece just to show you what I'm
so that is what I'm talking about
hold it drop it and that's how it's
gonna look just like the front and of
course you can pin these so you don't
have to hold it if you don't want to cuz
you know you don't want to be sitting
here all day but yeah so I'm just gonna
speed this up and I'll be back at the
end of this video
hey babe so I wanted to come back on and
just talk to you guys a little bit more
about Maxine here because I felt like I
really didn't give too much information
because I wasn't prepared anyway I
actually have in there Brazilian water
wave hair 3 bundles of 22 inch and an
18-inch 360 frontal this is another
Express hair company their information
will be listed below but I really have
to let you guys know that I really
really like this hair so I had it for
about three weeks and I wanted to make
sure I felt that way consistently like
without any problems going on because I
did rock this hair without bleaching the
knots and I rocked this hair before
actually making it jet-black and it was
holding up really great but I wanted to
you know put my pizzazz and then I
wanted to bleach the knot so it can look
a little bit more natural I wanted to
give it a fill after dyeing it just to
see if it was shed or cause any problems
and it has not it holds an amazing curl
it straightens great the wave pattern
reverts back after washing it and I'm
really really in love with it so if you
work with maxing hair in the comment
section please let me know I would love
to hear your thoughts about it but I
think that's pretty much all I wanted to
let you guys know so no cons no cons so
far but yeah I love you babes and enjoy
the rest of the video
I had to show you guys this hair in its
natural state because they're so freakin
beautiful after putting heat
straightening it all that crazy stuff
look at how amazing it looks when you go
and just you know put some water on it I
didn't even add any shampoo or any
conditioner on this hair and it looks
fabulous so I had to come and share that
with you guys so I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
