that I bought for my beauty supply store
so hopefully you guys have this in your
beauty supply store literally I was in
there looking for something from NYX but
then I ran across these and I put all my
NYX products back and I was just like
let me try these and then let me do a
video with these because I will be
wearing these all the freakin time and
guess how much they are a dollar 25 so I
was so freakin up when I found these
lipsticks I bought eight of them I lost
one of them already but I added some
more liquid lipsticks in this videos
from colour-pop and Milani and it's just
lipsticks and I usually wear my makeup
tutorials so I just can't even throw
those in there
so the lipsticks are from clean color
the ones that are a dollar twenty-five
and they and it's the madly matte lip
gloss from them so they're all the
colors and they're really frickin pretty
I'm going to be putting all of these on
my lips and yeah so as you can see like
I'm so into like neutral not too many
crazy colors on here but they have so
many I'm gonna pick up some more if I
enjoy all of these I have not watched
all of them or wore all of them I had
open three of them but like I said the
other one I've lost and then the other
two I paired together so we're just
going to put these on and let's begin
this video I just want to talk to you
guys while I'm watching them so I hope
you guys are doing well we're going to
start with the one I opened already and
this is like I said this company is
called clean color madly matte lip gloss
and this is in the shade 1628 okay so
this is what this one looks like
so this is what the spoolie looks like
it's just like a regular like applicator
lip applique the lip applicator I'm
gonna turn this off wait until it dries
matte and then I'm going to show you
what it looks like so this is what this
one looks like and I'm really excited
because I love this one I actually
outlined my lips with lip liner and this
is the brown lip liner that I use is
from clean color - oh I didn't even I
mean no it's like I don't even know this
lip pencil I never looked at the name
but I used to use this all the time back
in the day like when I was in high
school and I just knew that this was so
much creamier than like mixes lip liners
because NYX lip liners I used to try to
put all over my lips as you guys know
like that was my thing lip liners for
the matte effect that I like and it was
just so drying on the lips but these
never even looked at the name but it's
by clean comment - and this is the
lipstick will the matte lipstick that
I'm using today in these videos so yeah
so this one is 1627 so this is what this
one looks like it's more of a nude and
of course I'm gonna have to line my lips
with this one because I can look like
what's-his-name Dave Chappelle this one
is 1627 I just use another lip liner and
this one the two lip liners that I'll be
going in between today is only
cappuccino from clean colors and hot
cocoa
so yeah so this woman is what this one
looks like I did a lot of lip learning
because I didn't want myself to look too
crazy with this one on and I think it's
a really beautiful color it's really
nice on the lips and it's nice and
hydrating it's not really dry you can
still move your lips you're not like but
there's like you know too scared to move
your lips because you know you may feel
like it's cracking no it's giving none
of that I really do like this color -
really freaking pretty I will be doing a
lot of makeup videos with this one too
so next oh guys guess what they had the
colors on these like what they were
clogged and I took the plastic off of
these too because like I told you
using them at night but the other ones
now I can actually tell you guys the
name of them this one is called mink
this one's called rose this one is
called root beer this one's called
cinnamon and then this one is called Jam
so now we know that and um we're going
to start with mink now I want to do mink
a darker than these two it's like right
in the same shade family so I'm really
excited about this one so let me try
this one on now and once again this is
mink and then the number is 16 33 this
one isn't me this one is mink I really
do like this one this one's so freakin
pretty and then the color of it is 16 33
I mean the number is 16 33 so pretty
right I like this one a lot I didn't
line this one at all you guys about this
one I like this one too this one this
one is Ruby R and the number is 16 26 so
now we're going to do
16:29 which is cinnamon and then we're
going to get into these fun fun festive
little color
we gonna get into roads because this one
looks like it's probably gonna leave a
color on my lips afterwards and this is
jams other crazy I probably do this is a
color that always we want to pull off
and I can never find like a nice one oh
but you guys know Kylie has like a new
lip shade called like pumpkin spice I
don't even know mate cause I think I
just lied completely about that color
but it was like it's not foreign to new
color from her and I really do want that
one and maybe this was substitute for
this one just because this one is just
way too loud
I feel like this one doesn't fit my skin
my skin tone number is 1614 so it looks
really pretty in here and that's oh I
also picked it up and yeah it's not that
bad it's not well I guess if this is
your thing so now we're going to do Jam
and this one is 1660s don't think this
is mad enough for you you guys can put
some translucent powder on these things
and then you can make it like really
matte or whatever but it's cool like
this to me just because I really don't
care for these colors anyway these two
bright coeds long as my babies my
neutrals did the job for me
and that's really why I went crazy only
I still wanted to pick up some ones with
some colors so yeah so I'm gonna take
this off now and I'll be right back all
right so the first color I'm gonna do
what color pop is going to be Kapow and
this one kind of looks like this
I don't really know it's like a mommy
kind of color
hopefully you guys can see that on me
pretty good with this lighting
it's so annoying so okay so this
is basically what kapow looks like if
you guys we're gonna move on to beeper
and then she is my favorite so I'm gonna
leave that one for last
okay so beeper looks like this it's more
like a pinkie peachy kind of color
alright so that one is what beeper looks
like if it looks like it's all over my
mouth I'm sure it is when I don't have
good lighting then I can't really see
what I'm doing either
so that's beeper alright so we're never
going to get into cheating I already
lined my lips with um hot cocoa or
cappuccino I don't even know which one I
picked up the next year I don't put a
lot on with cheese because she is she's
a wild stallions so I move the lipliner
around a little bit more with cheap
blend a little bit more add a little bit
more blend your lip liner out but I'm
giving you the gist of this because I'm
ready to get out this mother okay I'm uh
my lips hurt so bad like I can't do
another one mm-hmm mom Milani one is it
looks like this and it's from how about
I put it on on top of this to see what
its gonna create because I usually mix
these lipsticks
this one smells so good there you go
now you kind of see what that one looks
like it's a little bit more Pinker than
Chi but not so much nude I need some
moisture in my leg Oh God
that feels good all right so yeah
I'm about to do me a nice little lip
scrub just to calm these lips down thank
you so much for watching I hope you guys
enjoyed so all of these will be in
listed in the description box below I
will rewind this video to make sure all
of those names are correct for the ones
that did have labels on them and then
beeper Chi and Kapow these are my babies
and then of course we have Milani so
I've been gonna lipstick crazy as you
can see only because I used to be a
lipstick holic in high school when I
first got into makeup and I really
didn't wear anything other than full
lips I wanted to do like my make sure
I'm recording I wanted to do like how I
did my makeup in high school and
literally all I used to wear in high
school was night moth like night mom
knight moth Knight Moss ruby was my
friend but them ruby was just like more
of senior year when I really got into
Ruby whoo but night muff and cyber were
my things so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video ladies thank you so
much for watching don't forget to thumbs
up comment subscribe hopefully you guys
can go and see your V supply store and
be as excited as I was when I saw that
those were only a dollar 25 if you guys
already have these let me know in the
comment section below and let me know
bitch your lady those are dope and
yeah you should have known that and once
again the lip liners that I were
using where were cappuccino and hot
cocoa so these are the two lip liners
that usually are my faves and these all
over your lips will give you a nice
matte look to so even if you can't find
these lip C's matte liquid lipsticks you
can use their lip liners for like a full
matte Brown or neutral color or whatever
they have like a large variety of their
lip liners - and what else can I tell
you guys um I think that's pretty much
it I love you thank you so much for
watching see you guys in my next video
