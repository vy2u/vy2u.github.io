let's get this freaking bang together
miss Westco how about that okay so I'm
back with another hair video and this
video is going to be for another hair
company by the name of V shine and it's
an unboxing video so the point of these
videos that I keep doing is basically to
show you guys how you will be receiving
this hair if you decide to purchase from
these hair companies that I do unboxing
videos for because honestly I personally
like seeing exactly how the hair looks
before I purchased the hair because I'm
not going to work with anything that
looks trashy and nasty so if you like
these video don't forget to thumbs up
comment subscribe and let's begin with
the unboxing I did receive 3 bundles and
a frontal from them so that's what I'll
be showing you guys right now so let's
begin okay so this is how it's going to
come in the rapper has their name on the
labels at the top with the list so
that's awesome and it's coming in
plastic and that's how the frontal came
awesome but I actually did take the
frontal out of the pack because I was
kinda confused about the frontal because
you guys see what confuses like thanks
okay so this is the 20 inch of the deep
waves and the hair texture is pretty
soft about the 20 inch is giving me a
hard time to run my fingers through it
but this is how the sixteen looks and
this one is really pretty and soft this
one's not giving you frizzy when I'll
grow my finger through I'm doing we're
here from here companies I wash the
bundles first and then I saw them so um
I can actually get its natural texture
and after I be conditioned and shampoo
the hair I'll let you guys know how
here stands up and maybe take three
weeks just to let you guys know my
honest opinion table just won't brush
the video but like I said I'm receiving
a better texture with a 16 inch rather
than the 20 inch and I don't know if you
guys can see a difference on the camera
but this is the 18 inch so this is how
the hair looks after you wash it so it
goes back to a deep way so the hair
still doesn't have a bad smell at all
and this one is really soft too so this
is why I try not to judge the hair when
it actually does first come out of the
pack without washing it because after
you watching you wash it you get this
real texture and eat that I'm not
getting any shedding after that and the
18 inch was really soft just like the 16
but I'm not getting too much shedding
out of the other bundles that I ran my
fingers there other than the 20 inch
we'll see how the 20 inch holds up when
I install the hair that I couldn't kind
of see like it's a it's a different
pattern than how the other hair came and
it looks like this would be a little bit
more curlier they try to make the hair
look the best when it comes out of the
pack I can run my fingers right through
this fingers that's running my fingers
through it just to wash it so this is
how much shedding that I receive with
that so this is how the frontal looks
after washing it and like I said it was
just because they wanted to hear to
probably look appealing inside of the
package or something or that's probably
just how they store their frontals which
is perfectly fine look long as the front
matches the bundle paddle
here so this is how the frontal lobe is
a nice density as well
I probably conduct baby hairs back
because yeah I did see some baby hairs
on this front oh yeah hope you guys
enjoyed this video um all of this stuff
just came in like a plastic big plastic
wrap okay so I went ahead and put some
water on the 20 inch so you guys can see
and it's way easier to run my fingers
through so I'm glad I did that so you it
just match perfectly with with the front
sole so okay so I'm glad and I just went
ahead is showing you the bundles wet
together so you guys love it when you're
receiving up front so from this hair
company it's going to be the same
texture as the bundles and they're not
trying to chip you out of your blending
so how am I going to put some highlights
in this hair because it's time for some
color now I'm tired of just boring black
hair so I'm excited to share that
installation with you so I'm probably
going to put that one the second half of
this video so this video could be a
little bit longer for you ladies and I
just want to thank you so much for
watching this part of the video and I
hope you guys like the installation
Here I am with the hair install and yes
I put some color in it like I said up
boy - I did 30 volume developer and um
let's add bleach on the hair for about
maybe 10 minutes that's how easy that
was and then I put extra little
highlighted parts in the towards the end
so I can get another type of color going
on um that's how I achieve this color
I'm really excited with this hair how
the hair held up during that process and
also how the hair looks afterwards um
I'm getting a kind of a curly feel to it
also like a deep wave it kind of reminds
me of best lace wigs um unit that I had
in but me and I just think it looks
super natural so even if you guys don't
get a front offer like you can
manipulate your hair really well to fit
this in texture really excited that I
went with me Sean to do a review for
them because this hair is holding up
really good and I'm excited to throw
some curls in there so that's going to
be in my next video probably I can get
ready or something a couple of UM
pictures up of me rocking this hair
because I'm not sure if you guys can
pick up the exact same color
don't forget to thumbs up share comment
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
