back with my blooming hair like I
promised so I just wanted to let you
guys know how the hair is holding up so
far
one side is wet one side is dry so as
you can see the hair is sexist but I
just wanted to show you guys letting it
your drive this is how fabulous that
your curls are going to be you don't
have to add any styling products or any
manipulation to this hair to get it to
be fabulous I just wash the hair with
water and some conditioner and look at
how awesome it looks so today it's
really hot outside and even with the
hair all in my face but some of the hair
is up in these little chopped nuts right
here say hello to them hello topknot
look it so this is me running my fingers
through the back of my neck to show you
guys that there's no like shedding it's
not hard to run my fingers through this
hair at all I'm honestly not supposed to
even be running my fingers through it I
don't I just like letting it air dry out
but for the sake of this video you will
see me like it touch the hair a little
bit more than usual because I just
wanted to let you guys know how popping
this hair is so we're gonna look on to
the sides and this is the bright side
the frontal is all basically right here
and then the back of the bundles so as
you can see it blends really good I
really don't have any cons with this
hair at law I give this hair it's not
button I really didn't think I was going
to get anything wrong with this hair or
find anything off-putting about the hair
because bloomin hair has nothing but
positive reviews all over there I'll use
spread scare stores so you definitely
need to check that out if you just don't
believe me or if you want another
opinion I did make this wig by myself
can you believe it is a wig I'm really
proud of myself I did a good job it's
really flat and it fits really snug on
my head so I'm probably gonna start
making wigs again I used to make wigs I
just have a style seat that you guys can
contact me on if you're interested let
me know
but I just wanted to thank blew me hair
forgiving me awesome quality hair I love
the luster of this hair and I feel like
that's part of the reason why it looks
so natural also in here that I've
straightened and it goes back to his
curl pattern
so nothing in the hair didn't add any
like products or anything just water but
when it comes to conditioning this hair
Garnier moblins repair and conditioner
try it out for yourself and then thank
me later
so yes I'm a wrap up this video now
because my camera is about to die so
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
