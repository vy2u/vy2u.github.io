hair and I have to say how much I love
this hair immediately because this hair
is holding up so well I've had this hair
in for maybe like four weeks it is not
doing any wrong to me it's not giving me
any problems and it's just given me so
much life the hair is not in its natural
state right now I did finger comb out
the curls so I can get my Diana look
going on right now low maintenance hair
so if you're looking for something
that's actually just wake up and go type
of hair this is definitely the type of
hair than to just anybody to purchase
all I do to maintain and keep this hair
looking really well and its natural say
is just literally water some water that
I put in my spray bottle and then I
spritz it on the hair and then I think
like a dry its own natural state and
this is how well the hair looks in its
natural state so I'm completely fine
with that I do have a closure in so
that's what's going on at the toddler's
hair I just wanted to show you guys this
hair in its natural state um it's really
soft hair like I'm here for me as deep
wave hair during the summer time I'm
glad the quality is as good as they told
me that the hair was well I get so many
compliments whenever I do detangle this
hair I just start from the bottom and
come from bottom up so I don't get any
shitty I definitely recommend this hair
to ladies that's looking for
low-maintenance hair but at a great
quality and a great price so if you guys
are interested in maximum hair the
information will be in the description
box below as well as somewhere in this
video I'm sure it's definitely worth
falling in love with and what I do to
get my hair looking very awesome like
that it's just water can you believe it
or not when you receive max clams hair
you definitely need to go ahead and wash
it um air dry and leave it alone rock it
like that when you want to bring your
combing out if you feel like it to get
this big look I said is hair to the shed
have bed smell it's not tangling it's
easy to detangle it's easy to comb
through you don't need a brush
throughout the day you don't need
anything and it's just soft and full of
life and you can wear so many different
styles with this hair how amazing the
hair is going to look when you put
blonde curls after you comb like a
really nice deep wave hair I just want
to do it really quick look at that look
at that okay so this is max clams
Brazilian deep wave 18 20 22 with a 16
inch lace closure I will not be
straightening this hair at all if you're
looking for some affordable hair
definitely check out max lamb's hair
looks big and it gets bigger and it gets
bigger and it gets better and like
you're going to get so many compliments
with his hair every time I go out
literally somebody and their grandmother
is telling me how much they love my hair
I don't have any negative thoughts about
this hair when you sew in your hair the
flip over method do not do the cutting
method because that causes shedding we
part wing with the lace closure and it's
my super flat the lace closure cows the
closure is so nice like look at this
soon as you part it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
