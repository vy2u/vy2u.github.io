they finally are able to snatch their
makeup sentence on your eyes this is
just very simple so why not I used to do
it all the time when I was able to get a
pop swing I was like yes and it was
ready to finish if they had anything to
say about my makeup very glam look very
basically at the same time so if you
guys are interested please continue to
watch I do have another you know topic
to share with you guys really quick
before we start this video you don't
follow your career and resolve that post
on Twitter was just letting you guys
know that I am going to be starting my
Westco custom units and I'm so excited
about it it was never a goal to do hair
all my life but what I'm great at is
hair at the end of the day so if I can
start my own hair line if I can start
making custom wigs for the people that
love and support me why not I'm going to
be able to do all of your guys's hair
that we should be able to get a unit
from me you know and which you'll be
able to get something customized from
the kid you'll have it to wear it so I'm
just speaking it into existence because
if you do that nine times out of 10 is
definitely going to happen
that's my motto so the units will be
sold on my website so when all of that
information is ready to be shared like
the exact link and stuff like that I
will of course update you guys my merch
will be on there as well and my youtube
videos will be just you know posted on
there too so you guys can just sometimes
just go to Tokyo with calm and just see
what the kid is doing just getting
updated in my pictures will be on there
most likely and yeah so I'm really
really excited about that that's just
the next step of you know I'm 22 and I
don't want to be lost in the sauce you
know I want to be the reason why y'all
look and saucy okay I don't want to get
lost in the sauce so just talking about
you at this point I love you and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye start
off with some primer sits in w50
concealer from mac love me for my dark
eye circles see la girl pro orange
correct and concealer and this is just
to make sure that you're cancelling out
all of your discoloration
hyperpigmentation whatever you
like your flaws undertone is like mine
are like really dark brown kind of
discoloration so am i using the orange
one if you feel like you need to use the
yellow green purple one because your
discoloration is different do so but
because I have more melanin in my skin I
like using the orange one for myself
you'll have to put this much on because
a little goes a long long way but you
know the kid is extra so that's what I'm
going to do so now I'm going to take my
la girl Pro concealer inside I'm going
to use this product to put on top of the
orange concealer just so when I blend
this out it's not as harsh because it
can look reprogram but if you go with a
whole bunch of foundation and Binger
these steps it's just going to be more
product that's not necessary so if you
can use your concealer to cover up most
of your imperfections and then go on
with your foundation when you go with
your foundation you don't feel like you
have to pack on your foundation unless
you like that full coverage glam girl
but even if you do like that full
coverage slim there are certain products
that you can use to get the full
coverage glim put you do not have to use
a ton of the product so such as eye
makeup forever like the sculpting stick
or you can use the hourglass stick
that's like a full coverage foundation
because it's a concealer and foundation
in one but yeah so I'm just going to use
my NYX or control drops today just I am
running out as Charlie because I didn't
spill all this on my counter the
other day so I'm stuck with the little
amount that I am using but it's all good
in just an interesting four three four
three nine brush it looks like this mine
is a little bit dirty it's cool just
because I don't wash my makeup brushes
every day I try to wait to the end of
the week to wash them so I'm going to
also take some of my rose water this
product is heavenly and I like to spray
a little bit on my brush as well so I'm
going to stipple it into my skin
driving the cat like like like like like
some more of my favorite concealer and
this is going to be the Milani retouch
erase concealer and this is in the shade
beep honey number six and I'm just going
to use this to put right on top of that
fun and color correcting concealer and
this is just to make sure I still get
the effect of what concealer is supposed
to do as well as what highlighting is
supposed to do and that should just
bring you up as well as covering your
dark eye circles and give you like a
highlighted look to your skin make the
normal sense I can take enjoyed school
cream contour and this is just to chisel
your face make you look like you have a
slimmer you know appearance yeah so I
like doing this and a little bit
underneath much in Penticton I'm going
to blend out my contour on my cheek
lightly with my same foundation brush
just so it can blend properly I like
using my Maybelline shine free powder to
set my under eyes just look up and put
this on your knees first what's no
creases if you feel like you have
creases please lend it out before you
set it with powder just because it will
look a hot mess if you don't do that
trust me the reason why do this is
because if I go in with a contour brush
or anything like that and start moving
it around with powder it's going to look
really patchy so I'm just like packing
the powder in this area first and you
can pretty much just go ahead and set
the rest of your face while you have
this brush on hands go bronzer so I just
like packing it first just so I can get
the color intensity that I want because
it's very built nice Benjamin Zuko
flipping it so I need a new brow product
I am going to be getting the brow with
no not route which I think it's a
benefit brow pencil in the shade number
5 yes I will go into you the angle brush
just to carve on the ground
we're going to do be morphe 35o palette
and then I'm just going to just use this
just to intensify my shadows you can get
this from Mac black magnacat like like
like like I'm going to go in with a
shadows who that mimics the shadow just
so when I go in with my eyeshadows
they're going to blend out a lot more
seamless so I'm going to go with white
from the lorac palette and I'm going to
take white and cream and just place that
right on top they supposed to be for
some dissipation okay so I'm going to go
in with taupe from this palette now
pretty much place it in my crease and
also like the transition area and just
blend this out the Keystone co-opting 50
35o palette and I'm just going to place
this color in the same area it's a bit
of this shame right here and just hit up
the crease area like maquette like what
happens the one there
you gotta do what you speak
another tumble Mac eyeliner just winged
liner
so I just tight line a little bit with
Smulders this is forget you like that
feline of sex go at once with a
different references like a phone
company in the fridge Mizzou call was
over going to the bottom lashline same
thing that we did on the top we're going
to do on the bottom you must agree much
of all it's always something to apply
some lashes but before I do that we're
going to go over live in a blush and
we're going to a shadow for blush today
swipe over right there one of the higher
parts of my face because I have a round
face so I don't like putting the color I
like right up in here putting it right
where I put my contour and my um my
bronzer alright so I'm going to line my
lips with next cork let us take 16:28
from clean color and I'm just going to
drag this all over my lid and pretty
much matches cork that's why I like it
so much I'm crimp in new in the center
add a little bit of this NYX butter
gloss in the center of my lip the abh
locates and I'm going to add some
highlight oh my I just want it to be
there
so know about these these are amazing
these are really affordable the big
enough I don't know Malia Malia I don't
know but I will lift them in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
