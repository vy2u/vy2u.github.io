a patio is going to be on V Sean's hair
update review to basically let you guys
know how I feel about the space I'm not
getting anything off putting a bath in
here like I don't see any excessive
shedding you get strands here and there
the closure it is a bit earlier than the
odd deep wave this is V Sean's Peruvian
equate I do have an ax boxing video but
it is a bit curl here as I was looking
at it and dealing with it Davie I didn't
notice
I'm so excited
don't you guys love it awesome Flatiron
curls don't ask me where I got this
letter from because I have no idea where
I got this letter from save up his hair
like do I have to say anything with how
amazing this hair held my curls my
Flatiron felt at that beautiful
beautiful that's all I can say thank you
be shine so much for giving me great
great great great quality hair this is
the Peruvian deep wave from V shine
definitely check them out they have
great bundle deals this hair is so
freakin soft my foot yeah definitely
check this out like look at this full of
life I did a lot of chopping though like
I wish I can just grab all the hair and
bring it to the camera but that would be
so nasty right let me know if you have
any other questions about this hair
Lester is amazing moon is that funner to
touch the hair the hair got silky
straight so I love that see that the
problem with the closure is not so much
of an issue if you check out other
tutorials on this hair so you guys can
feed if anybody else had a problem with
a frontal so basically this is all that
I'm doing with V shine hair I love how
this hair came out but it's just right
really easy to maintain I don't have any
cons with this hair deuces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
