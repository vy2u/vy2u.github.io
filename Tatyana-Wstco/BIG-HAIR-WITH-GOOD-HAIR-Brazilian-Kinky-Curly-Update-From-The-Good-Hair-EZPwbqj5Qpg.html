another video and today is going to be
my updated review for good hair and I
have been there kinky curly Brazilian
bundles and I really love this hair it's
a super big Diana s curly Bush I have in
the length to 20 or a 22 and an 18 inch
closure so have an unboxing video for
this hair company check that video out
I'll leave you in the description box
below how this hair is holding up I
don't receive shedding when I'm not
trying to detangle these tangling is
really not hard at all I just start from
the bottom up I do the it's transparent
there of course it's curly hair but it's
nothing too crazy that it's like worth
telling you guys it's shedding because
it's really not shedding it's just
detangling and what I use to detangle
this hair is just a mixture of
conditioner I have some keratin it's
from Tresemme I'll put its there deep
moisture conditioner I believe that's
what I use on this hair and I'll put all
the products that I use to maintain this
hair in the description box below there
and then I put that in a water bottle
spritz it all over the hair and then I
use my paddle brush to detangle from
bottom to top so I think all four
bundles in my head plus the closure so
this is exactly why my hair looks so big
you can probably get away with like two
bundles in the front so but I love how
it turned out I really think this hair
will look good with some color you know
that like rusty orange color that you
get when you like bleach your hair I
think I'm gonna do that you guys know
who scissor is the artist the singer
whatever she has like this pretty orange
color in her head and I really like that
and I think I might do that with this
hair so umm if you guys think that look
cute let me know in the description box
below when I receive this hair
here didn't have a bad smell at all the
hair still doesn't have a bad smell it's
a really soft hair like I really wish
you guys can feel it all I did was take
the closure like the front part of the
closure I part of it and then tuck
smooth it out tough it being on my hair
and then I left that breast hanging so
that's basically what's going on at the
top of my head right now and then I just
made me some little fake baby hairs when
I split them down to make it a little to
make it look a bit natural so the Cantu
shea butter and leave-in conditioner
this stuff is amazing on this hair I put
this on the hair often if I don't put
this on the hair it still is really
pretty but I feel like with this hair
because it gets so big you need a bit
more definition in the curl and I feel
like this helps give definition and it
smells like heaven turn around
alright I don't plan on curling it I
don't plan on straightening it up how it
turned out
I just put it on I wake at our dome crap
sold it down and call it a day so yes I
hope you guys enjoyed this video don't
