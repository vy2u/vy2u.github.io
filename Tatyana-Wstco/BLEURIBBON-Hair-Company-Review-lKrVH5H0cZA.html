I'm back with another video and in this
video I'll be sharing with you guys my
new hair secret and these extensions are
from Blue Ribbon hair company and it's a
uk-based hair company I having their
deep wave texture and filaments are oh I
have in their Brazilian deep wave
texture and the lips that I have in our
228 of 2624 a 22 and a 20 inch closure
and I have in half of the 22 inch so I
have four and a half bundles be any
closure man I am in love with this hair
this is the natural state of the hair
and when I say it's so soft and flowy
and bouncy I just love it so the hair
came packaged in this lovely box it has
the company's name on it in the boxes
like this and the bundles were placed a
nice in mean in this box I thought this
was so cute I also came on the bag can
do whatever you want with the bag I know
girls rave about this hair and say that
they had their hair from blue ribbon up
to a Thierry whatever you're you know
title we're in extensions and want to
have that your hammer Eve you can put
the hair right back in this box and
place it right back in the bag
that they provided for us I thought that
was pretty cool um what else I can tell
you about this hair this hair is like so
easy to maintain it's a low-maintenance
hair um if you want the curls to meet
deeper or you can all you need to do is
I take a spray bottle and like just miss
the miss the water on the hair and use a
wide tooth comb in this video coming to
us and I'll show you how the hair looks
wet and give it a little time to dry and
come back on the camera this is actually
the yes this is the hair in its natural
state but I actually had the hair up in
a bun and all that crazy stuff so the
waves are a little bit more defined than
this after I first like wash
so I'll definitely show you guys that
towards the end of this video but I love
the hair the ends are healthy
no no rightly strands or anything like
that but I did have a problem with the
28-inch when I first received it the end
seemed a little bit more dry so what I
did was co wash the hair with organics
conditioner and knocked out all the
kinks and the hair just felt so soft and
the dryness was going so yeah what else
can I say
um it holds a curl amazingly I have a
few pictures of how I style this hair
and I'm sure they'll be on my Instagram
once I get this video up this is natural
black and there's pretty much there's no
cons with this hair like I really love
this hair I know Yandy Smith and Emily B
Karrueche
Waka Flocka girlfriend is supposed to be
rocking this hair so that those names
are just to let you know that this hair
is great a hair if those ladies want to
rock this hair you're definitely
receiving your money's worth buying hair
from the ribbon hair company so keep
that in mind you're looking for great a
easy to manage great quality hair virgin
hair you definitely need to check out

wave hair from a company this hair is
but I'll keep you guys updated if I have
any cons trust me I will tell you I
can't wait to show you guys how I curl
his hair and stop this hair how this
hair straightens and all of this month's
stuff I'm definitely gonna have fun with
these bundles I have a coat for you guys
to use if you are interested in
purchasing this hair it will be at the
end of this video and I hope you guys
enjoyed the video love you thank you for
watching see you in my next video bye
the hair when it's wet this is a comb
that I use the wide tooth comb and after
I wash it and just comb right through it
I already come from the what you're
supposed to just come from the bottom
first and then go up but I already comb
through it so there's no snags and there
were no snags at all in this hair anyway
no nods no tangles wash the hair before
installing the hair that's when you're
gonna get the best result it was just
the hair was so coyly how it came I'll
show you a picture so try not like comb
through those curls like even with a
powder brush with this
when I was coming from bottom I wasn't
working and it kind of scared me because
I was like I don't have a problem with
his hair after I wash it it was just
amazed moles so I definitely would say
judges hair after your first co wash
yeah I definitely on contacting them and
let them know about the dryness of the
28 inches and the problem that I had
with trying to break the curls up in the
pattern that the hair came into them
into consideration and they loved to how
honest that was to them so they're
working on that problem but it really
isn't a problem at all after you wash it
I promise you guys it wouldn't be in my
head right now
yes it was you could put your fingers
right through this hair with no problem
you can honestly get away with rocking
three bundles on this hair not even a
closure like these bundles are so cool
full bundles the West Arnie and I just
love this hair I don't receive any crazy
shedding from this hair at all when I'm
styling the hair a little strands here
and there but um nothing crazy trust me
I cannot stand shedding from weeds but
you're going to get us stranded too as
long as it's not chunks of hair coming
out of your head you have nothing to
worry about
but I honestly barely get strands if I
do kiss chances because I'm detangling
my hair and you know brushing it out
from us now there's something like that
I don't put tons of products in his hair
so I'm using something in this hair it's
heating protective spray my organic
shampoo and conditioner and water that
is it I don't put anything to enhance
these curls or anything like that I feel
like if you have to do that and that's
not good virgin hair if you straighten
this hair like every freaking day and
like styling every day you are gonna
lose some of its curl pattern just keep
that in mind
with any virgin hair you can't just keep
putting heat heat heat on the hair and
feel like it's just not going to lose
its weight at all
you use less products and it helps the
hair the virgin hair lasts longer
it also products weigh the hair down
it's not going to be as flowy luscious
and lovely as it would if they were most
in its natural state so keep that in
mind when it comes to virgin hair that's
how I continue having so much hair or
that's how I get my virgin ears to last
as long as it does just by putting less
product in treatment as if it was my
hair coming out of my scalp you know
doing little trims here and there and
all of that cute fun stuff um yeah so
I'm going to dye this hair I don't know
if I'm going to record it or not and I
don't know when I'll be dying this hair
but I'll definitely let you know I'm
part of the hump day of blue ribbon hair
I'll let you know how the bleach took on
the hair if it made the hair dry or
anything yeah I just can't wait to share
you can share with you guys that process
and I'm just so ready for color black
and black but yeah tell me what color
you got to be got you go
don't save red I would never have dyed
my hair red ever ever ever never
I'm leaving how do you hate it do not
tell me about I think I need to get
thanks for supporting it rocking with me
I really appreciate you guys honestly
like hold me down and I thank you guys
because I actually do love making videos
