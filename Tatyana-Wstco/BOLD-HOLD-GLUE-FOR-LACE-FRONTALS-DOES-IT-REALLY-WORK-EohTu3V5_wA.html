this is the extreme cream this is the
extreme boho cream and if you guys don't
know what this is supposed to do is
basically keep your lace intact now you
can put like five to seven bears on your
skin and pop your base right on top and
it's not supposed to budge okay but
we're gonna do two layers today because
I don't want to not be able to take this
 off a lot of professional
hairstylist use this somebody I follow
on instagram actually promoted this and
yes so yes both hold I will put the
information in the description box below
I ordered it maybe like three days ago
and it got to me yesterday so really
good with shipping it was only like $20
$25 I don't know I'll click the link in
the description box below but so far so
good like this side is perfectly fine
nothing is wrong with it so what I'm
gonna do is be a little ghetto I'm gonna
use the back of a tube brush I don't use
this tube brush anymore yeah so I'm
gonna use the back of this and then
there of the bow hold extreme cream to
your skin only allow it to dry until
tacky
up to five layers each layer must be
clear before adding the next and then
that's it so yeah that's how some all
the little dot is so I already did this
signs I didn't do the top or this side
so we're going to finesse this together
zoom you in so you can see what I'm
doing so I'm looking at my monitor so
hopefully this turns out how I needed to
but you know I'm gonna have to start
putting it up there as well because yeah
um MPs I have like a stocking cap
underneath it and I use some foundation
powdered so the stocking can match my
skin please if your brown skin do not
just go in with a tan stocking cap
thinking it's gonna work for you cuz
you're gonna look crazy
trust me I'm almost made the mistake of
forgetting to apply my foundation powder
and this is a wig by the way so I was
able to take it off but this glue is so
powerful that when I didn't have to take
it off to add the foundation powder to
the other side it did not mess up my
application for the boho cream so yeah
so as you can see is starting to dry
already so I would say you can move
pretty fast with this product you do
want to make sure you're placing it on
your skin and not your edges okay like
that's a no-no so when we get down here
I'm gonna place it around all of this
the stocking cap is supposed to be high
and all of that but like I said I had to
remove and doors extra stuff so I kinda
was like pulling and tugging on the
stocking cap a little bit so that's why
it's not covering my sideburns like it
should be so this is the first layer
guys so the second layer will be placed
right after this part gets clear and I'm
gonna look in the mirror now just to
make sure I have all the spots that I
need to cover but I'm gonna wait until
this gets tacky and cleared and then
we're gonna go on and then we're gonna
put the second layer on there and the
reason why I'm using the two brush is
because it gets really really tacky so I
don't want to use my fingers or anything
like that you can use a chopstick or
like a little I don't know any any
utensil that you don't really need
anymore wouldn't help just don't using
like paper towel or tissue
so yeah you see it's already closed up
so I'm so in love already guys because
how I did this frontal I did it really
good and I feel like it was mint
for me to record this process so I'm
glad then I use my head today and turn
the camera on and once again this is
these second layer please avoid placing
this point your edges because when it's
time to remove I'm sure you can use
alcohol or you can just soak in some
water or something like that
I'll put way too much right here but um
yeah you can probably like just soak it
in some alcohol or some water and then
it will remove off your skin but if it's
on your hair game over game over I'm
gonna wipe this off and put some of it
down here
all right
but yeah girls like this stuff is
amazing I'm not mad at law
look at that not budging this side is
dry I might need to put a little bit
more like right here because I feel like
when I went to half I had to cut some
some of this off too
because it was too close but look at
this I just placed this and it's not
moving at all
that's nuts and I'm pulling hard like
look so let me cut I'm gonna cut around
here and I'll be
so yeah this is their frontal by the way
I bleach the nods as well as tinting the
lace so it can look a little bit more
realistic when I am applying the you
know lace on my forehead it doesn't
stand out to my child and I also use a
tan way cap to place underneath this wig
that I created and I use some foundation
powder just so if I do go in part it you
can look realistic on my skin complexion
bold homework really really good truly
truly advise you guys who do it in the
mirror
don't try to record yourself doing it
because it kind of looked a little wonky
on this side because I had to make sure
that the glue that was a little bit
extra to act too much I had to take a
paper towel and some rubbing alcohol to
get some of that off but once again I
was just my fault just because I really
wasn't paying enough attention to where
I was placed in the glue because I was
trying to show you guys so I'm glad I
showed you guys how well it holds I
don't have any problem with having to
apply that glue I think that really
really nice honestly I don't have any
cons with there or anything like that I
definitely would say fall to follow the
directions they actually have some bulk
hold remover if you want to go ahead and
purchase that when you go to purchase
this just because this stuff is really
strong and tacky so you just want to
make sure if you do accidentally get it
when you're here
please do not wrap your hair like take
your time and like taking it off use
some oils if you don't have the bulb
over the ball hole remover and use
conditioner use water use alcohol around
the perimeter just to loosen it up a
little bit but please just don't go in
just snugging and ripping because what
you have a really bad experience with
boho glue just because
can tell how like this is on my head
this is not going anywhere and I only
use two layers so it recommends five
layers well it doesn't recommend but it
tells you you can put up to five layers
on your skin your skin not your ninjas
and you can you know you won't have to
get touched up by your stylist or
anything like that and it also
recommends that you guys do not go into
any water or probably like don't get
your hair wet in the shower make sure
you wrap your hair if you are going to
take take a shower so the steam doesn't
affect anything for the first 24 hours
I'm not sponsored I just want you guys
know if you felt this don't blame
anybody
definitely don't blame me but don't
blame boho because you know their
directions are really really direct
there on the bottle it's a really small
fine print but it's very very important
because like I said it's a really good
product and it's definitely for
professionals so if you need help please
you know get the help before you go and
snatch out your damn hair I don't want
that for you okay but I love you guys so
pretty much I think grace hair will be
listed in the description box below I
just hope you guys love this because I
love it like look at the layer job or
this I did it really good but other than
that the hair left there is really
really popping - so I just makes it even
better but let me take these pictures so
I can sink my eyes to bed because it is
like what four o'clock in the morning it
is for 33 and I'm up acting like I'm
going out somewhere I'll see you guys on
my next one getting getting I love you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
