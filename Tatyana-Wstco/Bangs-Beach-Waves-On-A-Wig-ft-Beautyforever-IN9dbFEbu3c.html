today I have in some beauty forever hair
I will list the exact information in the
description box below but I just wanted
to come on and share with you guys what
I have been doing with my beauty forever
hair I do have another video up this
hair company but it was just me styling
just the bundles without the frontal and
stuff like that so I decided that I
wanted to make a wig and I made bangs
with it when I did create this wig I
didn't have my shears with me nor my
scissors so I was able to cut some
layers in the hair and also thin out my
bangs just a little bit because as you
can see that part right there it's a
little bit too thick for me so I'm gonna
fix that in a second so yeah so this is
beauty forever hair like I stated and
their hair is really really soft I love
this hair companies quality on their
hair I feel like it's really thick for
it to only be like two bundles in my
head this is really really nice hair
because I use the other bundles to do
other things like cute up dudes and
stuff like that but yeah so just watch
me
stop my hair today I will link their
information in the description box as
I'm gonna do some warm curls with you
guys on this look today and that's about
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I got a baby it's you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
