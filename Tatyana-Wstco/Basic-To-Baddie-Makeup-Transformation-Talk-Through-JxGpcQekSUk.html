baddie you got to make sure your skin
looks good even if it's going through
some things okay
we're human so if you break out you know
just try to stay positive about it don't
like try to like go hide underneath the
rock this strobe cream format gives you
a really really nice glow give you that
healthy glow that you're looking for
when you are applying your makeup now if
you're going for a really matte look you
can probably skip this step
but I also feel like it just makes your
makeup go on smoother so that's why I
like using this product of course you
want to use your favorite foundation
this Clinique foundation is in the shade
golden number 24 golden and I really
really like this one I've been using it
for the past couple of days and I really
really like its coverage and I also like
how it looks on my skin so this is only
like $28 it might be 20 to 28 I think
it's 28 so I'm just going to apply it
where I feel like I needed the most as
you can see I have a lot of like
discoloration and acne scarring on this
side so I'm just gonna make sure I apply
it in this area because you know I don't
really need a whole bunch of foundation
all over my face I feel like it's
unnecessary to go in with a full face of
foundation for me just because sometimes
I get really heavy-handed and then it
starts to looking really cakey on me so
I just kind of put it in the necessary
spots blend it out and then if I need to
put a little bit more I will do that
they didn't have my shade in stock so I
probably brought to the mall today to
see if they have it because I actually
really like it what I have noticed when
I do put this on I still like the
creasing is kind of there a little bit
so when I do blend this out and then set
it I'm going to have to
definitely look up and then set my under
I wanna make sure I'm not increasing
throughout the day so that's that and
then now what I'm gonna do is go in with
my NW 50 so as you see I lay my makeup
down first like where I want to apply it
and then I take my brushes and beauty
blender to blend everything out just
because I feel like this just makes me
have it like a lighter hand on my makeup
and it makes it look a lot more natural
so that's kind of why I do my makeup
like this start contour with my NW 50
concealer from mac that's when I put on
my nose I forgot to mention that just
take my Bobbi Brown foundation stick and
I like using this one just because this
is a little bit darker so if I'm go for
you really flawless look and I want
everything to look snatch I like putting
this right on top of the NW 50 just so
much
know that my contour can look a little
bit more popping and I like putting the
NW 51st also because it helps make
everything look seamless and nothing is
looking like money with me or anything
like that
so what I'm gonna do is spray my face
with fix+ and while I'm doing this I'm
trying to figure out what makeup what I
look I want to do because I have no idea
just going to start stippling my
foundation first and this is how you get
the most coverage by like tapping it in
and then you start working it throughout
the rest of your face and what I like
doing is I like mixing my foundation
with my concealer in this area as well
as this area just because I feel like I
don't need my forehead to be too too
light and learn how to avoid that by
doing this method so everything can look
good go in with my Beauty Blender of
course it's a damp and then what I'm
going to do is just blend the concealer
out so I also like letting my concealer
sit under my underneath my eyes for a
little bit before I start blending it
out only because I still like the
coverage a little bit more fuller
because if you start working with your
concealer as soon as you lay it down I'm
just feel like it gives you this sheer
look and then you would have to continue
to apply to get the coverage that you're
looking for so if you let it sit a
little bit kind of you know dries down
and then when you start blending it out
you know it looks like it's a little bit
more full coverage
but I'm just gonna go over the line
where I kind of stop blending the
concealer down and this is just to
ensure that there's no lime demarcations
and you can't like clock where my
concealer and my foundation starts
because that's extremely important and
add a little bit more contour okay and
we're going to just take this foundation
brush and tap not bringing any other
products down we want to stay in this
area any of this product gets down here
your face is a little bit a little bit
more wrapped that was Tom's aspect which
is my favorite part because you guys
know I love doing the most with my
favorite powder to sit with which is my
Laura Mercier that I just dusted all
over me cuz I didn't know there was
stuff in my top if I try to use
something else it just it just ain't
turning out like Laura blend everything
out again because trust me there is
creasing if you don't think it's crease
and trust me it is don't play yourself I
like to blow a little bit just so I
don't have any extra powder on the
sponge which will cause you to look
extra crazy a little bit and then what
I'm gonna do is take a little bit more
and then look up so now there's no way
in hell this powder can crease on me cuz
I didn't move my eye and pretty much
every direction and the powder has set
and all of my little fine lines
underneath my eye so I'm gonna set the
areas that I concealed
that set you know I slightly set my
forehead I don't like setting my
forehead too much whatever is left on
the brush or I'm sorry the sponge I just
you know tapped the remaining just so
I'm not oily and then I'm just like
trying to hit these areas too cuz
sometimes I get a little oily in these
area norms first I'm gonna use my Jaclyn
help ally just because I have been
loving this palette lately I feel like
it gives me a lot of ideas but I feel
like I also go for the same ones I'm not
so this shade is called pukey now I feel
like I need to put some brown in here
this Brown right here and kind of like
put it in my crease
you've got to live
so I'm gonna kind of do like the halo
eye with this so kind of like focus that
same brown like on the inner part of the
eye and on the outer part of your eyes
I'm using to do this is the morphe 506
brush I'm going to take pukey again and
kind of start blowing my eye out at the
bottom
I'm trying to see what color I would
like to put in the center
so I'm gonna keep the theme that I was
gonna go for something grungy I'm gonna
use my cold pencil to pretty much
or my smolder pencil to get this base
that I want which is just a super dark
base I was gonna put glitter but then I
couldn't find my glitter glue the
typical tossing on that problems when
she does a tutorial she could never keep
up with
so I find that looking down when you're
trying to get you like an oval shape
with your eye look helps a lot and you
can also like look up or like yeah look
up like this and they'll help you find
the shape of your eye that's how I start
learning how to place my shadows where I
needed to where I needed to place them
looking down to make sure I set it where
I need to set it
all right so now that that is popping
I'm gonna just do a neutral lip you guys
know that that's my thing
but your luck
magic
naturally transformed on my lips what I
need to do is just add a little bit more
line there like on the outer parts just
all won't look too crazy
I'm gonna add some gloss on top my
favorite gloss is acute aureus weaker
and minty shine gloss and I'm gonna
pretty much kind of like focus it in the
center put a beauty put a beauty lashes
I'm gonna put a little bit mascara
before I pop these on I just wanted to
show you guys how they look there's a
number 8 so once again
but your luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
