have another wig from RPG hair company
the information about this unit this is
a body well this is a 360 based wig body
wave Indian grooming hair its natural
color 18 inches 150 percent density 360
units medium capsize and yes so they
actually have a sailboat on free
shipping worldwide or any order for
exchange and easy return and they have
some deals going on so definitely check
them out I have a coupon code that you
can use it's TW ten I will list that in
the description box below as well you
save you can only use that code if you
might have your purchase at a hundred
dollars so yeah so that information will
be listed in the description box below
but I'm going to give you guys the back
information on how I feel
enough is here so let's make sure I'm
gonna look look no lipstick nothing so
yeah okay so received these wigs from
this company almost like a month ago
girl but the dilemma about the units
were um I wanted to I wanted to like do
a color on them or I either wanted to
dye them black and I did not want to
dive in black so if you have seen the
previous video for RPG hair it will be
in the description box below
I actually had a short bob from this
company I really wasn't selling on that
it was a also it was also a yaki and I
really felt like I was going to struggle
with that texture but in the video you
see how well the hair flatters curls
straightens whatever you want to say and
I love the textures father is is a video
just because I felt like it was more
natural was mimicking a little bit more
of like african-american females hair
and it wasn't really silky straight or
babydoll ish or Chinese like plastic
type of hair so that it kind of fail so
I was really
cool about that so you've seen that in a
previous video because I spoke about
that but I end up falling in love with
the fill of it at the end of the video I
just wear that unit but it's very like
sporadic due to the bag that you know
I'm kind of really really short and I
did not want it as short as I cut it but
it came out that way because your girl
just thought that she was a masters
using this tiny little mirror that was
sitting right here and I was cutting the
BOP in that mirror in that mirror for
you guys versus just putting it on the
dome head and cutting it out of what was
going on with me that day but I did that
with that previous unit but about this
unit so I did not come this color as you
heard it's a natural color actually and
that means it's just like a natural
brown kind of vibe so all the actual
natural color is like floating somewhere
back here but what I wanted to do with
it was just add some low light
highlights and also I just add some
character to the unit once again this is
a 360 unit and it fits me pretty snug
I'm really really pleased with how it's
fitting me I did reach the knob on this
unit and I did let the pair a couple of
times just so I didn't get any like
gentleness going on with the hair now if
I had to rate this hair quality I would
rate it more so on a scale from a scale
one through ten our braid this hair a
six the reason why I say that is because
I do see a lot of flyways in this unit
I've tried to straighten this unit
almost straight and I feel like it won't
revert back to my a bone bone straight
kind of texture it's very weird so I
have to keep this unit somewhat curls
for it to look you know decent I will
show you a clip of I might show you the
clip of me in a club and I've
straightened the hair before and it kind
of got a little poofy throughout the
club Bob so I don't know if it was
because I kind of rushed that string job
because
was running late I still tried to row my
flat iron druid a couple of days you
know after that situation just to see if
it would just get bone straight and I
find it really hard for this hair to get
in bone strength so it does pull the
curl as you can see I curl this hair I
don't know how long does curl will last
but I did curl the hair and as you can
see it does look really really nice the
hair is it dry but I have to use these
chin fusion drops just to add to my life
to the hair a little bit before I go in
and you know straighten it or curl it I
do feel like it did have some been in
you know towards the bottom but you know
you get what you get and I got what I
got sorely has no my experience with
this company RPG hair company
I'm abrasive maybe like a 7 out of a 10
just because like if you get a bomb
excellent from them you're going to bomb
a speck from them but if you get
something that you're really not still
in then it can it may be a problem I
would tell you guys just to look to see
if you see anything that you know floats
your boat on their website and if don't
like how it looks or if you don't like
how you know it looks on you after
purchasing it I will always suggest you
guys do the return foreign-policy with
this company just because you don't want
to lose out on you know your money
clearly
so yeah just do not cut the legs off of
your unit just because that can be a
problem you don't want any hassle when
it comes to returning something that you
don't want from any company dealing with
a wig or a frontal you or your closure
you do not want to cut the legs off and
tell them that you want to return it you
don't want to go in and diet do some
lowlights highlight ceviche do whatever
you you know want to do with the hair
and then figure out that you don't like
the hair once again I write this
six out of the ten due to me having to
trim the hair a little bit add the chia
seeds and drops which I don't feel like
I should have to do that all the time
and I feel like I do the hair color I
didn't list it to anything dramatic so
I'm not expecting the flyaways that I do
see certain days and the straightening
process I would love to wear this hair
straightened but if it's strand and it
gets poofy on me I do not do that at all
and I wish I didn't strain it the night
I went out just because the hair color
is so so nice that I created for this
unit but I just cannot wear it straight
I would rather wear this hair it is like
natural pattern anyway when you co wash
it and add some Aussie shampoo or
conditioner and you don't revamp it and
stuff like that is beautiful but I don't
know if it was because I put a little
bit more heat on the units and I
probably normally would because I wanted
to you know straighten it those times
that I didn't want to strain but so I'm
not expecting that from any unit but
once again this is like remy hair so I'm
not expecting my amazing quality but I'm
expecting it to be working for the
average girl you going on saying so you
definitely have to take your chances
with this company check out their review
section you know but if you work with
this company before let me know in the
description box know the comment section
below because I would love to hear you
guys experience with it you know let me
know if you work with this in become a
section below once again check out the
description box below may have you know
a couple of discounts going on and check
out their websites as they are having a
sale going oh and I think it lasts until
the 20th or it starts at the 20th of
August so I love you baby I will see you
soon and I'm going to start on this
favorite video of mine so I'll see you
in my next one hi babies on so let's
take this braid down I'm going to rub up
brush through the hair if you guys are
interested in this makeup look it will
be live on my channel really soon I just
have to finish editing it editing it you
know
yes King bud Singh slicing
childish but anyway so I'm just wanting
to brush the hair out now and add some
Chi infusion drops just to add some
moisture into the hair and definitely
focus it on the ends just because I feel
like the ends means a lot of lovin okay
it means a lot of lovin but yeah so I'm
going to go in with my little
professional Warren curlers it actually
comes with four different one curler
barrels but I actually am using the
medium one so I have to try the other
ones out I just haven't had the time to
but yeah I'm just going to make sure all
the hair is flat onto the barrel I'm not
going to no chunk up the hair and make
it really like oily so this is just
going to give you like a beachy
effortless waves
I'm going to alternate the curl so one
curl is going to go back the other curl
is going to go forward so you can do
that if you would like but I'm doing
that right now so I just want to explain
to you guys what I'm doing just because
I know some people have no clue how to
even curl here and I find that really
crazy sometimes but you know everybody's
just not good with hair you know so
that's why I'm here to share it know
what I'm doing so yeah so that's pretty
much all I'm going to do in this video
I'm also going to run my fingers bizarre
hair just to break up the curls
Oh
Oh
in
Oh
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
