and I've been so sick lately so I miss
you guys so pretty much I've been dying
literally okay when I say dying dying
but today don't mind this hair headscarf
I'm doing a wig review for you I'm gonna
wig review for you guys that's why I
have this dark one because I didn't feel
like diddle in my hair underneath it my
hair is in two french braids and it's
the perfect time to be reviewing a wig
because I don't feel like doing anything
I mean anything through my hair you feel
me so romanza pops it's a wig on some
honey beauty hair this is how the wig
looks if you guys are wondering I
haven't touched it yet even though this
is so overdue but payment this bag right
here was a little bit of description
about the wig which is a Brazilian body
weighs on 22 inch lace full lace wig I
love it so late everybody be saying
stuff is full-length but it really don't
be able I'll figure that out in a second
but this is how the Box looks and you
just pin that and inside it had dumb
caps and eyelashes for me so thanks
honey Beauty pizzette for the record I'm
going to see if this is a full waist
wings and it's not once again fullest
means this lace right here is full over
the wig it's not any of this in size for
Lili we put the wig or you want to go
well let me show you guys the cones
really quick it has four cones two on
each side one in the middle and one in
the back in the middle and you have
drawstrings of course you can snug on
them and pull them to each side so keep
it really snug on you it has the baby
hairs on this unit and a little bit of
lace for me to cut off and I'm going to
just try the weight room with the
weights on and then we'll worry about
cutting it off and later well I don't
want to run my fingers through it until
I actually put it on because I don't
know how I'm going to be styling this
hair I don't know if I'm gonna be
cutting layered into it but I am going
out because I'm finally not sick anymore
as I do when I do something with this
way for tonight for me and my baby
night out because you've been literally
watching me die as well and yeah so
let's pop this wig one and I'll be ready
unit once again I'm looking in this
another tiny mirror and I'm going to
figure out how I'm going to be able to
finesse this for you guys so so far
flipsie like over my fingers too right
yes I surely can't the hair is really
soft I can definitely tell you guys back
the install looks dead and I think this
is a really cute unit if it's really
snug on me by the way
there you go so this is how this unit
looks hair is falling pretty much to my
red and I think it's cute so far so good
can't complain I have a few ways to
review for you guys so you're going to
be seeing a few way reviews on my
channel
coming previous I mean coming soon let
me tell you all throughout they're a bit
sick I'm missing every time I was not
other day that's my stuff check out my
face still better chill able to run away
but sneakers real good mocking oh my
gosh
alright okay so I'm going to go along
the hot I'm going to do my hair tonight
I'll worry about the late in the second
but because this is the way you pretty
much get away with it I'm not gonna lay
this hair down really quick but I'm
going to be wearing it down tonight
because I really like it like this I
just looked at it in the mirror
so alright I'm going to be using this
freezing hairspray too long graphics Tim
X holding spray you guys know about this
if you watch my videos
use this a couple of times to lay my
lace frontals down so what I'm going to
do is just spray on the lace and not
really press it down because they have
to kind of get tacky and I don't want to
put it on my actual hair as much as I
want to do with the lace so it's kind of
why I'm not really focusing it on my
hair if I'm looking crazy because this
is color though between all of this
right see yes both get it honey
mm oh I can't well Moses
all right baby lasso as you can see this
unis poppin I don't have to do anything
to the hairline okay I don't even have
to curl it I mean that's a solid I don't
have to layer it this is a sleigh so you
can see this this I am still in it I
went to the bathroom and I was like oh
hold on I'm not going to halfway up
halfway down I'm wearing it just like
this so I just flipped it over and
called it a day
cuts my hair behind my ear and then
close it a day so I also guys enjoy this
video this is definitely this way it's
definitely for the girl that doesn't
want to do anything are there with cut
the bleep off sprays the hold of spray
down on the lay so I can not you know
move around or whatever but because you
guys have to close and the love jaw
strength and whatever you don't even
have to do that step but I always do
that exercise just because I like how I
feel for me it just feels a little bit
more secure you're not you know just the
type some possible no I need users but
I'm going to go and take some medicine
because I don't want to start feeling
that tonight whole time is it nine oh it
is it is do I don't know I love you guys
so much all the information will be
within the description box below but I
have to take this on as an opposed
because I will die if I don't love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
