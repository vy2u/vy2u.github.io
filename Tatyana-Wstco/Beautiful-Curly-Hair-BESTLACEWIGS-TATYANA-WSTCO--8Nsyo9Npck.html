shots and tell you we just follow when I
say this hair is so perfect it is so
perfect I freaking love it
and guess what guess what guess what
it's a frigging wig like it is a way
like act like you guys always ask me
about good curly hair and this hair is
amazing so he's on the hair this hair
this wig I'm so used to saying hair this
wig is from best lace wigs the style
number that I got was GSW 146 color I
think this says NC and lifts 18 inches
but like I said I went ahead and just
like start cutting everywhere on the
around the front of the hair and I
actually did do some trimming at the
ends but yeah with curly hair I really
don't care long as it's not too short
now as it comes too short then it might
be a problem but I didn't have that
problem at all I was 18 inch of course I
didn't come like this when it was
packaged but you can tell it was a curly
way it wasn't anything nappy knotted and
um anything it came packaged in a nice
little box opening you get the way the
wigs in the net you get the instructions
for the way and choose whether you want
a light to medium to dark stocking cap I
believe that's how it is I'm going to go
their instructions and after I explain
to you guys what I did to my hair and I
suggest you guys follow every um
instruction that is on this piece of
card quality of this hair is so
beautiful it looks so natural it doesn't
look like a wig at all if you want to do
some extra tweezing on the front it's a
lace wig or tweezing to the front to
make it look more natural to fit your
hairline you can't do that what I did
when I receive
the hair have braided it up put the
stocking the brown stocking cap over
eight and place the wig when I start
trimming my hair with was that you can
use a razor this is an eyebrow razor but
so what I did was just basically picked
up the hair just start breaking the hair
and going downwards um you don't have to
use this and they have hair if you come
tools that basically is the same thing
as this but this is only another at the
beauty supply store and I already had in
my bathroom so I went ahead and used it
um but yeah so I went ahead and put some
layers in the front and of course today
the wig is going to come with the lace
on the front so you can adjust it and um
make it fit your hairline when you wear
so that's pretty awesome and the lace
one about this wives on it so you can do
whatever on it so you just don't make
mistake I think you can do parting from
at least here to here the rest is just
the way but the wig is constructed so
well that I don't mind as a part of the
party for the lace is from here to here
but I go all the way around so use water
before you try to brush the tank so I
put the water on there and I went ahead
and use my favorite conditioner right
now the Tresemme moisture conditioner I
love this up I use this for my natural
hair my weaves my ways now and it works
wonders as you can see the curl pattern
is amazing is super natural
this is the person I used to rake
through the hair when it was away and
then I just left it alone I'm sure their
hair can get way more bigger than this
but I just went ahead and just parted on
the side and this is how I like wearing
it for right now absolutely don't even
feel like I have a wig on like the
construction of this wig is so amazing
and legs so flat on my head it's so
freakin awesome best place waves to dip
that you wash the hair twice a week with
warm water or cold water I suggest warm
water bring a mixture of water and
conditioner on the hair and brush the
hair from the bottom up here because
it's called less shedding less shedding
that is the key you must gradually wet
the hair down and brush
gently before you completely wash the
hair if the hair is very dry and a lot
of the waters added on to it at once the
hair will swell up like a sponge and
tango therefore it is important to
gradually wet the hair and brush it I
use a water bottle first put a mixture
of the conditioner in the water bottle
sprints it on the hair and start to
tangle in from bottom up make sure you
brush the hair daily applies and
leave-in conditioner so the hair will be
soft and moist and good leave-in hair
treatment can help the hair from drying
but remember do not put too much
otherwise this will build up and make
your health hair feel heavy I would not
put any products in this hair this hair
pattern is way too beautiful
just cut the hair if the hair looks like
it's not giving you so much light as I
just put like maybe like two sorts of
conditioner
a water bottle and sprays on it but some
break on I think I'm just using my hand
and call me right so you see how
beautiful this looks and this is just
with water in a small amount of this but
when I say this hair was even beautiful
before I click the conditioner and there
I just went ahead and use it
just to give them just like I said just
adding a little bit more moisture in
there but I wouldn't actually go ahead
and go and put like a like an actual
chrome cream for the hair I want to
stretch the hair and here's about right
here to me right now so you get an
18-inch way the last the longest layer
that I made sure it was still like
underneath they reach the bottom muscle
underneath my throat that's how long is
it for me and then I just went ahead and
just start cutting heavy language with
curly hair for the breathing okay how
amazing that looks we just turn to the
side for you guys were you looking for
you go look at it
yes pay your okay so make a couple of
big braids when you're going to sleep
swim or exercise please untangle the
hair before making the braids never
sleep on wet hair to let you know how
you can make your own conditioner they
fill it up at it should be 90% water
temper stayed on conditioner and that's
how you make your own leave-in
conditioner apply the mixture lightly
onto the hair and brush the hair from
ends to the top near the scalp I agree
with everything that they said um I
suggest you use the actual arm cap that
they give you for the way just so you
won't have like that light lace color
and you won't have to bleach it because
the actual colors come in
in your desired color it comes in light
brown or it comes in
medium brown or dark I always skeptical
because the pair pattern wasn't so curly
but when I added that water look look
what it it I was like ah try some more
textures for you ladies if you guys are
not fans of the curly but this way this
company will make you a fan of the curly
you'll put this cream or you use much
has let you ladies know like this is a
must-have I wanna see if I can already
eyes yeah things like that yeah I will
try to see if I can get a cold or y'all
to you if I don't already have one
oh I love you guys thank you for
supporting many did you love you guys I
appreciate all of you thank you so much
oh and if you guys want to know my nail
color is called warrior we just NC is
that it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
