still in the process of like learning
how to deal with frontal trust and
believe me because it ain't that easy
look at these got me some more flexi
rods and I'm gonna be using these soon I
have I've been waiting to get like I
never worked with these sized flexi rods
definitely need to get into this
I used to use flexi rods all the time
back in the day but I stopped using it
but in my other be shot video that I
have green hair in and that was that was
body weight hair yeah I was on the same
infection but that straight year video
I'll put it below I worked with flexi
rods again in that video and it could
have it turned out a little bit but I
was just being half as in Louisiana same
time an open 24 inch in past their store
code I mean that store name and the
lengths on the hair around here so
that's really good and freakin amazing
how like soft their hair always is guys

to a full color but I don't know like I
really want in for that like I'm really
feeling the black sleek look but we're
gonna put some colors in there and I
don't know what color yet I'm thinking
about blue yeah so this is another 24
inch it matches the same luster as the
other one and all of this hair so
freakin pretty no bad smell at all
