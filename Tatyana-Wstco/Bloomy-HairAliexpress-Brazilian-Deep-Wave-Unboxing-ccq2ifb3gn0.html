another unboxing video / first
impressions for a hair company by the
name of gloomy hair this is an
Aliexpress hair company so all their
direct links will be listed in the
description box below plus the exact
links to my hair that I received will be
in the description box below as well it
took maybe 3 to 5 business days for it
to get to my house which is usually how
long it takes for virgin hair to get to
your home and I believe that's all I
wanted to let you guys know oh like the
communication with bloomin hair was
really well and they let me know that
the hair was getting shipped out and my
tracking information and all that good
stuff so yeah so let me go ahead with
the boxing part and I received 3 bundles
in the front so I believe and like I
said I have not opened this at all so
let's see if this is some good deep wave
Brazilian beef wave from bloomin it says
plastic wrap and it has their store name
their email and other places that you
can find them on like Facebook and
Instagram and let me just
put some flexi rods in here for me so
thank you I think I'm actually gonna
start using flexi rods again because
I've been putting a lot of heat on my
version here and flexi rods do the job
as well and I have a lot about old
videos of me using flexi rods so you
could check those previous videos out or
mock flexi rods versus pin curls or
something like that video in the
description box below I'm back in the
day I used to love the love-love-love
flexi rods but I have to get back in to
just taking the time and actually Lexie
rotting my hair at night because
sleeping off flexi rods the best for you
bones
seriously and you're freaking curls last
forever so this is Brazilian beef weight
like I told you guys and I have a 14 a
16 and 18 by 12 inch frontal all of the
hands that I receive let me open the 18
has the type of here that you receive
plus the lid at the bottom like right
here so yeah so that's good know what
we're working with
I hate when we're taking air companies
do not put the Mint's or the type of
hair on the on the UM oh my god super
soft guys like Wow Wow
front of your fingers right through this
the ends are really pretty on this hair
you know that ends and this is how much
hair that you get in a 16 inch bundle
from bloomie hair so yeah I love half
softness freaking hair it's like I can
roll my fingers is the sixteen so I'm
going to be showing you guys
next the 16 has this much hair in it and
the right through really pretty this one
doesn't have a bad smoke either
pretty ends and of course I'm going to
do my water method of just putting water
on the hair and trying to see if he
reverts back to its curl pattern or
whatever so I'll be doing that soon
before I get off the camera so these
this is the 18 and this is the 16 the 18
of course has less hair than the 16
that's usually how it works
so yeah the longer the length the less
hair that you receive on your bundles
the shorter the lid the more hair that
you receive on your bundles I feel like
I say that every time I do unboxing
video so this is the 14 really pretty
also run my fingers are right through
this so I'm really happy with this I
don't even want to wash it because it's
just so beautiful so these are all of
the bundles that I received 14 16 18 so
yeah that's how it works this is the
deep wave photo it has a net over the
front so let's see if I can so this is
how the deep waves frontal books so I'm
going to also watch the frontal just
because they store front wheels
differently just on the hair can be you
know really nice once you get it so I'm
gonna wash all these bundles with just
water and no shampoo and no conditioner
and then I'm going to come back and show
you guys my reasons so the hair got
extremely like softer after I put water
in it so this is how pretty the deep
wave is from blooming hair really
freaking pretty so this is the 18 this
is the 16 and then this is the 14th as
you can see the exact same pattern the
exact same bluster the ends have guy
even more beautiful and then look at how
fabulous this freakin front soil is I
think this is the best body wave frontal
I've ever received like the texture
matches the same with the bundles look
at that freaking beautiful when you
order from this hair company I think you
would freaking amazing no bad smell at
all
it was so easy I didn't even use a comb
just use my fingers I didn't get one
strand from my bundles at all but just
how be frontal was stored I just had to
pull apart a little bit more and that's
where I got the shedding from but other
than that I could run my fingers
straight through this baby I'm going to
let it air dry and all that good stuff
and I'm going to create me a wig of
course and yeah so I'll see you guys in
my next video don't forget to check how
bloomie hair they're an ally expressive
in there like I told you guys make sure
you check them out and I'll see you guys
in my next video or my installation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
