another video I don't know if you
familiar with this hair but I actually
had it on my channel a while back girl
and I decided to bring it out the
woodwork so it's a oldie but a goodie
this is Eunice Peruvian straight hair in
four bundles 28 inch and a 20 inch
matching frontal now this hair has been
holding up so great today I decided that
I wanted touched her in it for you guys
and that's pretty much it so you will be
seeing me do this process the hair has
been holding up really really great I
can't complain about it at all I
bleached his hair all that jazz and I
dyed it to this cherry blossom kind of
red vibe and I will leave all that
information in the description box below
because I created this wig like a while
back and I don't remember the exact
colors I know that they were adored dyes
that I use but I'm not sure the colors
so it will be listed in the description
box below definitely check out units
hair if you're looking for some straight
bundles but I will be talking to you
guys towards the end of the video I just
wanted to pretty much say what is a baby
boo
what you see is the worst methods of
policing are happening in communities
that are target's alright stop
undeniable that this hair is poppin and
of course this flatiron has done what
it's supposed to do
perfect density I won't have to go over
to see how many bundles I actually
received from his hair company I'll do
that before the end of this video
yeah overall I was definitely raped
units hair a 10 out of a 10 I cannot
hate I can't give it a con just because
I did customizes color myself I will be
lying if I told you I remembered the
actual hair dyes that I used but I'm
sure I mentioned it in the previous
video so once again it will be listed in
the description box this is how a bomb
this hair is so I will give you all that
information for no reason because this
was Peruvian straight hair so the fact
that their straight hair actually holds
an amazing curl and it strains this you
know amazing no wonder why it's
straightening like god has to touch this
hair but if you see me with virgin hair
nine times out of ten it's a unit that I
made for myself so I'm able to take it
off put it on top of a mannequin head
and keep it pushing I don't have to
usually restyle or restrain or revamp my
wigs unless you know it's been a long
night a long day and I throw my wigs
across the room I can definitely give
this hair company a 10 out of a 10
because of how amazing the hair holds
the curl and this is straight hair
usually with straight hair your curls
don't last as long as body waves loose
wave just because it already doesn't
have a you know texture to it you have
four bundles of 28 and a 20 inch frontal
so if you're looking for some straight
bundles check out unis but I love you
baby so much I hope you enjoyed the
video thank you so much don't forget to
thumbs up comment subscribe share all
the information to units will be listed
in the description box below and of
course if you're interested in this
amazing Flatiron because I couldn't do
it without this little hot tool right
here this will be listed in the
description box below
it's the Nano baby bliss Pro my iron I
spent one hundred and fifty dollars on a
flat iron like I was looking at myself
like really do you really want to do
this but it was a great purchase as you
can see so yeah babes I love you and I
will see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
