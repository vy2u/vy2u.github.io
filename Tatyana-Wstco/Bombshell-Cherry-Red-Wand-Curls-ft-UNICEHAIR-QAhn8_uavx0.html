another video I'm going to be showing
you guys how to create these beautiful
long curls on my units Peruvian straight
hair I really really love this hair so I
can't wait to give you guys some
information but we're just going to talk
about this warrant curl process really
quick so this is actually a tool from
tho professionals actually came with
three barrels and this is the medium
barrel it's really really nice due to it
not going into like a tip towards the
end so it's really easy to fit all of
this long length on this barrel and keep
it in a you know uniform curl and it's
not getting one key on me you don't have
other ones go into like a tip and it
gets like all awkward at the end so I
really do like that and it heats up to
425 degrees so it's really really hot
and please be careful when you're doing
this because you can burn yourself I
burn myself so many times doing this
video but you know I'm a genius so I can
get through it
everybody anyway just be careful like I
said and what I want to tell you guys
about the walkers okay so I curled them
towards my face not away from my face
towards them and I kept every single
curl towards my face so just remember
that if you're trying to get the same
style as me and I also added some layers
into this head in the front just to
frame my face a little bit but I kept
the lips throughout the whole you know
unit that I made for myself so yeah so
about units hair I had this hair for
almost like a month or so and I made a
unit for myself I do have four bundles
and a frontal in from this hair company
I haven't breached the not yet but I did
go in and tweeze it a little bit and I
really plan on bleaching them out
actually tonight just because I feel
like it will be a little bit more
natural-looking and appealing to the eye
when you start parting it and stuff like
that this parting area was really dull
right here but the middle part is
actually really cute what I did was just
add some of my foundation powder
underneath the front saw so you know it
can looks nice right now but I haven't
went in and bleached the knots and once
again
I have a video on how to do that on my
channels I will link it below if you
guys are interested to see that or you
can do your own research if you want to
care because this hair did not come this
color I actually did the custom cover
myself that video will be listed in the
description box below if you guys are
interested to see how I got this color
it's hard at all it's very very easy so
I also want to let you guys know that I
rate this hair a nun of ten in the only
reason why I say it not out of
10 is because I haven't had the hair
long enough to really give it a 10 out
of 10 but it's really holding up great
I'm not receiving any shedding and he's
tangling and mean aping at the back of
my neck that I hold a really nice curl
and then had to put any hairspray or any
serums onto the hair to achieve this
look it makes me so happy and these
curls are actually still in the hair and
it's been almost a week and this videos
oh this voice over is new but at the
same time it is what it is you know we
got to get it done we got to get it done
but anyway units hair will be linked in
the description box below if you guys
have any other questions of course you
guys know to sound off in the comments
section below because I would love to
answer anything that you guys may have
to say or actually about units hair also
let me know your experience with units
hair if you ever work with this company
before I actually had their body waves
but I really wasn't feeling their body
wave as much as I was feeling their
straight hair so keep that in mind I
love you baby loves and I would love to
see you guys in my next video thank you
so much for your support your converse
and you know that makes me so happy I
love you bye

feel don't go to my quotes happy wedding
