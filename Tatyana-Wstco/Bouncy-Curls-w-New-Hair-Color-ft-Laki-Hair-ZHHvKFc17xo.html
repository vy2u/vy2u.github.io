going to be showing you guys how I got
this look with my wacky hair my key hair
is in Aliexpress hair company their
information will be linked in the
description box below if you guys are
interested to purchase from this hair
company so far the hair is doing great
has his hair for almost like a month or
two and I decided that I wanted to color
it like what a couple of days ago so
this is what I decided to go with and
these two color dyes that I use was
adore clover and adore indigo blue I
will list it in the description box
below as well if you guys are interested
to get the same look I lifted it to
maybe a honey blonde and I just mixed
the dyes together but I made sure that
certain pieces were just green and
certain pieces was more so on the indigo
blue side so yeah but the back
information about the hair so far so
good the hair is really soft
during the bleaching and dyeing process
I just let the hair air dry after I
shampoo and condition it and it just
made the hair really healthy I will list
the products that I use for shampoo and
condition in the hair and the
description box below as well but if you
guys will open that is the Aussie
shampoo and conditioner the Osby moist
shampoo and conditioner so that leaves
me hair really really nice and you can
always like go to Walgreens and get the
Copeland shampoo and conditioner if
you're trying to revamp any hair that
you may have because that conditioner is
amazing and it just has a great great
amount of nutrients in that product to
revamp your hair and make it look like
its brand new I'm trying to be any
shedding or tangling or nay pink at all
as you can see I'm getting closer now so
I can show you guys that and the ends
are really really nice I don't have to
cut anything on this is a 360 front so
from this company and I do have 3
bundles of their Brazilian body waves
and the limp is 22 inches so the exact
links will be listed in the description
box below if you guys want to purchases
hair so what I was doing today was just
basically using my accounting year
curling iron just the curly hair cord
and I pretty much alternated the curls
so some curls are going backwards summer
corn sports I wanted to do a funky bang
with this hair
so I made sure that it was like really
super big so you don't have to do that
if you don't want to I'm just trying to
do something different because I was
tired of the like same thing that I
usually do when it comes to curling hair
so if you work with lacking hair please

sure others will want to hear your
experience with this hair company as
