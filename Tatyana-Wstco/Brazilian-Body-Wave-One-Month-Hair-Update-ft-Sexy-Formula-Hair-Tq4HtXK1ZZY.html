share with you guys I got some hair from
a hair company by the name of sexy
formula hair unboxing first impressions
for this hair company I have not opened
it up Oh back to here yesterday it took
about three to five business days this
is how the hair can so this is the three
bundles that I received they have their
hair length hair and fell on like around
here so this is 20 to 24 and 8 24 22
inch so wow pretty guys saw that
indeed no guys smell so I can run my
fingers right through it really pretty
that's wave black mph in both of the 24
is now so the 24 inch this is how much
hair is in the 24 inch and this is how
much hair is in the 22 inch so a little
smidge of a difference the tweets for
has less hair at the 22 has a little bit
more here so this is really pretty too
this is the 24 inch I put my fingers
right through that and fast slow fast no
tangles no nothing the ends of this hair
is really pretty no bad smell with the
24 inch either and they both look like
they're the same but they're so that's
this oh pretty come rub my fingers right
through this one awesome no bad smell so
let me show you guys all of them now so
really pretty right somebody since the
16 inch front saw something and it look
how pretty
beautiful so they're 60 inch frontal
miss so if I put on this hair in a
ponytail that's how thick my ponytail
will be all they've got right links will
be listed in the description box below
so you can check that out honey bunnies
let's see how the hair turned out so
does it look like a wave to you guys
it's really popping here
don't let this camera in this life fool
you in person this Heron is beautiful
hopefully is turning up as beautiful and
silky and like natural looking on camera
but I'm in love with this freaking here
hey babies I'm back like I promised and
let me tell you guys how I felt about
sexy formula hair popping like this hair
is so freakin soft so silky and
beautiful
I created a wig for myself I don't get
any shedding tingling or Nathan at the
back of my neck at all I work with the
hair company because of their reviews
and their common and some of the girls
even rocked sexy formula hair and went
back to sexy formula hair so I was
really pleased to hear that so I just
wanted to give you guys my opinion if
you were wondering or interested
definitely check them out this is an
Aliexpress hair company so I have
nothing but positive things to say about
sexy form of the hair let me know if you
rock sexy formulas hair before or if you
know somebody that did and please write
how you felt about it below when you are
purchasing burden here you need to make
sure you're getting your money's worth
definitely do the water test on all
virgin hair so that means like when you
get it take it out from this plastic and
then run it underneath water the hair is
giving you like something that you don't
think it should be giving definitely
contact them and let them know that
you're about to shampoo a condition this
hair this shampoo and conditioner that's
sulfate free that's the shampoo
conditioner that I use sulfate free
shampoo and conditioner eliminates
anything else that can go possibly wrong
with the air leave the conditioner in
there for 30 minutes that should leave
what I do then I'll rinse it out and
I'll let it air dry now if it's still
bad call them all money back
like oh oh sit and just wait for a
miracle to happen and it's gonna change
it's not gonna change if virgin hair is
bad virgin hair is bad and it probably
means that it's not virgin hair it
probably has something synthetic up in
there you don't deserve that cuz you
spit your money on that I just want you
guys to get your money's worth but of
course I don't have that problem with
this hair I'm just letting you guys know
some things that you can do with virgin
hair before installing it in receiving
something that you didn't want you know
don't install anything that you're not
sure of do the water test and then do
the deep conditioner test and then if
you don't have good hair then you need
to just go ahead and send that back you
need somebody that knows what they're
doing to install virgin hair if you cut
your weft is going to cost if
you overlap your weft it won't
if you sell your webs it definitely
won't I don't sell my West but I'm do
not cutting my webs so no shedding
happens so keep that in mind like if
you're getting an installation by
somebody that doesn't know what they're
doing it can be the worst thing that you
can ever do in life just like you
shouldn't receive anybody matting or
nape enough at the back of your neck
that's how you know that it's bad hair
if you can't go outside and for like
five minutes without combing your hair
it's not good hair so if that's what you
should know so I try to give you a few
tips before I get off with this video
but my camera is about to die now so
I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
