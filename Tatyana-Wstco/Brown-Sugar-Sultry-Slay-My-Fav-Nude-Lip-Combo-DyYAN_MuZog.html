everyone loves I am back with another
video pushing them out pushing them out
I read the comments and you're like
don't leave me ever again and no not
2018
I'm not leaving anybody has 2018 except
for dusty-ass activity I am excited
because I bought some new glitters and I
feel like I want to do a glitter look
today and it's kind of gonna be based
off the last letter look that I did with
the orange vibe so you guys can see the
technique that I did but I still will
record the orange these three are the
new glitters that I got and they're so
freakin pretty there's a brown one a
like a like cool gold one but it has
like green orange and yellow reflex and
then I have this like champagne gold one
as well you guys know I love using this
to make sure my shadows are really
vibrant and then like and then what I
like doing is setting this with a like a
shadow that matches it or a white shadow
circular kind of situation today because
I don't want this look all
I'm gonna put it high because I want to
make sure my transition colors are
poppin and all that you know so I'm
pretty much gonna take this up to my
brow bone and pretty much like in the
inner part of my eye what I'm just not
gonna focus on is bringing it all the
way out here and I still a lot of
concealer and do my brows I just try to
put a little bit of product in my brows
so I can know what kind of direction I'm
going for with my brow shape today um I
want to do this Janet Jackson inspired
makeup look like this look she has on
her Instagram it's really really pretty
and I don't really do like champagne
colors on the lid like that like shimmer
champagne colors a little lid and that's
kind of the look that she has but it's
really cute so I think I'm gonna do that
really soon off any excess and then just
use these two colors to set that paint
pot so when I apply my shadows if they
move around up so when I go to blend out
my other shadows everything is going to
be nice and seamless blending brush this
is a smaller blending brush this is the
morphe 504 brush and I'm going to take
this shade suede and I'm going to do
circular motions just so I can see where
I'm going to be placing my shadows how I
want my transition color to be because
this is a super light shade I don't
really have to worry about being really
neat so I'm gonna do one eye and the
other eye off my camera but I'm gonna
still do this transition cover over here
on this side this year for Halloween I'm
definitely going to slay so I'm gonna be
practicing all kinds of drama look
like this Tarte Pro palette and I'm
gonna take the shade bold and do this
the same thing this color has a little
bit more color to it
so I'm going to pretty much place it in
this same area
it just has a different undertone that
undertone is a little richer in color so
it's showing up with my skin a little
bit more well it's just showing up and
it's showing up a little bit more
alright so now I'm gonna take
nunna from the magic palette is ooh a
ball your way evolved however you
pronounce this what do you guys try to
come from me and the description box
well laughs that means because I was
saying this wrong well you guys should
be a brand ambassador for this company
how to pronounce stuff you know I'm
saying maybe you should all get a coin
disable from this lorac Pro palette and
as you can see I'm using this honey
go ahead
clean out the center of my lid so I can
start pecking on this brown shading them
so what I'm gonna do is grab this brown
right here this oak from the kat von d
palette sit right in the center poor
edgy from this hard palate smoke
all right so now the brothers leaky it's
a very tedious process so everything can
look pop in or whatever
same brush
jake has a rock in the night glitter and
gingerbread sugar
there you go to the process I'm gonna
use my la girl Pro concealer today cool
tan color correct and concealer today I
don't know why I just feel like I'm in
the mood to use some color correct and
conceal it I didn't pride it's cool
so now I'm going to use my a BH
foundation
go back over with my concealer just so
any harsh lines from my concealer around
the noses of the banner or any like any
harsh lines around my contour area all
right so now foundation you guys know I
will be using my favorite which we are
going to go back in a little bit with
this any product left over bring down
our contour a little bit more
is take mother take my other powders and
sit around my face I do have combination
skin so I do have to set my face no
matter what or it's just gonna look
crazy so I'll kind of like going over
this area and then letting the rest melt
into my skin or I'll come back to it
later this is just so there's no like
extra nice going on I'm going to take
this statement but not flat powder just
to kind of like warm my skin up a little
bit more
these lester drops sephora and in this
area and this is just gonna help me get
natural highlight to use tap it out
spray it a little bit of fixer plus on
my face sure but I broke the goal that
was in here but I did it in here
down the bridge a little bit on my chin
alright I'm gonna go here would
naturally transform and the sinner
and I'm gonna take kleancolor six to 27
none let's take NYX butter gloss my
friend laughed at me one day I did this
she was like did you really put like
seven my glasses on

outline Oh
