maybe some hair that I received from my
hair companies by the name of sexy hair
company and I decided just to go ahead
with this review because you guys always
asked me about 4 to 1 hair and what
companies do I feel that you should
purchase so I did my research for this
company and emisn Aliexpress company we
all know how the Express has it bad ribs
cut spindles on there and give you trash
eating nesting hair but not everyone
does so like I said I'm did more
research and sexy hair had positive
reviews great quality hair and I heard
that every person that decided to
purchase from them for us basically
satisfied so I decided to go ahead and
get some bundles from them and I decided
to get a frontal this time so we're
going to jump right in on how these
bundles look before installing them how
it comes fresh off the pack fresh off
the box that you'll be receiving the
hair in haven't touched the hair also
you guys will be getting my first
impressions on the hair how I feel about
the smell of the texture and all of that
so I'm going to show you guys the 20
inch plugs that I receive from them it
comes like this it has their second hair
ribbon on there on the top of the photo
it has some haircare instructions and it
has their logo name right there it has
the limp at the bottom and I think
that's always important because you
don't want to mess around and have
fungus limp at the top of your hair and
the shortest link at the bottom when you
do your installation so it's important
that every hair company puts a limp on
their bundles so we know what we're
working with all the funds will
basically look like
and this is how the funds of us it comes
packaged like this it has their Peruvian
hair momo right here in the 12 inch and
it actually has their tag on this as
well with the instructions and all the
new social media that you can contact
sexy hair on and they're great at
responding super quick so please if you
have any questions contact them they
have their cell phone number on there
they have their email and all of that
good stuff so I'm going to go ahead and
open some of these bundles that I
received from them
and how I feel about the ecology how I
feel about the smell
talk about the texture and all of that I
definitely did give body wave so you
know wait it's precise in the bag
already so I'm going to open the 20 inch
and let's begin the beards on this there
are some flyaways but nothing too crazy
no the beers are not bad at all it's not
bad at all
it's just a little bit but nothing too
crazy and there this has a lot of hair
in this bundle so as you can see so
looks pretty nice
you'll see any hair falling out this is
how it ends look and xx going to my
waist almost in I am 5 3 5 4 loses a
little smaller than the 18 so I'll be
aware that I'll be able to tell which
fish this one it's in Liz oh it's a
little hard to sum up finger food is not
harder but I'm running my finger
straight there is 23 but I feel inch
running my fingers through it but I just
think it's the thickness let me know if
that's just some sounds about right to
you because it's proving here is they
could number zillion but it's nothing
like it's just like it's just things
so is that nasty or dead or anything
it's a 16 inch so it's shorter than here
more hair longer than hair and hair the
less hair that you get so yes that's how
that is 60 inches doesn't have a foul
smell either I broke my fingers no and
as you can see the ends are perfect I'm
not having trouble at all running my
fingers through this one super bouncy
flowy and like I said no foul smell if I
was to put the 16 for me it would be at
the bottom of my boot teen is a little
bit less than the 16 so is way more than
the 20 volt less than the 16
I don't see anything the beer zone means
I'm not bad either it's just a little
bit and this is a promise hope from them
this is the 12 inch in front oh so oh
yeah I'll be a bit of work with this
this is about as drunk as he hairs for
day I'd love to fudge it but it's super
nice it smells really good I lace
closure so that you'll be able to part
it everywhere so it's you guys
oh listen be a good purchase for you
please open the description box for all
of the information that you would be
needing will be listed in there to gain
contact with sexy hair and their
Instagram and stuff like that will be
miss in this video are as well the
description box so I will be installing
this soon this looks like some beautiful
hair and not believe I'm falling in love
with it super excited to try it out I'm
going to rock the hair pull it about a
little bit and let you guys know how
Phil versus me hopping around on camera
after the first installation I'm
probably gonna take over liquor too and
see how filled with the hair thank you
