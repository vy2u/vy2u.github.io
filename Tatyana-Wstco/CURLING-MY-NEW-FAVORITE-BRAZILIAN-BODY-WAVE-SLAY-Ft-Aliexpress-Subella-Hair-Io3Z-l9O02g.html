hope you guys are excited to see me
because I'm excited that you're back to
watch me I have some more hair to share
with you guys and this is thinking that
it's on top of my head right now and I'm
in love with it but before I jump in and
talk to you guys about super hair which
is from an Aliexpress hair company this
is their Brazilian body wave hair and I
have in some leg lifts like 26 26 26 26
or - 26 to 24 is one of the other in a
closure not a front oh so even though
this frontal I mean this closure is
really popping I really do love this
closure but I'm gonna throw some curls
in this hair really quick so I'll be
right back and I'll let you guys know
exactly how I feel about the hair and
how it's holding up
and I've actually wrapped this hair in
another unboxing video for four seasons
of beauty hair so you guys can check
that out because I was rocking the hair
and that video and you guys were like
what hair you read what hair you right
now and I just didn't want to tell you
guys exactly which hair I was wearing at
that point I felt like I needed to rock
me here for another week or so and I
wanted to give you guys my honest
opinion so you're gonna get that right
after these curls so let's get into this
now cuz you guys know I don't really
like like dramatic big dramatic curls or
tight curls it just gives me a subtle
little wham bam thank you ma'am fill up
it's hot already so that's good alright
so let's get into this so I'm just going
to pretty much straight and bump the
front just a little bit look at how
awesome that is just like that
take custom layers in the hair - because
this hair was so beautiful I didn't just
want to wear this hair really flat and
the lips were pretty long so I felt like
I didn't need to add some life in there
I feel like you should always add some
life into your bundles
so this is pretty much all that I'll be
doing to su Bella hair so to get into
how I feel about it if I do a Aliexpress
faith weave videos or whatever I would
want to title it this has to be in my
top 5 this hair is silky soft it is
beautiful it's easy to straighten just
imagine this hair straight like this is
equivalent to that other beautiful
string here that I received like the
texture is amazing the UM the luster is
amazing but it's in Brazilian body wave
form like I like look at how pretty this
is so I will be going out just like this
I'm not about you know selling you guys
hair it has changed this hater if you're
looking for some Brazilian body wave
hair su Bella hair it is where it's act
and it looks really natural I feel and
it's a gym that you guys need to have in
your life make sure you do your research
i'ma check out other videos if you can
just to see how anybody else experience
was with this hair but like I said they
have tons of positive feedback on their
Aliexpress website so if I like this
beats anybody wave hair that ever
received because it has less there it
has movement it has body
it holds an amazing curl is really
freaking soft like soft isn't even the
word it's past soft just like baby
bottom soft I just really am in love
with this freaking here and I go rock
sue Bella's hair I'm here as always to
be your guinea pig to see who has some
pop in here for you guys who's worth
your pretty penny who you need to
actually get some great quality hair
from and these videos will never stop
because I felt like all of you guys are
counting on me to give you guys gyms and
- and to be honest with you guys and I'm
very honest about my hair companies and
I also wanted to get this video up for
you guys because this hair is so amazing
that I will be having to change the
color
I'm posed to be doing Brooke I'm
changing the color and guess what cut
guess what coming yes are you ready
rose-gold
I know I know I know I know I know I
know but this hair is so freakin soft so
I'm very indecisive but I already got my
stuff - so I actually changed the hair
color but it's like but this color and
this this in the state and this look at
how sleek and chic and awesome this hair
looks I just have to change it I have to
change the color because this is some
amazing hair and to let you guys know
how serious I am about this bleaching
process you ready look at this it's lit
rose go watch out I'm going to try to
record it if I can if not I would still
let you guys know what I use and stuff
and I would just but you guys know I'm
definitely using this this is salon care
40 volume going brush and guess you want
from Sally's Beauty Supply Store because
it's only 849 but as big as gallon and
you need to go head and get one and um

amazing and for having like this on the
market because people are sleep if they
don't know about you but it's cool
