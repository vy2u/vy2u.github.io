with funky hair I really do enjoy this
hair as you can see is really soft and
flowy and bouncy I just added some
layers in the air this is their
Malaysian on body wave hair into 24 to
26 in a 3 inch frontal I really do enjoy
this hair is you could check their
feedback section out on their Aliexpress
hair company they let me know that their
hair is pretty much like said that a
hair so you're getting some great
quality hair as you can see but let me
know your thoughts about all that I did
in this video this is basically what I
do when I just want to throw some nice
little bouncy waves in the hair but
don't really want to curl my hair with
curling irons I feel like the rollers or
the flexi rods basically do the job a
curl can sit in the flexi rod and then
when it cools off I just take them down
so I wake me like 10 to 15 minutes to
come back on camera to show you guys the
results of the flexi rods so yeah so
hopefully you enjoyed this video thank
you monkey hair for giving me great
quality hair I'm really excited about
sharing this hair with you guys all the
links will be in the description box
would be love so make sure you check
them out but yeah let me know how you
feel about this hair I did another video
for this hair company showing you guys
how I lay my own frontal so it doesn't
move at all so you can check that out
that video will be listed in the
description box as well but I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching see you in my next one
