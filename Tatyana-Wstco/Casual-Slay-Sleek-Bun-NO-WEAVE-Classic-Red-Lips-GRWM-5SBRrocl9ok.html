much but I don't want to look cute okay
so I already primed and the next step
I'm going to do is my concealer
foundation and contour all right so
we're gonna first go in with my favorite
concealer this is la girl concealer and
it's really affordable this is in the
shade coffee I really love the shade or
foreign works it depends on what look
you're trying to go for if your my skin
complexion you can use fawn and you use
toffee coffee is kind of unlike the
liner lighter side the slider lighter
side talking is kind of more you know
light so if you want to highlight effect
but you don't want to do too much use
this so I'm placing it underneath my eye
because you know the dark eyes circle
team I have a presentation whatever you
want to call it and then on my forehead
just because we want to level it out
know when the Sun hits you you want to
be you know snatched in all kinds of
dimensions if that makes it so next
product I'm gonna go in with is my Bobbi
Brown Foundation stick in expresso and I
love this product so pretty much just
because it's the perfect shape for my
skin complexion when it comes to
contouring it's not - money's not too
red it's not too dark super creamy it's
really easy to blend out and it's
buildable so yeah you don't have to you
know follow the makeup rules as you can
see I'm using a foundation stick to
contour you can use anything to contour
whatever works for you whatever is the
perfect undertone for you you can do
powders you could do creams anything
that works for you like I said tell the
dupe for the Bobbi Brown foundation
stick I would say like black opal
foundation stick you can get it from
Walmart or you can get from Walgreens I
believe and probably your beauty supply
store I'm not sure I know mine has like
open products now this is my favorite
foundation when I'm trying to do
something affordable don't wanna really
do too much but still want to look
flawless this is the next total control
foundation and another
Foundation to stay on the affordable
side is the L'Oreal infallible Pro matte
24 hour foundation and my shade is in
111 and this in the laurio and in the
NYX total control I'm in cappuccinos is
the real technique Beauty Blender or
beauty sponge whatever you want to call
it and this is the affordable one so
you're only spending like like seven
dollars on this you can see you know it
covered me up so now all I have to do is
blend in the concealer and the
foundation know the concealer in the
contour down and it's going to be super
even and everything is going to be super
blended because why I have my foundation
now on this beauty sponge and now I'm
going in with this light concealer but
blending that in with whatever is left
on the sponge from that foundation so
it's not going to be too bright it's not
gonna be too you know light or anything
like that and that's what you want with
your foundation you want everything to
look seamless and blended and of course
I'm just rambling at this point alright
so as you can see that's blending really
really nice okay and I don't really look
like I'm extremely structured but when
we go in to blend out this contour we're
gonna look snatched and that's what's
most important really when I'm doing my
makeup that's what I find most important
as long as I'm looking slim in the face
and I don't have any dark marks or you
know any hyperpigmentation showing
that's when I know that I did my makeup
really good that day and of course
making sure everything is blended out so
if you need to go down on your neck I am
getting lighter because you know it's
not summertime anymore
I'm probably gonna have to start mixing
the two again I have caramel and
cappuccino in the NYX foundation total
control foundation and this is the
morphe in 439 it's super dirty right now
I really need to clean my makeup brushes
it makes no sense I'll probably do that
after this video thing so as you can see
this is rush winds out this so nicely
underneath the contour just so this side
is fine
with this side I feel like it's not
snatched enough for me take this on this
bunch and squint my eyes like this so
any you know fine lines it will be
getting into those and that won't be
like cracking on me later on and then
what I like knowing is just pinching my
nose in the same area that I put that
concealer on the sides of my nose I like
you know hitting those areas why because
we have to set it because it's a cream
product I'm going to set the other areas
that I applied the concealer why because
we don't want it to move around so now
that that is well you know set in place
and now I'm gonna go in with my next a
matte but not flat this is in the shade
deep golden and this is just you know to
make sure the areas that we haven't said
yet are set before we go in with our
bronzers and other contour shades and
all that other jazz it's not gonna look
muddy and patchy cuz we don't want that
okay we don't want that at all so I'm
going with my NYX bronzer
lately I've been filling plush and it's
kind of weird but what I do is just mix
it into that I just mix it with the same
brush that I'm using with the bronzer
yes but I think this is such a perfect
pink you know I'm the fan just a little
extra just a little yeah it's just on
water there's still some structure and
some tan is going on on my nose you know
you could go in with a Paint Pot for Mac
just so it can be a little bit more
pigmented but I'm not even gonna do that
cuz just because I kind of like enjoy my
lids being this dark naturally dark and
I feel like it looks like I already have
like shadow on it when I don't wanna
really do too much so I just like going
over with a no really tan shade and I'm
saying just for a little color because I
feel like it completes the look it's
time to look together you know you're
not looking for the ashy underneath the
eyes and so I kind of like going for a
bolder Brown oh it is so I like to kind
of like make sure I feel the man but you
don't have to do all of this
all right so now what you're gonna do
well what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my
Kohl pencil and outline the bottom of
this and this is just to give me a
bolder darker brow so as you can see my
brows look like you know they're darker
and the reason why like this is because
I feel like the darkest brow color in
this little NYX micro brow is not dark
enough they learn now just the carve out
and just so you know fix this area
because I feel like the tail isn't where
I need it to be like like this one so as
you can see that needs to be cleaned up
and that's the power of this product
right here and this brush right here it
does that morning
a little mascara because we're about to
apply falsies and you just want to like
this is the Tarte mascara by the way
and I actually like this mascara a lot I
feel like it gets clumpy of it you know
sticks my lashes together but it can
possibly be the way how I apply mascara
like I'm not the greatest at it I kind
of suck and this is the part that you
know you really need to take your time
alone this is what I like join what I
know I'm about to layer of red lips I
just like outlining my waterline with a
nude pencil and this is going to open up
your eye boos whatever highlight you
know that makes you excited about life
because this would have you not think
about any of your problems after
applying highlight and you're looking
real snatched girl out once you finish
placing it wherever you want it and I
also like putting it up in here so then
let me just put a little powder right
now you can do this too you don't have
to what I'm gonna do it all right Ruby
well here we go this is from Mac and you
just want to I like starting with
outline in the top of my lip first
bring us clothes
going back with that little tissue right
you see how you do it you can see you
know no no no that's how I apply red
lipstick when you do this and go
lipstick and give me you pinky you know
you did it right when I apply lashes and
I'm gonna highlight my browbone and
we're gonna start on this hair baby love
it so what we're going to do is I blew
my hair out earlier and kind of trimmed
it why did that Heidi okay um so just
part your hair with the rat to book with
the rat tail comb that's the easiest way
to part your hair when you're trying to
do a style like this take a good amount
of this slanted this on my hair my hair
is natural beads now I'm just going to
use my soft and hard brush to get this
going
so ladies how I wanted to be laid
all right
all right so I'm gonna take my favorite
hair ties these are the goody hair ties
and they are the ones without their last
big I mean be a metal that's always good
and I'm just gonna use one hair tie
today just because my hair just blown
out and it's not curly I usually use two
of these take a little bit of that go
styling gel and focus it right up in
here
all right so now that I'm is graded I
just like submit in my little tiny
little ponytail this is when I don't
want to add any extra here to my hair so
this is what I do guys
so anything that needs to be laid down
I'm just like going over it with my
toothbrush and if you don't like using
you know a toothbrush you don't I'm
saying you can get your little tiny
brush like this this does the same thing
the exact same thing so now I am going
to put this outfit on and head out the
door like this little red comas hey I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
