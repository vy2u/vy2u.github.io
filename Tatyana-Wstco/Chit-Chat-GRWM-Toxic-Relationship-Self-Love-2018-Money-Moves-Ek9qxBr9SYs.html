YouTube this is want to be a chit chat
get ready with me just because it's
Bissell boys this up annoying its office
if I wanna you know you know you miss
the girl I know you miss me I know I
know so let's just get into this makeup
look you guys probably gonna kill him
because I already did the eyes but it
was really really basic saw run through
what I did with my eyes really quick I
use Nana and Zakia from the Java the
magic palette by Java and yeah so be for
shades who literally that was all that I
use to recreate this look I mean to
create this look nah-ah and Zakia so it
was really cute glitter is very coppery
Goldy and it has some Silver's in this
as well it's just one of their glitter
packs that you can get from my Michaels
and I use this one so this one's really
really cute I like this one a lot
because it's given me like October
festive vibes right now and it's really
really nice it has like reflex of orange
yellow and green let's start off with
our concealer because you guys know I do
my makeup kind of dis stuff that
different I'm sure other people do their
makeup like how I do my makeup but I
like doing my makeup the way I like
doing it because I don't really go too
heavy-handed on my products because I
can really get heavy-handed at one
foundation and steal their and then I
started looking like a freaking crazy
person and I just don't like that for my
skin type personally gonna use my
Smashbox primer I love this primer but
anyway like I was telling you guys it's
been a lot of great things going more
recently with me one being my skin has
cleared up I'm only just trying to get
the discoloration off of my skin now but
like the bumps have gone and I'll let
you guys know what I have been doing I
actually went ahead and created like a
tumeric mask for myself I actually had a
video showing you guys how I did that on
my channel but I'm going to do a
updating one so I took off that video so
I just stuck with the basic remedy with
tumeric powder which is tumeric flour
whole milk you can use whole milk
whole whole milk i say milk my mom makes
fun of me but it's milk but i say milk
so if you hear me say milk don't think
that I'm retired I'm just I just that's
just how I pronounce melis I'll put that
video up really really soon and I also
use some other products that have been
helping the process go a little faster
and it's on the expensive side of the
spectrum when it comes to skincare but I
still want to give you guys that video
because if it helped me maybe it may
help you so yeah I did put the gold
light strobe cream on but I also want to
use this new revolution makeup the
luminous gold drops like I seen this
 on Instagram y'all and it was just
you to fall like look at that amazing
you guys know I'm really about making
the skin look really glowy underneath my
makeup so you know the skin can just be
looking healthy under there as well I
picked up the gold one because I feel
like it will compliment my skin tone I
don't want anything too like silver it
may look silver because you know I'm on
camera with this bright has light behind
me I'm gonna go in with this Tarte shape
tape concealer I actually bought a new
one the other day in tan sand I like a
like a really bright highlight so this
is not you like you know you can go
darker or like more closer to your skin
color but I like a nice bright under-eye
because I already have inherited dark
eyes um yeah so now what I'm gonna do is
just go ahead and blend that out I've
been doing my makeup a little bit
differently I'm gonna spray my face with
fix+
yeah so I've been doing my makeup a
little different have been blending out
my concealer and then putting my
foundation kind of like over the harsh
lines I'm very excited for this new year
I'm so like great things are gonna be
happening for me I have
thing to hold me back this year I got
rid of all the toxic and the craziness
already I look crazy right now a new
product I haven't tried these Anastacio
foundation sticks at all okay so I'm
trying one out today to contour and
hopefully it works out for me because
literally right after I found this I
went to my beauty supply store because
I'm trying to look for these lashes that
I really really love and I found a nick
stick that was just like this only eight
dollars and it felt as creamy as this
one so this was 25 and I'm just hoping
for the best
I usually use my Bobbi Brown foundation
stick but I feel like that one breaks me
out and now that my skin has gotten his
life together I don't need any more
craziness going on if it doesn't have to
be anything crazy going on you know what
I'm saying so this was this is in the
shade expresso I was going to get walnut
and I probably will return this one and
get walnut but you know I don't really
like a crazy crazy contour so I can make
this where it's not giving me really
really muddy vibes and I'd like that my
Bobbi Brown one wasn't either
I was just allergic to whatever
ingredients that they have in it and I'm
just really really aren't breaking
because I love Bobbi Brown's foundation
for contouring because it's super creamy
but anyway I'm gonna use a brush to
blend this upwards but I want to bring
my brush because all the my brushes need
to be clean but I've been super lazy
lately and I haven't been wanting to
clean them because I really haven't even
been putting makeup on for over I just
been trying to get my skin in order so
but I still need to clean my makeup
brushes
but yeah so like I was saying this
year's definitely going to be a great
year for the kid and for you okay Mike
whatever you were afraid to do in 2017
or holding yourself back from doing in
2017 because you were just scared or you
didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings I
feel like we need to set all of that
aside and definitely get into working on
ourselves and if this doesn't apply to
you then it doesn't apply you but if
you're already doing that great grant
but I feel like I have been putting
myself last on every spectrum in life
for the past two years honestly and like
I'm over it
because I don't get anything out of it I
always get the end of the stick I
always end up regretting it wishing and
praying I did things different and
looking back on the times like what the
 wasting my time for and you know
this year is not gonna be any of that I
don't have time for that filling yeah so
I got rid of that dusty boyfriend of
mine and I wish him the best of course I
don't ever wish bad on anybody but just
some things just don't work out and some
things are meant to never work out
because they're not meant for you so
Kathy is very much so single and I can
do whatever the hell it is I want to do
and I don't have to take care of nobody
I don't have to make sure somebody else
is straight
I can just definitely focus on my dreams
and my goals and I'm really really
excited about that part because I know
I've just I just been having a great
feeling since this year started you
don't know I'm saying it maybe it's just
because you know fresh start and I know
for a fact that I am done with my toxic
ass relationship that I was in and I'm
just not going back it's no point of
going back at all and um yeah so as you
can see I'm just blending my contour and
my highlight together so that's kind of
like different I feel like I didn't do
that before I kind of like laid
everything out and then I blended
everything in but no sometimes I get too
crazy with my under-eye highlight and
then I'll be like what's going on it
kind of needs some color back into my
face and blah blah blah but anyway yeah
so this is just how I do my makeup now
and I'm gonna go in with my favorite
foundation this freaking foundation is
flawless like I love this I always have
my eye on it and every time I will go
into Ulta and I also insist Ã¡fourÃ¡ like
for some odd reason I feel like every
person in there we're trying to talk me
out of getting this foundation so I
would never get it they would tell me
it's like way too full coverage and I'm
just like no it's not it's not full
coverage at all unless you pack on
pounds but it's a flawless finish and
you know even if it is full coverage you
can make a full coverage look really
natural at the end of the day it's
definitely how you prep your skin and
how you apply it
like I like apply my foundation with a
Beauty Blender sometimes with a brush if
I am using a brush it is this brush
right here but yeah I love this
foundation it's really really nice and
it's only like 25 dollars I'm it might
be 28 but it's really good
so yeah
so what I'm going to do now if you know
go back over the highlighted areas a
Laura Mercier powder and set my under
I've I kind of gotta speed this up
already my camera inside oh but I have
so many hair reviews that I have to get
out of the way for you guys so I just
wanted to come in here and pretty much
do my makeup with you guys show you some
new products that I was using and you
know just do a quick tutorial for you
guys I guess you could say this is the
chit chat I didn't really have much to
talk to you guys about right that's why
I don't really do these chit chats but I
just wanted you to know that I am alive
still I am alive
Todd's he's alive Tati is alive I hate
what I want to do a chit chat get ready
with me and then I like go to edit it
and then I don't want to hear myself
talk like I've been praying for my face
to get clear like praying to God at
night for a clear face that's how
serious it was and little do you know
like it was really affecting my my my
life for you to like like I just did not
want to get on camera anymore into a
full as blam and then I just don't like
how my skin looks in the video and it
would really affect me and I would try
to be positive about the situation but I
just knew exactly what was wrong like I
was just stressed not really like you
know taking care of myself
like my mental health and I think that
was just coming out in my skin and now
I've been working out everyday even
though I had Carabas the other day and I
had like a freaking dessert that was
like a thousand calories so that like
kicked out all of my hard work nothing
today I was happy with the choice that I
made for my meal and my dessert so I'm
just gonna have to go a little harder in
the gym
I've been going day and night and I just
see myself feeling how I used to feel
like just readies just to take on the
 world and just you know you know
network and just be around new people
meet new people life is so short
and I hate being in a relationship where
the person is so insecure that they
can't like stand seeing their girlfriend
or boyfriend out and they think that
you're doing their gonna you're gonna be
cheating on them and stay like that it's
just like don't be with a person like
that please ladies like if wanna feel
like the more independent you are as a
person you don't even have to be a woman
just as a person people want to hold you
back people like you people want you to
feel like you need them yeah but sorry I
had to change out my batteries my
battery was dying but yeah if you are in
a relationship if that person is not
motivating you holding you back talking
to you like you're crazy all the
time and trying to switch the flip like
it's really not them it's you you know
damn well you ain't doing nothing wrong
like listen these are the years that is
not time for us to be trying to force
something to work like this is the age
where we need to learn we need to
realize oh that's just not for me that's
not what I want if you can't change
somebody just realize you cannot change
someone you can definitely try to
motivate somebody to be the best person
that they have you know that they can be
but if they don't want to change for
themselves don't feel bad for them and
I'm literally just talking in because
this is what's my experience
and I just realized how much my 2017 was
definitely revolving around the wrong
things and it wasn't revolving around me
and it showed in my videos I already
came from a situation that was just like
I'm free I'm happy I'm away and I'm
doing my own thing - hopping into
another toxic ass situation so I feel
like I haven't gave myself to really
shine and be great and I know that I
have so much to offer and I know great
things will happen for me as long as I
keep my self my star player my which is
myself intact like do not lose focus for
somebody else that's not worth losing
focus for and you know how they
feel because it just it's just uh it's a
hot-ass mess when you feel like you got
nothing out of that and of course that's
not true you've learned a great lesson
and I've learned how I'm hoping is like
what I went through like I learned that
I was supposed to go through that like I
believe that everything in my life was
written so I feel like everything
happens for a reason I went through that
for a reason I went through that so when
I turned 32 I don't have to be going
through that I already know the signs
and the fuck-boy ways that's out
there that I I'm just I just know for a
fact that I won't put myself through
that
so just definitely if you have that gut
fill in if you have that instinct that
you just don't need to be with a
specific person but you're just trying
to make it work because you love them
listen you can love them from my
distance you can love yourself more and
you need to love yourself more if you
love love somebody you're not going to
listen to a friend you're not gonna
listen to a homegirl you're not gonna
listen to a roommate you're not gonna
listen to your mother your father your
sister your brother you're going to be
like oh no we
oh no no bitch you shouldn't listen but
you had to go through it you had to fall
a couple of times you had to you know
you just had to run for yourself and
there's nothing wrong with that but it's
almost like at the end of zing you know
what's best for you but you're once
again trying to please somebody else so
if you know something is toxic just let
it go because you're wasting your years
like Tom waits for nobody and I just
root I just feel like if that person
wasn't in my so close to my destination
if I did not put that person in my life
and I called him blamed myself for that
because I've already seen that that
person wasn't good enough for me but I
was putting him first I was putting his
past and his sorrows and his emotional
ass-fucking past that he was he used to
tell me about and I would be like I
don't want to be that person to herself
I don't want to be that person that no
bitch you need to be that person that
loves me from a distance and let him
know that what you're knowing you're
holding me back you're holding yourself
back and we are not compatible I'm
trying to figure out what I need to be
doing next while I'm talking to you guys
about this but yeah twenty twenty
eighteen is definitely about self-love
okay like if you're in a toxic
relationship please let it go it's only
going to hinder you and I'm trying to do
less spending more saving this year
definitely opening up my hairline this
year trying to do my website I just have
so many things and it works and I just
have to continue being positive putting
positive energy out there being around
positive people that are doing positive
things I don't have time for that this
year okay I hope you guys are doing
great I actually had a message on
snapchat that really motivated me and
was funny because you know while I was
doing my makeup I told myself that I was
gonna record this eye look but I just
didn't kind of like how it turned out
but then I got my life together and I
started liking it and then right as soon
as I was you know trying to find a way
to
tell myself I didn't like it or I wasn't
gonna record pretty much like this
message came through my snapchat and it
was like a really long heartfelt message
you know just girl just telling me how
much I inspire her and and it's just
like Tati you have a gift like you can
inspire people whoever thought was
written for you and you have so much
more to offer
my personality genuine as I am like I
just need to put myself first and that's
just what I've chopped it up as like I
could I could be great and I am gonna be
great
I could be I could be so much better
than what I have been lately and doing
much better and putting in work a little
harder then I have been but you can't
talk about it you gotta be about it so I
had to get my ass up
okay and just knock off the the fuckery
and just be like listen you have your
stuff to live for you have your
supporters to live for you have to make
them happy you have to make you happy
and you have to give back because I feel
like when I'm giving to others and
talking or trying to inspire that makes
me feel great so I just have so much in
store that I want to be able to do for
you guys more giveaways like when I
start my hair line I'm gonna definitely
give out to people that I keep
screenshots of people that sent me
really heartfelt messages that I really
can feel like they're being as genuine
as a genuine person can be and I have
those messages still stored in my phone
and I just know one day I'm gonna be
able to give you guys care packages free
hair like makeup just you know just to
help motivate you and if I can I will if
I can give back I can you know because I
wouldn't be this far without you guys I
don't want so I don't want you guys to
think like you know you guys are not a
part of my success story because you
guys really are so but once I'm able to
be in a position where I can just give
back that's basically exactly
what I am going to do that's what I'm
trying to explain and Express to you
right now but yeah so I'm going to be
working on getting my vlogging camera
because I haven't purchased one yet I
walked us who bested by a couple of I
want to say a couple of months ago and
like last month and I was looking at
this camera and this guy kind of try to
like talk me out of getting in because
he was just like listen like you should
just get like a handheld video camera
that has better quality not look you
don't want a handheld you know then so I
had to go high and low doing my research
on you know finding the vlogging camera
that I once I want the one that
autofocus is I wanted the one that kind
of has like this soft filter on it so
just the case I do have a bumpy it's not
preventing me to UM it's not preventing
me from making vlogs I do want you guys
as opinion though if you guys were to
buy virgin hair would you buy Brazilian
or would you buy Indian you know virgin
hair is really expensive if you are
getting it from a true raw virgin vendor
and like an Aliexpress vendor and try to
hike up the price so I'm gonna have to
start with one texture and my favorite
texture is resilient so but I love
Indian hair too and you know if you guys
love Indian hair I just want to know if
that's something that you would be
interested in purchasing from me or
would you be interested in purchasing
Brazilian so kind of give me an idea do
you like Indian hair or do you like
Brazilian Indian hair is a little bit
more coarse than Brazilian hair feel
like Brazilian hair is a little bit more
on like the silky shiny are side but the
definitely blends in with my hair really
good but eventually I'll be able to sell
both but I don't want to start with one
you're gonna say it on top of this lip
with the 620
from kleancolor and put it in the center
and then I am going to this NYX butter
gloss on top and then I'm going to top
it off with this Mac glass look glass
inspite I think this is spice um yeah
I'm gonna use downtown beauty from NYX
all right so that's that I'm gonna pop
on some lashes I didn't wanted to let
you guys know my favorite lashes I might
be doing that I might be getting lash
extensions tomorrow but I might not I
might not I see the like very flared out
long wispy lashes that I have on nine
times out of ten it's please
113 but these are so hard to find
nowadays I like because I told people
about them they go and steal them all in
Walmart this is the salon perfect these
are the salon perfect 614 lashes multi
pack they're only eight dollars at
Walmart I freaking love these lashes
like they're so beautiful and I don't
ever have to cut them sometimes I do but
I just feel like how wispy they are
they're perfect the reason why I love
these more than I love these is because
these are a little bit fuller and these
aren't so I kind of have to put mascara
on these a little bit but I still love
them because how it flares out and stuff
like that so but I just said like I said
these are just a little bit more fuller
up in the eye bar and then I'm gonna
ruin my makeup
all right baby laughs so this is the
final look I'm so sorry I feel like if I
wonder just do that look you guys would
appreciate this a little bit more really
simple though really freakin simple so
if you want me to recreate the look let
me know in the comment section or just
thumbs up this video and if it has like
100 thumbs up then I would just recreate
it and call it it no year new improved
you okay so new improved me that means
it's gonna be a new improved you take a
leap just a jump and just just trust
yourself trust your gut and trust in the
Lord or if you believe any higher power
just believe that they have your back if
anybody else doesn't they will and just
put yourself first please put yourself
first and if you're in a toxic
relationship please get out of it I
can't stress that on
no I'm happy guys really I am like
things that I'd be stressed about I'll
just be like is it really even worth
stressing no bitch you dodged a bullet
be thankful that you dodged the bullet
be thankful that you learned at this age
to be thankful that your you are where
you are just take time to appreciate
what you have like all the negative that
I went through just like look at how far
I've gotten in that situation so now
that that negative is out and I'm just
worried about myself now just imagine
what I must get myself into honey I'm
about to break in the bank okay I'm
about to just cash out on these hoes I'm
here I love you guys so freaking much I
love how my makeup turned out I haven't
sprayed my face yet but I'm not gonna
spray it until I get off the camera
I'm spraying it with fix+ it's what I
was trying to say I'll probably do a
video right after this one and yeah so I
love you guys so freakin much thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you in
my next one don't forget to let me know
what hairdo you want do you want Indian
do you want Brazilian they're both gonna
eventually be on the site on my site but
