foundation I'm going to be using today
is the Marc Jacobs genius gel foundation
I'm not even really going anywhere so I
don't even know why I'm using a
foundation but I feel like one up so let
me just put some more primer one because
I feel like I don't put it in the center
of my face so my favorite primer is the
Smashbox primer it just minimizes your
pores fills in no any oh pretty much
fill in your pores and make sure that
your makeups going to blot but I really
think something needs to be done dipping
around here in my life and you know I've
just been part you're talking to God
trying to figure it out and I feel like
I'm going to get through it but I do
need to stop stressing because I just
need to appreciate what I have in this
life and I feel like I just been that
person that you know really doesn't take
the time out to see all the good that is
going on in her life like I trust me I
know my life is great and I know that it
can be also better but I feel like I
need to kind of live in the moment a
little bit and not like forget like
where I came from and how far you know I
how far I got like I've gotten really
 far and a lot of it is because
of you guys and you just don't even know
how I appreciate you guys so much and I
know this is like the typical YouTube um
like you know thank you know to their
subscribers but like you guys really are
amazing and if anybody is out there
that's trying to pursue like no YouTube
or just you know is it creative and feel
like they're trying to get their self
out on YouTube the best thing I can
suggest you do is definitely get you
some good quality things such as like a
camera and like a really good camera
because quality matters definitely to
your viewer but my you know
your personality definitely has to shine
through
so since I'm just talking about this I'm
definitely going to just how much what
is go into the reason why I started
YouTube and stuff like that so YouTube
pretty much was mine get away from me
being you know emotional instead and
stuff like that and you guys pretty much
forced me to get on YouTube a lot of you
guys were on my Instagram first and
you've seen my pictures and a lot of you
guys wanted to know what I was like how
I did certain things and that's pretty
much what made me get on YouTube to show
you how to do certain things but I was
already watching YouTube and I was you
know getting inspired and I really got
into makeup because of YouTube but I I
won't say that I didn't take it serious
I just didn't know where it was going to
go and I also didn't like put my school
like heart and soul into this so if you
see like I have so many subscribers but
my video views are like kind of like off
a little bit and it's just because it's
one I'm doing something that after like
a lot of people do on YouTube and two
it's not really me doing anything like
like me like I'm not really I'm showing
you guys what I'm creative at and what
I'm good at but I feel like if I slip
more of my personality and put you know
different content on my youtube channel
it will be so much popping and that's
why I also know I'm here talking to you
guys about this because I do want to
know what you guys want to see more of
and I also you know want to get back
into my creative flows and my creative
juices it was just a lot for one of my
life and you know my creativeness got me
out of you know a situation that I
didn't want to be in anymore and I just
have to remember that you know my god I
have to remember why I started I have to
remember like I said how far I got just
you know being you know myself
and you know interacting with you guys
so why never years so and I do I feel
like I do ticket serious but if you
start getting comfortable you're going
to get comfortable honey and it's just
going to be like it's going to make you
feel like okay what's next
and I want to already kind of know
what's next you know I'm saying if you
get what I'm saying anyway so yeah so I
started YouTube and I really started it
because I was loving makeup but a lot of
you guys love you know hair and we even
stuff like that and guys wanted me to do
reviews and then that's when hair
companies start floating around and
wanting me to review their hair and all
that other jazz so I just said why not
but this that's not the main reason why
I started my you and I feel like I was
you know holding back from really being
myself when I first started you to just
because when I was in the good space
into I was probably worried about what
people in my high school would think of
me and if they would think I was weird
and like that and I always used to
say I never gave a thought about what
people thought but looking back on it I
know that's definitely one of the
reasons and you just have to be ruin it
so so you know can watch sugarcoat it
and as I'm thinking about it now that
what I'm getting that definitely was the
case but as you can see that doesn't
mean that does nothing but hinder you
and you know what I'm saying stopped you
from being who you are and you know and
I didn't I didn't want that for myself
and I don't want that for myself
and I'm definitely getting out of my
shell on YouTube so have a great
personality but you guys wouldn't have
known that if I would have had continued
to just be in that little shell that I
kind of was in so like if you're trying
to do YouTube just be yourself just be
you and I feel like if you dive into
YouTube and you don't know if you're
really sure if you want to do it or not
you're going to just start like picking
up certain pieces wrong videos that you
may seem and then you're going to think
that you're supposed to do it this way
because you know the face YouTube oh hi
guys how's it going another love is done
with our you know um fans
and that's not really how I thought
that's not like yeah I felt like that
maybe you know in a energy or
something like that but I'm not that
person I'm really crazy I'm down there
I'm full of and you guys are my
family you guys are the reason why I am
here and doing what I'm doing and why
not put my all into it
so if you're trying to do YouTube do not
shy away from being yourself because
people are going to love you for you you
know what I'm saying
people are going to appreciate who you
are because you're amazing you're a dull
person and you're creative and you know
you can you can get through anything
just by just being yourself you don't
have to try to be like anybody else or
try to act professional in YouTube you
know if you don't have to you know you
don't have to shy away from being
yourself is basically what I'm trying to
say because they're going to love you
for you and if they don't it
somebody else will trust mine you had my
p2i camera and I already had my MacBook
because those are the things that I
asked for Christmas when I was younger
so um the photos that I will post on
Instagram guys always ask me how I did
my makeup or how I did my hair or
anything like that
so that's kind of where you know my
youtube channel came from is definitely
you guys have support and wanting to
figure out how I was doing certain
things because it wasn't for you I
wouldn't have got on YouTube like I
always wanted to start a YouTube channel
but I feel like the quality wasn't as
great and it was just because I didn't
know how to really work my camera during
the time and I didn't know really about
lighting and all of that jazz so I would
definitely go into more depth like with
my lighting in mind so I probably are
looking at me like oh okay like she's
doing it you know I can do it and I have
to remember that you know I'm here to
help you get understand I'm here to
teach I'm here to try to teach you guys
how to differ
and that's what you have to remember
when you're starting YouTube also like
if you're going to do like a beauty
related kind of channel and that's what
I'm talented at so I'm not going to get
on here and try to be you know teaching
you how to do something that I don't
know how to do I think this is my gift
from God knowing how to do here is what
does I do knowing how to do makeup and
you know this is something that I will
always want to continue working with and
I'm not going to work on anything that
I'm not into you can understand I'm not
going to put all my energy into
something that I'm not really into so I
know this was my gift from God and just
the help of YouTube and thankful that
you know there is even a youtube to get
some people creative juices flowing and
get themselves out there I'm really
appreciative of that too and I'm
appreciative of you guys because you
guys don't have to come back and watch
me all the time and all of that good
stuff so yeah so I don't even know where
this videos going in how I'm going to
end it because I feel like it's all over
the place but once again you got in my
family and I'm talking to you guys
because I feel like I need somebody to
talk to and I'm sure there's somebody
out there that's probably needing to
hear something something but yeah girl
I'm just trying to get in and be
successful and remember why I started
and just be great even something like
I'm not trying to live without here
because I have plans and I have set
goals for myself and I just don't want
to forget about that no matter what the
case may be
oh yeah on a lighter note I got my
lashes done and lately I've just been
doing really natural I kind of make the
look just because I don't really want to
go in and do all of that boldness with
my eyes even though I did it the other
day wasn't that bad I'll definitely keep
you guys posted on how my lashes are
holding up and if it's worth getting it
this is like say three and a few of them
fell out but of course that's normal
it's not like crazy amounts falling out
that will happen you like okay I will
never do it again but I do want you guys
to know that I feel like this was a
great decision that I've made just
because I really hate when I'm
buying lashes and then I'm trying to do
a makeup look and it's just like
overpowered a and after like this these
extensions are perfect for me they're
the perfect density they're the perfect
lens and I really like them and for the
summertime it's one less thing that I
have to do when I'm trying to do my
makeup so I think it was a really good
move but they're pretty pricey so you're
not like trying to have another bill in
your life I wouldn't suggest you do it
because it's about a hundred dollars and
the maintenance to keep them up is every
two or two to three weeks fill in prices
like sixty five seventy five dollars so
it's definitely a luxury kind of thing
for yourself just like in your nails
done because Guinean ozone can be pricey
to research because I was going to go to
a couple of people and I think I was
just like trying to force it to get done
and I just didn't really know too much
about lashes other than I wanted them
and you can go all the way left and
you're playing with your eyes like
somebody is near your eye and you don't
want to just be gone to anybody and
everybody thinking that is going to
be sweet the last the last Texas I went
to she told me about a few girls that
she don't think it's her lashes done him
they like burn for like ten minutes and
then they stop burning if you also tell
me that like we go by and all her lashes
are out and stuff like that so when she
was telling me that those are the things
that you know we are worried about when
we get our lashes done because once
again they're pricey and you don't want
to just go to somebody and know that
they're only going to last for a week
that's not cool
price that you're going to be paying for
these right so I just felt more
comfortable that she was understanding
like she was someone that wasn't a last
tech this is the qualities that she's
looking for in a lash Tague and she was
saying all the right things I was just
like okay that's when I felt even more
comfortable cuz I was like oh she's
going to definitely make sure you know
I'm swayed because we're looking for the
same thing when it comes to lashes
you're in Atlanta area she is down here
so just give me like I said two weeks
just to see how this works and um I'll
come back and I'll let you guys know in
another video about her and I will leave
her information below or in the video
somewhere I don't know if you guys can
really see them but I'm sure you can
because their lashes um in their cute
groom oh is another thing I really want
a furry friend but if you guys don't
know I'm allergic to pretty much life
you got enough Scooby well you probably
see my dog Scooby in my on my Instagram
but that's my family dog and he's you
breaks me out like crazy and he's
supposed to be a hyper allergenic dog so
I don't know if that even exists like I
feel like they just say that just so you
can get the damn dog or pay more for it
but he was killing me like sneezing all
over the place and it's cute because you
know you can leave them and then go out
and come back but like if my dog is in
my house all the time I'm going to allow
it who will be in my bed be around me
you can say it and I won't be able to
get away from it and even though I don't
want it to get away from me I don't want
to be rude because I'm dying so I can't
get a dog and I really want a furry
friend just to keep me company and stuff
that's another bill too because when
nothing to get sick I had to spend like
I think what was it like 300 particular
100 is something or 200 $300 or
something my dog had to get done my
family thought I had to get done I was
just like that and we can you make cake
and that's what you got to worry about -
so apparently this is going to be like a
no makeup makeup look kind of situation
today
Oh have you guys bought any of Kim
Kardashian's makeup for a new makeup
I'll be buying it but just trying to
figure out if I don't think I'm going to
be buying it
but I'm just trying to figure out you
guys are going to buy it if you're not
looking for like a really snatch look on
it everyday I will say go get it but
there's three products that come into
that so I don't think it's that bad
because no foundation goes for like 5716
almost a hundred dollars sometimes and
I'll be buying that
so why not go get more for your money
you can look at it that way all right
and then this is the Sephora micro
smooth face powder and this is in the
shade deep M&amp;amp;E it's number 60 and not
just like doing patting motions in my
contour area with this product and then
taking it all over my face and this is
just to set B contour because you don't
want it to move around you guys know you
guys should know that by now but um I
need to take care must get more one I
need to be jerkin more water that's one
you know when you think that you drink
like a few bottles here and there and
you think that's enough a big girl is so
damn hot in Atlanta that I need to be
scarfing down
about six bottles a day seven days leave
now oh I didn't let you guys know so
like the maintenance on these lashes
you're just supposed to like calm
through them get you some alcohol and
comb through them and I'll have to go
run to I've been resting it to the store
and get some alcohol because I don't
have any more and you're just supposed
to use like a spoolie and clean them but
I don't want to be pulling another or
anything with you falling out so I just
need some alcohol to clean these off and
you're supposed to use a spoolie she
actually gives you slowly it's pink it's
cute you guys have another like product
that you like using to bronze up your
face let me know because I'm sure you're
never tired of saying this because I
kinda am tired of using it I know you
guys are probably tired of seeing it and
another thing that you have to make sure
you're doing is cleansing your makeup
brushes I'll probably do a video today
just cleaning my makeup brushes for you
guys a few that I have to clean because
I actually clean a lot of them the other
day and it was because I start noticing
my face is recognized but this situation
did not come here until this morning
and I don't know what the the
problem is down there but I'm still cute
recently did a new color with some hair
it's like that copper scissor color and
it's up on my channel if you guys want
to see that really cute color is I
gravitate towards that color or that way
all the time
great quality the whole thing I'll be
hating your not do color over here is I
feel like I don't pick the right hair to
do like cute colors with like I wish
under next pair you know what no I don't
because I actually have that hair color
already or curly hair and straight hair
oh yeah
I don't know I kind of wish I did that
hair color with this unit right here I'm
thinking about going burgundy to let me
know how you guys feel about that watch
so many reviews on this Jaclyn hill
palette from morphe and y'all are
 hilarious
like people are you two are so vicious
like if I was you know getting comments
24/7 and then majority of them were
negative I wouldn't give a
so the people that just be sitting
behind their little computer and just
attacking people I don't know I feel
like everybody has a opinion
just like I got one right now about it
so let her rock
she's in her money right here I'm just
going to drag that on a new tune because
I don't want too much darkness okay so
what are we doing my favorite lip combo
currently which is cork lip liner cookie
butter gloss from NYX and cork lip
liners from only people that butter lock
it doesn't stay on long enough for me I
think I'm going to use this this is a
clean color that'd be 1628 and then
we'll put that on there it matches cork
perfectly as you guys can see and it's a
liquid matte stick so hopefully this
will help
okay so that would just be wet allowed
near this lip not a nude eyeliner and
this is we cookie butter gloss from NYX
can I appreciate that so I'm glad I use
my brain today situation would mean it's
more so like I don't know who like a
vendor that I really can trust and I'm
trying to figure that out and I'm trying
to make sure you know the quality of the
hair is no good and who I can always
work with and stuff like that so I would
feel that part of my life to be I want
that to be perfect you guys know I don't
want you guys to have to be breaking
your pockets just for bundles
I'm going to be affordable but great
quality and of course you guys know I'm
gonna have to start off with Brazilian
because you guys know that is my
favorite hair texture but of course you
know a lot more products in there as
well and be future personalized trying
to speak it in existence so it can
happen because I feel like everything
that I say usually happens so start
speaking good things and take this
instead of the bad things into existence
Tatiana and the lesson or what I really
want you to take from this video and
just be yourself no matter what no
matter if you go through things in life
that makes you want to be hard and rude
and evil or just malicious don't do that
one carbons bitch to God knows your
intentions and that's all you need to
worry about and three you're going to
get through anything and everything you
want to get through if you have the
brainpower and the mindset and the drive
and the ambition to get through it and
don't ever put anyone before you
who you believe in if you believe in a
higher power and always put your
families second don't be on here putting
other people before you because people
will switch on you so fast and I
feel like that's what I've been going
through like it worth it you know what
I'm saying it's always worth it in the
end
it's just like certain bumps you have to
get over it it's part of your life to
get to the next part of your life just
to get to you know where you're supposed
to be but no one ever said that was
going to be easy you know and yeah I've
always you know I'm going and you know
cool wish it like that but I'm a human
too and I go through - and such a
weather for you guys I wouldn't be
getting on here every day or you know
getting up trying to stay motivated so
and when you're just working and get
your mind off your but always you
can also stress you out a little bit too
because you're trying to sugarcoat
certain things so I don't know but this
is definitely supposed to be about this
hair honey so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
