time chitchat to get ready with me and
I'm gonna probably like tell you guys
about my hair if not he'll probably be
in my second video I'll probably do
another one right after this please
excuse my skin just going through her
honey so I'm drinking sleepy time tea so
if a bitch falls asleep on you that's
why I don't even know when this was but
it I think it may have been this year
yes it was this year so a lot of
products that i am using will be listed
in the description box below I don't
know if I've said that already but I'm
sure I did girl I'm sick so I'm over
here tripping already anyway so regular
yeah so this so cool a friend that I um
used to call her friend she she was the
girl that knew everybody I was just a
little hot mama running around the city
that's the type of person she was so
this video is really not to bash or
anything like that but I'm gonna just
tell you about how we almost got our
drinks laced I ended up going to her
house I think I'm we linked up and we
met at her house so I have to know wait
with her and we
now this drop had to be like 35 minutes
away and it was in the cut since while I
was about to dip my hand in this
thinking this is where my Beauty Blender
was I cut like we was just like oh bitch
if this gets any darker I will not be I
will not be going because it was just in
the cut but like the houses were cute
over there but it was still really dark
where the location was so I just didn't
even like the vines so that was sign
number one so why what happened what
happened okay yeah so we pulled up or
whatever and it was it was like a cabin
type of vibe and don't get me wrong the
air B&amp;amp;B was really cute but the people
in it was real raunchy and just basic it
was definitely an area where if they try
to have like a real like a situation
going on and didn't want any police to
come and harass them overnight noise
that would be the place that you would
want to like get your Airbnb type of
vibe so welcome to the place and all the
people that she really knew was
downstairs in like the basement area so
that's where we went so you know if
we're going out 9 times out of 10 we
gonna drink would not and somebody had
access we wanted a drink or whatever and
then I was like yeah that's cool so if
we wanted to drink I was expecting us to
like follow him the bar this person is
concocting my dreams just tell them what
you wanted you know this is the typical
take me to the drink so I can see was
getting made type of vibe
and we stayed downstairs because he was
just like okay I'll be back
I'll go get y'all to your drink now we
wasn't about to just sit downstairs in
the basement if it was supposed to be
like a little uh like a little kick back
or whatever that's kind of the vibe that
it was given kick back vibe so we wanted
to go upstairs you know listen to music
whatever so
that's what we did maybe after like ten
minutes of being downstairs with her
other homeboys that was there at the
party so while she was chopping it up
and whatever issues like we noticed that
the guy was taking a cut of all right
just go through the house cuz this is a
really cute cabin it had a really cute
balcony and that we hadn't went out one
yet so we decided that we wanted to go
upstairs and do that and we going up the
stairs
homeboy still is not around with the
drink oh all right so my friend gets to
going well the girl that I was dealing
with during the time she gets to hoppin
up the stairs after we didn't seem that
balcony outside and it was really
nothing going on out there but that's
where homeboy that was supposedly
supposed to be making our drinks comes
and pops out I don't know where in his
hand and he just looked weird you know
I'm saying like he just first of all
usually when I'm going out with this
girl it's always a back story with the
niggas that she's dealing with I really
didn't think much of it I just thought
it was just like somebody that she was
cool with what I mean and like they had
invited her out so you know like awesome
homeboy homegirl shit so you wouldn't
think that they was gonna do some
foo-foo shit that I'm about to tell
y'all in a second
so okay he pops out of the room and I'm
just like okay I'm looking at my dream
ain't drinking yet you know and I'm the
type of person that is just like oh okay
like we gotta do it you don't know Sam
but something was just telling me don't
drink this dream no you've won your all
the way upstairs in Cabin in a room
with our drink so why it was a red flag
with me was because he already looked
like he was lit like lint off or
something way way way past liquor and um
liquor and we so I guess you know
because I've got that vibe when I first
seen him he kind of looked kind of crazy
and just just not anybody that we were
really kicking with um but then I guess
I kind of got comfortable because the
people that she knew downstairs they
looked like a little normal and they
didn't really look like how he loves so
um we get to walking around the house we
went downstairs and he was just pressed
like when I say pressed this is what
what set the freaking light bulb on fire
birth and everything for me he keeps
asking he's like all bloody don't be
babysitting unclean nigga we just got
the drink like you talking about
babysitting the drink first of all you
ain't give us a shot he made a drink
yeah we don't mind turning up but why
are you so pressed right now so I'm
looking at the situation for what it is
I'm looking at this homegirl is noticing
when I'm noticing and she's really not
noticing anything she just think that
he's being oppressed as person so she
takes it to the side she was just like
was explaining what she should have just
explained to me when I before we got
there because I you know what I'm saying
like you want to be prepared you want to
know what you're walking into like I
don't know what and the reason why that
matters is because like if a person
thinks you like him or if a person
thinks that you know you come in there
and y'all been talking on a different
kind of level and then you acting funny
when you know you never know because
they're under the influence he could get
pissed off at her and be thinking she's
faking and it could be a whole different
kind of ball game and maybe I think way
too much when it comes to situational
situations like that but it's because
I'm deal and I'm dealt
I've heard you know so many crazy-ass
stories that happen to girls when
they're out that I don't take anything
for granted
like soon is a red flag pop up like
nigga I am on it taught C's on it I
don't play that because my biggest fear
is getting great drugs and I don't take
signs for granted like you know I'm
saying sorry if there's a sign I'm gonna
be like I'm gonna be on it and I'm gonna
let my homegirl know so but I mean I'd
be trying to like not be so crazy about
it because I don't want to like cut the
move but if it's gonna cause us to be in
somebody's trunk by then the night of
course I might still say something
whether you think I'm being a debbie
downer or whatever the case may be so
that's why I kind of was like waiting to
see like what was going on I know I
haven't set my drink she may have sip
something with hers but we before we got
out but I didn't see her sip it so when
this is all this stuff is registered in
my hand while we walk in he's behind us
to be going outside
it happened so fast we didn't even stay
in the house but maybe like 20 minutes
because I was I was already on it like I
said so um when we get outside on the
balcony heat like I try and take her to
the sideline turn around I was just like
yo I'm not dumb he's literally like
y'all still babysitting that drink oh oh
just down there just thinking like oh
boy
nobody's trying to force no chick to
drink a journey you poured enough
alcohol in a drink
the shorties gonna get drunk no matter
what they don't matter if she drink it
slow she drink it fast she's gonna get
drunk depending on how much liquor you
put in there so if you rushing me to
drink a drink some is wrong with the
drink Oh as I said that shit I was like
bro there's Molly in this dream what
there is Molly or ecstasy and Molly has
ecstasy in it anyway it's just a mixture
of all kinds of crazy as drugs you can
drink it if you want to but bitch I took
my drink over the balcony I threw that
shit and I was like but I'm ready to go
and here here's where it got worse
my he cool bitch right now it's late
which one you wanna drop of a dime and
it was it was switch up on your like
that but he just thought it adenoids
malarkey and then this is what she
really believed me so homeboy and we
just like why would we go back to a
hotel when we already add your kids
right now you want to be this we don't
want to be here don't see the fish in
this lag but this was the dad will y'all
body headband me like it's gonna be
another so she likes you hold on
downtown I'm gonna come y'all can hop in
my car
corneas ass person that I we've dealt
with all summer we don't don't even need
to be around it cuz he don't even know
how to play the game right
just leave car here go to Atlanta and
Calvin or you to be just this cool
humble eyes down-to-earth person to get
us you know to our car later one that
night
that's basically what drew the line
right there she touched her drink over
and she was just like no we're not going
anywhere with you we're actually gonna
leave now
and
moral of the story time girl is if you
feel like you know you are already in
sub situation
don't don't second-guess that fill in
you know we're women and we have
instincts and we need to trust our gut
instinct when we first feel that shit
started that kind of went all the way
left because I'm not being on your P's
and Q's like you are and you might not
even be the type of person to be on
their P's and Q's like that but um you
know whoever you decide that you want to
kick away for the night when this
acquaintances a homegirl
a best friend you know y'all need to be
looking out for each other cuz there's
always some creeps like that in the
world
that's just a way for young girls to
slip up and you don't even have to be
y'all just women in period to slip up so
they can slip you something in your
drink and it will be Wow and I can't
fault anybody for not listening to you
you can only like take care of yourself
at the end of the night and that's why
it's always best for if you are going
out with somebody have your own uber
cats or have your own width because if
it went left like if she continued being
my girl you're tripping um that's not
even who he is that's not even in his
character but I'm telling y'all all the
signs that I told y'all right now I bet
you you y'all gonna be able in the
comments be like oh yeah he was geeking
oh yeah he did something and that's just
common sense that comes to me but in
that situation nine times out of ten
girls be thinking like dudes are really
not even about you know that life and
girl will piss me off the most is like
bitch I'm your friend
he's not your friend like that's not
your friend and he was
he's thinking about so don't come to me
talking about some oh I don't think he's
like that how do you know so if if
that's even in my head you should be
like I kinda like cut her off or
whatever but I was working on myself
because I'm so quick to cut somebody off
and just like keep it pushing and never
really talk to them ever again
I really tried to change that way about
me but you can't gamble off of somebody
that you met one time thinking that they
have the best intentions for you so be
careful when you go out into this world
be really careful and be careful who you
are friends with and especially friends
that put you in crazy-ass predicaments
more than just a couple of times because
you ought to look at it how they care
about themselves like first of all why
are you keep why are you keep putting
yourself in situations like this and
it's just like okay well maybe that's a
sign from God telling me stay away from
you and that's how you can look at it
and that's how you should look at it and
no matter if that person feels like you
know you ain't down or you ain't you
know you this and you that because you
just don't want to can be dead by the
end of the night with them who gives a
thing like you don't want that's gonna
be surviving you know saying you got
shit to lose they probably don't they
probably just think it for the moment
and I'm not somebody that just needs to
be thinking for the moment you know what
I'm saying like I have going for myself
and I don't have time to be getting
caught up and crazy and you just don't
want to be out here slacking slacking
and tripping you know I'm here to share
their story for multiple reasons not to
batch the person that put me through it
and it's on delete honestly to just
share my experience that it could have
it it almost happened to me mom and it
sucks because
you don't want to think that people want
to take advantage of you like that but
you can't be a naive and oblivious to it
either because that's how you get
yourself caught up in those situations
and board knows if you can get yourself
out of it you know what I'm saying but
thankful enough that you know I was the
smart one
and no I'm not cool with that girl no
more and that's really not why I'm even
making this story but I'm sure you guys
are gonna ask me and don't ask me why
we're not cool anymore because it really
doesn't matter you wish the best of
people
yeah so that's that so wonder why he
doing it shit like that cuz he's ugly
you gonna be sayin so that's why it
really didn't even I didn't even second
think the situation like I didn't
second-guess my my thought process like
I was just like oh no honey upstairs
forever can't find um coming out looking
all squirrely like mm-hmm
nope I already know what time it is baby
boy a bitch it's still in down and out
again so I think I should give me some
baby hair that's just so I can like
camouflage this area right here what do
you guys think yeah right so let me do
that before I get off the cameras before
I have to go out and you guys can just
see how I did that cuz yeah this is not
where is that right now they probably
got messed up cuz I had a car for
earlier
kinda like a little crazy when I just
went back and watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
