I hope you guys are excited about my
colorful background I was just like
something has to change in my videos
because I'm over it
so I decided that I'm gonna go to one
I'm gonna I'm gonna start putting up my
backgrounds and if you guys are
interested in where I get my backgrounds
from I just go to the what does it call
the fabric store and I get backgrounds
from there today is going to be about
beauty hacks life hacks and I'm just
gonna get ready in the process and I
don't know if I'm going to talk through
telling you guys the products that I'm
using but I probably will do so because
I it's not that hard to multitask
I don't think actually went shopping
went retail therapy shopping because I
was just over today in general but I'm
fine now quaint or a tip that I can give
you is primer primer is so freaking
important guys so back in the day I
didn't realize how important primer was
now make sure you get a primer that is
glorifying it's not a word it has that
quality that it blurs out your skin it
blurs out your imperfections and it just
makes a nice canvas for yourself to work
one when you are applying your
foundations and stuff I finally got my
hands on the NARS long-wear Foundation
natural radiant long wear foundation and
this is in the shade Macao now this is
the most popular shade I don't know
about your Sephora but this shade is
always sold out about every Sephora that
I would call will be sold out and
finally this is the last one so it was
meant to be so I was very excited so
this is the first time I am using this
foundation so if you are trying to get
you a popping lovely pop and glowy type
effect going on with your skin and just
wanted to look luminous and healthy and
happy and glowy because why wouldn't you
want that for your skin strobe cream is
definitely the key to that so I like
putting a little bit on the back of my
hand and then I like taking my Beauty
Blender and I like stippling that on my
face I just like using this all over my
face and I'm in the shade gold light now
there's probably four other shades that
you can pick up but I feel like go like
complements my skin complexion want to
show you guys how I do my layout on my
face so I don't have to you know go too
overboard with the foundation which can
cause you to look really cakey if you
don't be careful or how much you put on
your face in some areas you don't need a
lot of foundation not something others
saying you don't need a lot of
foundation it's about how you apply it
and if you apply it the right way your
product can last a lot longer so you
know I'm here to save you a coin or two
sis I always try to find me a new
concealer but I seem to always go back
and gravitate towards this one and this
is the LA girl Pro concealer I'm in the
shade fun but I like overdoing my
highlight so I always seem to get cool
tan in my hands and I've recently picked
up almond but I feel like ma man is way
too pink for me I don't know so I'm
gonna stick with cool tan today because
why not and I I tried to use the NARS
and I do use an R sometimes but I really
have to be in the mood to using the NARS
concealer creamy creamy concealer yeah
by Lauren NARS it's a really good
product but I feel like it's it's hyped
up and this product I feel like it does
a lot more for me and I feel like the
NARS concealer it's like empty as soon
as you buy it I don't know what the fuck
goes on with them putting product in
that little you know container but I
just feel like there's nothing in it
this is my a BH foundation stick in this
shade walnut' and I'm just putting it in
the hollows of my cheek on my temples my
forehead make sure I get in the baby
hair areas because you don't want any
line demarcation because that's going to
look crazy a little bit on my nose down
the side of my nose
and right here I usually put it
underneath my lip but I seem to always
forget to blend that out so I don't have
time to forget today and what I'm going
to do next is blend this out so if your
beauty blender is drying I don't know
what you're doing with your life we
can't be friends but maybe next shift
try it if you haven't been trying it
damp and damp meaning like there's no
water coming out of it and if there's
water coming out of it you haven't done
your job fully and squeezing it out so
what I'm gonna do is just blend out my
concealer first because when I go in to
blend out my contour second it's not
going to be any harsh lines and when it
is harsh lines you know it's going to be
easily to fix that so anyway so as you
can see I'm blending this contour up and
down around the temples and we're just
going to make sure everything is blended
out and looking seamless and there's no
harsh lines anything and I'm also gonna
go over that line that we stopped
blending out the concealer with our
Beauty sponge just go over it so there's
no harsh lines same thing with the chin
area and this just makes everything look
like you know it kind of belongs on my
face and just make sure you blend this
area out and don't drag this down here
because your contour is going to be
darker than your foundation so if you
drag it down to your neck a little bit
too much your neck is going to start
looking red and then it's gonna look
like you don't have the right foundation
or I've done that so many times and if I
so I'm just going to use the tip of that
beauty blenders just to blend out my
concealer and I definitely missed the
beauty blender because it's a little bit
more precise than the real technique the
real technique is just kind of too wide
so I know you're like where's your
foundation take this tiny amount and
what I'm going to do is put it
underneath my contour because this is
where I need the most coverage so say if
I put the foundation on first then
topped it with the contour then topped
it with all the powders I'm gonna have
too much product on my face and I don't
know what made me start doing my makeup
like this but I just started realizing
like I didn't need a lot of foundation
back in the day and I'm going to just
over using my foundation so I kind of
just found this way was just so so much
more easier and it also makes sense to
me a lot more because I didn't need all
of that foundation one of you guys asked
me like how do I motivate myself to go
to the gym don't think about it cuz as
soon as you think about it you're going
to give yourself ten thousand excuses
you're gonna think about ten thousand
things that you really feel like you
need to be doing other than going to the
gym just add that shit to your life
routine and don't think about it too
hard just get up and go and that has
helped me so much and that's just not
about the gym like whatever it is that
you want to do don't just sit there and
think about it like of course you know
plot plan but execute the plan at the
weight that I'm okay with and I don't
really push I'm going to the gym like
that a lot but I still need to go to the
gym like I don't need to lose it and I
don't mean to like know start slacking
it because what you put in your body
like really affects you like your the
other day I have this love-hate
relationship with Zaxby's and I only
hate it because it's so freaking good
that I can't stay away from it but soon
as I hate that you're not having a
Zaxby's and almost like three months
soon as I get it
I felt terrible I mean to look back at
this video one day and be like alright
bitch like yes you don't need to eat
Vesco but it has that impact when you
just feel like a slug you feel like you
don't want to do anything you just want
to go to sleep and you need to pay
attention to that to that like after you
eat it how do you feel if you feel like
shit that's when you know you need to
stop eating it ok because we're only
getting older out here hello just
spinach banana strawberries probably
some berries and I like putting like
almond milk or you can put like orange
juice in it just things that make you
feel like you're doing right by your
body so I'm getting my greens in there
because I love love love spinach I
pretty much I'm trying to become a
pescetarian because I really don't care
for me and if I am me me it's when I go
out to eat or if I fuck around and try
to get fast food for that day but like I
can live with just eating shrimp and
fish literally alright to drink three
bottles a day don't think about it cut
out the juice cut out the sweets cut off
the sodas I don't drink soda at all like
that's a dove but like I don't do
something because as soon as I see a
bump on my face I already know it's
because it's so and you guys sometimes
be asking me like what do i do at the
gym I get straight on the Stairmaster
the Stairmaster it's the first thing I
do then I go to this little bar Bell
kind of situation thing I don't even
know that's what you call it but it's
this thing that you pull like you can do
this with it or you can go up with it or
you can pull it down I like going to
that next and I like doing my squats I
thinking about doing a Brazilian butt
lift and get my boobs done you guys may
judge me or whatever the case may be but
listen I've always said the shit you
guys just didn't know that I was
thinking this shit because you know I
really wasn't talking to you guys at one
point and sometimes in certain outfits I
don't like how my boobs look and that's
why I would be getting a boob job but
then I'd be thinking like I want to be
able to breastfeed my child so
whoa you know saying and of course is
not necessary but you get what I'm
saying like if I want to do what I want
to do it but if I don't have to I don't
have to so I'm still going hard in the
gym I'm gonna go hard of course but I'm
gonna go harder of course so you know I
don't have to do and I keep a coin in my
pocket but at the same time like I said
if it's something that when I do I'm
just here to share with you know what
may be coming in the future you know I'm
so I couldn't find my other backup
charger but I found it so we're back in
action as you can see my brows are
already done but I haven't outlined them
so I'm gonna outline them in a second
I'll probably outline them after I do
this I look I don't know what I think
I'm gonna do
I bought something new today and I spent
$160 at a mall kiosk for this right here
okay hey I am in love with this little
guy this is the 30 inch what waist
waistband and it's just supposed to
basically of course like you know shape
your body shape your waist give you a
slimmer appearance in the waist area
flatter tummy you can get this one I
also purchased this one online and it's
actually from sweet sweat if you follow
me on snapchat or Instagram you might
have seen me post a picture with this
but this is definitely a gym you see
incident results because this is my
first time wearing this one that I'm
wearing right now I haven't went to the
gym with it yet but I wore this once at
the gym multiple times and I literally
had to take this off day too like in the
mid in Mid workout because I was about
to barf because I was just so hot this
made me so hot but it did the job
literally like when I took it off I was
like sweating like bullies playing I
told my best friend and my mom about
this and they actually bought it and
they loved it as well so I will put the
link in the description box below no
this is not a sponsored video I'm just
telling you guys
some hacks some beauty hacks some life
hacks for you guys and if you are a gym
goer you also probably would love these
little things I get these little raps
from a beauty supply store and you just
put you know put it over your head like
this and if you have a front or anything
like that you know this can definitely
help with your frontals if you want a
smaller one so it can't really get the
job done or I wouldn't understand how
this can get the job done more than this
one because this one's a little wider
and yeah but still if you guys want this
one you can get this one from your
supply store too hopefully but I will
put the information into the GE x1 that
I have in the description box below
leave that apple cider vinegar alone if
you have problematic skin I don't have
time for it so I found out that that's
just making our skin worse it's making
our like dark marks even more darker yes
it's killing the bump itself because of
all of the terrible you know ingredients
that it you know it hasn't it and it I
wouldn't say it's terrible but it's
terrible for our face and I found this
out because I talked to like a
dermatologist pretty much that's
basically what she is and she was just
my girl we used that to my cleanse and
tenderize and just basically kill
bacteria on me so why would you use
apple cider vinegar for your face
the reason why I'm bringing up skincare
is because I do want to let you guys
know if you do have like a bump that's
coming or you know coming on your face
or you still ain't like coming to the
surface I love this glam glow clearing
treatment mask
literally I put like this I kind of use
this as like a spa treatment more so as
a mask like yeah sometimes I do use it
as a mess but now that my skin has kind
of like calm down I don't like using
this all over my face because I feel
like it's unnecessary but like spa
treatment you know you feel a bump
coming on just take a little bit of this
on a q-tip and put it on you know
specific area and your bomb will be gone
my best friend shoutout to you she
actually got this for me for I want to
say Christmas it actually came like gift
set so I got all the I got all the masks
this is the biggest one that I got and
the other ones are mini versions and the
lady that actually has been helping me
get my discoloration off of my skin she
told me to start using this one a lot
more which is the youth mud exfoliating
treatment mask and she also gave me two
other masks to use but she told me to
start off with this one and this one
that one actually helps get off you know
the acne that's coming as well I love
this almond oil I use this to you know
Gries me up make my skin look flawless
and I use this on my body not my face
and I've been seeing a huge difference
in my skin and it's about that time for
our skin to be sure ladies so if you
want something on the natural side don't
want you know your pores to be clogged
up if you have back acne or chest acne I
definitely think that and you still want
to look good and glossed up instead of
using baby oil that clogs your pores I
definitely would recommend you using
this it's just supposed to nourish and
promote healthy looking skin and I also
want you guys to know about these
miracle drops this is the Kaleidoscope
miracle drops if you haven't heard about
these you probably just really kind of
been onto the rock the woman actually
says that her name is bebe Judi and
she's on Instagram she has her own
website and she has like an edge control
and those drops but those drops are the
most popular drops they're supposed to
basically help ensure that your hair is
growing thicker if you have any patches
or bald spots or your hairs thinning put
those drops on and she recommends you
just dab it on there and not squeeze it
because it does have like a little
squeeze tube thingy and this is um it's
like you squeeze it out she feels like
you you're just overusing the product
and it's not a such thing as overusing
it you just are kind of like wasting the
product and you're not wasting it
because it's still going into your hair
but at the same time
be able to have longevity with that
product and it's only $20
I found mine at the beauty supply store
and I was so excited that they like
ordered a whole style whole stock
whatever you want to say I've only been
using that for about three days but I
can just tell like my hair in certain
areas is getting thicker because I have
really thin hair but one lease like all
my edges I shaved this side like maybe
like three years ago and that was
because I have went like white like a
completely white like my hair was white
and I was braiding my hair so I had to
shave this side of my head because I was
not about to walk around with thin as
edges so I went MJ bald Michael Jordan
ball cuz right here was where I just
couldn't do with my hair everything else
was okay
but this son of my edges was fried okay
like fried that's basically what I did
not shave my hair off and I remember my
my ex walked into the bathroom and he
was like are you going through something
right now and I was just like no my hair
is ridiculous and it wasn't just
scissors that I cut my hair with I took
a full a full eyebrow razor and I have
this right here because I wanted to put
this in my beauty hack - if you guys are
interested in like just doing your own
brows and you need to touch them up and
you don't really want anybody to fuck
them up get one of these a dollar at the
VA supply store but anyway back to the
story I took this and I literally skint
my whole head says like so all of this
all of this was bald okay but my baby
here is still there let me tell you I
pick up hella lay doing the dumbest shit
like last night I was up filming my
Valentines Day look right and then I had
to get up really early this morning like
7 o'clock early and
well six o'clock I set my alarm for 6:00
but um I could not go to sleep so I
ended up going to bed at 5:30 in the
morning
but before I could even go to sleep I
was literally looking at people's net
worths
I was looking up everybody's Network
like net worth what why why is that the
other I know somebody hacks me before if
they feel like you know cleaning up your
brows first before doing them makes a
difference it makes a huge difference
because the way you clean up your brows
your clean them your cleaning them up to
to the shape that you want them to be so
when you go to fill them in and I you
know kind of like shake them up a little
bit more and have your tail a little
longer you guys know what that whole
process it just looks really really
clean you don't have any likes you know
stray hairs or you know groaning hairs
all over the place and what I like doing
is just going back over this area
I think I want to talk to you guys about
not having my dad around soon so if you
guys want to hear like a story tell me
about my dad because I feel like people
and select fathers know like what the
fuck that does to their kids like I
don't consider my dad and Debbie dad I
just feel like there's some shit going
on with him that he hasn't got all
finished chess because like you know I
just don't feel like my dad is that dad
that would just be doing this for no
reason and maybe it is and maybe I'm
because he's my dad but at the same time
I just want him to understand and I feel
like my outlet would be through a video
like that let him know like no one's
upset with you and the only person that
is upset with you is yourself because
you're doing that shit to yourself and I
know it's not allowing you to sleep well
and night like I know that his dad
wasn't in his life and my mom's dad
wasn't in her life and now my dad is not
in my life like but you know it just
makes me stronger than the day and I
don't use that to you know handicap
myself or hold me back from doing
certain things but it would be nice to
talk to my other parent as much as I do
there's no way that you're able to sleep
at night when you have a 22 year old
daughter out in the real world living or
her own mic and you're just not
wondering what she's doing I don't
believe that life is too short to be
going about life in this way right but
you know
to those who have their dad appreciate
it because there's people like me that
wish that I can talk to my dad every
single day and I can't and it used to
bother me a lot but I don't let it
bother me anymore whole other
conversation but trust me if you're out
there going through the same thing as me
girl we're gonna get through it
don't use that to be a handicap
situation don't use that as a crutch
like use that shit as motivation to be
like yo one day like my dad is gonna
want to talk to me because gonna be so
proud of me one day that he's gonna have
to like just show love you know no sand
just pop up just let me know that he's
he's proud of me
my cheeks so guys know I like using
eyeshadows as like bronzer or blush
it's almost egg nunna and a little bit
of Sakia I don't know girls don't get me
to start trying to say these damn names
and pop on some lashes and then I'll
come back with the outfit tease my
trainer is still on I feel like I'm
getting snatched another beauty tip if
you want big Tatas okay ain't it's get
you a bra from Victoria's Secret
it's the bombshell bra and gives you two
cup sizes up so it can make it look like
you've got a boob job but remember it
does come off at night your bras are
supposed to come up come off at night oh
yes so I'm actually gonna take this off
now because I'm about to put my pants on
and I meet him from zoomies they have
like this highs at the bottom so you can
have them really scrunched up and they
have the drawstring at the top so you
can have them scrum scrunched up as well
at the crop turtleneck these pants
get heavy like this semester your bun
with the pants on that trainer got my
freaking stomach snatched sis so you
definitely need to check it out I think
I gave you a lot of pointers in this
video you guys might see me in a white
shirt and a blonde wig because I don't
know if I'm feeling like the black top
with the black hair I don't know the
life of a person that does their own
hair size you can switch your shit up
whenever you want to and by the way
those colada Kaleidoscope drop some
miracle drops this has my hair extremely
soft like really read says like reading
is so important I actually picked up a
new book called never get angry again I
just you can tell your girl kind of has
like an anger problem a little bit just
a little bit because I've been through a
lot of dumb shit with people and I just
want to be able to control that like I
don't have I go truing a problem and I
just spaz out on everybody but there are
certain ways that you can deal with a
certain situation so you don't have to
get out of character and of course I'm
not the type of person thinking I
character unless I feel like it's really
necessary but at the same time you
should still be able to not even get out
of character at all because you don't
want to waste your energy on something
so negative like that and you always
want to have a positive outlook and you
also want to be able to do with certain
people because if worlds collide and
that person has an anger problem and you
have an anger problem it's not going to
go well and you have to be a bigger
person sometimes so once again it's
called never get angry again David Jay
Lim Berman and you can find this at
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's and it was only 25
dollars so definitely get your hands on
this if you are interested so get a good
read a really good book okay my thoughts
about the foundation because I do magic
know that it's really really nice really
nice and I said my skin looks like
second skin of course you know all this
action is on it you know it just looks a
little bit more glam but if I just
applied this without all of this extra
nets it would look like skin on me that
and I like the color matching Macao is
definitely my color it's not too red
it's not too yellow and I don't have to
go in-between so yeah the top is from I
want to say forever 21 this is a super
old top I wore this top well I got this
top during the time I was working in
Victoria's Secret because we had to wear
all black the top is from the toy secret
the earrings are from Aldo's the pants
the pants the pants are from soomi's the
pants are from zoomies and i think
that's pretty much it that you'll
probably be wondering about but once
again I love you babes and I appreciate
you guys so much I love you bye
