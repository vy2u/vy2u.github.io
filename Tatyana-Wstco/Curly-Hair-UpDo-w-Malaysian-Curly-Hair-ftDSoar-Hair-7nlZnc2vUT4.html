Thanksgiving and I just wanted to come
on and basically share with you guys to
hear that I am going to be wearing for
Thanksgiving so this is the soar hair I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
going to show you guys the makeup look
and I'm also going to just show you guys
how every being with his hair just to
make it look like this and that's just
by running some water on it I was gonna
put my hair back in the style that
you're gonna see how I had it with my
bandana in a second but I have to kind
of wait until it dries a little bit just
for it to do that because I don't want
to have the hair super wet but I don't
know I might go ahead and just do it for
you guys right now
all right baby love so this is the look
that I actually was talking to you guys
about but I'm gonna prep my skin and add
some foundation on before we get into
this hair so the two foundations that
I'm using for this look today is the
next total control foundation in
cappuccino and caramel and the reason
why I'm mixing those two together is
because my melanin is not as popping and
rich like it was in the summertime so
cappuccino is a little bit too red for
me but caramel is way too light so I
just like mixing the two to get my
perfect undertone and it works for me it
may look a little light but I'm gonna go
in with some contour and all of that
just to bring everything together so
yeah so don't worry I am using a real
technique Beauty Blender to stipple this
in and of course it's damp by the way
I'm gonna go in with the LA girl Pro
concealer just to conceal and to
highlight so I dragged it down a little
further than you would if you were just
to conceal your under eyes and once
again that's just because I like
highlighting as well making sure
everything looks bright and you know
awakened on me so I'm gonna go in with
the NW 50 concealer from mac to contour
and also bring some color back into our
face and this is what I'm talking about
this is just add some dimension
structured definition all of that good
stuff and work back into your skin
because foundation just by itself can
look really flat and you can look you
know not as sculptured as you really are
in the face so that's why I like using
this product you know to do all those
things that I just mentioned so what I'm
gonna do is add a little bit more of
that concealer and that's just because
I'm extra and I like making sure I'm
bright underneath there but you know I
still
look really put together if that makes
sense just because the concealer is not
super super light like I usually do
sometimes but anyway I'm gonna go in
with my Laura Mercier to set that
concealer so it won't crease and move
around and I'm gonna do my wing lashes
off of camera it's just so hard to try
to do something like that on camera but
I used my ELF liquid liner and that's
like my favorite liquid liner and it's
kaliya dollars so yeah and I've just put
some clear lip gloss on and my lashes
are from Mac I don't know the number but
I've spent $17 on these and I really
really like them they're really dramatic
and usually if I'm wearing this look
this makeup look I try to go for like a
dramatic wing or a dramatic lash and I
think both today and by the way Happy
Thanksgiving
I love you guys so much my family is
like you'reyou're doing videos on things
given and I was just like I gotta you
know make sure I say hey what's up it
was poppin to my family on here and yeah
so I think I did up tutorial last
Thanksgiving so if you guys are gonna
see that one I will list it in the
description box below that's the way
about this hair this is from the sort
here this is their Malaysian curly this
is a way so I made a wig the other night
and I actually put annoying Instagram
that Instagram story so if you guys seen
that you've probably already you know
seeing how it looked down but
all right babes before I got off of this
camera I didn't want to talk to you guys
about the hair and how I'm feeling about
it a little bit more the hair is really
soft I have to say that and that is one
of the pros to this hair one con that I
have is there is a slight smell when I
did receive this hair and when I applied
the water into it it kind of like
enhanced the smell I went in and co-wash
the hair and the hair actually calmed
down with the smell it's a distinct
smell it's not anything like - corn chip
ish it's nothing that you can't stand
I'm just shampoo and conditioner hair
and it will be fine I put some
straightener I put a straightener to
this hair just to see if it revert back
to its texture and it did as you can see
water just does the trick with this hair
so very simple and easy to maintain hair
is always a plus during this time of the
month but I love you guys so much and
I'll see you babies in my next video the
soar hair will be linked in the
