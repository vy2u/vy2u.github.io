video and I have some very hair in today
so of course you guys know that I did
the unboxing video for this hair company
already this is an Aliexpress hair
company and I do have their Brazilian
curly hair clearly doesn't leak early
right now because this is basically what
I did in this video
layering it cut it put some banks in it
and all of that fun stuff so hopefully
you enjoyed this video I did start off
with the hair cut over like a little
long in the beginning I mean I can just
do a video of how I'm going to cut these
bangs so just in case you guys see me
rocking this hair you can buy clothes ah
see how did you get your bangs or how
did you cut your bangs
let me go on video and let me just do it
for them let me show them and let's do
something else fun to the hair I'm
trying to do something different because
you know it's curly hair everybody knows
what like curly hair looks like so I
just wanted to take it the extra
Malick's soft is not even the word word
like beautiful like really beautiful and
this is a Brazilian curly hair you guys
know I'm a sucker for some Brazilian
hair
I don't branch out really too far from
Brazilian if I'm doing something
different it's probably Peruvian just
because I feel like Indian here is just
too thin and too and and then Brazilian
hair is just right for me cuz it blends
in with my hair really good and the
Peruvian hair is like if I get it from a
good company they're not really do like
a peruvian hair but anyway we're now
talking about all the next let's get
into this video because it may be long
I'm not sure but this is the outro and
the intro so hopefully you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye all right ladies let's jump
right in this is some her hair in it's
curly state natural curly stay I've
already washed it in the unboxing video
so I didn't do anything else to it and
as you can see I'm about to start
creating these bangs I chopped most of
the hair off and then I'm about to go in
and chop a little bit more but what you
want to do before you chop your bangs if
you have curly hair just blow your hair
out with a blow dryer first so you can
get all the curliness out of it and now
I'm gonna go in and snip this these
bangs you want to start really long so
just in case you make a mistake you can
go in and fix it versus you make them
them too short and then you're asked out
so yeah now I'm going to take my
Flatiron and curly hair under and I made
these bangs really freakin thick and I
was really upset because I try to avoid
doing that so much but I ended up having
to pin some of the hair back because I
just was not feeling it like I can't do
the Nicki Minaj bangs really can't but
just don't make the same mistake as me
if you don't like really thick things
try to make your hair until a smaller
triangle just like this one and then um
take a really small amount of hair and
then just spread the hair out because
this hair does get really big and then
just cut any pieces all that you need to
cut if they're too long whatever do your
thing and then I'm taking the hair down
and you'll be seeing me combing through
the hair with a paddle brush and this is
going to make it easier for me to
straighten this hair cuz that's what
I'll end up be that's what I'm gonna be
doing I'm trying to comb the hair out
starting from bottom to top so I don't
know take out a lot of hair due to
detangling but this hair is super soft
so it's really easy to detangle with the
paddle brush as you can see and then I'm
gonna be taking the blow dryers who like
straighten it a little bit more with the
blow dryer so when I go in with the flat
iron it's not so much work for me even
though it's still gonna be a lot of work
so that's why I didn't put a lot of the
shearing part in this hair because you
guys know how to straighten your hair
just use a comb like a fine-tooth comb
don't use a paddle brush like you see me
doing in a second I don't even know why
I was doing that I was clearly getting
desperate because the hair wasn't
straight and fast enough for me do that
in a second after doing all this extra
stuff that I'm doing
oh I drink like a fish watch that BAM so
now I'm feeling like Diana right here
still blowing the hair out clearly take
some time take some time and then now
I'm going in I'm straightening the hair
as you can see the front is a little bit
more straight than the back I was using
a comb paddle brush I was using that
round brush I was using everything to
get this hair straight takes a very long
time and it still didn't get as straight
as I wanted it to but I just didn't
really care I ended up starting to put I
ended up curling the hair because I
wanted the hair really bone straight so
I can see if it can get really bone
straight but it just takes too freaking
long and I just didn't have the time so
now I'm just curling the hair under
clearly you see me do this like so many
times
I'm starting to like Lehrer and frame my
face at the same time as I curl it just
so the process can go a little faster
and yeah this is basically what I'm
going to be doing to stumper hair I
really do love this hair it's really
soft and fluffy and it makes me freakin
happy and I get so many compliments when
I go out with this hair but all that
information will be in the description
box below if you're interested in
purchasing and thank you so much for
watching
here's holding up when I was rocking the
hair and this curly stay of course it
didn't do anything wrong to me um I
didn't get any shedding any no tangling
or anything like that the only use a lot
of cut the hairs because I didn't want
to work with 28 inches like doing all of
this stuff and I did want to layer this
hair so I just cut off pretty much a lot
of hair even though this hair is curled
what how how long it is now it's like to
my ribs so yeah I'm 5 4 5 3 5 3 5 4
somebody asked me that in my last video
so that's basically what it's going
Russian strums
from my beauty supply store it it says
dying in it I love how big these curls
so I haven't done this who any like
really good textured hair in a long time
like really go in and style it so I'm
really wanting to do that with this hair
because I do have another hair texture
that's like this in our closet and I
didn't want to ruin that hair bob is
like Wilson's I have two of the similar
textures I can do something different
with this hair
I'm not going to be washing this hand
anytime soon just because these curls so
poppin yeah filling for these
fellini-esque maybe I should do a Selena
tutorial if you guys don't know I'm in
love with living the way she planned for
each thank you so much for watching
ladies may found you another video maybe
I'll do another video what do you think
let me know get your white feeder this
is what happens when you have a
boyfriend it's like you just don't want
to wear anything else but their clothes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
