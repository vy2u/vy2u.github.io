it's coming down and out again those
looks so gross
like I told myself that I wasn't gonna
get my nails done until I snatched this
all to get a full set and I just never
got around to it
and I've been dying and all kinds of
crazy stuff and you guys know that
gloves usually rip a hole and um because
my pointy stilettos so I was not trying
to do a full set and then have died all
over my nails again but I'll probably
rather have done that rather than
walking around looking like a psychopath
all right so let me talk to you guys
about this hair really quick before I
get off of this camera because there's
not much that I need to do to it other
than you know just rebuffing it
restricting it
yeah so this hair is actually from
West's hair and I probably have some
clips floating around show you guys how
to dye this frontal I did that and I
dyed it ash brown light ash brown felt
like it really wasn't enough to make
this look a little realistic on me then
I did medium ash brown that I did dark
ash brown so it was three different
times that I use to achieve this look
and it's dark enough for me personally
you can always go darker but I just
wanted to
before I end up sabotaging this hair and
you want something crazy to it and then
I didn't really like how it turned out
but I really really love this hair guys
like this is some true really great
quality 6:13 this is actually 24 inches
I put some layers in this hair and all
of that dye that frontal and the frontal
is still holding up really good I didn't
receive any Nathan or tingling or
shedding I'm not about a 10 when I'm
working with 6:13 hair I'm in the past I
was always receiving something that was
crazy but just recently I've had some
two really good companies that actually
sit me some really good 6:13 hair so I'm
really excited to share that with you
guys because I don't I don't really
think that I actually have Rob 613 here
on my channel yet because of that reason
but trust me if I'm showing you guys if
I'm sure you got 613 here right now in
the flesh it's because I like it because
trust me I had many companies that said
that their 613 here was the same quality
as their virgin body way virgin
brazilian whatever the case may be and
then it gets to me and there's just all
kinds of crazy and then their main
excuses because I wanted to go with the
super long length and super long glimpse
usually have really bad quality hair and
that makes no sense
to me personally because why would you
even want to sell anything that's bad
quality and have you get a negative
review so you definitely have to gamble
and take your chances with a lot of
companies that sell 6:13 hair because
you will experience that but I'm not
experiencing that with West's hair now I
lightly slightly did some toning to the
frontal you probably really can't tell I
plan on toning it a little bit more I
don't want to tone it with any real
toner what I'm gonna do is just use some
purple shampoo to cancel out any yellow
brassiness going on and of course you
want to continue to do that when you
start seeing the hair getting a little
dingy or whatever and the reason why you
know here we get dingy on me is because
I'm a brown skinned girl and you know
make up may hit the hair whatever the
case may be assault yeah you have to
really keep up the care on 6:13 here be
put some layers in the hair and like I
said the hair is holding up really
really nice I've had this hair in for
almost like a week now so I was able to
wear it out and you know dancing in and
doing all that kind of jazz and I had to
actually co wash this hair because I
went out one night and it was smoking
like crazy in this club and um my hair
smell like a pack of cigarettes like it
was ridiculous find uh you know Co wash
it and blow it out and that's when you
can really know if some 6:13 hair is
really good like if you have to
manipulate it wash it do whatever the
case that you know do whatever to get it
back to its you know natural state and
if it reverts back to how beautiful it
was when you first receive it then that
means it's some really good hair now if
you go and try to blow it out and
straighten it and then it starts acting
a fool that's when you know it's like
about that time for you to complain or
you know see if you can get your money
back but let me know if you worked with
West's hair before cuz I would love to
know you guys opinion because I'm
experiencing great things this is a 20
inch frontal or an 18 inch frontal I'm
not sure but of course all of the
information to this hair will be listed
in the description box below and wanting
to come on and share with you guys
whiskas hair for the one time one time
here's how it looks again this is really
really nice guys and I don't have any
complaints about it so I had to yeah so
this is basically how it looks so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching babes and if you guys
want another story time for me let me
know in the comment section below
I had another one in my head who and I
started talking about this one but I
think I forgot a are so I think I should
give me some baby hairs just so I can
like camouflage this area right here
what do you guys think yeah right so let
me do that
off the camera before I have to go out
and you guys can just see how I did that
because yeah this is not where is that
right now it probably kind of got messed
up cuz I had a scarf winner earlier so
I'm gonna just use my hair to brush and
some water low crazy mutters went back
no watch that's a lot better isn't it
all right so I think we got it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
