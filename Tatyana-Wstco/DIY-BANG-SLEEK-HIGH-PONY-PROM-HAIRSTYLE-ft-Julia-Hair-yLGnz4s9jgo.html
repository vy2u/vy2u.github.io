today I'm going to be doing this
affordable look for you guys if you're
interested to see how I got this look
this fox bang and really sleek ponytail
I think this is gonna be so cute for you
doing prom as you can see I'm doing it
on myself so that means that you can do
it on yourself sis you don't have to go
to a professional you don't have to go
eggs
you know shanaynay down the streets do
it for you before you go to prom you
should be able to just finesse this by
yourself because it's really really
simple so I hope you guys can take
something from it and yeah it's really
self explanatory so I'm just using eco
styling gel just to slick up my hair and
just put it in a baby top not because I
needed to get out of the way because I
am gonna be doing my sleep ponytail
typical but I just wanted to add a
little bit more character with it with
the little fox bang and I'm gonna be
using like this little ghost ring so
just jazz up the high ponytail you are
going to need some wig caps to create
this well just to protect you are gonna
need a wig cap to protect your hair from
the glue yes the glue will still get
onto your hair but it's not directly on
to your hair you understand so it's just
not going to Snug and rip and tuck onto
your hair follicles and cause too much
damage you know you don't want to do
this every day but once again if you're
looking for something affordable for
prom
you know summertime springtime whatever
you want to say this is what you need
okay so a little bonding glue won't hurt
your sisters make sure you get the
remover or you can always use shampoo
and conditioner and a little bit of
olive oil soak that up in there and
just you know it's just slide right off
yeah so you want to always go in with
your blow-dryer to just make sure you
know the glue is completely dry before
you go to your next piece you don't see
me doing that right now because that was
just too much to be putting in the
videos but you know use the heat from
the blow-dryer
to secure this down honey because you
don't want it to be sliding anywhere
okay really really easy hairstyle you
just want to make sure that you're doing
stair steps and you also want to make
sure that your bang is going up into a
triangle so that means that this pieces
need to go
that means the pieces need to get
smaller and smaller the closer it gets
to your actual top not you know and this
is because the smaller the track the
easier is going to the easier that is
going to be the easier it's going to be
to hide it's two o'clock in the morning
you get a run trying to say so yeah and
also you're gonna probably be like okay
well when it gets to the last track how
am I going to hide that well if you did
it right the little the bundle we're
gonna use to create the long luscious
24-inch ponytail that should hide it
okay now if it's not hiding it you may
need to add another track you may need
to take away a track you may need to do
smaller pieces but as you can see you
know it's getting smaller up there for
me so it's really really simple I'm
going to pull out another bundle in a
second just to finesse the longer
ponytail but I just wanted to show you
guys how nice this texture is in its
natural state so I just blew it out just
a little bit so you guys can see it it
was looking rough because I actually
used giulia hair bundles a lot just to
do my updos because their hair matches
my hair texture really really nicely so
I'm sorry I didn't mention that this is
Julia
hair I'm using to create this look it is
an Aliexpress hair company I'm using 24
inches to create this look I'd say
receive four bundles or three bundles
from this hair company and I've been
using all of their bundles just to do
you know updos and cute little Styles
like this lately I have been using these
dumbass shears to do this hairstyle I
got them today actually as soon as I did
this video I went out just specifically
just to do this look so I bought these
thinking that they were going to be
popping in their trash so don't get
these I'm gonna go and return them and
get the more expensive one
I added the water for it to be easier
for me to cut into the hair because if
it was dry it's gonna look all ratchet
and blunt and weird so I wanted the size
to be longer than the middle so that's
kind of what I was given and I also went
in with some shears to thin the bang out
but if you're into a thick bang you know
keep it the density that it is but I
don't like a big bang at all girl I'm
not
I'm just gonna use my round brush and my
blow-dryer just to round brush my bang
out because that's super important to me
I like my bangs to look you know fluffy
and kind of natural-looking so I like
doing this step I didn't add any luster
or serum or anything like that on the
hair so you're gonna see how amazing
this hair is and I didn't even call wash
it or wash this hair this hair has been
through it all well this bundle has been
through it all but it's still giving
life so I'm here for it all you have to
remember is take care of your hair and
take care of your hair and if it's some
good hair is gonna go through the Ring
of Fire and still come out shining at
the end of the day but anyway we're
about to get into this 24 inch we're
just wrapping around the top not that we
have you want to make your top not as
small as possible okay that is key I
didn't make mine as small as I should
have because I just didn't have time to
redo it but um it's key especially if
your hair is really long you know
braiding it helps it get small but um
you know if your hair is on the thicker
side mine is on the finer side and I
still didn't get it as small as I needed
it to be but if your hair is on the
thicker side you need to make it as
small as possible because when you do
your wraparound method you want it to
look as you know natural as possible so
the smaller that your top knot is the
natural it's going to look on you know
you but anyway I'm just wrapping it
around you guys seen me do this a
million and one times take your time
make sure your web SART lining up with
each other you don't want anything
poking out or sticking out as you can
see I'm wrapping around several several
times and that's going to help hide that
last track at the top of my bang and
that's how simple that is it's really
really simple girl try it on yourself
try it on a friend try it on a mannequin
head whatever you need to do to feel
comfortable to do this look for your
