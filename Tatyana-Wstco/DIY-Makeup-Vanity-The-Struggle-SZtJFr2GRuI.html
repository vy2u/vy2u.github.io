another video today I'm going to be
sharing with you guys this DIY Vani
makeup station that I decided to create
for myself because your girl deserved it
I also wanted to put
you know keep some coins in my pocket
because you know getting a type of
dresser like this already like made it's
gonna be costly but I have fun making
this so bridge is gonna jump right into
it
everything will be listed in the
description box below
but yeah so here's what you're gonna
need you're gonna need to Alex drawers
from Michaels you're going to need a
piece a piece of wood and some white
paint and I got my piece of wood from
Lowe's and I got my white paint from
Michael's and only seven dollars for the
paint and this was a $30 board it's so
worth it I cut it down to 60 inches it's
a really really nice piece of wood this
is real wood so yeah you're also going
to need a piece of plexiglass also to go
on top of the wood so it could be a
really smooth clean surface now Alex
drawers are from Ikea like I said and I
try to basically put the base out to
show you guys the most important pieces
that you need to start working with so
it can be a lot easier for you so the
piece that I'm touching right now that
is the back of the board the pieces that
you see stuck up in the air those are
the sides of the board so how I got this
to be connected to each other is by
using the little two pieces the two
screws that you see on top of the white
board and yeah so how I get that to
stick together and be secure so it won't
fall down it's by using this screw right
here this circle screw and you're gonna
place it in little holes all six holes
that you see open and yeah this is just
how you're gonna secure it so like I
said those tools that you see right
they're not tools those screws that you
see right there that's what was holding
the drawers up in the air and I'd like
using an electric screwdriver because I
got this one from Target and it has
different heads so you can just remove
them and place the right one that you
need to screw things down and it just
saves a lot of time blood sweat and
tears and it just makes you feel like
you really know what you're doing girl
because that sound just be like oh
it's working
oh my god handyman dee Bob the Builder
we in here but anyway so what I'm gonna
do is just screw those things down those
little silver tools and then I put the
little pieces of wood ones and the other
portion of
dresser and I just pushed it in because
that's really what IKEA is about one of
those push kind of builds when it comes
to their dressers if that makes sense I
don't even know what I'm saying
I don't but yeah so now we're gonna work
on the bottom half very very simple but
before that you just want to make sure
everything is secure so you need to make
sure you put the other circle pieces on
the other side you don't want anything
to look or fall apart when you it's
basically what I'm trying to say so how
I started working on the bottom part of
the drawer you just want to put the
little small pieces of wood tools not
tools the small pieces of wood screws in
place and then press the wood on top
you're going to use these specific
silver screws and you're going to make
sure you place them in the areas that
you need to place them in now the
picture is self-explanatory so it's not
gonna be hard at all as long as you know
how to follow directions by pictures I
wouldn't say go on YouTube to you know
teach you how to do this the point of my
videos let you guys know I built this
and I'm so proud of it I just decided to
record it while I was doing it but the
pictures are so self explanatory that is
so easy but sometimes when you watch
somebody else do it you get a little bit
more frustrated because you don't even
know what they're doing because it's
like hard for you to even see what
they're doing as you can see my ankles
suck I was a one-man show situation this
day and I was just trying to get it done
but those little black pieces that you
see those are going to secure your wood
or your floor so you know the dresser
won't scratch anything up and you're
gonna use those same silver tools to
place on the other side and secure the
dresser in place and using that electric
screwdriver definitely will save your
life
this actually required for you to switch
out the different type of head of the
screwdriver because it's not just a that
type of screw if that makes sense so
yeah my electric screwdriver is from or
my power tool I don't even know what you
want to call this but that actually came
from Target so I was only like 20 bucks
really really really worth it and it's a
chargeable one so you know after you
done use it after you're done using it
just put it on the charger and then you
know be going so yeah so this is the
easy part right here this is just
creating the drawers you just want to
follow the directions you want to use
the correct tools you want to use the
correct white long boards for the sides
and yeah you just want to push it down
make sure they're secure and how you're
gonna make sure they're secure after
pushing it down is by using one of those
circular screws again and you're gonna
use your electric screwdriver so place
in that little screw and tighten it up
cysts you know I know what's going on
yeah but anyway this little white piece
is going to be the bottom part of your
drawer so you can actually place things
into your drawer okay you don't want to
empty drawer and things to be falling
all the way to the bottom and then I try
to show you guys the other that goes to
the back so you know everything can stay
in the drawer as well and it was out of
focus but it's cool I use the little
circle screw on the other side and then
I'm gonna use these plastic screws and
this is going to allow the drawer to
stay in place basically and then what
you want to do is go ahead and pull out
the silver little things the silver
things that's are inside the drawer and
this is going to make sure you're
aligning your drawer up properly and you
want to pull that silver piece all the
way to the front of the drawer and this
is going to make sure that you're
aligning this little hole right here up
with the other hole in the drawer if
that makes sense
and you're gonna use this really tiny
screw that one right there place it in
the inside of the drawer and then you're
going to screw it and then that little
piece is gonna poke out on the outside
of the drawer and then that's how you
know that you did it right if it doesn't
look like that you did it wrong and
start over okay that's just that but
yeah this is the dress it's super simple
after you get the hang of the first one
you should be able to get the hang of
the second one the drawers were $79
apiece and like I said I liked it it was
worth it to me and really really simple
process I'm sorry if it was
like kind of all over the place or
really hard to see what I was doing but
like I set up as a one-man show and I
felt like you know getting a little bit
more up close and personal would be more
helpful than being all the way in the
back now this is how the board looks it
looks like that so take that clip and
show it to somebody at Lowe's and be
like I need that board ok I got mine cut
down to 60 inches and the depth I didn't
even mess I didn't mess with the depth
of or the width of the board I just got
it cut down to 60 inches and then like I
said I went on the balcony and I painted
it white using my Michaels paint and
then I place it on top of the dresser
and I just thought it was so cute but
because it was just wood of course
you're gonna have like ridges and bumps
and lumps and stuff like that and you
don't want that and of course you don't
want that especially if you're using
this to put makeup or anything on it
because it's going to start making the
paint look wall tan and disgusting so I
went ahead and went to the Plexiglas
station and got me a piece of Plexiglas
my Plexiglas came out to be $89 so or
$80 yeah but it's worth it trust me it's
so so worth it cuz if you spill
something you can just wipe it straight
off girl and you don't have to worry
about anything and this is how it looks
on top of the piece of wood so I got all
of my little trinkets and we couldn't
send stuff like that my pillows my
candle and my fake little trees are from
TJ Maxx and the little lights are from
Target and then I decided to move it to
the other side of my wall because I felt
like this will be a little bit more
cuter because this area is where my
couch is gonna go but I moved it in this
little corner and I liked it so much
better and I almost finished I just have
to get my vanity mirror that's coming in
the mail soon and I'll like you know
update you guys on how it looks when it
does come but yeah so I got my chair
from TJ Maxx as well and I got my little
trinket or drawer organizers my makeup
organizers from TJ Maxx and I got the
mirror from TJ Maxx as well so I hope
you guys oh and the pitch
it's from t.j.maxx as well but I hope
you guys enjoy I hope you guys took
