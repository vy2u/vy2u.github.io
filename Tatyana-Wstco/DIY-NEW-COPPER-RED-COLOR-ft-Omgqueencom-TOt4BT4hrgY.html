video today I know you guys are going to
be super excited because a lot of you
guys have been action about this new
hair color that I have wrought lately
and this is a unit from OMG queen hair
calm I will list their information in
the description box below but this is
their Brazilian silky straight natural
color 14 inch cap B glueless lace front
wig it's going to be showing you guys
how I got this coming now I use blonde
brilliance it's a product that you use
to lift your hair and I also use some
salon care 40 volume developer and I'm
going to do this pretty sloppy but it's
cool because you know I know how to do
this already but if you want to take
your time use a brush and all that other
good stuff you know professional stuff
you can do that now of course if this
was a client or such I would not be
doing such things like this but this is
me at home trying to get this done
and trying to do something different
with a unit now this is my first time
ever bleaching a unit just to see you
know how the results will turn out and
it turned out really good and as you can
see look how fast it's lifting already
so I really really enjoyed doing this
because this was my first time once
again and I wanted to share the
experience with you guys so just make
sure you get all the parts that you want
to be lifted you know covered and then
let the hair sit for a little bit and
then I'm just going to get it to maybe
like a like I don't even know like an
orange blonde but I do want to let you
guys know that the dye the dark and
lovely dye I did not use that because it
was purple like it was so weird it did
not look nothing like the actual color
that was on the box so I was so glad
that I paid attention to that so the dot
the dye that was in the red box I use
that I will list it in the description
box below but I think it's like raging
red but yeah the hair is really soft by
the way like super soft premier lace
wigs is really great quality and I was
really pleased with the results after
dyeing it lifting it like straightening
it putting heat on it it still is
amazing I have it on currently so I'm
really really pleased with the hair I
would definitely keep you guys posted on
how the hair is holding up but so far so
good the hair air-dry because I didn't
want to you know cause damage to the
hair by putting too much heat in it
after bleaching and all that stuff
honestly I did this process maybe three
to four days later after bleaching it so
I let it air-dry let it sit for a little
bit and then I went in and started
putting the heating tools and stuff like
that on my hair but I just wanted to
show you guys that yes the hair still is
beautiful straight and it's really
really pretty so yeah I just start to
pinch other hair because I just wanted
to see how well this hair holds a curl
now I pin curls the top area and I
pretty much curled it underneath like
towards my face and then the rest of the
hair I'm just going to like not pin curl
it so I'm just going to curl it but I'm
not going to pin curl it now you can pin
curl it if you want to all over it
pretty much the reason why I didn't want
to pin curl it all over is because I
didn't want the hair to be extremely
tight because I'm going to comb it out
because I already know myself I don't
really like tight super tight styles
with my hair I like it to look like very
flowy the Dominican esque like round
brushed out kind of styles and yeah so
that's what you see me doing right here
just because once again I don't want the
hair extremely tight all around you know
so I'm alternating my curls curling them
towards my face away from my face just
to get some you know kind of wavy kind
of effortless look with this style so
once again you don't have to do this if
you don't want to you can just pin curl
the whole head and after you see the pin
curls get tucking down you just might
want to do that because they're really
really cute so once again this is a unit
and I'm very excited about it because I
don't have to do much I did have to go
in and tweeze it and stuff like that and
by the way they they have a ton of
promotions going on on their site a
20-17 biggest cell 30% off up to orders
that are 150 dollars special offers
starting at $19 you get your lace
closures and they have free shipping all
around so make sure you definitely check
them out I will list them and just I
will listen in the description box below
I do have enough lace to like work with
to do like side parts and stuff like
that but it's not far enough for me
personally that's the only con with this
like the lace doesn't go as far as I
would like it to go so maybe they can
work on that just because you know I'll
put that out there definitely try to get
some more parting
on the sides the middle part is cool but
the sides need to be a little bit more
so as you can see I wanted to do that
other side but the norm is like I'm not
filling it so I just combed it all out
and how beautiful it looks so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
