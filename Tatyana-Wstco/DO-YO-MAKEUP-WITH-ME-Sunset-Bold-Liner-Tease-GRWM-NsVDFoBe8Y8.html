another video today I just felt like
doing my makeup with you guys so I hope
you guys enjoy this video I kind of try
to do something out of the box just
because I feel like I've been doing
super natural makeup looks and kind of
really not even wearing anything on my
eyeballs so today I just wanted to dive
into some color and have fun I do go I
do want to mention this palette that I
actually bought from Amazon and I'm
gonna feature this in this video so this
is the like what does it call like the
knockoff version of the makeup forever
flash palette and I actually got this
from Amazon this I'm magic professional
cosmetics
12 flash colored case and I really
really like this I wouldn't say like the
quality is probably the exact same as
the makeup for everyone just because I
felt like just because I know for a fact
that it's not I feel like that one
probably has a little bit more pigment
of course it probably lasts longer but I
only pay about 7 bucks for this thing
and you can actually see the color on my
eyes so I think that's what's most
important I don't even know what these
are like
yes you will call this like a cream
shadow palette and it has all these nice
colors and you can do a lot with this
you can do cut creases and all that jazz
so if you guys are interested in
purchasing this I will list it in the
description box below so you can look
forward to picking this up on your spare
time or just to see cuz I totally forgot
that I have this Jo Ava
palette and I just want to dip into this
Yarbrough color and see what happens if
I place this on top of that and it has
like some shimmer looks really pretty
but I feel like it's changing the color
but I feel like it gives it a little bit
more definition not definition but like
a little more pizazz because it does
have shimmer in it but I still feel like
it's changing the pigment
and a little bit more blue but I still
think it's really pretty just because it
has shimmer on this shadow this is the
shadow that I went in and just placing
right on top of that was the products
that I use will be listed in the
description box below and yeah I love
you baby so freaking much and I'll see
you in my next video I hope you guys
enjoy and I will see you soon bye what I
do I am back so what I'm showing you
guys is the color scheme that we're
gonna be using today so you can get an
idea of what you may need you don't have
to use the exact same shadows as means
so let's get it poppin so I already had
applied my soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm
just applying a new shadow right on top
of that alright baby loves so we're
gonna take this tan color right here as
our transition shade and we're gonna
make sure it's blown out and looking
very flawless because this is going to
give a gradient effect after we apply
the super bright colors that we're going
to be using today and this is just gonna
make everything look seamless and
blended and gradient and that's what
we're looking for
I'm going to go in with this burnt red
shade and apply that right in our crease
we're gonna keep packing and blending
because we want it's super intense now
we're going to take that one shade once
again and pack that on our lids once
again because we need that color payoff
shorty yes we do we do it's time for the
star of the show we're going to use this
cream tour Coy's shadow and we're going
to make a wing out of this so I'll let
you guys watch I'm building the color up
so it can have the most intensity just
like you know the shadows that we were
using once before
and we're gonna go in with this NYX
jumbo milk pencil and we're gonna apply
that in our waterline and this is just
to waking us up brightness up and make
the eyes pop a lot more we're going to
just wait all that powder at the bottom
well underneath our eyes
I'm gonna go in with this next state map
but not flat and we're going to use the
shades golden and cocoa and golden is
first and then cocoa is second and what
we're gonna do is just bring some color
back into our face with this palette
we're gonna use it as bronzer not this
palette but with this foundation powder
and we're going to make sure we adding
some color back into our face I'm going
in with this Java palette and I'm using
these two shades to apply all my cheeks
as blush yes I am using a shadow as a
blush like you don't do that girl yes
multi eat multi-use so we're gonna go in
with this Becca cosmetics champagne pop
highlighter and pop that on the highest
points of our cheeks okay and blend it
out because we don't want to look too
crazy and we're gonna use this anastacio
clear brow gel and we're going to put
these brows into shape okay we're gonna
adjust all that little powder away
because trust me it gets dusty if you if
you use enough powder on your face like
I do now we're going to tie this look
together by applying that orange red and
that's pretty much it underneath our
waterline just so it won't look dry and
facing down there and yeah I'm also
gonna add some glitter in my inner tear
duct area but I didn't film that I don't
know why and I also go back in with
champagne pop on my brow bone and then
I'm gonna add two lip colors or my lips
clean color 16:28 clean colors 16:27 and
a clear lip gloss from Maybelline and
that is pretty much it baby loves I hope
you guys enjoy the rest of the video and
I will see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
