gonna be showing you guys this look
right here
I really wasn't as confident as I was
doing this look just because I was
working with purples and I don't really
ever work with Purple's on my eyes if I
am doing a purple look it's just because
I'm just doing a purple look and then
I'm not going anywhere but I'm actually
going somewhere with this purple look
but I feel like the glitter tied it
together so I'm really not trippin too
much but um yeah so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I try to do something
different with my lips but as you can
tell from how they look now they look
nothing like how they look when I first
applied the lipstick in this video so
it's coming more toned down I kind of
washed the color out with a little bit
more lip gloss so you know I was trying
to go for our purple purple lip but then
I'm wearing tan so it just makes
everything look a little bit toned down
first I didn't know what I was wearing
tonight so I kind of stuck with a more
neutral color because I feel like this
look we'll go over the good with like a
tan or whatever because it's not so loud
but anyway I do want to talk to you guys
about my hair I do want to talk to you
guys about my hair before I leave
because yeah this is some really nice
hair and I feel like you guys should
know that's heat on it so this is ally
grace loose wave hair this is like 26
inches I'm not sure but you guys know
I'm never sure when it comes to limps
because I have so much hair that
sometimes I just lose track of what
length is what nowadays but um yeah the
hair is really really nice I have no
cons about it it curled really really
nicely I didn't show you guys how I got
these curls but there's so many
tutorials on my channel show you guys
how to walk Earl and this is just some
really nice long curls or loose wave
hair and it was a freaking it was so
easy to do this to this hair literally I
kept it on the mirror for about a few
seconds and you're gonna see how I had
the hair before long curling it was
already like braided I just wanted to
cut my hair and to piggy tails just to
get it out of the way so I don't have
you know big ol hair throughout the day
but anyway on the hair turned out really
really nice after putting the wrong
curls in there I didn't know if I wanted
to put my curls or not but I'm glad I
did because I feel like it ties this
look together even more about anyway I
love you guys thank you so much for
watching and if you're interested to see
how I got this look continue to watch
love you
what about the way
Oh what about the way
pod Leone love my bed
the way
away
what about the way
you've gotta be good to me
by the way you love me what about the
one you love Oh what about the ways we
need
what about the way
the way
so T about the hair the hair is really
soft no foul smell the lustre is really
really nice you guys know I love me some
Brazilian hair and I tried out there
straight texture and their body wave
texture and now this is their loose wave
so you guys know now that if you do
order from this hair company all of the
hair quality is the exact same their
bundles are super full ends are really
nice on their hair you don't have to cut
it at all if you don't want to I didn't
cut this hair at all I just go wash the
hair when I first received this hair and
what else did I do I let it air dry and
I didn't do anything else other than you
know trying to tweak the frontal to make
it look realistic this side of my front
so probably is sticking up because I I
think I might cut this before I go out
right here but I'm not sure I'm not
trying to mess with it until I get to a
really close mirror later on
