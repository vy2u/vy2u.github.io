another video and today I'm going to
quickly show you guys how to get your
hair up into a perfect ballerina bun my
hair was already slicked up in
extensions with RV added to it so yeah
I'm just gonna use some water to smooth
my hair up and a little bit more of my
eco styling gel just so you know I can
tame my flyaways and all of that I'm
gonna use a tube brush and I'm also
gonna use some of this Cantu pomade and
that's just gonna make my hair look a
little bit more shiny so I'm gonna
quickly just flick up my hair for you
guys and just watch this apart and I'll
come back when it's time to do the slow
down grab go like you're trying to make
Joann spot off and I think I wanna smash
some on now
speed up guys
by the way I don't know what here this
is that I have installed but I like it
it has texture to its like a loose waves
so I'm not sure just make sure whatever
here you are using or if you are using
your real hair just make sure you tangle
it so there's no like before you start
creating your so I got my bun creator
from forever 21 and I don't even know if
this is called a bun creator like I
don't I don't know a bun donut I don't
know going to put it through my hair and
brush my hair out use an elastic to wrap
around the bun holder and I'm going to
also like put up the extra hair within
another with another elastic band just
to secure it and then do the same thing
using another rubber band just to secure
it down visually you'll understand what
I'm talking about but me trying to
explain it to you guys at 3:30 in the
morning
it's not going to happen but hopefully
you guys get it very simple you can get
this from your local beauty supply store
your bun holder you can make one at home
with the sock just look at other
tutorials or on how to create a sock bun
holder and/or a sock bun donut and yeah
so that's pretty much it
water eco styler and Joe gets my hair
really you know slick by the way
here is natural so a lot of you guys
don't believe me but I don't know why I
would lie about something as petty is
that put yeah girl anyway
just watch this and I will come back
when it's time to beat this grab go like
spot off kind of think I want to smash
up
we can spot off I think I wanna smash
come on now speed up guys
grab go let me go and spot off and I
babes let's start on this mug so I'm
going to start off by adding my
concealer I forgot to prime but there it
is there's my Milani prime light primer
I love this primer I'm going to use that
on a damp Beauty sponge just to stipple
that across my face on my face so you
know I can prime you know cuz priming is
important if we want this look to state
run all night by the way I was going to
a basketball game this day I did this
look this is the day after I wanted to
recreate the look for you guys because I
felt like it was a really nice look so
yeah anyway I'm using concealer I'm
going to use the LA girl Pro concealer
today in the shade cool tan I'm going to
take my a BH foundation stick in the
shade walnut' to contour hitting the
points that matter the most size of my
nose jawline cheekbones temples and
forehead and where else can I find I
think that's it sis I think that's the I
might hit under the lip not today I
guess I didn't okay so now I'm going to
go in with my next total control
foundation and I'm using two shades
caramel and cappuccino I'm in between
these two shades so I like mixing them
yes so you guys know this is the basic
layout that I usually do when I am doing
my makeup
well always do what I'm doing my makeup
the only thing that I switch up is my
foundation some days I don't want to
wear the total control but I felt like
you know to keep it affordable because
this can be a Valentine's Day look yeah
I started to just go in with my total my
total control foundation which is only
like ten bucks from Ulta your beauty
supply store you can get this foundation
from anywhere but anyway I'm gonna go in
with my 439 brush from morphe and I'm
going to stipple that across my face
while all over my face I'm blending my
foundation and my contour in and this is
just so there's no harsh lines you can
reapply your walnut or whatever contour
product you're using just so you know
you can you know have that contour pop a
little bit more if you blend it out a
little bit too much but yeah this is
just how I do my makeup because I feel
like it gives off a more flawless look
versus having to apply like a boatload
of foundation all over your face if it's
not even necessary I don't understand
the point of that and I felt like that
this leaves my face looking really
really cakey so that's just me personal
preference I am really heavy-handed so I
stopped applying my foundation all over
my face because I just started looking
too too crazy and I felt like I was
wasting product because once again I
don't need a lot of coverage everywhere
I like just focusing the most coverage
you know in the center of my face and
then making sure I blend out on the
outer parts because I don't need like I
said a lot of coverage in those areas
but yeah so that's why I do that and
then I'm just gonna go in with a real
technique
Beauty Blender just to blend out my
under-eye concealer and the bridge of my
nose and stuff like that so everything
can look flawless and then I'm gonna set
using my Sasha Buttercup mixing it with
my Laura Mercier setting powder just so
I can get the perfect undertone when I
am setting my face now because the Sasha
Buttercup powder is a little bit more
yellow well a lot more yellow
and then the laura mercier I just love
that powder with all my heart I feel
like it gets the job done
I don't crease at all and then I also
love how fine that powder is so I just
feel like mixing both of them together
and I do that nowadays so yeah I don't
know what I was into but I was really
late and really into it but anyway we're
just gonna blend that out anything left
over we're just gonna take it on the
forehead take it on the chin if I feel
like it and as you can see I'm applying
a little bit more of that foundation
shade and walnut buy a BH to make this
contour pop okay because I was going to
a basketball game honey and I needed to
like pop in and chiseled and snatch so I
took the contour up a couple of notches
you hear me you hear me so yeah you just
want to make sure everything is blended
out seamlessly you want to make sure you
hit your under eyes one more time before
you go into set because you don't want
to set your eyes with creasing do you
guys see how ratchet my Beauty Blender
looks okay let's talk about it so I keep
forgetting to get on another Beauty
Blender I go to Target almost every
other day and I just seem to always
forget and I'll go into the beauty
section and Target and all of that and
I'll by freaking mask
I'll buy makeup remover wipes I'll buy
another eyebrow pencil all of that but
then I will never look to my right to
get that damn Beauty Blender so I will
be going tomorrow together so you guys
won't have to look at that trifle
illness but yeah that's what happens
when you have stiletto nails and you
just go to squeeze and wring out a
Beauty Blender and it just stabs it and
tries to kill it but anyway I am gonna
use my micro smooth foundation powder
from Sephora in the shade 60 deep and I
love this powder it just makes
everything look flawless and yeah so I
just like setting my face kind of going
over the area that I set that set my
grab go like you're trying to make you a
spot I kind of think I want to smash
some on now
speed up
guys that money and they'll say Amen how
much tryna make you clear a boy or a
girl
Bob pencil from NYX and I'm going to
yeah setting us these brows they
actually didn't come out you know as
perfect as I would want them to but it
was a bad brow day that day I mean it
wasn't a bad bra day but it was a okay
bra day but it wasn't a great product
you know so yeah I kind of ended up
finishing them off camera because I was
getting frustrated as you can see I'm
complaining about them dramatic
I used my consider as primer today and I
set that concealer using the Sasha
Buttercup Laura Mercier mix and then I'm
gonna go in with this bronzer well not
bronzer is actually a powder from True
Match L'Oreal True Match and it's it's a
foundation powder and I just use it to
pretty much bronze up my eyelids use it
as an eyeshadow I like using it as a
contour powder contour now or just like
a bronzer but I like the color so much
that I just decided that I wanted to use
it on my lids hopefully that makes sense
I'm really sleepy I told you guys it's
four o'clock right now in the morning
but I really really needed to get this
video because I had told you guys that I
would so yeah like I said this well no I
didn't say that but this look is really
simple as you can see I'm just using
that one shade just to pretty much blow
out my my eyes with you know who's in
that one shade just to create this look
very simple I'm going on my under eye
just to give that smoky illusion you
don't have to do it but I like doing it
I just feel like sometimes its eyes my
look together and then I'm just gonna go
in with this Jake a stock of the night
glitter I'll list the shade name in the
description box below and yeah so I got
my Jake likes my Jake a secluded from my
local Beauty Supply they have all kinds
of colors in my local
you supply so I just like using my next
to glitter glue just to apply this and I
just like doing packing motions I like
tapping and then packing it on just
though there's no fallout all over my
face but that's why I also keep the
under eye setting powder underneath
there so if it does fall it can just sit
on there and I can just dust it away and
it's not a bad it's not a big deal I'm
gonna go back in with that foundation
powder and I'm just going to smoke out
my bottom line again and then what else
I'm not gonna do I am going to use my
Sephora luminizing drops in the shade go
light no I forgot the shade of this go
light is from from MEK the strobe cream
but this shade I will listed in the
description box below but you don't have
to get the Sephora one there's so many
so many dupes out there from the
drugstore from Ulta but I like this one
and it's affordable as well because the
Sephora brand is only about fourteen
dollars and I just like placing this in
the areas that I would like to highlight
and this is just to make my highlight
beam a lot more I'm gonna go in with my
Becca shimmer palette using opal two
highlights and you just need to make
sure you're glowing okay we're
on Valentine's Day if you are going to
recreate this look for Valentine's Day
because I feel like you know I'm more of
the girl that just likes a subtle look
for Valentine's like I'm not gonna go
walk outside with a purple and pink or
red look on my eyes I'm gonna go with
something like this and maybe a red lip
maybe a purple lip maybe a pink lip but
I'm not gonna go out with any crazy
colors on my eyelids I think that's just
too much and especially if you know if
you decide that you're gonna wear a red
dress or you know I just feel like this
is a more toned down but glammed look
for that day that occasion and your BAE
is not gonna be looking at you like
you're doing too much and you know not
really even about it but I just had to
throw that in there just just in case
somebody cared but anyway I'm gonna go
in with this NYX brow pencil in expresso
I believe this is expressed
or it maybe just call it brown dark
brown I don't use this anymore for my
brows just because I feel like they're
too it's too light so I couldn't find my
downtown beauty lip liner so I was
forced to use this so yeah but anyway
I'm gonna go in with my NYX cookie
butter lip gloss and I'm going to top
that off with my Victoria's Secret sugar
baby lip gloss and that's pretty much
that a little combination I'm gonna put
me some fake moles on my face I'm also
going to apply some mascara and
tightline with a white liner and I'll
come talk to you guys live in a second
but that's pretty much it
oh I do want to let you guys know I'm
using 113 lashes from ardell I feel like
you're trying to make up a spot and I
think I want to smash em out now
guys well same friend I play DJ mailroom
I got the hair done we got the face done

the 5000 member downstairs just kidding
we're not pulling any niggas smoked but
I gotta need a little bit more lip line
there I can't find my downtown Beauty
lipliner okay got a booty like house I'm
gonna bag yeah Wow
so Valentine's Day it's not always about
pink and purple you can do gold you can
do red you can do any other kind of it
just you know if it fits the part it's
not overly dramatic even though you
don't have to clashes it's got some
glitter going and the dress is from
Windsor I actually put all my Nike I
don't even know what to what those are
called I'm not a sneaker head so I don't
