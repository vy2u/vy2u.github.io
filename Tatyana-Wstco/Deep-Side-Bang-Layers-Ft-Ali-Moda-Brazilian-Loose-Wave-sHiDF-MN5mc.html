bundles 226 a 24 and a 22 inch from this
hair company up there
Brazilian loose waves the terrans really
friggin soft and you'll see it
throughout the video how it's really
easy to curl and also I added some
layers in the hair I'm thinking about
cutting this hair really short so
probably my next video I'll cut the hair
shorter and I'm just doing that just
because I just was I just been so over
long hair lately I've had so much long
hair that I want to do something short
with some hair so as you can see this is
a 26 inch or 24 inch I ended up cutting
it the first time up and rocked his hair
I want it a short a shorter length in 26
inches and I just went in chopped it and
the pattern in the beginning is how the
hair comes fresh out of the pack I
haven't cold washed his hair yet at all
so it's been holding up really good and
its natural state so I'm really pleased
with it so that's it was all run until
you dozen about the hair I've tried le
moteur hair company before and I really
loved their other hair so this is their
loose wave once again and I think you
guys would really like this hair if
you're interested in getting some loose
wave bundles from this hair company very
lightweight very easy to maintain is no
tangles no shedding or anything like
that

so yeah I'm going to be showing you guys
how to get this look if you want this
look thank you so much for watching I
give you the closure from this hair
company 18-inch closed 18 inch closure
and what I did when I made this unit
I'll just put the closure on this side a
little bit more than just in the middle
so that's how I got these deep bangs so
if you guys want to do that that's how
you can do it
