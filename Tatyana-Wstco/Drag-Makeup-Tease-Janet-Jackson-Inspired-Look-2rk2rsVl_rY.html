skin in the photo it's really not about
the skin I think it will look cool matte
or doing so which that whichever
direction you want to go in I'm just
gonna do my basic everyday you know skin
but the eyes are really really nice so
did my hair like how she had her hair
also her hair my hair is already slicked
up but yeah so her skin looks pretty
matte but it looks really healthy and
this is the eye look and I'm gonna do me
a straight Brown just like hers but her
highlight is poppin her contour is
poppin and that mohani eye needs that
mole so her lip I didn't see anything on
her lip so I'm gonna do something
neutral you guys know I'm neutral type
of girl anyway like yeah the micro brow
pencil from NYX
if you want a really really straight
brow instead I like going downwards like
you just want to go out like this like
that's how hers look this one's going
down a little bit too much so I'm gonna
make it go out a little bit higher don't
mind the concealer is gonna fix all of
that la girl Pro concealer and i'ma just
clean this
you
pop it so the pigments and all that jazz
are they're just going to make sure that
mine look it's going to last longer I'm
gonna bring it all the way up to the
brow bone the brow bone so the
transition colors can be pop it as well
then we use a vintage from this hard
powder just to set this primer so the
other colors can blend out really nicely
so I'm gonna use about two colors just
to get that pop in transition and then
go from there since we go on take bulk
from this heart palette and this is
because the Bulge is like a light tan
shade so it's not giving you too much
color it's like a perfect color for the
transition area or look like this or
honestly any look in general just
because it's so light so I'm gonna keep
you like straight right here and then
bring it in so straight
just to compliment this feline look that
we're trying to go for and bring it in
and I'm just doing circular motions at
the same time so I'm noting that it's
like you're breathing really harsh but
focusing majority of the color out here
so when I start applying the other
colors it can look really nice
ingredient all right so now I'll pick up
my neutral 35 whole pallet take this
little tan shade right here and do the
same thing pretty much focus on it in
the same area
okay of course so I'm gonna just bump it
up using some darker tan shades and
that's palate still going in with that
second shade though so I'm going to use
like this color probably a little bit of
this chocolate color right here and this
color right here
you
I'm gonna do the going up and drag it
out kind of motion just because I'm
gonna have to create me a really big lid
space like hers because as you can see I
don't really have that much lid space
take the other shade that I was using
and just with another brush and I'm
adjustable and everything
you
the Becket palette I was just holding up
this one right here and I'm gonna take
this shade and I'm going to pack that
one top to get the pretty shimmery
you
the job done but I feel like I need to
spray some fix+ on it so the second
layer I'm gonna put some sticks plus
you
but yeah so anyway these are the are
Dell 115 yeah and I was just like
Mitchell why not if I don't like em I'll
take em off but why not right
scoop dramatic vibes I don't really know
how this is gonna look scared so I'm
gonna put these alone and I'll come
right back this I am here for these
lashes for the first time ever and
Tatiana did a drama lash it's a really
good new year
really a new year they were a bitch to
put on though like really they were
trying to like find the placement so I
can actually look adorable so yeah so
let me do this mole hers is pretty big
it was like right
I heard last row not even does any lip
color you want to because this is such a
neutral look I should go and see what
lips you had on
so now what I'm going to do is add some
of this sixteen or twenty seven color
just for the center mommy my ghetto the
ghetto should be the lost
it's looking real healthy okay
this is giving me chocolate dades you
feeling it
I don't even have bottom mascara one and
I don't think I want to put it on so I
just like using this clear you Nastasia
brow Joe just to like get them back in
order
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
