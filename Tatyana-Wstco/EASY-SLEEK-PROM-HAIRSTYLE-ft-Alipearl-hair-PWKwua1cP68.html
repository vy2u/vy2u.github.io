how about my love muffins I am back with
another video today I am going to be
showing you guys how to do this queue up
do I feel like this is
for prom season so I just wanted to
throw it up there you know it's really
really simple self-explanatory so
hopefully you guys find this helpful I
know I'm about to go and do my cousin's
hair for prom tomorrow so I just thought
about you girls and I'm just playing let
me help you up let me help you out
a real quick anyway so I already slick
my hair down I just section off some
hair in the front because I'm about to
put two braids in the hair you know very
simple and I use eco styler gel in water
to do so to slick my hair down and then
just for this part up here I'm just
using eco styling gel for the front and
I'm just going to start braiding um
that's how simple this is and I'm using
my ally pearl hair to basically make my
hair look longer so giving you that
ba-ba-boom ponytail that you need to
slay on these hoes or whatever so I hope
you guys enjoyed the video I really
haven't had this hair for a very long
time to tell you guys good or bad but so
far you know when I first took it out of
the pack the hair was really soft it
wasn't any shedding or Nathan or
anything like that
I was really it was really easy for me
to run my fingers through but I just
used my brush also um I do still have
the style going on right now I think I'm
going to take it out and do another updo
with their other bundles that I have I
did receive three bundles in a frontal
because I'm not really still in front of
Whaley I've just been doing these kind
of styles with my hair so I hope you
guys appreciate it a little bit more
because even if you don't have the exact
hair that I'm using in these videos that
I'm showing you you can always go to the
beauty supply store and get you some
hair you can either use beauty supply
store hair or you can even use braiding
hairs to do these ponytails I have a
synthetic ponytail style on my channel
if you guys want to just stay really
really on the affordable side and not
even buy a bundle or two from a beauty
supply store but you know it's up to you
alley pearl hair will be listed in the
description box below if you are
interested to purchase from this hair
company and yeah so don't forget to
thumbs up comment subscribe and I hope
you guys um have a great day and if you
are you know going through your prom let
me know if you do this style and if
you're not going to prom
just I just really appreciate you okay I
just want to tell you that I really
appreciate you for watching and I hope
you guys have a great day I love you all
but I want to say before I got off the
camera this would have been so much
cuter if I put some hair jewelry in my
hair so if you have any hair rings or
clamps or anything like that to jazz it
up do that because I said it was like a
prom you know kind of style but where's
the vibhum without the bling so I would
try to list them here
um like jewelry in the description box
below so you make sure you open it just
to see if I'm you know remembered or
whatever but I do have a few um hair
jewelry but you know I'm not recording
anymore so I'm probably trying to do
that incorporate that in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
