brows navigate I've grown my brows out
and I really like them like this so this
is what I will be doing today in this
video so I'm gonna be using my Anastacio
dip brow in peponi and this is how it
looks you can get this from Sephora but
what I do is just use an angle brush
with the spoolie attached to it this is
from ELF and I know this was probably
like 3 or 4 dollars I'm just going to
dip my brush into the dip brow and by
generous amount of product on my brush
just because I don't really like to keep
dipping back into the product so yeah
I'm gonna start not all the way like in
the front but like almost like right
here in the middle of my brow and then
just outlining the bottom and dragging
it towards the front bringing the
product all the way to the end of my
brow and then making a line like that
and then I'm going to start filling my
brows in with the leftover product so as
you can see this area it got like a
little too much so I'm just going to use
my brush and start streaking it outwards
and then go back in to basically filling
your brows in with the leftover product
now if you get like that patchy mark
right here like a lot of product you
just want to go up with the product so
it can diffuse throughout your brows and
it just won't stay in that area right
here and now because we're pretty much
almost done I'm gonna go back into the
product and then I'm going to grab a
little bit more but if you want to pinch
your brush and what you want to do is go
back and you want it make sure it's like
really sharp in the same area that we
did right here take it up there first
almost like in the middle and then
outline at the top of your brow and then
what I'm basically doing is
yeah outlining my brows I'm not really
trying to I'm not trying to make them
bigger if you get what I'm saying
or thicker this is just the natural
shape of my brows so that's what I'm
just outlining the natural shape of the
brow and this product is amazing I love
it it's because you can go grab a lot or
grab a bit and I like the I like it way
better than a pencil I just think it
gives your brows a cleaner kind of look
and you want to start focusing a
straight line towards the front so
basically clean that up because my brows
get really sparse right here and I still
want that to look fool just like the
rest of my brows and then I just go
through my brows again with the product
that's left over on the brush again and
then now what I'm going to do is clean
up my brows using a 19 brush from morphe
brushes grab your concealer of choice
and then start creating a line under
your brows
then drag the product downwards so you
can start blending out that concealer
and start working on the top of your
brow same placement first almost like in
the middle so you don't put too much up
the product towards the front or towards
the end of your brows so when you go to
start you know blending it out it won't
look quicker
so that's that so I'm gonna blend it out
a little bit more of course towards the
end but I just want to start working on
my other brow first
okay so final step because my brows are
crazy and they get hectic sometimes and
they're just they just can never stay in
place so when I go in do is use my brow
bow conditioning primer and this is my
benefit it looks like this it's a fun
little tool I like it I just twist the
you know bottom so it can come out only
a tap it's not really necessary for you
to put massive amounts on your brows but
it's just to tame your brows and keep
them you know looking flawless all day
and they stay in place your brows don't
Brown your brow hairs don't move around
and it does leave your brows pretty like
hard or like stiff it's not like weird
feeling but it does what it's supposed
to do so I just like combing the front
hairs up with the product and then
running the rest of the product
throughout my brows because sometimes
and we know when we do grow our hair
out like this area right here can't
start sticking up or doing some type of
weird thing throughout the day I'm going
to apply the rest of my makeup already
have my foundation worn but I'm going to
apply the rest of my makeup my contour
and highlight stuff and you know so
that's pretty much how tatiana does her
brows i love muffins this is my brows
this is how my makeup is turning out
tonight so i hope you guys enjoy this
video i need to get into this closet and
figure out what I'm gonna be wearing
tonight because I have no idea but if
you guys want to see this makeup look
let me know in the comment section below
I hope you guys said something for this
video from this video because I felt
like it was super simple super easy um I
did grow my brows out if you have
noticed I'm so glad that I decided to
and just was just didn't care how crazy
my brows were gonna look on a daily
basis because I was looking very insane
but it was so worth it because now the
maintenance of my brows is like so
simple and easy now that my brows are
growing out all I have to do is just
clean my brows up with this little
eyebrow razor and that's all that I do I
don't really go in to pluck or tweeze my
brows not that serious anymore but it's
so worth a so if you guys have extremely
thick brows and you're just arching them
because you just want them thin I advise
you just to try to grow them out because
I just love thick brows I didn't do
anything crazy to get my brows to grow I
just literally stopped plucking tweezing
them and um they could we're back so
yeah thank you so much for watching
ladies
I'll see you my next one hairstyle will
be up on my channel soon so I hope you
guys are excited
well I end up cutting it shorter than
what I originally did in that video so
you guys aren't going to kill me because
I love having to cut my hair like this
