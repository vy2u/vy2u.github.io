we're going to start off by priming our
eyes with soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac
and we're just going to blend that all
over our list so our eye shadows can be
really intense and vibrant and you know
you know you know you know so after that
we're gonna go in with the super old Mac
palette and I'm going to well first I'm
gonna set the Paint Pot using a cream
shadow from the middle matte palette
metamath from the metal matte palette
from Kat Von D and after that I'm just
gonna go in with this Mac palette using
the super old palette it's actually like
a burnt orange kind of cocoa brown kind
of color and I'm going to use that in
the crease or the transition area yes
transition area and pretty much blend
that out as much as possible and I might
go in with another shade that like kind
of looks just like this but I'm going to
use a smaller blending brush to get more
color intensity and you know more
definition in my in my eye you know what
I'm trying to say you get it you got it
so after that very simple we're just
going to take some concealer to cut out
you know this look and I forgot to
record that I added a little bit more
brown in the crease just so this cut
crease can look a little bit more
defined you're going to see that in a
second but I didn't add that clip into
this video because I couldn't find that
clip so yeah
dicks glitter glue and I'm going to put
that right on top of that cut crease or
lid space whatever you want to say and
then I'm gonna take this silver glitter
that I got from NYX and we're just gonna
pack that right on our lid I forgot to
record the liner just because I really
need to be super close to the mirror
what I'm gonna do is just use those same
colors to blow out the bottom you know
underneath my eye so this look can be
tied together so just won't be blanking
just weird underneath there and then I'm
going to yea give you some more
definition in that crease like I was
telling you guys about pop some lashes
on these are our dough don't even know
the number yeah but that's pretty much
it so that's how I got this eye look
very simple and I used naturally
transform on the lips with cork lip
liner in a tube in a clear gloss on top
of my lips so now we're about to get
into this hair this hair is actually
from Julie err this is their Brazilian
loose waves and I actually curled it a
couple of times so that's why I kind of
already looks curled but what I want to
do today is recall it for you guys using
my Hot Tools curling iron and I'm just
gonna add some curls in it and that's
pretty much eight I do have a lot to say
about this hair first starting off with
the fact that when it first came I was
really really happy with how it looks
after co-washing it with conditioner I
was debating on either cutting no not
cutting I'm sorry I was debating one
either
bleaching this hair or just dying it
jet-black and as you can see I just went
with dyeing it jet-black now the hair is
30 inches okay but it may not look 30
inches anymore to guys and that's only
because I had to go in and cut this hair
because I did receive a lot of tangling
and I knew for a fact that was because
of the length now I'm not expecting 30
inches to tangle
if it's 30 inches it needs to be 30
inches of good quality hair I don't want
to get thirty inches and I know you
definitely don't want to get thirty
inches and you receive something really
crazy like I was receiving which was
detangling
the shedding so I just had to go in and
cut it and just see hopefully it would
you know get its life together and it
did so I just want to let you guys know
that that's what I was receiving maybe
other people have not received that this
is my first time working with 30 inches
of hair with this company I haven't
received any 30 inches from anybody else
so I'm not here to tell you if this is
you know the first one only time this
hair company you know has done this but
I will always say just you know check
out the review section on their website
but once again I did cut this hair the
shedding and tangling did stop
drastically so I kept the wig I do like
the hair I really really loved the jet
black or me the hair does hold a really
nice curl and once again this is a loose
wave hair the hair in its natural state
it's really really pretty but I felt
like I should be able to do more than
one style I do have a fourth bundle that
I haven't actually put in the hair I
actually used it to create a ponytail
and to see if it definitely was the limp
that was giving me the problem because
it was 30 inches and it definitely was
because
twenty-four inch bundle was really
really nice I believe it was 24 inches
it might have been 26 but it was really
nice and I didn't receive any problem or
any trouble but Julie Hara information
will be linked in the description box
below if you work with this hair company
before let me know in the comment
section as well I love you babes and I
will see you guys in my next video have
a good one and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
