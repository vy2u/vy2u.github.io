I am back with another video today I
have my son well way to share with you
guys today so I haven't unboxed this as
you see it's a little dirty just because
of me I was doing my makeup and I
actually touched it with my little dirty
hands so girl yes anyway I have on boxes
that I like I was saying so it hasn't
been unpacked or anything so we're just
want to do this together
we're gonna pop it on my head finesse it
I'm excited by it because it does have
colored so I don't have to go in and
color so it looks like it's 22 inch body
wave yeah I'll put all of the color
information in the link information in
the description box below it gives you
some instructions on how to take care of
your wig so if this is your first time
wearing a wig
please you know take notes please read
over that but you know I know how to do
but I know how to do share this is how
big I think this color is gonna be so
cute I love that color is so cute so
cute so key it has a net over it just to
make sure the hair is going to be
looking cute when I receive it and this
is how the big love's I'm so excited so
I don't think I'm gonna do much to this
hair just because it looks like it's
already in a style also the girl is
being lazy today I honestly just want to
pop something on feel cute and just walk
out the damn house so nine times
and if you purchase a wink that's
exactly how you're going to build you're
not gonna be like me probably wanting to
restyle it make it look good whatever
the case is you're just gonna want to
cut the legs off and keep it pushing so
as you can tell it doesn't have a lot of
lace to cut off and it's actually brown
lace honey like I can't stand where I
have to go in and bleach my nuts on my
units just because the lace is just not
visible or it just looks dry and dusty
so I really really made a plan to make
sure that this lace color was Brown so I
want to go over the inside of the wig
just because a lot of the times in my
videos I'm telling you guys like Josh
drinks and how I pull them to each side
and how I touch my cones under how I
took my clothes under and all that jazz
and probably nine times out of ten you
guys don't know what the hell I'm
talking about unless you have seen the
inside of a wig before so when I say
Josh drinks because I don't know like
the perfect term for this or the correct
term for this I need to view things
right here so when you first get your
way these are not going to be stretched
out at all they should be if it is is a
problem that means somebody use your
damn wig it should be hard to pull first
like this okay and then I like looping
it all the way through the last loop on
each side why because I like it to fit
extremely snuggle me I would I will have
the information of the capsized in the
description box below but I believe this
is a medium or a small depends on what
they had in stock at the time sometimes
with the smalls it takes a longer for
them to be customized so sometimes I
have to just think with the medium it
has three cones and I'm glad because
they don't have this damn comb in the
back sometimes I like to convey it back
there but
I don't I don't know like it's really
really iffy with me like if the cop with
if the waif is really snug without that
back home being stuck back there I like
it but if I feel like I want to put my
hair up in a ponytail with anyway I want
the comb to be back there so it's just
your preference but I just want to let
you guys know son both legs only come
with three I mean this weight only has
three I don't know about their other
ones too on the side one in the middle
you guys know how I feel about this comb
I feel like it's unnecessary um but I'm
glad that it's not in a lace like a
couple of companies put the damn comb
right in the middle of the lace and I'm
just like what the hell am I supposed to
be doing with that like how am I
supposed to part my damn hair what's the
common being in the middle of the lace
but it's not that hard to remove just
because they use their injustice over
comb down so what I'm trying to show you
is if you put this on this is how the
party it's gonna look which is really
good because once again you don't have
to go in and bleach the nuts just to
make it look visible have the wig looks
this is how the inside looks after
pulling the drawstrings and I don't have
a problem with this extra fabric just
because I'm used to at this point anyway
I'm gonna snatch this way off now I
don't have this egg laid down so that's
how really good this wig is I really
loved it and once again this information
to this wing will be listed in the
description box below my hair is just in
a ponytail underneath every wig that I
usually rock or it's probably in braids
or whatever the case may be whatever get
your hair looking really flat underneath
a unit please feel free to do that babes
I'm gonna take that comb that's on the
side right and pull it back as much as I
can
okay and I don't really want to move the
part around but when I do this side is
gonna go back to the middle trust me
so the comb is all the way back here now
at this point okay it was like right
here but now it's all the way back here
that you're going to tuck
right underneath that wick have and
pushing back and that's how it's going
to secure your unit and make it feel
like it's not gonna move around and
that's what we want okay I'm trying to
lay down a frontal closure a way this
alarm graphics hairspray ten max hold is
amazing for that if they don't like that
got to be gloom ethic cuz I don't like
your girl so I don't I don't use it
buddy so what this does it just helps
the lace same place you know how it
still has that movement we don't want
that Oh unless you're running out of the
house real quick and then you don't mind
so before we go and do that I'm going to
cut these ear tabs to where they need to
be cut because as you see this is not
where it's at okay but all of this up
here so it could fit the shape of my
hairline my ear and all that so my ear
can pop out cuz nobody's walking around
like this okay no no no no no no so let
me go ahead and do that before I bring
this hairspray down and you're gonna
need a blow dryer
 it
we want a little bit of this lace still
there so we'll be going with the
hairspray is going to be easier for the
hairspray to lay down on this laser
because we don't want the hair spray on
the hair that's a no-no okay
okay we don't want this much lace this
is way too much so we have to cut this
off a little bit more all right babe so
I went back in and just cut some layers
lay this wig down i shampooed and
conditioned this hair put some layers in
it cut the dead ends off and I feel a
lot better about the hair but I have to
let you guys know some cons about it
because there are some and one of the
elastic band fell off and I just was
very pissed off about him just because I
was just like well listen if a girl is
out and that happens like what the hell
is she's supposed to do what if she
doesn't do my method to hold down the
front and then her wig is you just loose
that's you know that just makes people
not want to wear wigs but wings are
really really awesome to wear if you're
definitely trying to give your hair a
break and I also wanted to mention that
there was some slight shedding Lauren
Lauren and I just think it was because
of how light the hair was towards the
bottom so make sure you do your research
make sure you check out their reviews on
their website I'm just here to share
what I experienced with some well so I
will see you babies in my next video
their information will be linked in the
description box below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
