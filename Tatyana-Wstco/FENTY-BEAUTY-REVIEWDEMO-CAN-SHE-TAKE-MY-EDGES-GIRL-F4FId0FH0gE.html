beauty can I grab a few of the products
from fancy beauty line in Sephora it was
a little chaotic I went to three to four
us and I could not find my shade but
finally on the ninth yes we finally got
it together and I was able to get my 390
foundation shade from this line I am in
the shade 390 so they said I don't know
I might have to go and check out another
shade just just so I can make sure that
this is my correct shade but I think
it's okay I think it's fine I'm so
excited for you guys to see my thoughts
and just to see how beautiful this
packaging is with these products and
yeah girls so let's just jump right into
the video thank you so much for watching
and if you have tried any of these
products please list what your favorite
is so far from the fin see Beauty
Collection let's just jump right into
this video and I will see you guys in a
second
bye we're gonna get into this foundation
so it says Pro filters soft matte long
wear foundation like a satin finish I
will leave all of the information for
this product in the description box I
heard a lot of people say that this
foundation is really runny and on the
back it says shake well so make sure you
shake this foundation up advise you just
to scrape off the access at the top so
you're not getting it all over the
bottle and I heard this product oxidizes
so that means it just gets darker later
on if you feel like this doesn't look
like my shade we're gonna see because it
matched me pretty well before I walked
out of the store the other day so here
it goes I'm gonna go in with my morphe
439 brush and just stipple this onto my
skin and as you can see it's not as
running as people were saying it was so
just make sure you shake it up like it
says so you don't get it all over you
so I'm going to get a closer mirror
so I'm not getting any streaking I feel
like it's covering it's covering up my
imperfections most definitely and I
pretty much squirty like two to three
pumps on the back of my hand I feel like
this is really really pretty guys if it
and place it in the area that I feel
like I need a little bit more coverage
this has like a really velvety like
smoothing finish it's kind of weird it's
kind of hard to explain but it makes you
kind of feel like airbrushed like that's
what I'm getting I'm gonna apply a
little bit more in the center of my face
just to get a little bit more coverage
in this area and on my forehead just to
see if this is full coverage because I'm
getting full coverage vibes off of three
pumps now why I love this morphe 439
brush is because it really doesn't eat
up the product like a Beauty Blender
would she actually has a foundation
brush in her line so you can pick that
up if you want to but I know that I love
this brush with all of my heart size
I feel like I could have went a little
darker and I'm trying to look in the
viewfinder so like the foundation is
doing a great job at what it's supposed
to do which is just cover imperfections
it doesn't look cakey and it's super
lightweight I don't even feel like I
have four pumps of foundation on my face
so usually I don't use four pumps of
foundation but I just wanted to try to
see if it can get really really
full-coverage and I feel like it's
giving full coverage tees here I heard a
lot of people say that they could live
without the cream contour in concealers
that she has but I still want to
purchase them so I'm just going to color
correct a little bit I didn't want to
color correct any of my perfections on
my face I just wanted to see how well
the foundation would do with that as you
can see I have super dark under eyes so
that's why I do this step
with my Milani retouch integrase
concealer in the shade 6b punny and
apply that right underneath my eyes and
I'm going to take my Tarte shape tape
concealer place at in the same area but
I'm only going to do it like a quick
line
I'm gonna let that sit for a little bit
so the shape tape concealer can actually
like dry just a little bit because I
like when it drives because I feel like
it gets the full coverage vibe going I'm
gonna go in with my Real Techniques
sponge and of course it's damp and I'm
just gonna tap that out
nw15 concealer just to snatch my nose a
bit near my cheekbones I'm gonna go in
with my shimmer skin stick in the shade
of rum I'm gonna use this just to give
me like a natural glow with my skin it
looks like this packaging is really cute
a really soft touch and just make sure
your hands are clean before you go and
touch this because it's a really pretty
pale paint color and you don't want it
to get it you don't want to get it dingy
after like that this is like super dry
like I wish this was a little bit more
creamier
I feel like you will get the best
results with this product if you use
your Beautyblender swipe it on top and
then stipple it onto your face wherever
you want it to be at before you go in
and like start moving around your
foundation I'm gonna set my concealer
with my Maybelline shine free powder I'm
gonna fix this area a little bit that I
kind of got the powder in clearly this
is a cream product that's why we're able
to apply it onto our skin like this and
that's why it's in a tube like this also
notice that when it dries down it kind
of goes into like a powdery like
highlighted forum so that is like a plus
just because it won't move around on you
and it's not super creamy and that's
kind of what I was expecting it to be
that's not a problem for me as long as
it gets the job done
and you know it shows up on my skin and
it looks at this flawless so I'm gonna
go back in with my NYX stay matte but
not flat powder and I'm just going to
hit these points on my cheeks so just
get some color payoff going back onto my
face just to kind of give me like a
chiseled look this is just for the first
color and now I'm gonna go in with Coco
from NYX stay matte not flat and I'm
gonna hit the back points like right up
in here and this is just gonna give off
the appearance that my face is chiseled
and snatched how every girl wishes her
face was on a everyday basis look like
we are
Slade laid and ready to play
so I'm going to take this up my temples
a little bit too I'm going back in with
deep just so I can get you know the
intensity that I want around these areas
that powder is dusted away I'm gonna go
back in with cocoa I was saying this was
deep but it's called cocoa
last but not least we're gonna go in
with trophy wife girls
amazing on your sights so this is me
opening it just how the back looks this
is how the front looks really sleek and
pretty whites you can't go wrong with
white and this is how it looks on the
inside so freakin beautiful okay take my
501 brush from morphe and then I'm gonna
just swipe lightly because girl I've
seen so many reviews that was just like
what the living are you guys doing cuz
they went in just like you know scraped
it off so that's how that looks this
lighting is not giving this product
justice because girl I am blinding
people with this honey
when I say blinding blinding and my
brows are not even done so I don't want
to take it up too far but girl this was
a beautiful
beautiful this is pretty guys
like if you wear a dress girl oh yes
hit your collarbone a little bit with
this product and you cannot go wrong
funny it's this product could go super
like wild on you if you use that brush
so I advise you to get like another
brush just to apply her highlights with
just because her highlights are super
pigmented and blinding so just be really
careful when you apply it on your face
just because you know it's not Halloween
everyday I don't want you to think that
this is not for the everyday girl
because it is it's just about how you
apply it
so I do want to let you guys know that
I'm so freaking in love with this
foundation it's super flawless it makes
you look like you don't have any
problematic skin and if you do have
texture on your skin babes I don't know
what happen here but all I'm trying to
tell you guys if you have problematic
skin and even if you don't like Rihanna
has blushed you because this is matte
full coverage and you look so flawless
and it doesn't even look like this is a
full coverage foundation it's not heavy
it's amazing and it's $34 it's like I
can't sell it to you anymore you
literally have to go to Sephora right
now off the strength of this video
looking at my skin and knowing that I
have a problem with my skin currently it
doesn't even look like I have a problem
I know as soon as my face comes down
from my allergic reaction to my dog this
foundation is one of ten times better
like if you have completely clear skin
like you're gonna fall in love with that
if you have oily skin you're going to
fall in love with it because it's a
super matte foundation but it still
looks really flawless and it definitely
has like this velvety kind of smooth
effect that it's giving on your skin so
that's why I definitely recommend you
guys picking up a foundation the
foundation was $34 rum matchstick was
$25 and the trophy wife highlighter was
$34 as well so you know there's so many
different items that you can choose from
if you walk into Sephora you will see
double-sided highlighters I really
really want what does it call my money
baby or something like that so I really
really love all of the products I will
say the matchstick was the only thing
that kind of had me feeling really
skeptical but I got it together and I
know exactly how I will work it now in
the future when I am wearing it this
product I would recommend you move kind
of fast when you are trying to blend
this out because it is a cream product
but it dries down like a powdery form so
it's a great product but you definitely
to know how to work it I would say so
now that I know how to work this I will
go back and pick up a few more colors
just because they have so many to choose
from and they're like some super unique
colors in the line so I'll go be going
back to the store probably tomorrow to
get cinnamon and a few of the purple
lavender colors and also that peach
apricot color so let's get into this
trophy wife highlighter this is
blinding and beautiful I would say go in
with your own personal favorite
highlighting brush just because the one
that it comes with I think it will be
super super intense with this product
just because how intense it goes on with
a 5:01 brush from morphe and that's like
a really light feathery brush that brush
that she actually has for her line it's
really really dense so if you just wipe
one swipe of this product on top of your
face with that brush that she has from
her line girl you will look like so you
may want to go down to a more subtle
highlight I have my eye on one of them I
forgot what it's called uptick is like
money baby or something like that
the only reason why I didn't pick it up
is just because I liked one of the
shades and more than the other and I was
just like hmm do I want to spend 34
dollars or something that I halfway like
you know what I'm saying so but just
because it's Rihanna of course I will go
back and still purchase day I just
wanted to you know try these few items
out first give it a feel and of course
now I'm about to go and splurge or fancy
keep you posted in the comment section
as well as the description box if
anything changes let me know if you feel
like the foundation shade is perfect for
me mmm I don't know I hope you guys
loved this video definitely go out and
check out fit see beauty in Sephora
because you will find something that you
will love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
