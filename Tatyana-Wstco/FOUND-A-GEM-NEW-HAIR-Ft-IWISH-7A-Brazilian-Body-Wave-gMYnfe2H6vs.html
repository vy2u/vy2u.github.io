have in my I wish hair and I have in
four bundles of their 26 inch Brazilian
7 a body wave this is definitely some
7/8 hair amazing this is this natural
wave I haven't put any heating
appliances in this hair since I've been
rocking it but I thought to jump on
camera and actually do that for you guys
today right now so I hope you guys enjoy
this video what I could say about the
hair doesn't shed doesn't name up at the
back of my neck the bluster is beautiful
true to its length
I do have 26 inches so it's falling like
in the middle of month but I'm 535 4 I
just hope you guys enjoyed this video I
didn't really know what else to come and
show you guys because it's amazing
Brazilian body wave hair and I love
wearing it like this but I know you guys
were going to ask me like tonic doesn't
curl good does it straight and good and
of course I didn't want to string in
this amazing hair texture I'm just going
to throw in some curls and have to are
curly I'm going to put in my flexi rods
and a lot of you guys ask me why do I do
that and the only reason why I put flexi
rods in right after I curled the hair is
because I'm like you know allowing the
hair to sit and cool off on the flexi
rods and then when all of the hair cools
off after putting the flexi rods in the
hair it's just going to look so amazing
and so and really really pretty after
doing that so that's why I do that now
you know you know you know got it there
alright babies let's begin
I'm back and I love how the freakin hair
turned out after curling it is so
freakin pretty as you can see the
process really wasn't that hard
it was just me trying to curl my hair
with this tiniest curling iron but other
than that it holds an amazing curl is
really beautiful the luster is amazing
and I'm so freakin happy I'm about to go
out right now I'm finishing up Christmas
shopping because I thought I was done
but I'm not done but I love you guys so
pretty much I'll list all their
information in the description box below
please if you rocked
I wish hair let us know how your
experience was with the hair I would
love to know and if you guys are looking
for some body wave hair I would
definitely fit knit knit knit knit knit
knit knit knit knit ly say go look up
their feedback section trying to get
others opinions and purchases hair
because so far for me it's going so well
so I hope you guys enjoy this video I'm
probably gonna be wearing this hair for
Christmas in New Year's

pleased with the hair so thanks again
