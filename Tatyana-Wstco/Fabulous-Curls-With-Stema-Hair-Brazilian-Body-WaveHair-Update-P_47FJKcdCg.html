another video and today's video is going
to be my updated review for stomach hair
since they're Brazilian body wavelength
26 24 22 and an 18 inch frontal all
their information in their site direct
links will be in the description box
below I did an unboxing video for this
hair company so you now leave that in
the description box below as well so you
guys can check that out my thoughts on
the hair so I was very sad because when
I watched the air it didn't go back to
its wave pattern that I thought it was
going to go back to after I did my
co-wash Andy but I didn't want to show
you guys the hair in its natural state
before I curled it just so you does have
a wave like I said but it's just not as
precise as it was before I get my cold
washing but even with that being said
the hair is still amazing really soft it
holds an amazing curl I've done this
hairstyle before and the curls last for
maybe like two weeks so that makes up
for the body wave issue you don't really
have to keep curling your hair over and
over again
there's no shedding or a tingling or
like no foul smell with this hair at all
so I'll see you guys up into the video
with my results of this curling process
you tell me
okay ladies so basically this is all
that I'm gonna be doing with my my stem
my hair the hair holds an amazing curl
such great quality hair honestly like
the only con that I have with this here
is the body weight was a wave but it
wasn't really as poppin as it closed -
when I first came out the pack but
that's what you are going to be looking
forward to you know it's easy to run my
fingers through its really natural
looking this frontal is positive amazing
like amazing as you can see look at how
well this all the curls yeah so
basically this is all that I'm going to
be doing system or hair I hope to see
you guys in my next video and thank you
so much for life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
