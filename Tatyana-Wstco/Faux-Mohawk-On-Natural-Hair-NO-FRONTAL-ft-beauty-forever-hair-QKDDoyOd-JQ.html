video today I'm going to be showing you
guys the style that's you seen in the
beginning I really liked how this turned
out this is my first time doing this
look on myself so it was just me just
being over frontals and not really
wanting to use one and I wanted to
incorporate using my natural hair in a
video with some bundles you guys know
the typical wrap around your ponytail
that I've been showing you guys how to
do on my channel so there's nothing
different in this video today you just
need to make sure that you're lining up
your tracks when you do start wrapping
your hair around I'm going to be using
my Beauty forever
Malaysian curly bundles for this look
today I use two bundles I didn't use the
third bundle I do have 26 24 22 and I
use 26 22 yeah and I ended up just
layering the 26 bundles so I'm basically
sectioning off my hair in three
different sections and I'm going to
basically wrap the bundles around my
little baby buns that I end up making
for myself as you can see my brother had
to help me with my middle part because I
was struggling like you know who can do
this by ourselves sometimes anyway I'm
just using eco styling gel to slick my
hair down my hair is natural obviously I
feel like you guys we thing cannot be
purpose but ain't no reason for a bitch
to perp about what is going on with the
natural hair my hair is just on the
finer side so that's why it just looks
down so easily you know what I'm saying
thank my mama and my papa
because they both have thin hair my dad
just has curly hair so anyway that's
that so once again just ego styling gel
and water and some good hair ties to get
you know your you know ponytails as
tight as you need them to be of course
don't have your hair mad tight because
throughout the day you will start having
a headache because you're also going to
be wrapping around you're gonna be
wrapping a bundle around your little
baby buns that you are going to make for
yourselves
so your hair can get out of the way as
much as possible but other than that
that is all that I'm gonna be doing in
this video really really
self-explanatory you can leave it big
you can just combing out like I had but
you're gonna see that I just added some
water just to get the real texture so
you can see you know when you first
receive your bundles it's not going to
look exactly how the you know natural
pattern is supposed to you're gonna need
some water and just to get the natural
texture because you know they keep it in
this little style so you know when you
receive the hair it's presentable it
doesn't look all messy and crazy and
whatever but when you put water on it
you actually get the actual wave pattern
that you're hoping for so I just want
you guys to see that I ended up putting
some layers on the hair just so the hair
can stay in place but once again it's up
to you how you want to rock it I am
gonna curl this hair just so it can be
really really tight and I feel like the
mohawk will look a little cooler so you
will see that in the second video for
beauty for ever but I will keep you guys
updated about the hair because this is
my first day wearing it so I'm really
not you know sure about it I dig it some
shedding it's curly hair so of course
you're gonna expect that from curly hair
just long as it's not excessive shedding
you know okay with it but it hasn't been
doing anything wrong and the hair is
really really soft so yeah I love you
guys i hope you guys and you know get
the gist of the video you guys see me do
this plenty of times now on my channel
but their information beauty forever
information will be listed in the
description box below if you are
interested in once again this is their
malaysian curly hair I love you guys and
