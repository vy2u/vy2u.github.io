video and I actually did this video
earlier today but I went to go try to
edit it and then some of the footage was
going so I don't know what happened to
it but I'm back and we're going to get
through this we're not going to get
upset we're just going to loose ah and
start over you don't have to be natural
but this is the stuff that I use for my
natural hair let me know if you use any
of these items in become a section below
or even if you have anything that you
suggest me using for my hair you can
list it in the comment section below as
well now we're just going to kind of go
in order like what I do when I actually
do rock my natural hair and let's begin
so the first thing I want to mention is
my favorite Holy Grail like if I don't
have it I will go out at night and go
and get this if I run out this
amazing so this is the Garnier hope
Lynn's repairing conditioner love this
stuff and shampoo this is a shampoo this
is the conditioner compare it clearly I
love this way more than this so it's
just supposed to strengthen inhale
damaged hair it has all kinds of natural
ingredients free of things that are
terrible for your hair you can use it on
your natural hair you can use don't perm
here if I could use it on my skin I
would that's how amazing that stuff is
and it smells like heaven so the next
items that I want to mention is the
other shampoo and conditioner that I use
when I don't want to strip my hair any
of its greatness and I just want to make
sure I protect everything and help roll
my hair as much as possible
and this my sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner from Marc Anthony's line
this is the hydrating coconut oil and
shea butter sulfate free shampoo and
conditioner really do love this stuff
smells like heaven you can pick this up
at your local drugstore this is amazing
it's just supposed to restore dry
damaged and supercharge healthier and
faster growing hair it's infused with
biotin so biotin is just of course
supposed to give you happy nails happy
hair happy skin and why wouldn't you
want that in your shampoo
and your conditioner right so that's
that now when I you go deconditioning my
hair and I still want to have some
leave-in conditioner in there I go for
my can - leave-in conditioner
looks like this it just makes my hair a
little bit more manageable to work with
it has great ingredients once again
smells lovely amazing you guys need to
pick this up if you don't have it now
the other product that I use for
leave-in conditioner is the Shea
Moisture jamaican black castor oil
strengthen growth and restore leave-in
conditioner it has shea butter
peppermint and keratin ins out of it and
the best thing to make it black castor
oil if you guys don't know about
jamaican black castor oil you can get
its little black bottle slap it all your
edges slap it in your scalp do hot oil
treatments on your hair when to make
them black castor oil so for it to even
be like in something like this oh yeah
I'm all for Cantu coconut curling cream
just supposed to leave your hair a
little bit more manageable noticing
you're here
slick your hair up comb your hair
through whatever this stuff amazing and
it smells like coconuts like who doesn't
let this sulfate free oh it's just
amazing how a product can smell this
good I love it alright so next thing I
want to mention is another amazing mic
product like that
it's the shea moisture jamaican black
castor oil strength and grow and restore
styling lotion now it's supposed to
moisturize protect and shine add some
shine to yo hair girl it has shea butter
pepper dip peppered it peppermint and
keratin inside of it and once again
smells like heaven throw this in there
after I applied my leave-in conditioner
whichever product I want to use or
sometimes I even use both because I am
dramatic I don't even know how I was
living without this but I was until my
mom decided to pick it up for my little
sister and then of course somehow it
ended up in my bathroom for a couple of
months
and then I was just like let me go and
get my own now this stuff right here
this is from Carol's Daughter the mimosa
hair honey it's better than grease it's
not as like donkey sticky and
he as Greece it has an amazing smell you
know some Greece don't smell so good
is a shine pomade and it's for dry
brittle and textured hair moisturizes
scalp conditions hair controls frizz and
it really does believe it or not I use
this so slick down my edges to water and
this amazing love it the local drugstore
get it thank me later
now the next thing since I've been
talking about edges to make them black
castor oil strip and grow restore edge
treatment slap this on your hair the
texture is kind of weird so don't get
scared it's like a jelly type of kind of
filling to it but um I really like this
stuff I don't really use this that much
anymore but I still think it's a great
product and I feel like you should just
have it in your natural girl hair care
collection if you want and it smells
like play-doh actually nice this is how
it looks if you could see yep and this
is the Jamaican black castor oil in its
original form again if your edges are
about to leave your scalp put this one
there hot oil treatments even if you
want to do that you can't heat the water
up first in a bowl plastic bowl don't do
anything with glass put it in the
microwave two minutes three minutes
whatever is your type of temperature
stick this in the bowl
don't put it back in the microwave sit
it in there
leave it in the bowl for maybe 30
minutes take this out dump it on your
hand spa treatment so that s when I want
this lake to pony tail bees wax local
Beauty Supply Store 100% beeswax I just
used a really hard brush a really soft
brush select my hair up put it in a bun

about biotin so like this is what my
hair is much thicker plus I had to make
a black castor oil you do have another
one that isn't as high as 10,000 these
MC g's and you
get that instead of this one but
Walgreen water if you want your hair to
grow if you want your skin to be happy
if you want your skin to be healthy if
you want you to just be healthy your
