you guys how I found my bra virgin hair
boutique hair today I'm just going to
try to put some like waterfall kind of
curls in this hair um this is the hair
in this natural stay really lightweight
I do have one of the bundles that I did
not install in my head right here so
this is how the hair looks if you're
interested in purchasing the ends aren't
bad at all but what I can't tell you
this hair is very light and like really
not full at all this is how much hair
that you get on one bundle um so you
probably would need like four bundles or
five depending on what Muenster trying
to get if you're trying to bleach this
hair be careful how much you lift this
hair because because of how like light
and fluffy this hair is it can cause a
lot of breakage so I just want you to be
aware of that but I'm just going to go
ahead and stab this hair I have curled
his hair and it does hold a nice curl so
yeah this is Brazilian body way from
this hair company all their direct links
will be listed in the description box
below
it isn't a Aliexpress hair company you
guys can actually check their website
out if you're interested they do have
tons of the textures on their website
their customer service is really great
and yeah so I'll check other videos out
Robert your hair boutique hair if you're
interested to know how their hair is I
did cut some layers in this hair only
because it can look really flat if you
don't put like any layers in it oh I
wasn't going for that look but yeah so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video
Oh
Oh
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm
done curling my hair that's like the
fastest I've ever combed my hair but I
really do love how lyin area natural
this hair is if you want 26 I would
definitely recommend you get at least
for 26 inches so you can have a full
head of hair to be on the safe side just
because this is how much hair that you
get on a 26 inch this is a really like a
small amount of hair and so if short
lengths try to get it like 3 bundles and
a closure or frontal and then that
that's all I really want to say about
this hair I'm going to go out tonight
and hopefully these curls last for some
time I just put some flat iron curls in
there and I'm not sure what flatter and
this is I got this for my mom she gave
it to me and she doesn't even know where
it came from I'll probably like end up
getting me a chi or something like that
just because I want to at least use a
flat iron that you guys knows about even
though it's light and airy it's still
gonna have like a ant bout the end of
the night it's not going to be just flat
completely and I really do like this
look and let me know how you guys feel
about their hair a lot of girls that
actually rock Robert your hair boutique
on YouTube so please do your research
before you decide purchasing from this
hair company you know other people have
different opinions about how they Robert
your hair boutique hair held up but mine
is doing pretty good I've had this hair
for some time now and I just wanted to
rock it and give you guys on this
opinion before I came on and tried to do
like a style with you I did put layers
in this hair because of how light the
hair is I just wanted to add a lot more
body in the hair but it's really
