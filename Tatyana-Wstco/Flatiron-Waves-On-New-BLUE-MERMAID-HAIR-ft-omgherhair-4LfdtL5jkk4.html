the back information as soon as I start
this video I just wanted to say hello
happy Sunday and we have made it to 100k
thank you so much let's come on my
Familia I am so so excited because I
thought I would never hit 100k like
numbers don't mean anything to me but to
know that my channel is still growing
and you know you guys don't forget about
me and you always check up on me and you
know you keep me motivated and you push
me to you know do things that I know
that I'm capable of doing
even when I'm down and out and all that
jazz you know I still get up and I still
appreciate every last one of you and you
guys mean so much to me so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I added some
color just to add some little fun on my
channel because I feel like everything
has just been you know kind of basic
black and I actually did a Cherry Bomb
like a cherry red and if you guys
haven't seen that video I'll list it in
the description box below you may think
I used more than one dye color for this
to achieve this color but I didn't i
only use indigo blue i dyed the hair
when it was wet so that's kind of why
has this two-tone vibe going on because
certain pieces wasn't as wet as others
unit is constructed really well it fits
me really snug i did go in and tweeze it
a little bit pre pluck away so you don't
have to do a lot of plucking but i went
in and trying to pluck as much as i can
just to make it look a little bit more
natural on the sides always units look
really good in the front but i kind of
like had to go in and know tweak the
sides a little bit more just because i
felt like they were a little bit too
full for me it's definitely about your
preference in which you look forward to
look like when you are wearing a wig so
keep that in mind in this video you're
gonna see me style this hair with my
nano bliss butter and so can get this
look with any hot tool that you have at
home
just practice practice practice so I
hope you guys enjoy this video thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next one
fire I have a 10 inch away from this
hair company I will list all the
information in the description box below
but the back story I just want to let
you guys know that I died this last
night and I haven't really worn it out
so today I decided that I wanted to jump
on camera and show you guys how I would
be styling it for tonight's use and the
go blue from add or Die to achieve this
color blue so yeah so I hope you guys
enjoy the video I'm just going to use my
flat iron and probably my little ratchet
curling iron just to put some curls in
this hair so it's just gonna be sped up
just because I have somewhere to be and
I don't want to be doing this all I
don't want to be talking through this if
it's unnecessary to talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
