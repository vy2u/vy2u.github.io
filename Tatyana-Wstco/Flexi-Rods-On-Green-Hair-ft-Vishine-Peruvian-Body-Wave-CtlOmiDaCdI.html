my body wave update for a bichon so I
dyed the hair I bleached the hair and
the hair looks fabulous
I love the freakin color I did adore
dyes and it was in because our emeralds
I then bleached the hair up to really
like a bright bright blond color it was
more like a natural nice pretty honey
brown if that makes sense and then I
just put the dye on top of that
bleaching the bundles dead lose a bit of
the wave pattern isn't as precise as it
was when I first got the hair the hair
is so beautiful if you guys haven't
checked out my unboxing for this hair
you can check that out and it's really
pretty so the frontal didn't lose its
pattern so much I like straightening
this hair the most though and showing
off the color here is this straight
right now I did blow it out with my
blow-dryer
so I'm going to put some curls in it
because I haven't curled this hair yet I
just been rocking it straight so pretty
long it goes all the way down lovely
that's me here so beautiful
look it's a lot of different changes
because I've actually worked with it
before I really do love me shines hair
you can check out all the positive
reviews that they have on their website
because a lot of other girls who loves
each odd hair also Bichon hair is just
full of life it has so much luster and
it has a lot of movement a detangling or
shedding or anything crazy at all I'm
not receiving anything crazy after my
bleaching job so I hope you guys enjoy
this video I'm gonna go ahead and start
styling now
take me outside
