loves I'm back with another video and
today I'm going to be doing a first
impressions with a new foundation of
course I haven't tried that the whole
point of first impressions I want to try
a new products with you guys so of
course is going to be dealing with
makeup as you can see see it part of my
face is complete the eyes but the rest
is still looking like what are you doing
don't get me lying about the same it's
like tint it dull Ultra 24 makeup I
don't know it's French so I don't speak
French but it has SPF in it it says
we're in comfort retouch free makeup
design perfection all skin types my
shade is in 4060 suede WX up to 24 hours
of wear for a divine lasting perfection
it's above having velvet matte finish so
we're going to jump into this bad boy
and I'm going to use a foundation brush
not a Beauty Blender but I am going to
like pushing into my skin with a Beauty
Blender to get a really flawless effect
but I am going to go in with my clean
439 aren't you happy that this is clean
for y'all yes bitch I was like I cannot
keep showing these dirty as brushes ok
so the foundation I'm going to be giving
a try is the Lancome tinted old ultra
the ten speeds of ultra 24-hour makeup
foundation and it supposed to be a
full-coverage flawless foundation once
again it's oil free fragrance free
transfer free and tested or sensitive
skin so just know that it's supposed to
be a really good foundation so that's
why I'm trying it out for you guys I'm
sure there's tons of reviews online this
does retail for about forty seven
dollars so you can go and pick it up
from Sephora that's where I bought mine
and yes so we're just going to jump
right in the color that I'm in is 460
suede W and I color match myself
she actually like told me that I was a
shade lighter than this and I was just
like shorty and I'll go to play me is
that shake well before using our prawns
and moisturize and even more dramatic
and just pump it on my face and see what
happens
okay one two my more feet or do nine and
stipple this all around my face done
alone okay this is looking a little like
she was trying to give me a lighter
color than this yeah like this is given
my neck but you know we are going into
summer and stuff so I'm going to end up
having to give me some darker foundation
because I'm actually really liking this
color it's not giving off a really red
undertone
so what'd you guys think so I still see
some spots like that I will want a
little bit more coverage in so I'm just
going to take some more and I just want
to make this as full coverage as it says
and you never know a foundation can
oxidize and become one with you and
that's the life this is what this
foundation is doing right now
because I feel like this is a lot more
lighter but when I packed it in it
actually turned like warmer
and whatever is left over I'm going to
press it into my so as you can see I'm
just pressing the foundation and not
blending so much this is how you get the
most coverage as well I've been trying
to get um the whole point of me
purchasing this foundation is because I
want to get into more full coverage
foundations I'm so used to doing
something that's dewy lightweight and
buildable but nothing like super full
full coverage I want to purchase a
foundation that was full coverage and
supposed to be a really good full
coverage foundation I really wanted to
purchase be-what foundation is that the
Giorgio Armani foundation but I was just
like girl I do something different like
don't get that silky effect that glowy
skin effect like go for something that
is not your comfort zone I'm liking it
like I can't even tell that this is a
full coverage foundation like that but
it still looks really flawless and it
doesn't look cakey it supposed to be for
all skin types but I still feel like it
has some shine in it it's not super like
just matte completely and I thought it
was going to be a super matte kind of
fill because that's kind of like what
I'm looking for and I know what Mac's
like I don't want a matte foundation
because Mac just breaks my ass out when
it comes to their foundation I do love
their Pro Longwear foundation from Mac
but that's just more so on the dewy side
to the jewelry family the natural glow
what it is but it is buildable that
foundation and who can get like a full
full like coverage kind of live with it
I must admit that but maybe it's just
meant for me to have like a natural
finish with my makeup I guess the makeup
cause is like that you don't need super
cakey makeup but I'm going to find me
something that is just like it's hard to
even come off on the makeup
why do I want that on
girls who want to put like a fourth
layer on it I feel like that just way
too bizarre what I'm going to do next is
just apply some concealer I'm going to
use fawn concealer from la girl pro and
I'm going to just press that right under
the eye looking at it now and it's
probably been like 2 or 3 minutes after
putting the third layer it looks good
like velvety matte is definitely what I
feel like I feel like it's not doing any
more it's getting more on the smooth
finish like airbrush I want to ground my
heart shape paint concealer and be shade
pants and to just add some more
brightness because you see this eye look
is giving you drama honey if you guys
going to see this eye look let me know
and become this section below because I
have fun I have fun doing it and it was
super simple and easy and I don't know
it's like the makeup guys is like girl
it's your time asked me to do this maybe
five months ago how it was they couldn't
do it couldn't have done it you want to
take a damp Beauty sponge from Tarte and
always dance never draw so I'm also
going to use this to guide me to pinch
my nose I've been getting better at my
nose contour too I talked so much
about my nose contour and one of my
videos and then I felt like I woke up
one day and I was just like bitch I
think you can figure this out and I was
trying all day and I cry and up you got
what I was looking for
okay
so clearly this is going to be a super
snatch look because of this dramatic eye
look the concealer looks really good on
top of the foundation using NW 50
concealer from mac to contour filling
out the hollows of your cheeks will be
the best way to do this probably with
your finger like I'm doing or you can
just use a brush but make sure the brush
is slim enough to fit in that area
buffing brush Real Techniques press that
into my skin also brings in your back
into your face because after applying
all that foundation that's the same
color as your skin and adding lighter
concealers or just adding a concealer
just to brighten you up or to conceal it
can make you look really flat and washed
out so you will have to go in and add
some color and that's where contour will
help you at once again I'm going to add
another contour shade because I forgot
to mix this one and this is expresso
from Bobbi Brown using it just to deepen
up the contour because I feel like the
other one is just a little bit too
subtle keeping it right in this area
somewhere we could get away if you will
find another place he would never leave
a chain Laura Mercier powder and I mixed
this powder with some of my shot free
maybelline powder and I'm going to look
up and sit and make sure there's no
creases in your eyes before setting
because it can just turn out to be a hot
mess okay so yeah
generous amount with me do whatever you
feel whatever floats your boat or
tickles your fancy me looking extra
crazy because I have all of this powder
on my face around but it's cool it's
going in and we get in there all right
so I'm going to go in with my black
radiance contour kit using these two
shades wrong palette one second please -
shade on the right just to warm me up
set my face using the n7 super blendable
lore'l foundation powder just to bring
some color back into my face and also to
set that cream contour so we go in with
the actual contour colors it's not going
to be patchy right and now I'm going to
use this brush to press the powder
underneath my eyes and away from my nose
go if you want
not press this powder into my skin I
don't like sweeping it away because I
feel like it just makes me look patchy I
say that I feel like I'm saying that in
every video but I've been learn to do a
lot more talk terms because I feel like
it's just easier for you guys to
understand what I'm doing and also just
to you know chitchat with you guys a
little bit more without you having just
to see me do something don't know what
it is and just have it list it in the
description box below if I ever put it
in there you know to kid this foundation
is definitely a keeper
I'm not sleeping at all y'all like if I
was using the genius gel right now I
would still like those oils are coming
through already to finish this eye look
and I'll be right back I'm going to put
my final thoughts about the foundation
in the description box as well cuz hold
up really good right now
but of course we have to go out and have
some adventure with it a little bit
before I can give it in school a plus so
I will have that extra information for
you in my final thoughts in the
description box below so make sure you
check that out thank you so much for
watching baby and I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
