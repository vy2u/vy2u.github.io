with another video today what is these
shoulders did you have your makeup
brushes clean it's not you know it's
okay cuz mine are you think today is
gonna be a little bit different than
usual I'm gonna be doing a full face
using majority of Becca cosmetics makeup
the first thing that I want to talk to
you guys about is their deep puff
brightening under-eye setting little
trio kind of situation here
I'm not gonna use the deep puffing
primer and this is this little blue
thing right here it looks like that the
second step is the under eye brightening
corrector and it comes with two of them
and this is their setting powder right
here so I'm gonna believe I'm gonna use
the setting powder like I said it's
majority of their stuff not everything
so I'm gonna use the medium deep one
because obviously my skin complexion is
one of the deeper side so this is how it
looks this how it looks it doesn't smell
like anything pretty packaging I love
the packaging cream so this is their
foundation comes with the primary it
comes with a brush this is usually
behind here so that's kind of why it's a
little dusty but we're gonna put it to
the test today I'm not sure exactly what
complexion I am I'm just gonna go with
expresso and pump it on my neck because
there valve a blurring primer I'm gonna
pump some on the back of my hand cuz I
don't know how it squirts out and I'm
glad I did look that's how it looks
wearing it out I'm gonna talk to you
guys about my hair and stuff too cuz
I've been loving this unit that I made
for myself using some Brazilian straight
hair under eye corrector and this to be
really really creamy like if I'm not dug
into it it did all of that so that's how
you know it's like really really creamy
so I'm here for it so I'm just going to
kind of like pack in
stupid this into my skin alright so
that's that so now what I'm gonna do I'm
just going to like blend out the outer
parts of it and I'm gonna bring a clip
closer mirror to my face so I can see
what this is given so you definitely
have to blend this in I am going to
conceal like I usually do but I'm just
gonna go in with my full coverage
concealer well I feel like this is full
coverage with my NARS creamy concealer
and I'm going to place that right on top
of there like that I'm sorry if my
camera is going in and out it is about
to rain so no I don't have any more
sunlight because I took forever to start
filming today well yeah
so I'm just gonna go in with my NARS
creamy concealer and let this sit
underneath you know also how about I
should have primed I thought I was gonna
already different girl today has been a
long day alright so I'm going to dry
this concealer down the bridge of my
nose the center of my forehead on my
chin around these areas in the center
I'm gonna try to really snatch my face
for no reason cuz I'm not going in okay
so I'm going to shake up this foundation
I don't know if it says to but I just
feel like it needs to be shaken up and
once again this is expresso I'm on the
redder side so hopefully this works out
and if it doesn't work out I'll make it
work trust me so I'm going to use my
little morphine two to four brush to
basically put this onto my face so as
you can see that's a really dark but the
the complexions are pretty dark so I
can't do anything about it other bench
prata finesse it like look at that yeah
and this is express out so if I took my
hominy is way way too warm cocoa cocoa
is really dark like I can use that for a
contour I always do swatches on the back
of my hands at the end of the video so
you can see sandalwood is just like
expresso I just feel like it's a little
bit more warm what do you guys think
that's saddle this is set over right
here so this is giving you really the
really red undertones but like I told
you I'm gonna tweak it I'm gonna fix it
no stress okay so this is how we're
looking I put a little bit of saddle on
my forehead keys so you guys can see the
difference and I have expresso down here
okay so let's go onto blending this out
I'm gonna take a little bit of my fix
plus spray that on my face and also
spray this on my brush I like the real
warm honey but it's okay so we're going
to stipple out the foundation first
I feel like you can't go wrong with
getting like a foundation a little bit
on the darker side because you can tweak
it and make it work for you more so if
you go with a lighter foundation and
then trying to get the proper undertone
for that like if you hit like deal with
a problem like this you can use your
concealer to balance your face out a lot
easier than having two sticks like a
great cast on your face because your
your foundation is too like so take it
down
perhaps take it down RORO far as this
but it's cool you just use whatever is
left and whatever is left is freakin
saddle but we don't get it we go get it
to work
all right so we're gonna have to really
really balance it out so I'm gonna go in
I feel like I am a whole different race
right now so we're gonna take my Tarte
Tan sander and then take my Beauty
Blender only about - we bout to see what
we could do here sis
I know y'all scared for me right now but
school have faith in me
I feel like I'm gonna have use that
foundation colors it's a contour as well
because my contour is naughty so I guess
I feel like I could still use expresso
cuz if I go darker again like I'm P if I
up the ante one contour now like with a
different shade I might look broke real
crazy alright so like right so like
we're we're getting somewhere here we're
getting and place this underneath
because I just don't want it to be like
really dark and then really light in the
center cuz then that's gonna look like I
definitely don't know what I'm doing so
I'm gonna go back with a concealer
that's a little bit closer to my skin
complexion again
all right so same thing I'm gonna go
over with the brush okay so setting the
under-eye setting the chin area hit
these areas a bit lightly since they're
like so warm
why not because this is really not my my
complexion so you can just like go over
this area and hopefully the help of the
yellow of this powder hope it Islands
out everything and this has some flushes
and then stuff like that but I'm gonna
still stick with my NYX stay matte not
flat to bronze on my face
and they have this really pretty sponsor
right here this called bronze Bondi yeah
they have this really pretty bronzer
right here I'm going to try to use it
because I've never used it before so
this is kind of like a first impression
of impressions as well
now I'm gonna go in with this blush
right here just hitting the hot parts of
my face and I feel like that's good
enough because I'm not a blush girls so
one swipe is good enough for me but what
possessed me to put a sweater on so
we're just gonna let that marinate under
there okay so now we're going to start
on the eyes because I do have a new
palette from them alright so this is
their ocean Jules
situation this is an eyeshadow palette
in a highlighter highlighter palette
eyeshadow palette I'm going to go in
with eyeshadow palette right now alright
so I'm going to take this shape right
here and this is just to set the
concealer
I'm gonna go in with this chocolate
color called sandstone this is a really
pretty color and this is what I'm
excited about the most in this palette I
love me a chocolate color so I'm just
placing it down and like that outer-v I
don't know if I'm gonna do a halo eye
but I guess I am
since are you just started applying it
so I'm just placing it where I want or
how I want this to turn out cuz I'm just
trying to use this palette in this
palette
okay so right now I'm just using this
True Match bronzer to tie this look
together at the bottom I'm going to use
the darker color in a second but I just
need another warm shade to go down
before just like I used it up in here to
blend out my concealer
they're super blendable foundation
powder and place it underneath
I'm just would suggest you know if you
are my complexion just go find you the
foundation that actually matches but I
love the I look and like I said this
came straight out of the pallets using
only only using sandstone in spirit
quartz that's what's on my lids so this
is their highlighter palette really
really pretty looks like this just
giving me that Rihanna vibe well we
ain't gonna like it here okay so I feel
like I'm just at my face again
I'm gonna take this golden shade right
here cuz that's the coral coral crystal
yeah coral crystal crystal
yeah so the thing that I didn't do was
really set my face with a finishing
powder but I felt like because this is a
full-coverage I don't really need to do
that
I'm not shining through at all with this
look so I'm really excited about that
but I am going to apply my mascara and
then use a nude in my waterline let me
use this Laura powder to just get this
little light cast off my face from the
Sasha buttercup Laura Mercier iron love
muffin this look has been completed the
only thing that I did that you might
have not seen is added downtown lip
liner around my lips
I'm also winning with my naturally
transformed lipstick with Mac and then I
put in the center in the center of my
lips is and in the center of my lips is
the glass bomb from fancy Beauty so
that's pretty much it and I also apply
my salon perfect lashes in the number
613 on obviously my eyes and yes so that
is about it that completes this look my
overall thought for it to not have been
the perfect matching foundation shade I
feel like I really finesse this look
okay so let's give me a pat on the back
a round of applause for a key
you know here for you guys also because
I do want to talk to you guys about what
hair I have in recently we do need to
fix this because this is always a
problem when I take that little thing
off but it's cool because I'm just going
to be wearing my hair straight down
anyway so yeah so so yeah so I'm gonna
get my arm really quick and then we're
going to straighten this hair and we're
going to wrap this video up
I love muffin so we have completed
today's get ready let me talk to you
guys about the hair really quick before
I get off the camera
so this hair is actually from thou best
hair but let me show you what I got from
them yeah this is actually a dolly
Express hair company I have 18 20 22 and
a 16 inch frontal end right but the real
thing about it is I only have what
happened I have in 20 and 22 and not the
18 so I was going for a more natural
look when I did this and of course you
guys know I do ponytail looks and stuff
like that so I didn't need to extra
bundle to do that with but I loved how
this hat was really effortless and um
just natural-looking so I just went with
just going in with two bundles with this
look so if you guys are interested in
getting this hair and you want to you
want it to be more so in the natural
side I could have stuff the third bundle
in there but I didn't want to it may be
too thick for you personally but this is
a look that I really enjoy especially if
I'm trying to wear my hair up or in like
a little sleek little look two bundles
will get the job done my mom loves this
way because she feels like you know it's
give me like natural hair vibes I don't
have any cons with this hair I've had
this hair for almost like a month yeah
for months honestly and I've been
wearing this hair non-stop only because
it's really good this is their Brazilian
straight hair oh this is just my
personal preference while I was making
the wig I was thinking of
having it looked a little bit more flat
and natural on my hand because I usually
always put three bundles am but I just
wanted to see if two bundles will get
the job done and it did as long as you
have a front so you should be completely
fine like I said I do have a 16 inch
front so in from this hair company and
I've decided to put a little layers
going on in it I've decided that I'm
going to add like a little fringe in
there for me so it wouldn't just be
straight down and super flat um what I
usually do with this hair I wash it and
then I round brush it but today I just
round brush the fringe and it's getting
on remember when I do my hair I do my
hair for me not Suzanne not for Jonathan
not for Timmy and not for Samantha I do
it for me
so whenever you see in a video that I do
it's honestly me doing it because I want
to do it you don't have to do the exact
same thing as me and I don't even get
into this long like two minutes speech
about how what I do is for me because
you guys should already know that but
you know I'm always here to hear
feedback don't don't forget the thumbs
up comment subscribe you know keep it
positive in the comments section before
I figure out how to get a team of
beehives underneath my comments section
to gross the out of somebody I
really really love how this makeup look
turned out the hair information will be
listed in the description box below
very very nice hair I have no cons with
it the hair is super super soft I hope
