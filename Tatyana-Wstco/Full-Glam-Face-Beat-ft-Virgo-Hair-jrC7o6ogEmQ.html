video today I'm gonna be showing you
guys how I got the look that you just
seen in the beginning so I hope you guys
are interested so let's just jump right
into this process so I'm gonna be taking
my la girl Pro concealer in cool tan
using that to highlight and conceal
today and I'm going to take my a BH
foundation stick in the shade walnut to
contour and this is just to make sure
your chiseling your face and bringing
color back to your face and also some
definition and dimension and I'm gonna
go in with two foundation shades from
the next total control line and I'm
taking cappuccino and caramel and I'm
mixing those two to get the closest
shade to my skin complexion as I
possibly can I'm right in between both
of these shades and yeah so that's why I
like mixing these two I'm gonna be
taking my morphe 439 brush foundation
brush and I'm going to blend everything
together pretty much focusing the
foundation in the contour together and
then I'm gonna take my Beauty Blender to
get my under eyes and the rest of the
highlighted areas so they can pop a
little bit more so they won't be like
you know blending in too much with the
foundation and the contour shades but
it's all about making sure there's no
harsh lines and Longy mark Asian and all
that kind of stuff you just want
everything to look seamless so you're
gonna be seeing me go back and forth
between my Beauty Blender and my
foundation brush just to get that you
know look that I'm looking for and don't
forget to take your foundation down your
neck sometimes I always seem to forget
this and then it like is a problem by
the end of my makeup routine
so like I said I'm gonna go in with my
bro technique Beauty Blender to just you
know blend out that concealer you guys
know I have inherited dark eye circles
so I just like making sure my under eyes
are really popping oh and by the way
that was a vanity planet brush that I
use to blend out my contour on my nose I
love that brush to do that just because
it stays in the area that I want it in
and I'm just like going over with my
Beauty Blender just to make sure there's
no harsh lines then I'm gonna set my
under eyes using my Laura Mercier powder
I mix it with my Sasha Buttercup and I
love this together I love these two
products together I just feel like you
know the yellow from the Sasha Buttercup
make sure that I'm not having too much
flashback or a flashback at all because
I don't do flashback honey
you know what I'm saying but um yeah I
just like the color that it brings you
know to my face and it's not like a
stark white translucent color so yeah so
I'm just using that to set my under eyes
and the other highlighted areas and I'm
going to take my True Match powder and
also my Sephora micro smooth powder and
deep just to set the rest of my face I
am combination skin so I have to do this
step and I'm gonna take this true match
foundation powder
I forgot the shade I will listen in the
description box below but I like using
this so it broadens my face up a little
bit I kind of went overboard and hit my
neck too much and now it looks like my
face is darker than my neck but anyway
I'm gonna take this Paint Pot from Mac
and this is in the shade soft ochre and
I'm using that just to prep and prime my
eyes so my eyeshadows can stay on all
day and I'm taking a color that's that
similar to that Paint Pot and I'm just
gonna set that so when I go in with this
shade right here it's easier to blend
out versus if I didn't set it it would
be really hard to blend out and it will
be looking really patchy so this color
is like a Coco bear shade and I'm gonna
go in with that Jaclyn hill favorite
color of mine that pukey color
I believe this actually called pukey 2
and I'm using that to blend out my
transition area as well as bring me some
color back into my crease so back and
forth
and then I'm gonna go and cut out my
eyelid space just so I can have a bigger
eyelid and I'm using my Tarte shaped
tape concealer and medium to do so or I
think it's like medium I believe this
medium or cool tan anyway I'm just going
to do that process and make sure that
sublimity out and I'm also going to drag
it out a little bit further just because
I can't I kind of wanted a feline look
so yeah then my mom called me and so I
had to finesse while I was on the phone
and then I'm just gonna take and not
enough from no no no I'm gonna take this
like matte white cream beige color and
I'm just gonna pop that right on my lid
and then I'm just gonna go back with
like like I'm gonna say like a bronzy
color in my transition area just so
there's no harsh lines but I forgot to
put that clip in there and I'm just
going to blow up this clip that I have
of me putting my eyeliner on because I
kind of was far away so that's why so
zoomed in right now but I'm using my ELF
black liquid liner I love this liner
like I love this liner I wasn't hip to
the NYC liner that you guys were really
hype over back in the day but I had to
you know get this one because it's the
cheapest when I was first starting off
doing my makeup and I just fell in love
with this one it's only a dollar at
Target Walmart your local beauty supply
store not beauty supply store but your
local drugstore and it's so easy to get
your hands on so I love this product
I'm gonna go in with downtown beauty
from NYX and I'm gonna outline my lips I
really really want sandstorm from this
liner collection but they always seem to
be out when I go and get it but I love
downtown Beauty also and I'm gonna take
peach stock for the first time ever I
love this lipstick now it's a really
perfect nudey pink for my skin
complexion and it's from Mac and I
really really like how it turned out and
I'm gonna top it off with some gloss
and by the way I put some mascara on
also tight line with the white liner in
my waterline so my eyes can pop a little
bit more and I'm going to put some Ardo
1:13 lashes on to complete this look
alright so now let's talk about this
hair this hair is actually from Vargo
hair and I am in love with this freakin
texture this is their loose wave hair I
will list the links in the description
box because you guys know I never
remember that but girl like this hair is
so easy to maintain super manageable
like if you're a low maintenance type of
girl you just want something to wake up
and go all you have to do is put these
put this hair in like two braids just
like I did and this is how it looks when
you walk out the house it's like
fabulous this is their loose wave
texture so really really nice hair I
have no complaints about it and the
frontal is popping as well I will show
