makeup look so I hope you're excited so
let's start with this transition shade
I'm using foxy from The Naked 2 palette
and oatmeal tan from Coastal Scents and
I'm just making sure I make that as
vibrant as possible but before I use
these shadows I had my milk jumbo pencil
from NYX on my lids just to enhance
these shades on me and I'm just going
back and forth back and forth but with a
fluffy blending brush just to blow out
these two shades as much as I can if you
guys hear background noise it's the
people outside blowing grass okay so now
I have Oktoberfest in the crease and
that's from Coastal Scents also and then
I'm going to be just going in very far
in my crease with this shade just so you
can see the color pretty good and then
I'm blowing it out as much as I possibly
can and then I'm taking deep roast from
Coastal Scents and eyebrows is like a
nice brown shade so I'm applying that on
top of Octoberfest to get that gradient
look and yeah then I'm gonna be taking
chopper from the Naked 2 palette and I'm
going to be placing that right on my lid
after this there it goes and you can
enhance this shade with some fix+
or some water just so it can be a little
bit more vibrant on you I love this
color so pretty look at my face like
what am i doing like why do you gotta
make that face when you put makeup voice
just know I am human like all of you and
now I'm gonna take Oktoberfest to blow
out that nice harsh line that that made
and I'm gonna take all day luminous
foundation from NARS and apply that on
my face I am in the shade Macau super
super amazing foundation I love it you
can use a Real Techniques sponge you
don't have to get the $20 Beauty Blender
it works the same and it's really soft
then I'm cutting my eye shadow with my
foundation so it can be really nice and
flawless
then I'm gonna be taking my
the concealer from la girl la girl Pro
concealer in toffee placing it on my lid
I mean my lord
you know you sear a place of that okay
all right so now I already beat my face
pretty much and I'm gonna be using Kat
Von D's liquid matte lipstick in Vampira
if you were wondering what I use to
contour it is the blunt blush from Mac
and my highlight is from the fat globe
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills and
I'm taking my mineralized skinfinish
powder from Mac and dark deep to go over
and set my face now I have to 206 lashes
on and I'm gonna switch those lashes but
I'm just taking deep breaths and
Octoberfest
and blowing this eye look out a little
bit more since I put the lashes on and
now these are the lashes that I was
telling you about I do not know the name
of these because they're so freakin
pretty I picked them up from Ulta they
are from ardell but I do not know the
number now I'm gonna be using the eye
studio gel liner and blackest black to
create this nice wing and if you guys
want to know what brush I'm using it is
from the craft store yeah I got it from
the craft stores Michaels actually you
need to go and pick it up I don't know
what number it is
but I'll probably list it in the
description box if they have a number on
the brush but I got it from Michaels and
that's all you probably wouldn't need to
know it's silver and it's like go here I
think so now I'm going in with almost
Han just to block any harsh lines and
Old Mill tannins from Coastal Scents
also I'm done so I hope you guys enjoyed
this look thank you so much for watching
