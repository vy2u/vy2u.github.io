sometimes you know concealer creases on
you so if you can get the same effect
with foundation wish me luck with this
because I'm not
and my right element to be doing that
browse because somebody is dressing oh
this brow pencil I'm using is NYX brow
pencil in the shade dark brown
so just apply my math powder on my face
now and I'm going to carve out my face
so I can get that look that I like
I'm going to take this color called
olive wood from Coastal Scents and put
it in here in my crease we're going to
pop that right in the crease and blow it
out as much as we can
focusing on my eye shape lately that's
why I haven't been doing so much makeup
videos because I really wanted to
practice my eye look so much more with
really good shadows and just with
brushes that I was giving and trying new
techniques and shine to learn my shape
of my eye and just working on my craft
because I like doing makeup more than I
like doing hair honestly and this is why
I really started my youtube channel
because I knew how much I loved makeup
so now you can go back and open the chin
and then run that along to harsh lines
that might be there and then I'm going
to go in and start packing in this other
beautiful color called golden avocado
braids my brush and I'm going to pack
that color right on top of that it's
like a gold but it had green reflex in
it and it's so perfect like the perfect
name golden avocado and I love me some
avocados so I had to pick this eyeshadow
so why wouldn't you guys tell me I had
something on my shirt it's not there
anymore because I had to wipe it off
before I went to stock then how would
you guys tell me about my mirror I'm
trying to be cute and classic with my
new backdrop always whatever you know
all white okay I went to the store I got
my Maybelline eye studio like ass black
gel liner do a winged liner you got let
me tell you I haven't done liner in a
minute
oh you're gonna see how I put on my
lashes take my little short flare lashes
that I get I'm going to view supplies
board nothing fancy go in there like
that with it this much yo there's
somebody there's a guy in my complex
that won't leave me alone
he always knocks on my door asked me for
roll ups asking me for this asking me
for that I might ask him to leave me the
 alone the next time comes and
knocks on my door because I'm going I
can't deal I can't
I'm sorry and now what I'm gonna do is
so you can see but I'm so blind y'all
telling y'all can y'all see me put it
right under I try to put it like
Brightman be like either the middle of
my mom put my pupil or on the outside of
my people and then I focused the other
one like towards out here and then
that's it nothing extravagant I don't
know if it's really that hard for people
to do this but this is like the easiest
thing ever for me
is look there you go
don't move don't move you can't stand it
but make sure you fan in something
that's not gonna hit it well girl are
you late you in there it ain't nothing
he took our cleavage we still have our
Dells short players if you um you like
and practice or you a nice beat based
practice arts all over if I felt enough
to need you me some hard l and he said
blue not don't do that that was $10
is that bad no because this is a lot in
here in a class for a very long time as
long as you keep the top to it that's
one thing I a person that knows how to
put top spackle and stuff so I'm working
on it these are another pair of our no
lashes that I do love all my life
yeah on the morrow these are the our del
double up 206 lashes so this is very
like you know anyway okay somewhat blush
because I mean yeah don't blush to use
the contour hoppers the people we need
to videos I swear it never something as
long as you like it isn't like a whole
day
I'm going to line my lips Oh Leonard
