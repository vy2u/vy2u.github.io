with another video and today I'm gonna
be showing you guys how I created this
look I'm not sure what I want to call it
but we're gonna jump right into this
video so as you see I'm applying some
lipstick this is Kat Von D's Vampira
lipstick it's their everlasting lip
stain lipstick that she has I'm in love
with this lipstick it's twenty dollars
pretty pricey but it's definitely worth
it because you can't find another color
out there now you see me apply my
moisturizer and my primer I'm gonna be
taking some concealer from a line called
Milani I got this from Walmart it was
about ten or twelve dollars I believe
it's in the shade earth deep and I'm in
love with this super creamy and yeah I'm
gonna be putting that the hollows of my
cheek to deepen up my contour and give
me a more chiseled looking face I like
warming up the products now I haven't
been doing that but let me tell you I do
it with my concealers my foundation and
it just gives me second skin appearance
and I'm really really diggin it I don't
even know how I was able to do some
makeup looks without warming up products
but it definitely gives me a flawless
face and I'm in love with how it has my
makeup turning out lately so the
foundation that I'm using a Studio Fix
fluid from Mac I'm in love with this
foundation now even more because I've
been applying it with a little born and
my fingers first instead of stumping my
brush into the product and then rubbing
it onto my face
I find that me using my fingers and then
using a brush to buff it out is giving
me more of a flawless finish and I also
believe is from this new primer that
I've been using I have to give you guys
the name I'm not sure what it's called
but it will be in the description box
but I'm loving how flawless my skin is
looking
Studio Fix fluid foundation we all know
how kinky it can look on us now I'm
going in with my Mac Studio Fix fluid
and my Mac Pro Longwear concealer NC 42
I believe the shades will be listed in
the description box because I'm not
exactly sure if those are the shades but
I'm going to be placing that underneath
my contour underneath my eyes and also
on my lids just to brighten me up a bit
I'll be taking Ben Nye banana powder and
setting my highlight with that and I'm
going to brush that off immediately
usually I'll let it sit forever but I'm
starting not to like how that looks on
my skin when I let it sit for a long
time so I stopped doing that I take it
off immediately right after so I won't
kind of get that chalky appearance
setting my contour with some bronzer
love the bronzer I'm gonna be taking
that same pen still there that I use to
contour and taking it down the sides of
my nose and then you're gonna be seeing
me take some of that highlight that I
had underneath my eyes I'm gonna be
taking that down the center of my nose
as a highlight just a little bit not too
much nothing too crazy
I'm going to be priming my eyelids ready
to do this I look for you ladies I'm
gonna be taking red bricks for Mac
placing it above my crease blowing it
out as much as possible and then I'm
gonna be taking raisin max blush raisin
and I'm gonna be putting that in my
crease and on my lid I'm gonna be using
some color from the Naked 2 palette i'm
not sure but i used my charge water to
enhance the color and also you saw that
I pop my lid before so that enhances
colors that enhances the color as well
the primer that I used for soft ochre
from Max and I'm gonna be doing the same
thing on this eye yes
back in anomalies turn it off I love
this coven it's so pretty now I'm going
to be doing some tight lining
I love this gel liner from L'Oreal I'm
gonna be using those same colors and
placing it underneath my eye just give
me a smoky little effect I'm gonna be
taking a gold deposit from Mac they
think that as a highlight as a shimmer
highlight with me
and I am complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
