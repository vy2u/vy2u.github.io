it is man I'm going to share with you
guys how to straighten monkeys 30-inch
slice will miss I did a previous video
for this Aliexpress vendor and I'm just
showing you guys how to do a makeup look
and also a little bit more back
information about the hair in that video
so if you guys are going to check that
out I will list it in the description
box below so you can go ahead and click
on that if you're interested and today
like I said I'm just want to be
stringing the hair but let me give you
some back information on any hair if you
guys would like to purchase it in the
near future
this is monkeys Brazilian straits this
is 30 inches I received four bundles
book was only able to fit three bundles
on this unit I can honestly stuff the
fourth one in a problem I probably will
be doing that really soon but I like how
flowy and natural and kind of like
effortless this looks when it's in this
natural state so when I go to straighten
it it may look a little thinner but I'm
going to I'm going to force the fourth
bundle in there soon so don't worry
about it it looks been during this
process I don't plan on putting any
serum in this here I just want to see
how well it straightens by itself yes I
did trim the hair just a little bit no I
haven't been seeing any shedding and
fall out any tingling anything or
anything like that but we're just going
to see how well this hair strands
hopefully I will receive the flyways
again if I do that will be a major
problem honestly for me just because I
won't be able to rock it as much as I
would like to but it's when it's in a
wavy state like this I really do love it
if you guys see that it's wavy if we
have actually cold wall shampoo and
condition this hair because of the
flyaways and I've just been wearing the
hair like this and I'm really really
pleased with it I'll stand up so you can
see how long it is yes I am 5/3 so this
pretty much past month but and the hair
looks really really nice in this state
so I really do like it
I had it braided earlier so it may
look a little way here at the last tire
but yeah so that's what I'm going to be
doing today for you ladies if you guys
want to see this makeup look just let me
know in the comment section below and
yes let's get it started I'm going to
use my honey here to a 1 slash hurting
iron flat iron flash curling guide today
for this look and I don't want to put
any serums in it like I said so let's
just see how well this hair strands
without serum now when I receive this
hair it was super long straight and I
didn't see any flyaways in the bundle
finish and when it was just in the
bundles but when I started making the
unit I just started seeing so many
flyways but like I said I co wash it I
didn't see a lot but today I feel like
I've seen a few of them eye popping in
and out and it's not as bad as it was
when it was straightened so I'm not
really worried so hopefully today when I
go in and strain it it's not going to
give me a problem I usually want to blow
on the hair out but after like the hair
is combed out enough that I don't have
to go in and use a blow dryer so that's
what I usually do when it's time to
straighten hair and yet so you know you
can always use some heat protecting
spray on the hair if you guys want to
but I currently don't have any seed
protecting spray with me I'm actually
not at my place so all of my hair parts
unable to bring with me on my trip so
yeah so so far the like is straightening
really well let me know if you guys work
with this company before and how your
hair held up if you ordered any hair fro
monkey hair you can always check out
their Aliexpress review section to see
all the girls pretty much all around the
world that have been rockin monkey hair
and how they felt about the hair but
they have a ton of positive reviews on
their website that's why I really wasn't
a skeptical about this hair
opening so I really did want to give
them a chance and I wanted to review
their hair for you guys
if you were interested in purchasing
this hair so I'm looking over theirs
because my mirror is right there
and I know you doesn't right here I know
I see you will I think will tear I don't
know how to love this lipstick oh this
is a lipstick from Mac called
green machine I think still feeling like
it's getting satin guys so I honestly
went in today and put some salt in the
little braids that I have put into this
hair I will might have like four
different flats in the hair and I just
use the phone to just control the little
flyaways that I did see and it actually
works so it really wasn't trippin about
it but I just don't like flyways with
long hair or super straight hair just
because I just don't want to be looking
crazy in my hair just sticking up
everywhere but as you can see is flat
ironing really really good and once
again like I told you when I first
received the hair was a really really
soft and it was really long it was
really talking was really long and very
straight so I didn't feel like I was
going to have a problem straining it
because it was already in this state if
you guys have any tired that you really
love and you think that I should
purchase let me know I have my eye on a
couple of them in Ulta but I really want
to hear you guys and sponsors up oh by
the way I do want to mention these
fronts are really quick so what's the
frontal I had to go in and breach the
nuts just to make it look a little bit
more natural so I'm the parting pins
look like it's an actual like scalp kind
of feel I do have a video on how to
bleach your nuts and I'm just winging
this that footage the editing process so
that will be up soon so don't worry I
know you guys are probably like well how
do you do it but I did record it for you
guys and it actually turned out really
good so I'm very excited for you guys to
see that video they go in and tweeze the
frontal because it wasn't a very natural
looking but not all photos are coming
pre flux and stuff like that so you
definitely have to recommend that or
watch out for that when you're looking
for frontal I definitely would say go
with the pre plucked frontal or please
pre plug the wigs because you don't have
to go in and do so much of the plucking
yourself and it saves you a lot of time
helps again co-washing situation is
definitely the key to making your hair
look sleek full because I feel like
Aliexpress vendors they just send you
the hair however no they store it to
make it look really pretty when you
receive it but you're not getting the
real natural texture if you don't call
wash it trust and belief so like
sometimes it comes in coils and stuff
like that that's not bad but that's just
not the natural hair patent so when you
wash it don't be alarmed nobody like
your waist though because it didn't fall
it's just how they styled it to keep the
hair and looking healthy and um
appealing to the eye like 1b websites
and stuff like that and they want you to
know what type of texture it is but if
you co wash it the wave is not going to
be super like indented that is
impossible for someone here to really
really look like that like it's not
impossible but how perfect their hair
being usually that's like a style that
somebody gets to have there
I'm going to piss our clip so you guys
know what I'm talking about this is our
life happy with the you were
using I really don't notice like how
some people don't have any knowledge
behind my grease and I expect you guys
to have some so I don't really give me
that the inside scoop is or I'll be
talking to you guys about the inside
scoop and you probably don't even know
what I'm talking about but trust me I
will always recommend you guys go wash
any hair that you receive from
Aliexpress you know so you can see if
you like the pattern because I just
don't like when people receive hair and
then they think it's bad hair but in
reality they just have it took the time
out to do the extra steps to make their
hair look good so a lot of you guys be
like your hair always looks good like it
doesn't look that good like what shampoo
are you using what conditioner are you
using are you leaving the conditioner in
there for some time so it can get the
nutrients back into the hair test put
moisture back into the hair are you
turning the end so it looks natural are
you storing your hair properly like
those are the things that you need to
definitely pay attention to when you
have weave in your hair because as long
as you take care of your hair your
weaves just like it was your hair my
hair is worth less for you well I'm not
saying I've expressed hair is going to
last you forever maybe four or five
years but it can definitely last you up
to maybe a year and it's just depending
on how you take care of the hair because
I have some hair from Aliexpress that I
still rock still keyboard and I also
have some wigs from other vendors that
have a hat for a very long time and
still holding them release great
so yes Smail videos want some opinions
about how to take care of your weaves or
maintain a we or how to style cut trim
that kind of video for your weaves let
me know in the comment section
because I can just click some of my
favorite products and I like using you
know to wash mommies there's a few of
them because I had a few shampoo and
conditioners that I use for my actual
hair so they're not always going to be
the same one
and for my weaves I don't like using my
expensive stuff but sometimes I have to
if it's looking like it needs some
severe help you know but hope length
conditioner from Garnier is so popular
virgin hair trust me
thank me later I love that for my hair
but it's not so great free for my hair
but you don't really need the sulfate
free nuts for the Wiis even though you
could do that and like I said sometimes
you may have to depend on how your hair
looks now if you have some wee that
you're trying to revamp definitely go
get the obvi shampoo and conditioner
that is the deep moisture or even
Vietnam get me hope length gardening
honey treasures conditioner and shampoo
and leave that conditional in there for
at least 45 just like an hour and watch
how amazing your hair looks and you can
even try that here on your natural hair
that here that no you can't try that
hair on your neck even trying back
shampoo conditioners be hunting
treasures or your actual hair if you
have natural hair if you have relaxed
hair it definitely makes a huge
difference in your hair and I love it so
freakin much I'll be having places to be
without be going videos so I'll be
trying to get it wrap it in and get out
it's not that much longer but it's a
little bit more passed like hitting my
thighs now and once again
I'm 5 degrees these are the final result
I hope you guys enjoyed it as you can
see the hair and looks amazing no
flyaways
no cops no so for easy to flat iron so
definitely definitely check out their
reviews because I don't know if you guys
have worked with this company
not but this is my first time and I was
having some trouble bed first but as you
can see we got it together got it
together now I'll be conditioner and
shampoo that I use will be listed in the
description box below or you can check
out the previous video now that you guys
know a little bit more information about
the hair and what I was going through in
the first round when I first created
this unit for myself yes this is a wig
that I made for myself you guys know
that I can't be someone down to my
head because I'm reviewed too much hair
so yeah so this is basically what it's
going on right now and I will update you
guys in the near future about how the
tears holding up in the description box
below but so far so good as you can see

again this is there for fun drill 30
inches plus a 20 inch frontal I think
I'm going to go ahead and stuff the
fourth photo in downstairs but yeah I
haven't even mentioned that like yes I
did trip it in so that's why you can
kind of see that it's kind of like
straight and even in certain spots
density is nice enough to be natural and
it's not too much it's not going to make
you hot during the summer time and I
definitely think everybody in in girl
and every girl in the world should
experience 30 inches or more
at one point of their life and well my
22nd birthday I'm definitely wanting to
do that for myself so yeah so this
pluckers I'm never working with 30
inches of hair I do have some very for
interesting bundles that I will be

getting longer and vulgar and ready to
slay your way honey so thank you so much
