and today I'm going to be sharing with
you ladies this makeup look I'm going to
go through these products that I use
today for you ladies so you guys can
understand and know when i am doing i
used about 5 eye shadows in this look
too from makeup geek and the breasts
work from a morphe palette so ridges
will to start off by showing you guys be
more fatalis because the morphe palette
because this is the transition colors
that I've really started off using first
now you can pretty much use this whole
palette if you don't have the two other
colors that I'm going to show you from
the makeup geek from makeup geek but
anyway so this is the first color that I
used in the morphine matte palette and
this is the 350 matte palette from them
I use this one first and then I went in
with this one which is like a more
chocolate color and then this one is
like a deeper chocolate color and I went
in not with my morphe colors which was
deep roast which looks like this and
this is the one that I packed on my lids
and you can bring it up to the creek how
high do you want it and I use Britta
also as a transition shade or just like
a shade that I was gradually getting
into this deep rose color oh the brow
bone highlight that I use is the naked
urban decay suspect it's what I have to
highlight my brow bone today and the Jay
cats are rocking the night sparkling
powder and this is like in a brown shade
I got this from a local Beauty Supply
stores and what I use to apply my
glitter was the NYX glitter prime
collection which all I did and I'm going
to share the products that I use for my
face I just used my Mac Pro Longwear my
la girl concealer my new HD setting
powder that I got from my local beauty
supply store also and this is the HD and
this is the HD setting forget setting
I indicate earth is really like a cheesy
yellow kind of color so what I did was
just mix it with some of my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and like that
banana shade and I just mix that
together and got the desired setting
powder color that I want it and then I
just went in just packed it in like skin
instead of swiping that's what I like
doing now because I feel like swiping
just makes we look patching and we're
pretty much it I'm going to set my face
now and I'm going to wait for day 2 gal
