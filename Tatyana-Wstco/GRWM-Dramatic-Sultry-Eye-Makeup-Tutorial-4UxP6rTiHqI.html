beginning of that video I use the same
product so I'll be listening those in
the description box below so I'm gonna
talk you through this I color or this
eyeshadow look and this is all Milton
above my crease just to use it as my
transition shade and all these colors
are going to be from Coastal Scents that
I'll be using today so now I'm going to
be taking deep breaths and putting that
in my crease and packing that as much as
I possibly can to enhance this color and
to get that color pick off shorty and
I'm going to be blowing that out and
building it and using Oktoberfest or
whatever is left on that brush to blend
that out and I'll be taking the
Oktoberfest right now and I'm using that
to blend out deep Broce and I'm going
back in with deep rose just to intensify
the shade a little bit more
going a lot of back and forth with this
I look so bear with me I'll be taking
blackberry now from Coastal Scents and
packing that on top of that deep rose
definitely focusing it in the outer V
and bringing that inside of my crease as
much as I possibly can just to get that
color payoff and yeah
and then I'll be using chocolates here
on the outer V a little bit more and
that's a darker shade from Coastal
Scents just to enhance this look a
little bit more add a little bit more
definition and dimension and I'm going
to be doing some of that on the other
I'd too because I really didn't focus
chocolates here on the outer V and yeah
a lot of blending a lot of back and
forth in this video like I said so bear
with the kid I am sick so if you guys

more I know you are cuz I see it in the
comments I know I know so I'll be taking
blackberry again just to enhance that
shade above I mean just enhance the
shade a little bit more since I've been
applying chocolates here which is like a
deeper chocolate color or a deeper brown
shade and yeah I still need that
blackberry to show up girl
and I'm just blending all harsh lines
that I've created out as much as I
possibly can and now I'm taking cherry
Moss from Coastal Scents and this is a
beautiful freaking shade I love this we
has all the pony shades and it's like
green bread and see some cool colors in
the shadow and yeah so that's why I'll
be using on my lid you can use fix+ of
water to enhance this metallic shade
and I'm using blunt blush from Mac just
to contour my face and I'll be going
back in with my eye look I'm not
finished I'm just trying to get
everything done and then I'm taking
blunt back onto my nose and yeah carving
out that nose honey and then I'll be
taking the a BH that glow kit in bubbly
to highlight my brow bone my nose and
inside of my eyes and now I will be
doing what doing some more blending I
guess and I've already applied my gel
liner as you can see and I'm taking my
Mac deep mineralized skinfinish powder
and now I'm taking some airspun powder
just to carve out my nose a little bit
more
and I'm applying those shadows at the
bottom of my eye and I'm applying chief
from colour-pop and self-aware and it
was a lot going on I like this look with
this I mean this lip with that but then

bit more chill and not so much but you
