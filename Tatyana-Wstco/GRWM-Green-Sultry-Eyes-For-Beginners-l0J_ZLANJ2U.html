video it's really late okay
it is 2 o clock in the morning but I
told myself that I was gonna do a makeup
look so I didn't care what time I was
gonna do it I just know that I was gonna
do one so as you can see one of my eyes
are green I went on Instagram like to
ask you guys what color should I do on
my lids and some of you were saying
glitter some of you saying were some of
you were saying litter blue green and
all that good stuff so I went with the
green because I was trying to do a green
look for a very long time I don't know
if I'm gonna keep this I I kind of
wanted it more around it and it turned
out not to be rounded because I used a
makeup wipe to clean it up and we'll
probably use different brushes since I
kind of know what direction I'm trying
to take myself in so I'm gonna use my
Jaclyn hill palette and I'm going to
take I'm gonna take I'm gonna take this
shade right here this is like my
favorite shade in this palette that's
literally why pick up this palette to be
honest with you guys and I'm gonna use a
small mirror and I'm going to look up no
I'm gonna pretty much explain to you
guys how I started getting good at doing
my makeup because I know you remember
when I looked crazy on here I'm trying
to do really like creative eye looks
which really wasn't that creative I
started like trying to look at my shape
of my eye from a different angle so I
could understand the placement and also
I start purchasing more brushes brushes
matter definitely if you're Lawrence who
get you a brush set it needs to have a
flat brush a shadow brush a blending
brush and you need to get like different
size blending brushes and different yeah
different sides blending the different
size blending brushes and why I say that
is because
you know the smaller the brush the more
detail you can get the bigger the the
bigger the brush the more faster you can
do an application so sometimes it's just
really simple for you to just go in and
do a regular science blending brush
sizes such as this one which is the more
few fourfold one and the reason why I
like doing this is because well using
this one or like my transition area is
because it's really easy just sweep on
the color in the transition area and
it's not you know giving you any harsh
lines when you are applying it so a
fluffy blending brush is really good and
a smaller blending brush is great as
well a more dense one it's also great it
just depends on what look you're trying
to go for now if you're not like I'm
you're not trying to do anything fancy
like you can just get you some regular
brushes from Walgreens the wet wild
brushes are great you can start
purchasing brushes for morphe or
anything like that I just wouldn't go
and purchase Mac brushes because I feel
like there's so many dupes out there and
to be spending like twenty to forty
dollars on one specific brush like
that's crazy
you can get about like ten brushes out
of that or morphe or you can even get
forty brushes and Walgreens for that
price yeah so like I said when I look up
I start to see who where I need a place
my eyes when I look ahead I'll just be
like I feel like I have no space to work
with I don't have any lid space but in
reality I do I just have hidden like lid
space so you get over saying because if
I look straight on it just doesn't work
like that for me because I have a
different type of eye shape if that
makes sense
you have to just find out what works for
you when you are trying to do I looks
you have to learn that packing and
sweeping our two different things if you
pack you'll get more intensity with your
shadows if you that's with packing and
pressing if you just sweep you're going
to get the color but it's not gonna be
as intense so those are the things that
I started learning last year when I
started you know
my eyeshadows a little bit more serious
because it was looks like if I'm going
to be on YouTube and if I love doing
makeup like why am I not learning how to
do certain things versus just like
brushing it off and being simple about
the situation I'm gonna also take that
was the morphe Jaqueline morphe palette
and i took that you know mustard color
i'm going to take this green from the
Smashbox bold eye palette and i'm going
to give me like a halo eye so when i did
this i went straight in with this solid
color right here and it's not this color
that i'm using i it's actually another
color from that Jaclyn hill about it and
I don't know why I did that but I just
did it because I knew that I was only
gonna do one eye on camera but still I
should have realized what I was doing
and yeah but so what I'm just doing
right now is taking a smaller blending
brush like ice the smaller the blending
brush the more detail you can get in a
look this is the morphe 5 or 4 if you
guys want me to do a detailed like video
or my favorite brushes please let me
know in the comment section below
because there's not one brush that I do
not use I'm not buying brushes just so
they can sit around and look pretty
I don't get sick of brushes so it's
nothing to like you know try to force
you to buy it's just letting you guys
know what brushes work for me and what
brushes I feel like are a must-have if
you are doing your makeup
so let me know if you want that video so
as you can see I'm just placing and I'm
coming like pressing and placing at the
same time so now what I'm gonna do is
start doing circular motion so I can get
the blown out effect I want this color
to show really high I wish it was
honestly a lime green but it's not what
I can do is mix the yellow and the
greens together to get what I'm looking
for so I might go ahead and do that as
you can see it looks a little bit more
lime green now and that's the neat thing
about makeup you can really just do
whatever you want to do to create what
you want to create
so as you can see I'm still like looking
down but the mirror is face like this so
I can see where I need to place the
shadow so it can be like rounded like
I'm you know how I wanted this one to be
and I'm gonna take this shade which is
in the Jaclyn hill palette it's right
here and it's called Jada yeah it's kind
of weird how they put these on because
in reality they're not set up like this
like this shade is Jada but right here
it says soda pop and this is not soda
pop soda pop is right here but I guess
she kind of had to do it that way I
don't know but I feel like you can't go
wrong with purchasing that pallet
there's other ones on morphe that don't
have the large variety of cool crazy
shades so it's almost like you have to
get multiple palettes from morphe if you
are trying to get that vibe the target
shape tape concealer and I'm going to
just place that in the center where
there's like a little open space so I
can apply the lash shade in the center
and what this does adding the concealer
is just going to make sure that color
pops as much as I need it to and won't
bleed into any of the other colors
causing another like shade that I don't
want I'm gonna pick up the color by
pressing not doing too much slider so
it's not powdery tap off any access and
then just press here now what I was
thinking about doing was going darker
and because this is a lighter shade
I can go lighter I mean I could still go
darker but if I wanted to go darker and
I didn't like how it looked then I would
have been
so
just going to make sure everything is
blended so I'm pretty much want to try
to make that color that we put in the
center go into the other other like lime
green chain that I was trying to create
and this is just so there's no harsh
lines and once the harsh lines are gone
we can go back and with packing that
turquoise color from the Jaclyn hill how
they back in the center just for the
extra color intensity that we want
our baby's moving on to my skin so I'm
gonna start off with Milani
primer this is their prime light primer
since it was so late I didn't want to
use anything expensive so this is more
only an expensive side I'm going to let
you guys enjoy the music just because I
feel like you guys know exactly how I do
the base of my face because I'm a little
bit more detailed for the base of my
face before I am with my eyes so I feel
like I just needed to explain to you
guys how I created this eye look I will
just follow the products that I use in
this video in the description box below
but I'm just gonna run over the products
that I use really quickly for my face so
like I said I use the prime light primer
from Milani you can get it at Walmart
I'm gonna take my Tarte shape tape
concealer in the shade medium no I'm
sorry tan sand and I'm gonna use that to
conceal and highlight so I like using a
lighter concealer because I like to
conceal and highlight now if you want to
just conceal you want to use a more a
concealer more close to your skin tone
but I use a super bright concealer
because once again I'm using it to
conceal and highlight I'm gonna go in
with my a BH foundation stick and this
is in the shade walnut yeah in the shade
walnut to contour I'm gonna blend all of
that together and then I'm gonna go in
with my Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation in the shade golden my number
is 24 so I will list the products in the
description box below of course I'm
gonna set my under eyes with my Laura
Mercier powder I'm going to contour
powder contour with my NYX tan map and
not flat I'm gonna set my face with my
Sephora micro smooth powder and I'm also
going to take this true matte powder in
the shade in 8 just to make sure none of
the highlighted points of my face is too
extreme for me and then I'm going to
take a little bit of blush I figure I
forgot what blush I use I believe is an
eye shadow to be honest with you guys
from the magic palette by Java and I
used my 6:14 salon graphic lashes I also
took a Milani lip I don't know the name
I will list it in the description box
below I also use Chi from colour-pop in
the set
and I topped it off with a gloss the
hair portion of this video will be in
another video so if you guys are
interested I will link that video in the
description box as well so you so you
guys can see that part of the video too
but I just wasn't able to fit all of
this in one video just because I felt
like it would've been way too long but I
love you guys so friggin much thank you
so much for watching I hope you guys
took something from the video I will see
you guys in my next one
5
alongside
you
before you
alongside
I definitely was a Alda following the
directions
they actually have some balls load
remover if you want to go manage that
when you go to purchases just because in
tacky so you just want to make sure if
you do accidentally get it when you're
here please do not wrap your hair you
will have a really bad experience with a
ball hole glue just because I can tell
how like this is on my head this is not
going anywhere
um and yeah so I'll see you guys on my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
