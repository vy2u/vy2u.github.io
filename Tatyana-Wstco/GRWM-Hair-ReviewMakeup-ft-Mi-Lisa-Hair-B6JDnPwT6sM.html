hey guys us I know I love crazy let's
begin this side look I'm going to start
off with priming my lid with the Mac
soft ochre Paint Pot and I'm going to
use my e27 brush from morphe to begin
this priming situation and a little bit
goes a long way like you guys know all
the products that I will be using today
will be in the description box if you
missed anything priming just makes your
eyeshadows pop a lot more and they want
a lot longer
picking classics from the tarte pro
palette and i'm using that to set that
soft ochre Paint Pot I'm going to take
this yellow in the Smashbox bold italic
and it's in the shade sell out and I'm
going to take a this blending brush pop
that in my crease and above the crease
to start this gradient effect going so
I'm pretty much pushing this shadow into
my skin and not blending it out yet
pressing it just intensifies
the pigment on the shadow I picked this
fools Gaucher from Coastal Scents and
put this on another blending brush and
I'm going to blow that other shadow out
using this show
ok now I'm going to go back in with sell
out from the Smashbox palette just to
make this a little bit more vibrant I
want to pick up some sell out with this
brush as well and blend that into the
holes go bloom that into the pools go
because I don't have my milk jumbo
pencil on me I'm going to just take this
paint pot this is going to just
intensify the other yellows I'm going to
pop a lovely lemon drop shadow from
makeup geek and I'm just going to take
my finger and press it right home I'm
packing motions will be the best for
this because this is kind of like a
shimmery shadow and I'm going to go in
with that dense blending brush see in
y-axes vivid bright liner you can get
this from Ulta and I'm going to use this
to create this line
these are 113 lashes from ardell only $3
a pound of top and us but it was like a
black-owned beauty supply store and I'm
very proud of them and I bought tons of
them so I'm super excited about them
because they're really pretty and
economy money of the other ones that I
was wearing but the other ones that I've
been wearing they just haven't been
giving me the vibe that this one has
been giving me so I might just go and
just clean them out and take all of them
because they would really do it with
this look too so I'm going to take some
more of that women drop I shadow from
makeup geek and I'm going to drag this
underneath my waterline fell out from
the Smashbox palette and press that
underneath there as well
ready baby loves even though my liner
and distant cousins is cool you got get
what I did what I was trying to do turns
out a lot better when I'm not on camera
but you know you got a deluge about a
little girl so I'm going to finish my
space really quick and this is the black
radiance cafe blush and I'm using to
warm up my face a little bit more taking
it down here
this brush so basically what I did we
just put some concealer on the center of
my lid I use my mouth caramel concealer
put cheese on top of that and then lined
it with this brown lip liner and this
clean color lipstick is 1627 and I will
list all the products that I use in this
video in the description box below
I also lined my waterline with this nude
pencil and that is pretty much it
so I'm going to start when my hair is
actually from me Lisa hair I pretty much
already stabbed the Front's how I win it
today to Brazil you lose way for
Brazilian body weight I believe it's
loose waves so I will list all the
information in the description box below
I believe this hair to a brown shade so
it looks old the top is black the well
the top is brown dark brown natural
Brown it's a bottom you could say it's
like a number 4 holding up pretty good I
do have a frontal it's on this hair
company really soft and it took the
color really well and I'm just going to
alternate the curls so some curls are
going to be towards my face some curls
are going to be away from my face I want
my first girl to be towards my face and
then it's just going to be you vice
versa
Karnas we're finished so we're going to
sit for maybe 30 minutes 15 slicing I
run my fingers through my hair can that
see me this is how the hair looks so far
result I'm in love with the hair I feel
like I got even softer after curly and
maybe that's the help of the chi drops
so these are just so confusing drops so
I just apply that before applying the
heat on my hair you go I'm parting my
hair in three different sections and put
rubber bands around the end just so I
can say I kind of did like a twisty
color method going on so that's one for
one at the top great quality hair
honestly like I would definitely break
this hair a eight out of the ten because
it took the color really great
the ends are still tamed the limp is
still there it's not a lot of shedding
no foul smell it holds a really nice
curl if I use a smaller barrel it will
be extremely tighter than this I curl
this here previously and when it wasn't
Brown so I know that I hold the really
nice curl one is in its natural color
and that's of fate so don't worry about
that the pattern is really pretty in its
natural state it does still have a
pattern after bleaching so I was really
excited about that as well
well I think I tried a another texture
from this hair company if I did I will
list it in the description box below
