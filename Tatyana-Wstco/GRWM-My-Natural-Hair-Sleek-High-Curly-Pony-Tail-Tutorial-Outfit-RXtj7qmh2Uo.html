gonna give ready together so hopefully
you're watching me while you're getting
ready because this process of right here
all the information that I will be using
in this video will be listed in the
description box below but we're going
for a sleek ponytail right now so let's
get into this hair look so this actually
is or freshly washed hair I have some
leave-in conditioner in my hair and I
just used a wig brush just to brush it
up because we're going for a high
ponytail this day and I'm gonna take
some eco styler gel olive oil Tim exhale
just to make sure everything is sleek
and chic like I want it to because that
is so important you don't want any
flyaways you don't want your hair to be
popping out you don't want it to be
looking all bumpy and lumpy this product
is amazing for that and of course you
need a perfect hard brush and a soft
brush just to get the look really smooth
and secure like you need it to be I got
all of these products from the vu supply
store you can get it up to your local
beauty supply store I don't believe they
sell the Eco styling gel anywhere else
maybe Target I don't know probably
Walmart but I never bought it from there
next thing we're gonna do is take some
elastic bands just to get this ponytail
pop in and secure I like using two I
don't do that one daddy loose booty
ponytail look I like using two to make
my hair really secure so that's really
important and the remaining on the hair
that is going to be left out in this
ponytail we are going to braid it so we
can put it in a tiny bun so we can wrap
a bundle weft around my hair so I can
get that form luscious look until my
actually hair until my actual hair it
gives that long okay because it will it
will trust me as long as I stop cutting
my hair and stop doing dumb to my
hair and we'll get that long so just
just be prepared
you
II
okay so now I'm gonna just take a little
bit more of that Eco styling job that
sleek look again
now I'm gonna take a really tiny rubber
band to secure this really tiny button
that we're trying to make because you
don't want your hair to be really
peeking through in this look because
it's gonna look really ratchet and tacky
so yeah just make a really small bun if
you can my hair is getting longer so I'm
gonna eventually have to do a new way by
just putting the weft in the top of my
button and then using a bobby pin to
secure it and then wrap it around my bun
and then wrap it around the bottom of my
bun if that makes sense but anyway I'm
just going to take a really tiny piece
of that whip and then use that little
hair that is on that web just to wrap
that around the web just to secure it if
that makes sense and then I'm gonna
start wrapping the remaining of the weft
around the entire bun to make it look
like it's actually my hair so a lot of
you guys like asking me how I get this
look and now you know how I got it no
you know you know so take your time make
sure it's really secure make sure it's
as make sure it's as tight as you want
it to be don't do it super tight just
because you will want to snatch this
walk with your head throughout them day
so this piece that you see right here
I'm going to just kind of detangle it
with my fingers and try to get as
straight as I possibly can get it you
can't use a brush a comb and you can do
it as thick as you want it to as thick
as you want it to be or you can do it
like really like tiny if that makes
sense this is just to make sure it looks
like it's really your hair and it
doesn't look you know tackier crazy and
it's also going to make sure that no
weft is showing because you don't want
any Wes to be showing and you know you
did this process right if there's no web
showing at all and this process right
here is not necessary so I'm just gonna
make it a little thicker just because I
was going for that kind of look today I
don't usually do this but I wanted to do
it today and I could have detangled the
hair but I didn't I want it to be really
big poofy and curly so yeah I'm just
going to keep the hair like this now I'm
gonna use some argan oil wrap lotion
just to keep that little piece right
there in place and I don't like using
bobby pins just because I don't like the
bobby pins to be sticking in my head
throughout the day but you can't use
bobby pins if you want to but not me
girl not me
so now it's time for makeup now we're
gonna go in with la girl Pro concealer
please use fun I accidentally picked up
medium beige right now and I really
looked at myself after blending this out
and I was like what the hell happened
anyway I'm gonna go in with well if you
are my skin complexion use fawn but next
I'm gonna go in with my Bobbi Brown
expresso foundation stick just to
contour my face and this is just to give
me some dimension definition and also
color back into my face as well
using a Beauty Blender damp is really
important that's just how you get that
flawless look going on now I'm gonna use
my Mac no I'm gonna use my next total
control foundation in cappuccino just to
give me some color back into my face
because that's you know that's very
important we don't want to be looking
ghostly out here so we're just going to
blend blend blend trick with your damp
Beauty Blender
all right so now that that is all
blended out I'm gonna go in with my
Laura Mercier translucent powder just to
set my under eyes because as you see I
have used a lot of concealer today and
we don't want to melt we don't want to
get oily and this is just going to make
sure that you're looking snatched and
met all day and yeah I love this powder
it's like crack so I put it all over my
face pretty much that sounds so crazy I
love this powder is my crack girl no
it's not my crack
it's just a very it's a good product
okay going with these powders that I
love the most I'm gonna use two of the
next a matte but not flat just to give
me some color back in my face I'm using
the darker one I believe this is deep I
will list the exact shades in the
description box below but this is just a
set that cream contour that we're
working with and we don't want it to
move around so that's why we set it and
it also just gives a little bit more
color back on our face now this powder
right now I'm using the micro Sol for a
powder and this is just to give color
back in my face as well and I'm just
using the lighter shade just to set the
foundation to set my face in the
contours just so if I go in with a
really dark color it's not gonna look
muddy on me if that makes sense so yeah
so I'm just gonna go in with the second
shade that I like using for must stay
matte but not flat powder and I believe
this is like in toffee I don't I don't
know so I'm not gonna go lie and tell
you that it will be listed below
go in with the darker shade again just
to get the chiseled area going on back
there and I'm gonna use the next bronzer
to bronze my face up a little bit okay
and that's not really necessary but you
know I'm just being extra at this point
I really really didn't like my eye look
I should have just stuck with this color
right here but I didn't I wanted to go
and grab that top shade that orange you
see right there and I was like why did I
do that I should have just stuck with
the first shade and then did like a
brown on the outer crease but I didn't
but it's cool I'm gonna use lashes and
it's kind of gonna like not really be a
big deal I'm going to use this NYX brow
pencil just to fill in my brows and use
some of my la girl Pro concealer to
carve out my brows as well
okay so now that that is out the way I
actually popped on some lashes already
this was actually a Sephora brand I
forgot the name I will try to find it
and link it below below and of course
I'm going to apply some highlighter it's
but now I'm going to set my face with
the mac fix+ and I am going to be
ratchet for a minute now it's time for
the outfit I'm gonna go in with this
cute red two-piece from fashion over for
my outfit for today I will link it below
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
very simple easy look and I will see you
guys in my next one bye baby loves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
