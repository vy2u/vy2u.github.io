time Ramos's for you dad but I got you
to the last corner
yeah ever told you that I had better get
you know I got you and I'm happy how I
feel don't open my calls everybody not
physical Don I think about every single
time when I'm with you want to see the
whole show
halli pearls stray hair I heard up
bleaching it maybe like two weeks ago
and it's been holding up really good I
don't see anything too crazy going on
with the hair all the information will
be listed in the description box below
and I will put it on the screen so you
guys will know but I know that this is
straight hair it may look a little wavy
it was because I had my hair in a braid
earlier I actually went out with that
makeup look I had to recreate it to run
out and go somewhere and I thought I
would have been able to finish the video
but I wasn't able to so and I'm not
really even doing my hair yesterday
because I wanted to do it today and it
does hold a curl but I'm not really
trying to curl it right now so I'll try
to curl like one little piece which is
this hole right here but yet so this is
their Brazilian straight hair and I
received it maybe like I'm gonna say
almost two months ago but it comes out
really nice I was wearing it and it's
messing with this natural color but I
wanted to do something different and I
didn't want to do anything too too
drastic
because I plan on doing a crazy color
with my hair soon but I don't know when
yet
and I didn't want to do it anytime soon
I kind of want to wait until my birthday
to do a crazy color so I wanted to do
something really subtle but still some
colors so I went for like a crown and I
liked how it turned out so the hair is
really soft I don't get any shedding the
bleaching process you know because I
didn't lift it to like a 613 I didn't
get any shedding or breaking I do have a
360 frontal from this hair company as
well and so three six feet from clothes
are cool I like it because it goes all
the way around your head if you like
that type of thing but I feel like just
a regular frontal would do the job if
you're not interested in paying that
extra buck for a 360 frontal it just
means you have lace going all the way
all the way around your head and you can
do a lot of parting to your hair if you
do purchase a 360 frontal it construct
it really good but I didn't want to let
you guys know that and I'm looking in my
mirror right here so if you're wondering
what am I looking at right now that is
what I'm looking at this I do so yeah so
if you guys have noticed I'm somewhere
different and I in my new apartment and
I'm so excited because I love this
apartment so much more than my last one
a lot of things were different and made
sure I checked up on certain things that
I didn't do at the last place so I
really like this areas on in and I'll
fall in love the apartment so maybe one
day I went to an apartment or when I am
finished decorating everything and yeah
so I don't know if you can hear an echo
you might be able to but if you hear one
that is why the apartment is not empty
but it's still missing a few signature
pieces if you know what I'm saying
you know I don't know what I want to do
like a like this or middle where you
guys think probably flip over and then
when I'm done I can put it in the middle
would you like this I thought I was
going to do something but to like a up
do with this hair like halfway up
halfway down but I just want to show you
guys how do you here turns out so you
guys can see how really nice that this
hair is from ally pearl all their
information will be listed in the
description box below my folder yeah 3
1036 we close out their Brazilian
straight play for in and I believe this
is a 20 inch 360 frontal but I hope you
guys enjoyed this makeup look and this
hair quick you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
