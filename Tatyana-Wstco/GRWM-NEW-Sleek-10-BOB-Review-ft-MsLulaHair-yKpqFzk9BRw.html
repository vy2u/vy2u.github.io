video as you can see I have a new style
right now this is hair from Miss Luba
hair it's a 10 inch Bob and I'm super
excited to share with you guys wore this
in a picture oh and I have all black and
red lipstick off inside the picture
right here and I've been wearing this
hair for almost a month or so and we get
health flaws it still looks I really
think this is a super manageable wig if
you guys want something that's really
easy to maintain during the summer time
this is a perfect purchase because it's
really short it's kind of choppy looking
in the back and it looks natural to me I
don't know I don't really like straight
run across cuts when it comes to Bob
I've been back to look like it has you
know some kind of you know edge to it if
you did what I'm trying to say so that's
basically how it looks in the back and
this is how it looks in the front I am
thinking about putting some bangs in his
hair and giving it like a choppy feel so
let me know if you guys think that I
should do that in the comment section
below but once again this is from miss
Lula hair I will leave their information
in the description box below this is a
unit a wig from this company it has four
combs draw straps and it's really
snuggle me I have a small cap side and
brown lace and I also went in and boost
the nut I do have a video on how to do
that so I will leave that video in the
description box below and bleaching the
knob is just making sure that your part
in your wigs are looking more natural
than if it was just it's regular dough
kind of color and sometimes you still
have to go in and tweak it because it's
not the desired color that I was
expecting when I asked for dark brown
lace so I had to go in and tweak it
myself so that's what I did I just went
in and reached the hair but if you do
not want to take the time out and buy
the products that I use some bleach you
can always use some concealer I check
out in w50 concealer from mac it's the
studio finish concealer and it's in this
little pot and this works this tone
works really perfect for women of my
complexion because sometimes the prolong
working so they aren't too liquidy and
it kind of looks like messy if you use
that but you can still use that only
because they have a large variety of
colors in their you know selection so of
course Mac does too so if you want to
just go ahead and try Mac as well but if
you try to stay a little fordable side
just definitely look into the LA girl
Pro conceal
and try to take a really like tiny
concealer brush and go in and just you
know tweak it like that I feel like my
wig is kind of twisted oh yeah but yeah
so that's what you want to do I do not
actually lays it down with any hairspray
is I actually just wore my head just by
the columns in the giass dress and then
staying really snug on me and it does
not move around trust me if my wig it's
moving around I definitely will go and
apply the hairspray method that I like
using with my wigs but I feel like I do
not have to it this way just because
it's sitting really slow on me so yeah
so that's like the back information for
my hair so I want to speed this process
up when it's time to do my makeup but
definitely know that all the products
will be listed in order in the
description box below I promise you this
time don't kill me
miss Lula hair will be listed in the
description box as well thank you so
much for watching very much and I'll see
you guys in my next video bye
the way
what about the way the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
