with another video I was gonna do just a
hair tutorial but I decided to turn my
camera on while I was doing my makeup so
if you're wondering like bitch
what are you doing why do you look crazy
right now is because I kinda already
have my foundation on and kind of
already have my concealer placed on my
face the foundation that I'm using today
is the Mac Pro Longwear foundation in NC
50 I believe and my pro la girl Pro
concealer in medium beige to highlight
and also to conceal and I'm just gonna
use my Real Techniques sponge just to
stipple this into my skin and just to
make everything look flawless and
seamless and I forgot to add in the clip
where I put the NW 50 concealer from mac
on the bridge of my nose and also on the
sides of my cheek and this is just to
give you more of a chiseled appearance
all the products that I do use in this
video will be listed in the description
box below yeah so watch me blinchik
watch me
what I'm gonna do next is set that
contour shade that I used which was NW
50 again from MEC and I'm gonna take the
black radiance contour palette using the
sculpting shade in the light to medium
palette just to set that contour shade
and what I'm gonna do next is set my
under eyes with my Laura Mercier powder
and I'm just going to make sure I said
it really well so there's no creasing
throughout the day even though I didn't
go anywhere this day anywhere at all I
just washed my makeup off right after
yeah so I'm just going to pinch my nose
with this powder step my undereyes set
my chin set my forehead and this is just
to make sure that you know you're not
gonna melt away in this lovely month of
September
I'm gonna grab that sculpt and shave
from the Black Radiance light to medium
palette and add some color back to my
face I just showed my forehead but I
also put it in my cheek area too to set
that contour that I have placed on the
sides of my face
we're gonna use Becca highlighter in
Champagne pop to highlight the bridge of
my nose and just to give me some glow
because we all need to glow if we're
gonna have makeup on who doesn't like to
glow if they have makeup on you know so
get a highlighter in your life you'll
watch it change your life
I'm taking my brow Wiz pencil from NYX
and I'm just going to snatch my brows
I'm gonna make updated browser toriel so
don't worry okay because we got the brow
shape down pack finally okay I will
never go thick brows again ever in my
life so what I'm gonna be doing is
creating this eye look using my lorac
Pro palette and I actually have in my
hand right now so it looks like that if
you're interested is in Sephora I use
pretty much all the brown shades in this
palette I started with the tan shade I
used sable then I used the like a
chocolate brown and then I use the
darker Brown for the outer V area so
it's just to give a gradient effect with
your eye look you know start with dark
lighter shades then go with darker
shades and then that's how you get this
smoky illusion and then I'm going to go
in with my Mac mixing medium just so I
can add the shimmer on my lid and what
the mixing medium is going to do is make
the shimmer shadows that you decide to
use on your lid or wherever you decide
to use it it's going to pop more because
the mixing medium just gives it a base
it's almost like a primer for the lids
for a shimmer shadow I hope that makes
sense
it's 346 in the morning baby girl so if
I'm sounding crazy
that's exactly why but I had to do this
voice over for you guys because I love
you but I will be talking soon in the
video so you guys don't have to hear my
name's Louie voice right now anyway so
you know keep blending keep blending you
don't want any harsh lines because
you're working with brown shadows so you
need to make it look as effortless as
possible so take a clean blending brush
you know take a fluffy blending brush
and make sure you're just getting all
those harsh lines out of the way
what I'm gonna do now and start with
this mixing medium and you're gonna see
how I does it so I'm just gonna be quiet
now because you should
Russia I'm using by the way is from
Michaels I actually love this brush it's
a paint brush obviously if I'm getting
it from Michael's but it's great for
precision work I was about to say
precision precision work so it's good
it's great for carving out you know your
lids and making cut creases and all that
jazz it's very stiff but yet flexible if
that makes sense so that's why I really
like this brush for that I'm gonna go in
with a shimmer shadow and this is
actually from the mat from the Mak
neutral warm palette that they had came
out with a couple of years ago and yeah
so I'm using this bronzy shade and this
like dusty golden brown shimmer shade
it's kind of weird but I actually got it
from either Coastal Scents or makeup
geek I will list it in the description
box below I'm going to tight line widths
motor from Mac
alright babe so we finally got this
makeup out of the way very excited I'm
just baking underneath my contour let me
zoom you guys out so excuse my blondes
they're moving because I just closed
them because it's getting dark outside
now I talked to you guys about my hair
and I hope you guys like it I wanted to
do something different and the exciting
news
this is a wig from Wow African calm I
will list their information in the
description box below so what I wanted
to do with this wig as you can see I
wanted to see how well it would take
bleach but I didn't want to bleach the
whole thing because I didn't want to
have to color the whole thing because I
haven't stabbed this hair yet so that's
why I wanted to do this for you while
I'm on camera because I know you guys
are going to ask me questions about this
hair when you start seeing it in my
snapchat and all of that good stuff
so that's what I'll be doing today so of
course this is the side that I bleached
and I died I used three different dyes I
use hot pink dye from our dough no not
our nail I always say are down from
adored I used ooh
salmon from the Sally's Beauty Supply
stores salmon salmon believe it or not
from color brilliance and it didn't turn
down salmon it's probably because I
didn't want to damage the hair too too
much I didn't want to get into like a
213 I got it to like almost a 213 was
pretty much lifted to it like a brassy
blonde coming color and I put this diet
right on top and it wasn't enough so I
ended up having to run to view supply
store and get a door dye and this is
salmon and this is what it says the
salmon but when it came out girl who's
pretty much hot pink so that's why I
just stuck with the hot pink because I
would've had it orange I would have did
Sam and I would've made sure the top
part was probably see him in and then
the bottom part was like a kind of
vibrant orange but how this color came
out it was literally hot pink in my
opinion so let me know if you use color
brilliance die before and how that
worked for you but I'm just going to
quickly style this hair just don't know
what I want to do with it today I
probably won't put any layers in the
hair I just pretty much want to show you
guys how amazing this hair really is
because the quality is really really
nice I
this hair of course in its natural state
but I wanted to give it some life so
that's why I decided to do this two-tone
type of vibe going along with the hair
so all about Africa information will be
listed in the description box below so
make sure you check it out if you are
interested in purchasing this wig really
like how this wig is constructed if it's
really snuggling me it has four combs
draw straps so you can make it more
secure on your head
I use my salon graphics and mega hold
hairspray just to lay down the you know
top part just so it can look a little
bit more you know natural and it's not
going to be moving around on me just so
I could feel a little bit more secure so
it won't move around at the top i plug
the part of course so yeah so let's move
on to styling babe the first thing I'm
gonna do is just blow-dry my hair I have
a ratchet brush my brush broke it
actually didn't break it did break
nevermind
these are so poppin like I literally
have to keep them away from me so I
don't eat the whole box
especially when you find the one that
got all that extra flavor on us for it
to take bleach I bleach this hair three
times I bleach my right side three times
and it didn't get no bad at all and you
can see it looks just like the black
side Andy if you were interested in
bleaching this hair this is how it would
turn out I use argan oil bleach though
I'll put that product in the description
box below because it was the first time
I ever used that bleach and that
probably has something to do with why
the quality is still amazing just
because it's not super harsh or anything
oh and this is probably how I'll end up
wearing this hair today comes on tuck
behind my ears but like make sure making
sure this part is super flat but so far
no cons with this hair
so this is basically what I decided to
come up with I just put some moose on my
hair so if the hair of us a little wet
right at the top that's exactly why
because I was trying to get the flyaways
under control even though I think I
missed a few
all right so I do want to give you guys
a little bit more back information about
the hair before I get off the camera
because as you can see this was a very
simple test today I didn't do anything
dramatic so this is their virgin
brazilian straight lace wig and the
style number is lfw 5:01
it's a silky straight wig from this hair
company natural black and they
definitely let you guys know that it is
diable 18 inches courses the lace front
wig it has five inches of parting space
so you can do a lot with this unit as
you can see I tweeze mine some right
here but it does go a little bit back it
does go back a little bit farther this
wig does come with baby hairs and it's
also pre plucked if your order is at $89
or above 89 you will get free shipping
worldwide and I also have a coupon code
$15 off of all lace wigs and it's
Tatiana 15 so I believe all of that
information in the description box below
I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
didn't do anything spectacular I just
want to let you guys know that the hair
on this unit is really really high
quality as you can see it's nice and
silky straight now and you can bleach
this hair you can dye this hair and it's
not going to mess up nothing by the way
this is Brazilian silky straight once
again so I love you and I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
