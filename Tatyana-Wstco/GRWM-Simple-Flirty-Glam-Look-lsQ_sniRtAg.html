video and I'm going to be giving you
guys this brown sultry cranberry esque
smokey eye today very simple only use
three shadows so the first one is this
tan color from the tarts Pro palette and
I'll list the exact name in the
description box and then the second
color is this brown from the morphe 35o
palette and that is the only two shadows
that I was using on my lid and from the
brow bone highlight that is either a
Coastal Scents eyeshadow or a makeup
geek it's just a white like snow white
shimmery shadow that I use to pop right
on there and I felt like it really tied
the look together it was using the NW 50
to contour my nose for mac and then on
using my la girl fawn concealer to
conceal underneath my eyes and just to
highlight certain areas that I want to
highlight I'm going to use another
highlighter today for the other eyes but
this is going to do half of the job for
me and then after I do this I'm going to
blend the contour and the concealer out
together with a damp Beauty Blender you
guys want to always make sure it's damp
because it just works the best that way
it doesn't soak up the product and it
makes you look very seamless and
effortless and flawless when it's damp
and yes just try it if you guys don't
want to spend $20 on this one use the
dupe which is the Real Techniques Beauty
Blender and it works just as perfect and
it's really soft just like that one so
as you can see I'm just applying my Marc
Jacobs foundation and then right now I
am highlighting with the Mac what is
this highlighting pin in light booth and
this is just to brighten me up and
waking me up a little bit more you know
and then I'm going to set that using my
Maybelline shine free setting powder and
I like using this because I do tend to
get a little oily with that foundation
and and this just helps me stay no kind
of matte all day and not so much on the
oily side and I'm just going to touch up
my contour or my nose using the black
radiance sculpting kit and then I'm
going to go in and set the rest of my
face with the true match foundation
powder and I love this stuff because it
doesn't gives it off like a red
undertone and it looks really it looks
really pretty on my skin so I really do
like that that will be listed in the
description box below and I'm just
highlighting down the bridge of my nose
with naked naked half-baked shadow and
I'm going to go in once again with the
contour shade from the Black Radiance
palette and I'm going to just set the
cream contour that I was using which was
the NW 50 concealer from mac and I'm
just going to make sure I set that so it
doesn't move around all day and then I'm
going to add a highlight to my face and
I'm going to be using B and it's a fear
that globe K highlight and shade bubbly
as my highlight today and I'm going to
take a brown lip liner I'm using chi
from colour-pop and then I'm going to
put Speight on on top of that
combination and I am going to apply
mascara now so this is pretty much the
look I just put mascara and called it a
day and put a nude liner inside my
waterline I hope you guys enjoyed this
video all of the products that I use
will be listed in the description box
below so make sure you check that out
all of my social media is below as well

loves and I'll see you on my neck
