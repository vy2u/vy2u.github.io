just wanted to throw another makeup look
up on my channel because you guys know I
do so much hair videos and I'm about to
come at you with a ton of them so I just
want to keep getting up these makeup
videos for you guys I'm not exactly sure
what I'm going to name it I'm sure it's
gonna have something to do with a bold
lip and a red smokey with some gold I
don't know but let's get into this video
I hope you ladies enjoy alright love
muffins let's jump into this so I went a
little shopping makeup shopping and I
got me some Mac strobe cream and I don't
know exactly what the shade is called
and I'm going to be applying that on my
face I have applied some charge water
and now I'm gonna go in with that strobe
cream I don't think it's worth $32 or
how many dollars it is because as you
can see it's like a nice glow but what I
was getting with my I guess it's a nice
inner glow and with the other product
that I was using from Sephora it's more
of like a wham bam it's their type of
fill let me know if you guys can even
see anything like you start seeing me
staring at my face like did this even do
anything but anyway so I'm going to take
some of my pro longwear foundation in NC
50 and a little bit more of that strobe
cream to mix that in there just to see
what kind of effect is gonna give me
with that because this is like basically
my first impressions of that product and
honestly I don't know how I feel about
it
so I don't know if I'm gonna return it
or just keep it in my makeup kit just to
have if I want like an inner glow so as
you can see I'm using a damp beauty
blender to blend out my foundation for
even application and make sure you get
that next so you cannot be looking like
a two-tone it's sister so I'm gonna be
using groundwork from Mac and my Kat Von
D metal matte metal matte palette I
believe that's what it's called and it's
so pretty this is my first time opening
it and it's
nice I can't wait to dig into it I
definitely say you guys need to purchase
this and I'm using the nude shade I
forgot what that is called but it will
be listed in the description box then
I'm taking Coco bear from makeup geek
and blowing that out in my crease and
above my crease and then it looks like I
just started stabbing my eye with this
red shadow and this is from BH Cosmetics
palette it's very old and it's a nice
red but I really like this red so I
decided to use it it's very intense and
bright and that's why I love it so much
and then I'm gonna go in with velvet
from that kat von d palette and it's
really nice it's like a nice purplish
kind of color or maroon color whatever
you want to call it and just packing
that on the outer V of your eye and then
I'm gonna go in with milk my extra jumbo
pencil to intensify those shades under
my eye and blow it out and going in with
velvet to deepen up that shade and then
I'm gonna go in with that red color from
the BH Cosmetics palette and I'm going
to intensify that red again and then go
in with Coco bear to below it out a
little bit more and then I'm just going
back and forth with packing just to
intensify all the shades
and then I'm gonna speed up this process
right here cuz I was like freestyle in
the other eye because I didn't know
exactly what I wanted to do and then
after I got it I was just like all right
this is pretty easy so I'm just using
that BH Cosmetics palette red I'm not
even sure what I think it's the day oh
yeah the day and night palette from BH
Cosmetics and yeah so then I'm gonna go
in with Coco bear again to blow out that
red shade and then go in that brush I
use that nude from that kat von d
palette I think it's called suede but
once again it will be listed below and
then I'm going in with velvet right here
on the outer V
and using that read again to intensify
this color I really like this I look
then I'm going in with suede I believe
that's what it's called from the kat von
d palette and then I'm going to UM I'm
gonna pack that on my lids and I wasn't
sure if I wanted to stick with this look
or if I wanted to go with a little bit
more shimmer because that all of these
are pretty much matte that I use today
so I went in with shimmer and I kind of
like that a little bit more because it's
for more festive for this time around
for this time of the year time around
what am I talking about and yes this is
going to be my L'Oreal mascara and I
think this is the toughest got big
mascara yeah it is
and then I'm going to just highlight my
brow bone you can use any shade I used
the a BH that glow kit to highlight and
then I'm gonna take this matte oh this
liner this is from plain color and this
is this dark brown liner and then I'm
going to take this liquid matte lipstick
from my beauty supply store I will list
the exact name in the description box
but I won't recommend you get it it's
very much so a waste of your money why
because you have to pack this on so
much to get like a nice even application
then you can't like pucker your lips
together at all it's very messy it can
be and it's just not worth even telling
you guys about it but if you guys want
this lip and you don't want to use what
I'm using or want to use another dupe go
try to find night moth from Mac or or
cyber from Mac same thing but I hope you
ladies enjoy this video thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
