this is from Julia hair calm I have a
previous video showing you guys how I
got this style so check it out it will
be in the description box below
I cut the bangs in the last video I told
you that I was going to show you guys
the final results in my last video but
life got in the way I got sleepy I
wanted to take my makeup off up and out
all that other great stuff so today is
the final result of what the mousse did
I also went into some of this coconut
curling cream with the mousse in the
other video I just showed you that I've
just put the mousse in there and I felt
like I was missing something so that's
why I probably my curls it in pop when
they were drawing so I just went in with
my hands and curling cream so the
coconut curling cream just adds more
life to your curls when they dry and as
you can see so pretty and it's so soft
trust me the hair isn't hard it's not
like hearts and run my fingers through
anything like that it's still really
soft and yeah so that's basically what I
did all today I'm just going to be
showing you guys how to do this makeup
look now let me tell you about this next
look so I did a school eye and I did not
like the eyes so I end up wiping it off
I just felt like it was too much for
what I was doing today I had to tone it
down and I'm just literally wiped it off
and just put a brown eyeshadow on top so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and I
definitely want to let you guys know
that this hair being awesome you need to
purchase this hair this is perfect for
any girl that's looking for something
very manageable very easy very
low-maintenance
just like the only thing you have to do
when you pop up in the morning if you
already go through the steps that I did
then coconut curling cream in the
motions one night and let it air dry
girl all you have to do is wake up put
some water on your hair like it a spray
bottle I don't know where my spray
bottle is but just get too much hair
spray bottle or something like that and
spritz it all in there and just push it
up holiday my friends called me I gotta
go I love you
so you guys probably thought you wasn't
going to hear my voice again but I have
come until you guys what I'm doing so I
started off with my Mac I think this is
the No
Mac what is this the strobing cream yeah
strobing cream from Mac and I stick with
that all over my face just to get a
really nice glowy kind of skin effect
now I'm going to go in with my la girl
Pro concealer this is the orange
correcting concealer as well as the
color fawn and I just like make some
these two together because as you can
see I have dark under eyes in lids so I
just like to color correct with these
two products and then of course conceal
and also cover up all that
hyperpigmentation that I have on you
know around my mouth so yeah so that's
basically what I'm going to do and then
the foundation that I use today was the
NYX total control foundation and I'm
mixed to a mixed caramel and cappuccino
I just put a dab of caramel nowadays
because I'm getting darker because it's
the summertime girls so yes I have
gotten a tan and yeah I like mixing
these two together and I like using this
when I'm not trying to do like a super
like matte like over-the-top dramatic
kind of foundation and this is a very
affordable foundation you can find it in
also gives you really glowy dewy skin
and I like popping that with Sephora the
new Sephora powders I've been using I'll
list it in the description box below
because I do not know what it's actually
called off the top of my head because I
just picked it up maybe like last week
and I really do like it
so yeah I like using these strobe
noth-nothing strobe drops but these are
the Sephora luminizing drops and this is
in the shade I don't even know it's the
gold bottle but I love this stuff you
guys know I love the stuff you've
probably seen it in a previous video of
mine but like I said all the products
will be listed in the description box
below because I don't remember
everything off the top of my head now
this is the medium shade from the LA
girl Pro concealer and I like using this
just to brighten me up a bit you know
because all of that under-eye
foolishness I just feel like I need to
get it together get it together y'all my
food is on this
dull honey and I'm about to burn this
band chicken so I'm going in with my NW
sister concealer from mac and what I'm
doing right here is just giving me some
you know color back into my skin getting
me some shadow using it to contour to
chisel my face up to make me look
slimmer and I'm taking my chicken out of
the oven while I'm talking to you guys
on this voiceover it's all shriveled and
black convert yes yes it is but I'll
still eat it because it's still good I'm
just using a tart beauty sponge to blend
that out and I also went in with some of
my this is the Maybelline shine free
powder and I'm just like using that to
set my concealer because as you can see
I put a lot more today and you don't
want it to crease up on you so this is
the Sephora
powder that I was telling you guys about
and I am in the shade don't know why I
can't tell you but it will be listed
below um honestly really didn't want to
come on here and talk to you guys about
this hair though like it's amazing guys
and I have it on right now I made I made
a unit for myself
and I don't know if you guys work with
Julia Heron calm before but if you have
please let me know your experience in
the description box below because I am
so in love and it's the most simplest
easiest unit that I've ever made for
myself because the maintenance for this
hair is just so minimum like all I have
to do honestly is put some water in it
and of course you don't have to put the
pan through coconut cream or even the
mousse in there I just like doing it
just because I like my hair being tamed
and because this is a ten inch you know
unit I don't want it to like get all
over the place throughout the day and
anything like that but I of course I was
rocking it without putting the cream in
and also the mousse but I just love what
the cream and the most you know do
combined but I won't always use those
two products on the hair just because
you don't want any product buildup in
your hair and yeah you wanted to look as
pretty and natural as possible so once
again just let me know if you guys work
with this hair company and not because
as I definitely have to say this is one
of my favorite units I made for myself
because it's just so perfect and
effortless and I do have three bundles
and a closure in I don't think I
mentioned that in the beginning now back
to this makeup look so this is the eye
look that I was telling guys that I was
going to do and I was just like uh-uh
honey so what I just did was just primed
it and put some shadow on top of the
primer to set and then I ended up wiping
it all off so all of them under eye
makeup kind of got like messed up but I
really didn't care I had somewhere to go
so I just wiped it off and then I just
applied this brown shadow underneath it
and try to blow it out as much as I
possibly could and I use these two
shimmery shadows from The Naked 1
palette I will list the names in the
description box below I think it was
like smog and some other colors and I
just put some fix the plus on my brush
and stipple back onto my lid just to
give me some shine because I didn't want
it to be super matte and dull so yeah so
that's basically what I did and I do
have Samantha lashes on there's a huge
Beauty cuter Beauty whatever that damn
name is
it's those lashes and you can get those
from Sephora and then I changed my lip
color I didn't have the cork lip liner
with the NYX cookie butter and I'll just
wipe that off as well and just put some
clear lip gloss on and just put cork on
the outside
I put cork on the outside of my lips so
that is pretty much it so as you can see
my hair was drying throughout this video
so I hope you guys enjoy it thank you so
much for watching and definitely shout
out to Julia here for this 10 out of a
10 hair that I have in my head I love
you I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
