I'm going to be showing you guys or sure
I'm going to be sharing with you guys my
compare can I have on top of my head and
this is beauty forever so I'll be
talking to you guys about this hair in a
second but I'm just going to start with
this makeup look I'm in love with the
parents I love you guys and ask me about
really really good curly hair and I
think this is definitely a gym so far so
good yeah I have to 26 to 24 and a 20
inch closure from the Terr company and
there's going to be a coupon code within
the description box below if you guys
are interested in purchasing as I've
been wearing this hair a lot and I end
up sucking the closure like I do my
frontals
lately so it looks really really natural
right now just I have a headband on just
because I'm trying to get my hair out of
my face and clearly it's telling me just
because the hair is so big but we're
gonna start off with color correcting so
I'm going to use the LA girl Pro
concealer and orange and this is just
going to cancel my dark eye circles
because you know the kid has them and
I'm just going to put it around my mouth
a little bit it's visited basically
supposed to cancel out any darkness
around my mouth as well you know
wherever you feel like you had
discoloration hyperpigmentation whatever
you want to say just put this on top of
it and depending and depending on the
discoloration you can get the perfect
color corrector for that so you have
your yellow options your greens and your
purples so I like using orange just
because you know you can't lose mine out
perfectly and I'm going to take the LA
girl Pro concealer in fog now I'm going
to mix this together just because I go
ham on the launch concealer just because
I really have intense under eyes
personally that's how I feel but my mom
swears up and down that they're not as
bad as I think that they are but it's
just one of my flaws and
if I'm going to wear makeup I'm going to
make sure they're all covered up you get
what I'm saying I'm going to use my Real
Techniques sponge just to flip this out
I'm right in front of a sink thank God I
don't have to go and walk away if you're
working with a beauty sponge make sure
it's dead because you're going to get
the best results just because it's going
to blend out evenly Oh PS I've been
taking my biotin so you know violet in
this poor hair is going to know just to
you know get your life together kind of
vitamin so I feel like that's the reason
why my scar on this side of my face has
been going away really really sad and I
say that because when I wasn't taking
this it was taking forever for me to get
rid of the discoloration that I had or
thought of my face though if you guys
try to fix any discoloration or
problematic skin take these because I
feel like it definitely helped the
situation out I'm going to be using my
NYX telecontrol foundation and this is
in the shade cappuccino I usually mix
the two but I've been getting a pan
because you know this summer time so is
about this melanin right now and I'm
going to just drop a couple of drops on
my hand and I'm going to use my brush my
fortune on a brush from morphe just to
blend this out all over my face and I
love this product just because it gives
you a flawless finish and it's very
affordable you could find it at your
local beauty supply store or even also
has it if you guys don't see it in your
beauty supply stores the four three nine
I always call this the four to nine but
four three nine brush from morphe
amazing this is like a must-have if
you're trying to look for a brush that
gives you a flawless canvas and it
doesn't like drink up all your products
mean all my makeup brushes today very
excited about that this looks like it's
still a little dirty but it's cool but
I'll just pick up this product and it's
just stipple bit around the area that I
feel like I need the most coverage and
then when the rest out on my face and I
did this just because I don't like
wearing a ton of foundation during the
summer time just because it's just too
hot for all of that Julie yeah so I'm
just going to also make sure I cover up
the orange concealer with this product
too okay so that's good enough for me I
have a boo-boo on my nose so if you see
something it's just because I tried to I
thought it was a blackhead in my nose
but it wasn't is actually a bump that
was just trying to get to the surface
and I was popping it and it just almost
ruined my life but it's going away okay
it's going away so I'm going to take
this Bobbi Brown foundation stick you
guys know this is my favorite product to
consult with and it's just because well
actually you know I've been liking it
now because I'm a little darker now but
before I was using the NW 50 concealer
now this is just more so or like the
cooler of red type of undertone and this
is a little bit more deeper and if
you're going for a very chiseled kind of
contour you definitely need to work with
this product if you're ma skin
complexion
so this also I'll contour if you guys
don't know about contour it's just
supposed to just give you a swimmer
appearance you know to your face I've
been working out with my brothers
insisted we have made a workout plan and
it's been doing great and it's been
going great we've been really staying on
top of it and they've been helping me
stay on top of it like if I try to get
out of there then it's like it's time to
work out like get up let's let's break
out so yeah I'm excited that I have them
around motivate me right now and I have
little workout partners that's always
fun so that you still work out by myself
and it's sometimes like alright I can do
it with this right now
learn to conceal
no this is my new fave consumer this is
the Milani retouched concealer and when
I'm in Georgia like they do not have
deeper concealer complexions like this
in Walgreens or CVS and I don't know why
I'm guessing they just think that black
people don't exist or deeper skin
individuals don't exist out there and so
now that I'm in Maryland I was able to
pick up the one that I needed and this
is in the shade deep honey
now I so happy that I went with this
comment because they have a color
lighter than this um a little lighter
than this and it was honey and I really
really like the deep running for me so I
just love the application I love the
applicator on here too it's really cute
and I'm just going to just take a little
bit of this product and put it right
underneath my eyes the reason why like
the applicator is because it fits right
up in this area and you don't really
have to put a lot of product one because
it can leave a little bit one's a little
applicator
okay so I just added some more of my
trip translucent powder on my nose
really quick I'm going to stop working
on this eye look because I don't know
what I want to do but I think I want to
do something simple so we're not going
to do anything to brains ink
problems of the broad think you know
when I say when you're soft ocher you
guys know this is just my face and this
is just to enhance my eye shadow pigment
I start palette this one right here that
I broke look at it I lost this whole eye
shadow
just like oh you know love my classic I
didn't even notice that I'm just going
to have to buy me another pallet but
it's cool so I'm just going to use
vintage just set I usually use classic
because it's the perfect colors to put
on top of that going to work for my
transition shade I'm going to use the
same brush because why not I'm going to
take this shade right here which is I
want to say who what color is this I
used to remember this name cuz it's my
favorite color and when you want the
most activity with your eyeshadows just
Pat them in instead of swiping them
going to take some of my mixing medium
like force greenish kind of coming right
here and looks a dusting printout mail
it dusty but probably not because of
this length
so yeah so now we rather just smoke out
the bottom lashline is the elf blush I
got to put lashes on mascara and the
lashes that are using and these kiss
lashes they come in a pack like this and
they're the 11 lashes you can get them
from Walmart those are my favorite
lashes I got to do my brows I'm just
going to use dip brow
evany annasophia and mascara though I'm
going to be using is be pumped it up the
pump it up mascara from Italy
right babe so I got my lashes on and I
think that's pretty much all that I have
to do for makeup for today yeah but it
puts some NYX eyeshadow base in my
waterline so don't have my white
eyeliner pencil with me right now what
else did I do
oh I added some of this NYX liquid white
liner dots like right here you see the
white dots that's when I did that's what
was it so I hope you guys enjoyed the
makeup portion of this video now it's
going to be about this hair so once
again this is beauty forever hair I'm
going to take these just like you will
pluck a frontal I'll pluck the closure
like that and I actually got this hair
jet-black it may not look like it
because I didn't put all the pieces yet
back but you get the gist of it you get
the gist I'm going to pretty much pick
the hair out I don't want it like tight
and coyly right now pretty much what it
really big so what I can say is the
closure is a lot looser than the bundles
as you can see like the wave pattern is
looser than the bundles but I don't hide
that just because when you wet it it's
fun like it looks good it blends really
well so that's what I'm going to do I
don't know if you guys who want to
purchase the closure and you're meaning
probably it's just not like the perfect
texture for the bundles but you can
manipulate it once again when it comes
to curly hair I don't like straightening
and the reason why don't like
straightening it is just because like I
said the curl pattern will get loose'
on you over time if you keep wanting to
put heat through curly hair just like if
you were to continue putting heat on
your natural hair if your natural
eventually your curl pattern is going to
get loose and your hair is not going to
be as curly as it would be if you did
not put so much heat on it and if you
don't put a lot on your hair or your
weave if it's curly it's going to last
way longer how it looks if you put a
little bit of water on it just trying to
get it to mimics the bundle a little bit
and because I take the hair out just
because I pick the bundles out you can
see it blends really good create like
right here
and I didn't leave your products in it
before so don't think I may have
anything left over in here I don't
really like putting product in my weaves
just because the build up situation I
haven't set it already within a unit
that I'm micro meso and you just want to
put your hair up in a pineapple like a
really high ponytail that's right you're
going to sleep organized through smut
and w50 concealer from mac to just mix
apart a little bit more visible I kinda
want apart to just be right here once
again this is a closure so when you're
working with a closure and if you make a
wig for yourself you can just maneuver
the wig around if you want to be part to
be more so on this side you can like
twist it and like make it lay that way
guys want to see how I do that I have a
video on that on my channel I'll list it
below so you can see how I lay my front
solder closures or wigs down it's just
with some hairspray so long graphics
holders spray and this is the concealer
if you guys wanted to see how it looks
it's the studio finish concealer from
mac either gloves so I wanted to share
with you guys what I did after putting
the water on it I just took a little bit
of this can to define and shine cuts
there and ran it into the closure and
just the front part pretty much on the
back not so much and this is pretty much
how I got it to look like this it's just
going to make it a little bit more easy
to deal with throughout the night when I
go out just because I don't want the
hair to just be all over the place and I
actually calm down the closure a little
bit more with the comb and I and I also
put some of this product inside of the
cone and just combed it through the top
and stopped like at this point just so
you can see the part and the part can be
a little bit more visible you know and
that's pretty much it so I hope you guys
enjoyed the video I'm going to do some
slo-moes now Beauty forever information
will be linked in the description box
below
like I said I rate this hair a night of
a 10 due to the closure
having some manipulate it and sometimes
you don't want to have to always do that
you just want to wait and go but if
you're doing a wedding go look
trust me the closure is going to be
perfect I will do an updated video on
how to get the hair looking nice again
and it's like really coyly state that
will be the next video for beauty
forever hair and I'm probably going to
record that tomorrow I didn't make this
hair out of a wig once again this is not
a soul in this is a wig I actually sold
the bundles down to a wig cap so to
close it down to the webcast and I call
it in a day so I hope you guys enjoy
thank you so much for watching if you
guys re-create this makeup look I would
love to see photos of it because it
would mean so much to me all the
products not used will be listed in the
description box below
thank you so much for watching again
