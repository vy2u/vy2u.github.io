feels like
and I'll come back with another video
today I'm going to be shared with you
guys this hair and I'm also going to be
doing this makeup look for you guys so
I'm just going to jump into the hair
information right now so this hair is
actually from wonky hair it is an
Aliexpress hair company I have three
bundles of their Brazilian straight hair
I know looks waving right now but I'm
going to give you guys in back
information with this video start so I
have three bundles of 30-inch Brazilian
straight in my head in a 20 inch frontal
to match but what happened was when I
first received his hair I was really
alarmed by how the flyaways were after
creating my unit for myself now it was
like epic like I was like I cannot wear
this hair if it looks like this straight
so I had to co wash the hair and I co
washed it as you can see there's no
flyaways everything was really really
nice and natural and what I use to Co
wash this hair was just some Garnier
Coblentz shampoo and conditioner welco
washing your conditioning it but also
shampooed it it didn't have a cinch
it came really what it was supposed to
but I lost this package because of UPS
so that's a whole another story but when
I received the hair I was really excited
because the lens was super long and it
was super straight but when I received
it when I started creating my unit for
myself I don't know why I started seeing
so many flyaways but that's what I was
left with but I thought to myself like
why not just go wash the hair because a
lot of times I always suggest you guys
go wash your hair before installing your
hair why because if you guys don't like
the hair if it's not the same pattern
that you're expecting it to be such as a
like a body wave or a loose wave or a
deep wave you can always return your
hair if you're not feeling it now with
this situation when I co wash the hair
or when I washed my hair I received this
really beautiful wave afterwards so what
I did was just shampoo conditioner with
these two products and not also let it
air dry and not go in with any oils
serums moisture
there anything like that I just let it
do its own thing and this is how awesome
the hair looks I did trim see here a
little bit so if you can notice at the
end it looked it looks really even and
that's because I just cut at least this
much off even with the front so I did a
little bit of trimming but honestly if
you see it right here it was like
literally right down there so that's a
little little smidge of hair that I had
to cut off some really excited to
actually install it in my head because
it's 30 inches and I never worked with
30 edges before I always follow me on
Instagram guys can see the hair on there
but yeah so so far low-key hair has been
doing really good I haven't received any
shedding any tangling any maybe in the
back of my neck and this is 30 inches so
you have to be aware it and to be honest
with you guys I did be cutting method
with this hair and I still don't see any
shedding so I'm really really happy with
that I don't know if it was the help of
because I am using my hot glue gun to
lay my Westdale on my dome caps but and
that can also fill the West so that may
be the reason why it's no shedding going
on because when you do cut your web you
are going to see a little bit more
strands here and there if you just
rather than overlapping your web so
overlapping your West is going to
definitely minimize any shedding that
can be possible for your installation we
have a lot of loyal customers that come
back and repurchase their hair so
definitely check it out so I already
have my concealer on for the day la girl
Pro concealer in the orange color
correcting concealer and then the shade
fawn I mix these two to get the desired
color that I want and this is just to
once again color correct because I do
have dark eye circles today I'm going to
be sharing with you guys my hair also so
I want to be talking to you guys about
the process and what I have been doing
lately with my hair and what is on my
head so this is monkey hair
it's an Aliexpress hair company and of
course of course I will be their
information in the description box below
how this when I was the foundation I'm
going to be using today is the main
content idole ultra 24 hour makeup
foundation and this is the shade 460
suede W I did a full video for this
because I am in love with this
foundation I only wear when it's like
really hot out and I still want to be my
things or thought we might do like a
flawless look which is what I'm going to
be doing today so that's what I'm
pulling it out but before I do that I'm
going to go on with my mac strobe cream
and this is just to enhance your skin
and make it look glowy and dewy and
natural-looking so yeah so that's what
I'm going to do and I'm just going to
use my Beauty Blender and stipple that
on my face so yeah so okay so about this
hairstyle backstory I think I was going
to work with long key a while ago but I
don't know exactly what happened so I
went with the 30 inches of straight hair
from this hair company and when I first
created this wig so we're straight when
I first received the bundles and then
when I made the way I've seen a ton of
flyaways now you guys know what you guys
don't know like that is the most
annoying thing when it comes to stray
hair because when you're trying to
strain it it just pops right back up and
it's really annoying so but I used my
brain last night and I was just like let
me shampoo and condition it and it turns
out really nice
I really really love it and I can say
that because if I stand out when I stand
up you guys will see it's so pretty the
wave pattern like when you co wash it I
used shampoo and conditioner of course
and the one that I used was um Garnier
Hoagland's the olive oil extract shampoo
and conditioner I turned the hair just a
smidge just because I didn't want like
the dead end to be at the bottom but
it's still really long I'll stand up
like I said towards the end of the video
I just don't have pants on right now I
know you guys don't want to see all of
that but yeah so be nice my grandmother
loves it she saw me from she saw me
create this way from start to finish I
like it it's a really really nice it
didn't have a spouse smell or anything
like that and did my pack my butt so for
30 inches really good I am 5 3 I figured
that out the other day spin it next to
my mom's mom or
five six and I didn't even know she was
that tall but yeah so really nice it was
really easy to make the wig of course I
use my mesh dome cap this time and it
was the first time I ever used a mesh
dome cap and I really really liked it I
wish I was doing the mesh toe caps
before like the regular don't hassle
that were using of course I'll update
you guys in my next video letting you
know how the hair is holding up but so
far so good
in any 20 inch frontal now I went in it
did a lot of tweezing plucking and I
also bleached the nuts on this frontal
and it turned out really really good at
first I was very skeptical because I
created this way to fill up the frontal
with a lot like spacious like you know
how some frontals can come like when you
part it it's like really patchy versus
like you know straight line but it
didn't it didn't look like that when I
popped it on so I was really happy with
that lovely I know you guys are like
which one are you going to start making
Wade Kinsella no it's coming really soon
so I am going to apply my concealer now
and this is the same song concealer from
la girl so how have you guys been I know
you guys are probably like how do you
put out a whole bunch I do and then go
to my game I wanted to regroup in me
around you know my family my grandmother
and stuff and I'm glad I've made that
decision because you know what you do
stuff a lot um and you kind of like not
get bored with it but you just need a
break you like a vacation and I chose to
spend my 22nd birthday
I'm 22 if you guys didn't know that I
chose to spend my 22nd birthday with my
grandmother and my family just because I
feel like that was the best thing to do
because my grandma she's okay but she's
she's noggin old and you know that means
and I just wanted to enjoy my time with
her so she made a really nice dinner for
me a day before my birthday and she made
my favorite dishes which there are
macaroni dressing and potato salad slaw
was in here eating like I'm like like we
and Thanksgivings even and he a girl has
gained like 10 pounds oh it's time to
snatch my life back in place when I get
home
thank you oh yeah by the way thank you
for all the happy birthday wishes I
haven't been on mind you to really to
respond to you guys but I really
appreciate it a lot of you didn't I was
Joe and I and yes I am a Gemini with my
NW 50 concealer from Mac I need to go
I'm picking up another one contoured
base cuz I'm going to use another color
to contour but the other share is a lot
darker so I just like putting this down
first so it won't look you know muddy or
me and the other product that I use to
contour is the Bobbi Brown foundation
stick and expresso and if you guys ever
worked with that product you guys know
how creamy and nice it is so that's a
lot like using that to contour kind of
shame and of course contouring is just
to make your face appear slimmer
that's buffing brush from Real
Techniques and not just like pressing
the product in like and don't drag it
down because I just want to defeat the
purpose of contouring and it's going to
also make your face appear bigger if you
bring the shadows towards the bottom you
want to keep it up like up here and how
you find your jawline or your jawbone
cheekbone or whatever you want to call
that you go do this but I've been doing
makeup so much
um I know where mine is
so officially you will be knowing where
your placement is going to go when you
start doing this more often if you want
to do this and of course you don't have
to get this bold if I left them out of
product if this is too much for you but
I'm Gucci I'm wearing red lipstick so I
want to make sure I am snatched and my
hair is 30 inches so why not just be
good face today right
what concealer I just used with the tart
shape tip concealer in the shade medium
so I like looking up when I do this
because I have so much concealer
underneath it and I don't I have so much
concealer on that I don't want to creepy
itself when you press this powder and
try to look up so you're not going to
get any creases going over Mercier
powder mix with the maybelline shards
free powder and that one looks like this
pick this up from a Walmart or a
drugstore and the Laura Mercier powder
you can pick it up from Sephora so I'm
just going to use this pretty much set
my under eye and then I'm going to go in
with the maybelline shine free powder to
set the other parts of must face and
I'll just blow off the excess powder
because I just want to make sure it's
going to be an even application versus
it being patchy and sometimes that
happens with this sponge but my other
sponge the Beauty Blender I didn't do
this it picked up for super evenly but
this one it doesn't for some odd reason
so the areas that I highlighted that's
where I'm going to place this powder at
so on my chin forehead underneath my
eyes and just packing above my eyes so
that air you can be set and I also like
going on going right here and doing the
same thing it's just a true match
foundation super blendable powders in
the shade n7 and what I like to work
with this is just using a like flat
brush and I like pressing it in the area
that I set my contour well place my
contour the cream contour and this is to
set the cream contour because you don't
want it to move around you don't
my shirt or look a hot mess winter or in
the day so that's why I do that and I'm
going to go in with my contouring colors
now hi this is the light to medium black
radiance palette and I'm just going to
use my powder brush to pretty much get
into this area just so my contour can be
more broadly in glowing and not so much
on the flat side I kind of still want it
to be loud so yeah so this would I do
this for so now we're going to take this
brush to blend it up a little bit more
Maybelline shot sleep addict and now
we're going to use that I make some of
that banana shade in this one though I'm
going to go in with my morphe 412 brush
and just take some of this foxy from The
Naked 1 palette look like this and I'm
just going to put that right on my lid
your palette and I'm going to take buck
with the same brush it decreases with
this color to add some color payoff you
know because we don't want it to be too
too tall but we don't want it to be
really anything on my lids honestly I
don't really like having a lot of makeup
on my eyeballs if I have red lipstick on
because I feel like the red the stick is
the main focus when you're wearing red
lipstick but whatever floats your boat
you can do a more fancy outlook if you
want to but this is usually what I do
during the summer time with red lipstick
the morphe palette and when it picked is
on the 35 oh and I want to take this pan
shade right hand and just place that in
the crease as well just to brighten it
up a little bit she will end up living
with me yay alright so I'm going to use
half-baked that I use down the bridge of
my nose you guys know that's the only
thing I like using to highlight the
bridge of my nose with and I'm just
placing that on my browbone also sisters
go
this is my dog Scooby it toes and then
him so much I'd not be so much boobie
this is Miss Maddie Rooney Mara wat skin
finish powder that I need to go and
restock of oil if you guys have a
favorite setting powders
I heard the forest setting powder is
really good and I have a ton of
different colors let me know if you guys
like that word because I needed a
setting powder and I don't want to get
that one because it's too Rekha me and I
have to mix it with this one which is
the true wind and um I don't like having
to do that all the time okay swipe it
away after like it leaves that patchy
like what the hell is going on up there
kind of look so that's why like pressing
this alright so by the way I have
combinations again so during the summer
time I don't have any time for oils
pores to be showing so that's why I like
spending a lot of powder on my face but
I like going in a Lauren I said oily to
combination right yeah so the oil
repressed in my face and like the t-zone
area so I'm so I don't like that getting
all crazy throughout the day so I like
to put a lot of powder or going to right
now is George my face in six plus and
that's how it's going to look really
natural and I'm allowed you guys don't
even think that I have makeup line
sometimes but I see girl yes I have to
make up one so I like to doing that and
while that is working into my skin
notice my like for everything to use to
enhance my highlight they have tons of
different colors into 400 fifty half 3
and this is by Sephora and this is in
the shade ocean light I always say the
gold bottle you put this quote ultra
light spacious and make sure the Beauty
Blender is extremely been like almost
close to dry just wring all the water
out so I'm going to go in with my back
locate using all three of the more
um glowy shades it doesn't make sense
not the yellow one I use all three of
the other ones except for the yellow
shade and I'm just going to put this
right on top of that liquid highlight
that I used I brushed it out a little
bit and that's how I always feel took
nation so you can outline your lip if
you want to I am today because this is
basically the same thing that I did for
my photo and you guys asked a lot of
questions so I'm just using cork lip
liner and I'm going to outline my lips
and then the shades and I'm using for my
lips is B Sephora shade and it's the so
called Rouge it's the super red one in
the Sephora cream lip second in the
shade number one
and what I like doing is going in and
hittin my lip like this in there because
when we do this it's not going to show
up but if you don't do that you're still
going to be able to see your lip color
and I hate that when I'm wearing red
lipstick going to add my lashes now
these lashes are real or deluxe lashes
and the shade Milani you apply my lashes
and my mascara and I'll serve it up so
let me go ahead and show you the hair
really quick so it's right underneath my
butt if you see the problem that I was
having just wash it let it air dry and
this is how you're going to get this
nice really nice wave so when it did
look like this after Co watching it
because it's less that I have to do if I
would like to just wash and go with this
unit that I made myself so thank you so
much for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
