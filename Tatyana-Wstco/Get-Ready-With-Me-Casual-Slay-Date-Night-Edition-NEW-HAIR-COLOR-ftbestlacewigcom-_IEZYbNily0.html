first I want to go with thought so as
you can see I'm using a lot of concealer
today and that's just because of my
breakouts and discoloration so I'm going
to go in with my damp Beauty sponge so
the best way to cover up your breakouts
you want to start off with a you know
enough concealer that is going to
conceal any of your discoloration or
breakout and then go in with your
favorite foundation I'm in golden almond
in my hourglass foundation and I'm just
going to put this around the
imperfection areas I don't want this
foundation all over just because I feel
like it'll pick up too much of my
textured skin right now so I'm just
going to put this in the area so like I
need the most coverage in and I'm going
to go in with my total control
foundation unmixed total control
foundation in cappuccino and PS I got my
nose though today do you like them love
them handle them you know I haven't done
stiletto nails and so color when I got
with 176 I don't know if you'll have
that color in your shop so I'm just
letting you know just in case you do
when my entire shaped a concealer this
is this alright heat pants and a warm
honey from la girl just to get some
color with my NW 50 concealer from mac
and I'm going to take that for the side
of my nose looks like this for you this
contour because I'm going to blend out
my concealer in a second and I don't
want to blend out B contour with any
left over concealer on the sponge coming
with the under eyes first because
whatever is left over we can work it out
in the other areas the only is only what
the whoops go down on the needle
my objective so chop see my bosom of
this go down a few pounds in my weight
loss is the canopy's adult maybelline
shine free powder that I was often seen
as about taffy on your eyes there's no
creases how's this underneath
I'm going to do a back school makeup
look
less products more about the technique
also
it's going to be drugstore by the way
like you get your nails done get a
pedicure get your hair did
boys take this powder this is before my
gross world product and I'm just going
to touch up any other areas that I use
the cream contour and I'm just going to
press this powder in that area matte
bronzer we're going to go in with this
whole guy because Daniela Tamia was so
I've got a box ecstatic if you want to
call crazy if you my concealer
as my eyeshadow base because I don't
want to go with a nearly colorless so
we're just going to stipple that in with
our Beauty Blender keep it really in the
sister my baby Buffalo dusty palette
we're going to take this is my favorite
color in this palette and I'm pretty
much gonna put it all over my lid
that's the common mood I made today it's
really going to be a bustling color but
I'm just want submissively packing in
certain areas let them look like I'm
using two shades
why
I'm going to add a brow bones low and
I'm just going to take dripping gold
from that low kick
so these are the lashes that I have to
mention to you guys this is the G X
lashes I will have a dedicated video on
this company so this is in the number
six I will check the description box I'm
going to pop these babies for use in my
Ardell lash glue and I'll be right back
and what I'm going to work on my hair
with you guys so this unit is actually
from best lace wigs I will have the
information in the description box below
but it's one of their 360 units I don't
know what's up with small class sizes
when I want to get it more cat sounds I
feel like it's not blown up but always I
said that would be like a medium so
sometimes I kinda have to like make my
own whole it's just not as snug as I
wanted to be delicious
my personal preference when I wear a
weight I want to be a small cat fat but
my kite is way smaller than mine what
are you going to do like you guys
shouldn't have to go and customize your
own like holes in your wigs or do the
most just to fit so I'm going to do out
so you guys can see the hair color it's
like a Asha mocha kind of colors so I
like it a lot this is it in a straight
state but the body wave texture is
really really nice I actually
straightened it so I'm going to keep it
straight in I wish this hair to like a
613 and I didn't receive any problems at
all so best place to waste quality on
their hair is amazing like I love this
company I work with this company a lot
they actually have a unit named after me
on their website it's based off my
hairstyle that I had did with one of
their wigs and I customized then maybe
look like it was like something that I
would actually be able to work with one
of every day that way got a lot of
positive feedback from you guys so they
actually did this style and actually
sold us out with my name on it so if you
guys are interested I will leave that
video in the description box
but I don't have any cars with this unit
at all other than the cap size size so
think about their 60
lace wigs no base is kind of liked in
this area but if the comb is just
sitting right here like what the hell am
I supposed to do when I'm trying to lay
lay down you don't know there so I don't
get it but it is what it is how it
weighs it makes really nice after me
having to create like my own custom
holes in the way I just use that hub
just to put through the hole so it can
sit nice and snuggle me and I also use
my salon graphics holding spray just to
hold the lake down so it doesn't lift up
so as you can see it's not going
anywhere and how I remove that product
is just by adding a little bit of water
in this area and it just lifts right up
so that's pretty much it
so I'm going to post a picture of colors
that I use to get to this hair but like
I said I've wished his hair to a 613 I
actually toned it and I got like a
little brassy oatmeal kind of tan color
when I told her hair and then I think
added this guy on top and then I put the
second I staple on the bottom so both of
the guys are so dark and lovely and I
really like it I gravitate towards this
unit all the time in the quality or this
hair is amazing so I give this hair a
non other thing this is the skirt from
H&amp;amp;M Lissa big trust me in tonight's
aside for actually and I love it because
it dislike that in the front will drop
like that and then like the cut off is
really really cute and it's going to be
really cute with these poodles
Jill that I'm gonna be wearing they're
clear and this shirt I love it I hope
you guys check out that like wigs unit
because this definitely worth it trust
me don't want to psab again so we both
did some money as much as it all is only
it wasn't
go down animatable shop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
