video today I'm gonna be sharing with
you guys this hair that I received from
me Lissa hair it is a Nelly express hair
company and I am so in love with this
unit that I made for myself so I just
decided to turn the camera on and just
record while I was kind of constructing
this u-part unit it's actually a mesh
dome cap that I'm using to create this
wig and yeah the lens that I received
from me Lisa is 226 of 24 22 and a 20 I
believe of their Brazilian straight and
I will do a more in-depth tutorial on
how to do a U part unit if you guys are
interested I will leave the comment
section open of course for you guys to
share your thoughts and let me know if
you guys want to see that um yeah but
other than that the hair was really soft
and didn't have a foul smell and that's
why I really kind of wanted to jump on
camera to share what I was doing with
you guys this day when I was
constructing it but yeah and I did see a
lot of flyaways when I first received
the hair after constructing this unit I
just applied a little bit of water and a
little bit of mousse on the hair just so
it can be tamed and it really really
helped the flyaways go away immediately
so I really wasn't mad at it at all I
didn't go wash this hair or anything
like that and you could probably just go
wash it so you don't have to deal with
that problem and I would just knock out
the you know flyways immediately but
just let the hair air-dry always if you
are gonna Co wash it or anything like
that
the way I am using my Nano bliss
titanium Flatiron to stir in this hair
and that's pretty much all I really
wanted to tell you guys about their
Brazilian straight hair it's a really
really great quality and I have no cons
with this so far so I will link them in
the description box below but we're
gonna get into this makeup look all
right babe so let's work on this mug and
what I'm gonna be doing is going in with
my tint idole ultra 24 hour makeup
foundation and this is from Lancome I'm
gonna be going in with the shade suede
for 60w and they have so many
shades in this line for this particular
foundation and I am in love with this
foundation just because it's undertone
matches so perfect with mine so I have
no complaints when it comes to this
foundation a my love its coverage and I
love how natural it makes my skin look
I'm gonna go in with my la girl Pro
concealer in the shade coffee underneath
my eyes and I'm using it to conceal in
highlight and also to highlight so if
you see it going a little further down
that's because I'm using it's a
highlight once again I'm gonna go in
with my NW 50 concealer from Mac and I'm
just using this to pinch my nose as well
as to add a little bit of color back
into my when I use my Laura Mercier
powder to stay underneath my eye and
yeah I like using this powder just to
make sure that there's no Kris creasing
underneath my eyes and everything looks
like you know seamless and there's no
craziness going on underneath that area
okay so I'm gonna dust that away and I'm
also going to press a little bit of my
micro smooth powder from Sephora into my
skin just so I can set every area that
needs to be set and then I'm just going
to go in with my two favorite powders to
use to bring some color back into my
face and that's the next day matte but
not flat powders and I'm using two
shades Coco and also deep golden and
once again it's just almost like using
this powder as if it was bronzer if you
are looking for a cute bronzer it's the
one that have been currently using is
NYX matte bronzer and medium and you can
get it from Target or your bee supply
store but yeah really nice bronzer I am
trying to get my hands on the bra the
Bobbi Brown bronzer and let me know if
you guys have any other dupe to use
until I get that one just because I'm
looking to get more bronzer but I feel
like I don't really know any good
bronzers out there before you know
darker complexions
so I'm gonna go in with my Becca
champagne pop highlights and I love this
highlight and if you can see my skin is
a little bit more like Dewey and that's
just because I added a little bit of
fix+ on my skin so the powdery look can
get calmed down because I have been
using a lot of powders on my face lately
I don't know why but it happened
sometimes when I do my makeup but about
this grungy I look I definitely was in
my fillings when I'm doing this makeup
look so I was definitely going for
something more smokey and grungy so yeah
so I was going for more warm shades so
I'm using my 35o palette to create this
look and also going in with my tortise
pro palette just to take a little bit
more of those brown shades and that
palette just to intensify the brown that
is going Lord on my eyes and that's
pretty much it
everything will be listed in the
description box below I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I am going to link me
Lisa hare information in the description
box so you can check that out but I love
you guys and I hope you learned
something throughout this video I will
see you babe soon
