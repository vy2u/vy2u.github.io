today i have in my summer wig i showed
you guys this wig on snapchat and i know
you guys're afford to be language what
is that I don't know if I'm going to
just tone this hair or add some color
towards the top but I'm going to tone it
first because I like the color it's cool
but still as you can see it's giving you
like Barbie so I'm really not feeling
that on it every day
and I want to wear this wig during my
birthday so I'm going to basically
finesse it for you guys want to tone it
first but if I like how it looks with a
completely tone I'm not going to add the
darker roots but let's begin this I have
a bathing suit or right now and the way
this is set up is going to be super hard
for me the first product I'm going to
use is the frothy a shade from color
charm and this is a web of toner I'm
going to use whatever I have left of
this and hopefully it would take there's
not a lot here in this wake honestly and
there's a lot of this product left so
I'm going to pretty much mix this
product in this little hair Bowl it's
going to tone the yellowness that you
see in it down they'll also want to take
some of this Clairol professional 30
value developer and i'm just going to
mix that in there
matrix shampoo - I honestly just use
this was supposed to do is cancel out
the breath of yellow stones in your hair
without having to use any toner how many
guys are like yo what the is she
doing is that exactly how she does her
hair well of course not I was doing it
crying or maybe a 5-11 a front of the
camera I will be able to do it a little
bit more organized if that's the words
I'm trying to use I don't want to leave
the shampoo in there for too long so
hopefully this turns out good hey guys I
am back with the final results I am in
love with my hair the two promotion
foods that I used were the matrix
shampoo I purchased a from Ulta and the
blonde brilliance purple shampoo so
super simple very easy if you're already
working with 6 13 bundles try to tone
your hair first into purple shampoo
don't get this water colors because they
can be a little pricey depending on how
many you get depending on how long your
hair is you may need maybe four five or
six eleven toners so just try the purple
shampoo first if it doesn't work for you
go and purchase the wallet owners from
Sally's Beauty Supply Store the quality
of this wig is still amazing it still
has an actual wave pattern in it and I'm
super excited about a register ended
because I'm about to go out now so I
hope you guys loved the video or if you
thought it was crazy
and the results turned out to be
pleasing give me a thumbs up thank you
so much for watching guys if you're
working with a lot of toner please use
gloves I'm so used to using my hands
with everything doing my hair for such a
long time now I just know what works
best for me so yeah so I hope you guys
enjoy once again and I'll see you in my
next video
