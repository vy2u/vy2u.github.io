channel I am here to share with you guys
this wig that I have on top of my head
so let's jump right into it this wig is
actually from our PG show calm this is
their dope blonde human hair lace front
wig and yes I actually have 20 inches
silky texture 200 percent density pre
plucked light brown lace cap size 1 nude
wig cap actually came with an elastic
band also it has three combs
on the wig it does have an elastic the
two little elastic straps that you can
pull each size so that way it can fit
really snug when I received the wig it
actually came pre-curled pre plucked and
the curls were really loose but they
were really pretty and the hair smells
so good so I was so here for that
fortunately the hair was kind of brittle
towards the ends so I had to go ahead
and cut it and add some layers and then
just so it can suit me really well this
is how I wear the hair now and that's
just because the hair is on the on the
drier side so I like wearing it wet and
I like putting it in a low bun and
that's just mean personally this is what
I was experiencing with RPG Show wig
maybe you guys can check out more
reviews to see if anybody else has
experienced that I know if you try to
take a 1b hair color to a like blonde
color like this it does take a lot and
it does take a lot out of the hair just
to be completely honest with you guys so
I'm not mad at it because I love the
color I love how it's constructed I
loved how it came packaged I love how
they put a lot of effort into the hair
but sometimes it doesn't go well and
that's just up to you if you want to
purchase it or not I'm just sure I'm
just sharing with you guys my experience
with the unit and yeah so there's no
reviews on the website that you can
click on to see like somebody else
letting you guys know about how their
experience was but I do want to let you
guys know on the website the girl hair
looks like a backwards ombre so it looks
like it's light at the top medium and
then darker at the bottom
and when I received the hair I wasn't
getting none of that I've got a
strawberry blonde kind of color you may
not be able to see the strawberry blonde
in this video but I do have another
video that I'm gonna put up and that's
when I first received the hair and
that's how it looked before cutting it
before styling it before doing anything
to it but I just wanted to share share
with you guys what I've been
experiencing I've been having this unit
for almost like a month and some change
and this is what I've been experiencing
I didn't want to put out that video
first I wanted to put out this one first
because I've had the hair for some time
and this is what I'm experiencing with
RPG show wig I didn't want to mislead
you and not give you enough information
in that video to the point that you'll
go ahead and buy it and then you may
experience something and you're not here
for it I'm just letting you guys know
that I have been experiencing shedding
breakage to the point that I have to
wear it in a wet state like this install
it like this and then if it dries on me
then I can deal with it but I can't just
go and apply like a blow-dryer to the
hair and like blow it out and restyle it
because then I'm going to get so much
breakage that is not gonna make any
sense and then I'm just not here for
stuff like that so I like waiting like
this like I said you may have seen it on
my Instagram or my snapchat you guys
know that I still wear the unit this
video is pretty old I recorded maybe
like two weeks ago but you know I'm here
for the for the video still so I'm just
expunging sharing with you guys what's
going on but I'm gonna let you watch
what's what I'm doing on the self
explanitory
I just added some holding spray so the
lace so it can hold the lace down and it
won't move on me I like making my units
really really secure so I just used my
salon graphics Tim max holding spread
just to get the lace to lay down how I
want it to the combs are placed in a
really good area so you can make sure
that the wig isn't going anywhere just
by tucking the combs underneath your wig
cap and that's pretty much it so I'll
let you guys enjoy the rest of the video
RPG Show wig information will be in the
description box below
this is the completed look I just want
to thank you guys so much for you know
being here watching this video if you
made it to the end I just want to say I
appreciate you guys so freaking much I
hope you guys enjoyed this video
don't forget to check out our PG show
RPG show wing comm in the description
box I do want to show you guys how they
here with the package it came in this
cute little sweet box right here it's
kind of dusty because I've been using it
for other things I hope to say other
things on top of it but it came with wig
caps it did come with instructions on
how to finesse your mates to make it
look natural it also came with a cute
little book and it also came with an
elastic band once again it does have
three cones and it has the elastic
little straps to make it fit snug but
you could just use this as well just to
give it a texture and she felt like to
do so yes so make sure you check him out
honey make sure you check them out I was
really really really digging this awake
how this package had this smell it came
with a net and it was awkward like it
came with a net and it was also a
pre-curled I'll put a picture of the
hair probably looked it looked just like
how the girl has it in the picture but
you know Tatiana's always doing
something different to make it look you
know a little bit better on myself so
that's what you have to understand about
wigs like you don't even have to wear
and how we come straight you know out of
the box you could finesse it you can
wash it you can air dry to see the
natural pattern you can um currently or
anything like that
when I did first receive when I first
received this unit I actually wanted to
curl it like recurrently how I wanted to
but the dead end was preventing me from
getting that look
was going for so I just wanted to redo
the video just to show you guys that you
don't have to wear just how it came and
you can make it look really really good
a different kind of style so thank you
RPG show for sending me this unit like I
said their information will be listed in
the description box below thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you
babies in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
