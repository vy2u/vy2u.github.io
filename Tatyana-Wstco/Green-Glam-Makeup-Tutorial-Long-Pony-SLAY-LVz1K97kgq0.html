ochre Paint Pot eyeshadow I forgot what
this is called I want to say it's like
creme brulee yep
used to color kind of it and it was like
there detect any out covers any other
color that you may have hacking on your
lids first and then start going up to
that crease so directing it in that area
and not blowing it out I kind of want
this look and more rounded love versus
any more blown out look to make sure
this is showing honey so I'll bring it
up as much as you can but don't bring it
all the way up past that little mustard
yellow of it I'm gonna make sure
centricity is the same
Oh
again I'm trying lead us to play baby I
want to get it on and
Michael's arts and crafts and it looks
like fits it's like some pretty and
stuff so that's what you see inside of
my eye and then I just use the lip liner
to fill in my lips and outline my lips
and this is BJ cat to roll in it up Auto
eyeliner but I use it as a lip liner and
this is in the color we're just going to
say the color green because I'll see the
name I used my new - Marc Jacobs
foundation in the shade cocoa medium and
perfect shades was using the laura
mercier candle glow foundation but that
should make my skin look like a hot mess
so I went aboard that were today and I
really do like this one I can already
tell if nothing like the cannibal Laura
Murphy because why I am NOT seeping sir
I Spit my snow foundation and stuff and
I'm still not looking oily with you know
I actually wanted to highlight with this
book but I think I Kondo do because I
feel like my natural glow is just
shining through life if you know you
need to highlight for this and guess
what another dramatic epic fail
for this video I do not have any
settings for tight line with my nude
liner and just put my in a suction cup
little kick for my skin and I set my
face with mom in her last gift finish
dark sweet powder how I would make it
half-baked and on my nose and I
contoured with my black radiance contour
palette in the medium dark using the
sculpting shade in the contour shade
these two oh yeah so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video very simple very easy
I hope you guys took something from it I
try to explain to you guys but my mom
ended up calling me
which made me not be able to finish so
in the toaster with you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
