how I customize my little bangs for miss
Luba hair this is a unit from them has
four combs stress and it's this really
snug this is a cap size small so don't
think like this will be everyday like I
can deal with bangs in my face this is
definitely fitting the nice kind of seal
vibe because I kind of have like this
grungy like cross black and gold dress
one but I got inspired because I didn't
want to put lashes on for this makeup
look that I have currently and why not
throw some bangs in your hair if you
know what it where lashes so that's kind
of where I was going with this look and
I didn't want to blunt I didn't want it
like perfect I wanted to look like rock
so I'm going to look kind of rock stars
like you know so long if you're going to
get this one for any kind of rocks
orientations but you're going to be
going to in the future please continue
to left handed I'm not going to just try
to make these bangs really quick if you
guys want to see this makeup video I
mean moving up if you guys want to see
how i got this makeup look check out my
previous video for miss lewis in that
video i show you guys the same unit and
i also share this makeup look with you
guys so check that out but i'm just
going to try to get these choppy bangs
and i was thinking about because i think
that's what i want to do and i know if
this turned out really good and i'm did
this off of camera you guys are going to
kill me so that's why i'm just going to
do this really quick on camera so I like
my bangs to be really thin I don't
really like full bangs on me so that's
why I'm kind of keeping the triangle
really small that I'm making myself and
you can even go smaller than this and
you always want to start small they're
triangles you always want to start with
smaller triangles just in case you mess
up and you have too much hair after you
let the bangs go trust me I learned my
lesson in the past when I was trying to
get myself bangs plenty of times and not
always felt like it always turned out
like so we're not going to try to
make it that way today so bear with me I
don't have
my my shears with me I mean my razor
with me at my mom's house so let's see
what we can do with the rest of the
scissors that I found here
so once again I want a choppy look I
don't want perfect straight bangs so
that's why I want the end to come up
with like this and by the way let me
give you some bank information on this
hair this is miss Lula hair and I will
leave their information in the
description box of course but I really
will fill in this wig in the straight
part but just so you guys can try
different techniques or styles on you
I'm just going to show you how to do
this because I know this is going to
look really cute with this unit just
because this unit is pretty choppy in
itself already in the back so I feel
like the front would look really cute if
I had some choppy bang so that's why I
decided just to do the bangs today so as
you can see that's what I meant by
keeping the triangle small because when
you let it go it's going to expand if
that's a good word to use for hair and
you don't want your bangs to be really
thick well I know I don't but you can
make your bangs really thick if you want
to but that's not the look that I like
when I do things for myself these pieces
on the side I'm just going to make them
longer so when I have my hair like this
it's not going to be all in my face like
it is right now so I hope you guys
enjoyed because this is definitely what
I was looking to do so I'm going to just
throw some something more really quick
for the day and I'm going to give you
guys some slow-mo so you guys can see
how the hair actually turned out I'm
probably going to put some mousse on the
bangs just so I can get its life
together and yes enough so like the only
thing that you will have to worry about
when you get a wig is definitely going
with the most at the top to control the
flyaways but
than that this wig is really really nice
the hair is really soft really easy to
maintain once again and really use it to
straighten and get back to you know its
natural state
yeah I love you guys and I'll see you
guys in a second
that's me in June</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
