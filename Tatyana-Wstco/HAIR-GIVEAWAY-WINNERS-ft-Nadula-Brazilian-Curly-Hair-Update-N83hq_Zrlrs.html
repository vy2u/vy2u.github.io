your name's up notorious and then Mei a
egg so you stated that you know you're
super excited to try some brazilian
straight hair from this hair company you
said you love to do this hair but you
never really got a chance to purchase it
it will be such a huge blessing to win
and winning this will be so amazing so
new jiggle would be contacting you make

notorious I believe you're getting 10 12
14 but new doula will be letting you
guys know all that information once you

much for participating so so freaking
much I love you guys so much and I hope
you guys enjoyed the hair but one thing
I have to ask from you is when you
receive the hair please know in this
video how your hair is when you first
receive it also updated comment and also
like your
to show thoughts about Manjula hair just
in case if anybody is interested in
trying some Indian or Brazilian straight
hair from medulla you guys will be very
helpful in those comments section in my
comments section it for those people so
thank you so much again I hope you guys
enjoy this gift and yeah so I want to do
the hair and how it's holding up for me
so of course you know hook up that
Brazilian curly girl and if you are
interested in getting this Brazilian
curly 7a you need to go ahead and get it
because it is so freaking poppin I love
it so much it's so soft it's so easy to
detangle I don't really need to use my
freaking comb or paddle brush at all so
detangle this hair when I put some water
on it and start from coming in from
bottom to top it doesn't give me any
problems at all the conditioner shampoo
that I use with this hair is Guardian
Copeland's shampoo and conditioner I
always rant and rave about that
conditioner on any weave it will make
your weaves super soft so even if you
guys have some weaves that you want to
revamp go ahead and get that shampoo and
conditioner and you will thank me later
trust and believe me you can get it from
your local CVS Walmart Walgreens
anything like that any stores like that
Target but yeah so it doesn't nape about
the back of my neck doesn't shed it
doesn't cause any like matting it
doesn't um what what else can it do
wrong it doesn't do anything wrong I
don't have any cons of office hair so
what I expect from ajumma is to send out
the same quality hair that they send me
because honestly this is some amazing
freakin hair but they're super adamant
about their hair being very awesome and
7/8 hair so I'm not expecting them to
send out anything other than that you
can check their Aliexpress feedback
section where girls all around the world
have rocketed ulla hair that left their
their reviews underneath that feedback
section um just how their hair is
holding up and any remarks that they
want more to say about medulla hair will
be in that feedback section so let's
check a look so make sure you check that
out and also check out any other
youtubers that have rakhna dougas hair
other than me just to get you know your
second
third opinions from people other than
just me but thank you so much for
