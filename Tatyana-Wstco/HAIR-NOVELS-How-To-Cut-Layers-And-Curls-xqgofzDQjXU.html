and today I'll be showing you guys how i
layer my hair these are basically some
frame face layers not too heavy on the
layers at all today I will be having
another video of me showing you guys how
i layer my hair like with a lot of
layers and heavy layers but this is just
basically an effortless tutorial super
easy and I believe you guys will be able
to achieve this look on your own so
let's jump right into it okay so as you
can see I have a few layers at the top
so if you want to go ahead and cut some
layers however long you want your
longest layer to be go ahead and cut
that so that could be your guide I'm
cutting the hair in the angle because
with this look I don't want what's super
heavy layers right now but in the future
I will probably want them but with these
extensions I just don't want to go right
and hit right ahead and cut deep heavy
layers in them so I'm just doing angled
layers and this technique that I do when
I do not want heavy layers I did my
cutting techniques so unusual this day I
usually section off my hair and start
cutting that way but I believe it was
because I knew that I didn't want to cut
major layers in my hair today and I
actually just wanted to focus on framing
my face so like I said I will hopefully
get this um super heavy layered tutorial
up for you guys whenever I actually want
to do heavy layers with the hair but if
anyone is interested my hair is from a
company called blue ribbon hair company
it's in their brazilian loose wave range
and it's in the mid to 28 and to 26 I
also have a discount code for you ladies
to use if you're interested and that
will be at the end of this video
and right here I was just showing you
guys how long the hair actually is and
if you see the shorter piece I'm going
to cut the longest piece up to the
shortest piece and now I'm looking for
any imperfections in how I layered the
hair when I'm combing the hair through
everything should fall in place how I
want it and I'm actually just going
through to make sure I got all the
pieces that I want to cut into layers
into layers and yeah so right here I'm
showing you guys how I actually like
having the bottom part of my hair as
even as possible just because when it's
straighten I don't want anything uneven
so now I'm done with my layers and now
it's time to just go ahead and throw
some curls in there because I know you
guys are probably wanting to see me curl
my hair now after putting the layers in
to see how the finish results will look
when I have my hair curled so we're
going to just go ahead and do that I'm
just using a regular Conair one-inch
curling iron it gets super hot it does
the job it does be good I lost my gold
curling iron I don't know where the hell
it went but it's okay because this is
always the old faithful and I'm just
curling my hair away from my face I was
he doing this throughout the video make
sure you pay attention to how I do the
day because I do a little different kind
of technique I actually curl it towards
my face instead of away from my face and
then I brush it back with a comb so I'm
going to let you guys enjoy the rest of
it and I hope to see you guys in my next
video please don't forget to thumbs up
