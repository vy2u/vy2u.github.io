another video and today I have in my
units hair I'm gonna start off by
customizing my frontal and I'm going to
style the hair towards the end of the
video but all their information will be
in the description box below so I'm
going to part where I want my baby hairs
to lay on this frontal and then I'm
going to take my salon graphics 10 max
holding spray and I'm going to spray
that on my edges as well as my baby
hairs and then I'm going to take my blow
dryer and blow-dry that area so it can
be tacky and then I'm gonna place my
frontal right on top of that after that
I'm gonna take my comb and press that in
and then I'm going to take my blow dryer
while pressing my comb still on my
frontal and I'm going to blow-dry that
area completely so it can be completely
dry and secure I'm gonna do that to the
other side as well as the front and
that's pretty much it well I'm gonna
start tweezing my baby hairs and taking
the density out of the other side of the
frontal and I'm going to stab the hair
with my cunny air21 curling iron slash
flat iron and flexi Rob the hair and
then I'm gonna take them down and voila
and that's pretty much all I'm gonna be
doing I wanted to explain to you ladies
what I was doing in the beginning oh my
god babes I almost forgot to mention
