guys about my hair and this hair is from
you glam it's a nice breast hair company
and I'll have all the direct links in
the description box if you're interested
in purchasing from this hair company or
getting the exact same textures and ones
that I have so I have to 26 to 24 of the
texture Brazilian deep curly so I have a
frontal and four bundles in my head 20
inch frontal - 26 to 24 in the bundles
so I do have a con about this hair and
I'm just going to start with the
comforts because the rest are pros so
the column that I have with this hair is
I can tell that this is not the same
texture so but I did my water method
just to see if the curl pattern will
revert back to its actual texture that
it's stating on the website which is
deep curly and the frontal dead but the
bundles didn't this is how the bundles
look and this is how the frontal looks I
don't know if you can really tell on
camera but I will take a picture so you
can see the difference but if it's not a
problem for you I would say go ahead and
get these bundles because the rest are
pros like I said but the hair is really
soft it's really easy to maintain it
doesn't have a bad smell at all and I
get a ton of compliments on this hair
but it doesn't share the less I'm
probably detangle in the front so are
the bundles just because how long the
lengths are the less amount of shedding
while detangling you need to start from
bottom to top when you're detangling
your hair and probably do it with a Y to
comb or something versus a paddle brush
so you can get the exact same feel that
I did I actually did and washed his hair
with some conditioner and I really love
how soft and amazing this hair is so I
put the front saw up just so you can see
the bundles a little bit more I really
want you guys to not take away from the
quality of this hair just because the
front load really doesn't match the
bundles because these bundles and this
frontal is really beautiful hair and the
that it's a wedding bill situation like
deep wave or deep curling we're
expecting it to be the exact same
texture because when we wet it and we
can actually leave out and look
phenomenal we don't have to do too much
manipulation at all
but just let me know how you feel about
this hair I've had you like churning
your hair or curling your hair I'm
putting a lot of heating appliances
through your hair maybe you can stick to
this frontal just because when you do a
lot of heating appliances on hair you
start losing your actual wave pattern
other than that check out their
feedbacks on their actual website they
have a lot of girls I actually brought
this hair so check their reviews out
just to see how their experience was
with their new glam dude curly or with
other textures that they decided to get
so thank you so much for watching don't
forget the thumbs up comment subscribe
let me know what you want to see next
with this hair in the comment section
below show you a curl they inherit
whatever just let me know so thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye
so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
