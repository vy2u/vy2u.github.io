and I'm super excited to share this
video with you guys because I got a new
way from best place away and guess what
it's a new style that is by the kid so
you guys know that lose curly wig that
I'm transform the hair to a new style in
that video how it came and I made it
like my own type of style because I
liked how it looked in that video but I
just know that I'm not a big coyly type
of curled hair style type of girl if
that makes sense so I wanted to do
something that was very wearable for me
they made a new wig that looks just like
how I transform that loose curly wig and
it's a permanent style on their website
so I'm so excited about that that's
super cool it just says how kind of
Westco hair inspired wig but the actual
like style number of the wig is SW 170
and it's a virgin brazilian hair it's a
hundred and fifty percent density and
it's 16 inches and the cap size that I
received is capsized 0 9 it's a lace
front wig and yeah so I was really
excited to get this new so I'm going to
leave the link in the description box
below so if you guys if you guys want to
purchase this wig
you can go ahead and do so so this is
how the Box looks it just says best lace
wigs professional hair manufacturer 100%
human hair with a portable price and
yeah so I am excited so this is how I
received wig it looks like this and I'm
super excited that they decided to make
this a Brazilian type of way because you
guys know that I'm all about Brazilian
hair it's just my favorite type of hair
texture when it comes to virgin hair I
did receive wig caps from them and these
are the brown ones and of course these
come with too and I have a return form
policy if you don't like it and you want
something new just fill out this form
but please do not cut the lace off the
wigs because they will not accept if you
cut anything any layers in it if you cut
the lace off of it if you try to snip
something if you try to bleach something
just don't put
try the hair on straight out of the pack
with the lace horn and see if you like
it so I'm going to put this um wig on
I'm going to come right back and see how
you guys still about it and I'm gonna
give you guys my honest opinion let's
see if it looks like what I created in
that last video so I'll be right back
it's like you see it doesn't even lift
up if I like until I pull it up like
this but it doesn't go anywhere if
there's really stuck on my head so cap
size 0 9 is definitely like my perfect
cap size like the combs are not stabbing
me in my head this is the wig cap that I
have underneath it and yeah so let me go
and cut this lace off and I'll be right
back it's like their stylist nailed this
hairstyle so I'm really happy about that
so I'm gonna take some pictures so I can
share with you guys this look on my
Instagram it's so soft
I'm trying to like comb the curls out
with my hands and it doesn't go anywhere
so I really love that I just created us
a little thick baby hairs for myself and
put like some of my concealer in my part
so I can kind of look a little bit more
natural I'm sure I'm going to mess with
this hair a little bit more in the
future but I just wanted to share with
you guys how it looks if you were if you
were interested in purchasing this wig
once again is a permanent style on their
website let me know how you feel about
it ladies all their information would be
listed in the description box below so
