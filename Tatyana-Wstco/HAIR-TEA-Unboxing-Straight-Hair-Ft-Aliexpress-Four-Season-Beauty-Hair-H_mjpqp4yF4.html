video and I'm super excited to get this
hair video up for you guys because I
have some more straight hair to share
with you ladies I'm going to most likely
be doing a color with this straight hair
just because I just received some other
stray hairs I've been rocking and I just
wanted to be able to have you guys know
which one is which and probably just
like do like a strip of a blonde
somewhere in the hair not really sure
I'm not really trying to dye the full
thing a certain color even though I'm
really into just trying to do some rose
gold hair because I know a lot of you
told me that you want me to try to do a
rose gold color but you know it's fall
and I'm not really trying to do anything
crazy too too crazy
if anything I'm thinking about doing
like a rusty like a rusty like orange
color like you know houses a hair cover
looks like cezzah if you guys know who
says it is like the artist I was going
to do since his hair on a different type
of curly hair but I do not like that
here anymore so I was like huh you know
jump right into the hair video now but
hello and nice to see you again and
thank you for always coming back and
supporting me and clicking on my channel
just just to see what I have going on
that's new so thank you so much for
watching and let's begin maybe like four
bundles for this hair company or three I
believe it yeah it's just three and this
is 20 inches over here so this is how
you will be receiving hair from forces
and beauty hair I'm really excited about
this hair company because I just been
sharing the things about this hair
companies helpful
hopefully this is some good hair so this
is basically just a little like card
that's having all their information on
there it says you get thirty dollars if
you like do a YouTube video Instagram
post a Facebook post and if you 5-star
this hair company it has some hair care
instructions on the car so you can check
that out so alright so let's go
so as you can see I have some more
flexing rise you guys know I'm excited
about these flexi rods now just because
I'm getting so many and I can always do
videos with these bad boys so I have
four bundles not three bundles cool so
all of these are three inches and all of
them look like this oh no no no I do
have three bundles three bundles and a
Sprunt so from this hair company yeah
that's why I had three bundles because I
did get a front row so this is how the
hair looks um it's falling to the top of
my booty I'm sorry five for it I haven't
really never freaking sells every time I
do every video I said it already oh okay
every time I do a video I was trying to
say review in a video at the same time
something always happens so in the midst
of me blabbing on and not checking the
back to see if my video or my camera was
still recording it cut off right as I'm
trying to open all these bundles and
give you guys my first impressions and
my first thoughts and letting you guys
know how I feel about the hair it cuts
off but we're going to get into these
bundles without the unraveling part but
I'm still gonna stick to my gut and my
initial feelings when I first arrived
with this hair so I'm just gonna show
you all of the bundles now plus the
front zone so okay I don't even know
what happened to the sunlight it looks
like it's about to rain so out of
nowhere so I just had to turn my lights
on so if I look a little different
because of that these are all of the
bundles that I received from or season
Beauty hair really easy to run my
fingers through really soft that was my
first initial thought but did I start
looking at the you know hair and I
started seeing a lot of these flyaways
going towards the bottom and like I was
telling you guys about how I wanted to
bleach this hair to get that rusty
orange color I'm not gonna be doing that
because I don't want to mess up any of
the hair I don't want to cause any
damage up in here I don't want to do
anything crazy or to enhance these
flyaways so I won't be dying this hair
into that rusty orange color what I will
be doing is dying this hair blue-black
it's like a natural black or maybe
unnatural brow
color in this light I see a lot of brown
but you may see like a natural black
color I'm going to do the blue-black on
this hair and it's going to have to be
just that this is basically what I'm
getting out of all of these three
bundles it has a lot of hair on these
bundles so I feel like you're you're
good with three bundles if you get
twenty inches but if you go anything
past that maybe try to get four so yeah
so let's talk about this frontal so I
did receive a 360 frontal from this hair
company and I totally forgot about that
so first time I ever seen a 360 frontal
looking like this let me know if you've
seen a 360 frontal looking like this but
the previous 360 frontal that I worked
with actually was laced all the way
around look like this all the way around
at the top part I had Josh strings that
you can pull and fit really snug around
your head so this one is like this is
the first time I'm ever seeing a 360
front of looking like this it's just
like us like a tiny elastic band and
it's not like the hair is not glued on
at all it's actually in this elastic
band so I think that was pretty I
thought that was pretty neat when I
first saw that you wouldn't saw like how
cool I thought that was but hopefully
this fits pretty snug on my head because
if it doesn't I'm not sure exactly what
I'm going to do that's why I feel like I
probably would like the JA strings a
little bit better because I can make it
fit tight or like in if this doesn't fit
tight on my head I don't exactly know
what I'm gonna be doing but I'm gonna
let you guys know about all that
information in my update review for this
hair company I still get flyaways in
this one too towards the bottom but at
the top if you see a lot of them is just
because it's the baby hairs that they
already have on this frontal
so that's pretty much all I wanted to
share with you ladies about this hair I
don't get any foul smell with this hair
at all but I did actually go on the
feedback section on there for season I
expressed psyche and I saw that a girl
actually said that they that she did
receive like a distinct smell with her
virgin hair but I'm not receiving that
so that's why I always tell you guys to
do more research before you purchase
your hair or thinking about purchasing
from a hair company that I'm telling you
guys about because other people can
experience different things but I'm
receiving something different
also so just keep getting like a second
or third or fourth opinion if you
actually rocked four-season beauty hair
let me know in the comment section down
below so other people can hear how your
experience was with this hair company as
well just remember I am your guinea pig
I'm here to you know go through the good
and the bad and the ugly before you have
to go and spend your pretty penny on
some hair you give them sand so if I get
some back here I'm gonna let you guys
know some back here if it's some bad
hair I'm not even going to basically
review the hair like if I already like
go and check out their eye Express
website and it's just nothing but
negative things in the feedback section
I will not I wouldn't I won't agree with
a hair review it's just not gonna happen
I felt like Aliexpress also step their
game up because I have been getting so
many gems on Aliexpress so don't sleep I
will always say do your research and
actually try to go on youtube and search
some good Aliexpress hair companies and
maybe I should do a video on my favorite
Aliexpress hair companies so far since
I've been working with Aliexpress and
also always make sure you check if check
their return policy situation because
you want to make sure if you're not
getting something that you want like you
need to be able to return them because
I'm all here for somebody getting their
money's worth you get them saying like
I'm not here for you guys to be out
there getting gypped for your money or
me receiving something and then when you
go to order some hair it's not this same
exact quality but I just want to thank
you guys for watching I appreciate you
always coming back to see what's going
on with tatianna and I really do hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and if you guys really
do want me to do the recipe orange color
let me know I'll try to still do it but
if you understand where I'm coming from
with the flyaways let me know if you
guys want to see the blueblack with this
hair but either way it's not like a
really huge difference we're not have to
lift the hair because I only have it
lift the hair like a smidge since I do
want the rest the orange color but the
blue black dye would just be me just
dyeing the hair person to me having to
bleach the hair so let me know what you
want just depends on how you guys feel
and yeah don't forget the thumbs up like
come and subscribe and tell me guys and
tell me your thoughts about this hair
ladies I'll see you guys in my next
video bye
oh and all the links will be in the
description box below if you're
interested in purchasing from this hair
company see you some time
you guys know why I'm going to be doing
a round brush review for a tutorial on
how I do my brown brush curls because I
haven't done that in so long and I got
me a poppet as a round brush I stated
this in my other video of mine and I
really do like this brush and I want to
do some awesome curls blowout curls with
this I just freaking bought a nozzle
that does not fix my blow-dryer it's
right here like it doesn't feel my
blow-dryer and I spent money on this and
it's not even helpful like what the
am I gonna do with this now anyway I
should just want the size beauty supply
store and found a blow dryer and that
already has the nozzle attachment
because my blow dryer is getting ratchet
at this point my flat iron is not
ratchet it would never be ratchet to me
because you see how fabulous these curls
look right now I did it with that flat
iron slash curling iron okay girlfriend
I'm just rambling on because I love you
guys and you guys are my friends and I'm
gonna talk to you guys like you're my
friends so you have to listen to me or
you can just give to the in this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
