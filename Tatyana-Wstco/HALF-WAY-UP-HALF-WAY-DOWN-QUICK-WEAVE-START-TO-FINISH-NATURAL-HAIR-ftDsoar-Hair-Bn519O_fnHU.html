another video today I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to create this halfway up
halfway down quick weave I'm using my
destroyer hair from Aliexpress you can
use any hair that you want you just need
to make sure you prepare your hair
before you start this process make sure
you raise your hair up you wash it good
and you know you put the oils that you
need to put in there you need to
stocking caps and you need some bundles
of course and you also need some
scissors and a white marker like guide
you where you need to stop putting your
tracks and where you need to begin your
tracks so that's basically that and so
you're just going to measure your weft
to your head so to see how long you need
it to be and that's pretty much how
simple this process is towards the top
you're going to start doing it like you
know a more curved effect to your tracks
because you don't want them straight on
because you're gonna have to start
cutting really really tiny pieces if you
do just continue making them straight
across this is a really super easy style
especially for somebody like me because
I've been doing this on myself for a
very very long time but and on others
this is how I first started getting into
hair because girls in my high school
used to always ask me to do their hair
and this is the style that I usually
would do for them but this is when
invisible parts were out but anyway so
the main question that I got from you
guys was like how is this even able to
stay on your head well you are getting
glue on your hair but because I used to
stocking caps it's not as much as if I
was to use one this is a quick way so
you know that's the whole point is just
a quick style you do need to secure your
hair you know you can do the molding
method if you want to but I just don't
like all that product on my natural hair
how about removed this is by just using
shampoo and conditioner i drench my head
in water and then I just literally allow
it to marinate on my head for a little
bit and then the moisture from the
conditioner and the shampoo just like
loosens up everything and it literally
slides right off don't go pulling at
anything if you feel like you know
you're struggling with getting some of
the pieces off you know just go in with
a little bit more conditioner going with
a little bit more conditioner and just
like massage it through your head and
then use a wide tooth comb to get any
extra gunk out of your hair that you may
have but this is not a everyday style
you can't keep doing this to your
every single day or you will cause
problems it will be easier if you like
this look and you just want to go ahead
and slow it down because it's a little
bit more secure and it's gonna last a
lot longer
a quick leave is only gonna last maybe
for three to four days depending on your
everyday life if you go out you know
party in and you sweat a lot in your
head this is just not gonna work for you
more than you know two or three days but
if you know how to wrap your hair at
night and you're really good I just you
know just being a princess then it may
last you maybe like a week or so but
anyway that's how simple that is I think
that pretty much touches all the main
questions that you guys may have and
yeah so what you don't see me doing is
blow-drying each piece now you should do
that if this is like your first time
doing this but I wait to the end because
I just don't have time to be picking up
and putting down the blow-dryer now if I
wasn't recording a video I probably
would but it's just too much to try to
do all of this and record it at the same
time this video was literally 20 minutes
long it took me only 20 minutes to do
this but of course it doesn't look like
it cuz it's sped up in certain spots but
yeah so I also want to let you guys know
that you need to leave enough here at
the top you need to leave enough hair
out at the top where you are able to use
some of that hair to cover your lash
track at the back of your hair if that
makes sense so even though you know
you're gonna have all of this fullness
from the weave you also need to have
some of your hair out to cover the last
track because you don't want anything to
be showing so you're gonna see me do
that in a second
but right now I'm just using the blow
dryer just to make sure everything is
secure and laying how I needed to and
it's just going to make everything feel
like you know it's in place like you
need it to be so I'm just gonna use some
scissors just to cut off the remaining
of the stocking cap and you just need to
be really careful with this part I would
suggest you guys go ask somebody else to
do this for you because you do not want
to cut any of your hair trust me you
don't want to do that so yeah if you
don't have a really close mirror are you
just not good at doing something like
this just go ask somebody else but you
just need to cut it as close as possible
to the last track at the top because you
don't want anything peak
through like a stocking cap you can
create peeking through because I'm not
gonna be like girl what the what is that
like you got pantyhose in your head but
yeah so that's that and I'm just gonna
use another bundle so that was pretty
much two bundles in the bag and then
this is a third bundle that I'm using
for the top half of the hair because we
need this have to be looking as full as
the back obviously now me being an idiot
I decided that I wanted to pick up the
wrong bundle I picked up their body
weight bundle by accident but yeah I
mean it still worked well because it was
the same hair company's hair so the
quality wasn't any different this hair
is super soft and nice and full and just
you know it's perfect for a style like
this so I just decided that I wanted to
go ahead and just make the top a little
bit fuller about adding some of the
third bundle that I have from this
company I actually got four bundles but
I didn't want to use the fourth bundle I
may want to use the fourth bundle for
another ponytail style or something like
that so yeah but I'm just going to wrap
it around enough where I feel like it's
full enough and I need enough that I
could take some of that hair to do that
little band method around this ponytail
vibe if you're feeling the vibe here if
you're if you're getting what I'm trying
to say and this is just going to secure
the ponytail look and also make sure
that there's no track showing so here's
what I'm talking about so you see I'm
taking that piece and I'm wrapping it
around trying to see how thick I want it
it's definitely your preference you know
some people like going all out but I
like trying to make mine look a little
bit more reasonable so I don't use that
much hair but you do need enough so it
doesn't get hidden in the track if that
makes sense so yeah so just watch this
and I'm going to use a little bit of
hairspray just to smooth everything out
so you know there's no weirdness going
on and I was just smacking up on that
gum I would never chew gum in a video
again because I was looking like a
little cow just ratchet ratchet ratchet
but I'm just using my hair to brush to
just smooth everything out now you can
see the hair in its natural state the
top is body wave from D soar and the
bottom is natural wave from these lures
so whatever here you like you know girl
it will be linked in the description box
below if you are interested to get
bundles from them I'm just gonna put a
little bit of layers at the top because
I knew that I was going to style it
because I messed up and used the wrong
bundle for the top so now I was kind of
definitely forced to style this hair for
you guys but that's good because you'll
know that it holds a really nice curl so
as you can see I was just playing with a
trying to see what I was trying to go
forward do I want Flatiron curls or do I
want my Hot Tools one and a half inch
curls and I went with this look because
this look made me happy so we listed in
the description box below if you aren't
interested to purchase them they are
from old so you can get both of these
from Ulta and that's pretty much it
ladies like this how simple this is
there's no rocket science behind it you
just need to make sure oh the main thing
says when you are placing your tracks on
your head you need to make sure that
they're lining up with each other you do
not want stair steps with these tracks
because if you do stair steps when you
go and cut off the remaining lace I mean
a wig cap it will cause all this honky
that's going on and it's just not gonna
look as clean as you need it to look and
it may cause the style to last less than
even a day so be be really really
careful and make sure you you know pay
attention to that line your line your
tracks up really really important so
yeah
the removing process I just use shampoo
and conditioner to you know get it off
my head i drench my head in water and
then I just kind of like you know put my
head upside down and like pour some
shampoo on like the nape of my neck or
the size or whatever parts that I can
just feel that it's
was about that time you know that it's
coming up or loosening up I definitely
focus on those parts first and then I go
into like Charlie like you know have it
marinate on there just a little bit and
then I just use my wives who've comb if
I feel like there's any pieces of glue
left in my hair after taking this off
and the cool thing about this you're
you're gonna feel like you're able to
reuse it because the wefts are still
going to be attached to the wig cap and
well if that happens to you that always
happens for me but yeah and you're like
oh my god like can I put this back on my
head but you really can't so don't even
try it
but you may be able to take the you know
tracks off of the wig cap and reuse them
if that's your thing but honestly you
can just get some more bundles from the
beauty supply store and just finish this
look again but I love you guys I hope
you guys enjoyed and disor hair
