with you guys how I lay down my frontals
I wanted to talk to you guys about this
hair because I will be styling this hair
in this video - so this is hair from a
hair company by the name of Long Key
hair I don't know exactly how to
pronounce it but it's long and then this
Qi and then this is their Malaysian body
waves in - 24 to 26 and a 20-inch
frontal so I'm going to take the hair
down but I just want you guys to focus
on the frontal part really quick so what
I do to lay my frontals down some hair
spray honestly so this is a wig that I
created with this hair this hair is
holding up really awesome I really do
like this hair but we're going to show
you guys how to get this done made of
wig so I'm going to put pull the frontal
all the way up here so then I'm going to
part I'm going to part it and then this
is the hairspray that I use to lay it
down this is the professional freezing
hairspray from salon graphics and you
can find this from Walmart or Target
wears not buy this from I bought this
from Walmart but you can probably find
it at Target - that's it on the hair you
can press it down so I'm going to use
this so you can do it just like this and
then what you can also do is blow-dry
this section right here you can put the
blow-dryer or cool or warm it doesn't
have to be like scorching hot
so look at that you can't pull it but I
don't want to pull it too hard yet
because I still wanted to leg so that's
how it's going to look and then you can
do this side too like this part because
this part is already intact with this
pulled this down a little bit more like
right here and then same thing part the
hair right in there
use your cone press it down
and then blow-dry
another section part their hair blow-dry
the space now I've already plucked the
frontal so you can watch the video that
I show how to pluck off front so I'm
going to do another one a more in-depth
one but I'll put the link in the
description box of the other little
frontal quick frontal slay video that I
did for you guys press it down you can
comb the hair roundish so you don't have
a lot of hairspray in it but it really
doesn't matter to me because it's in
like a parted area
pull this down and then spray in the
parted area
blow it out
and that's that so we're going to do
this side and I'm probably going to
speed this side up because I've already
explained to you what I'm doing you can
part some more spots just so you can
feel a little bit more secure even up
here you can spray down my hair is in a
in four braids one brain right here two
braids right here and one braid right
here or sometimes I don't even bring my
hair I just put my hair in the ponytail
so that's that you see that
oh but I forgot to comb and comb it then
you see how pretty this hair is I love
it you're going to see it in a second
so now you can part it up here is it
getting okay
I'm going to flip down like that right
like that well comb it out don't forget
to comb it out because you don't want
any product to be really stuck on the
hair
let that get very dry put it another one
just like baby here's I guess given I'm
trying to say so make sure you focus on
this part so it can stain really flat
and then comb it out so doesn't you know
be all over the hair and then pull it
out
all right so now we can like focus back
up here a little bit more you see this
part is a little bit still loose
so part these areas spray
and then where your baby hairs are a
little space that you created for your
baby hairs put the spray on you on there
like you see this area right here
break that down so look it's stuck well
the top
see not going anywhere okay that's my
brother trying to pull my hair so I hope
you guys like this little quick how I
lay my frontal slang I'm sure that's
what I'm going to call this one to
already tweeze this frontal but I'll
list the other frontal video that I have
in the description box below so you can
check that out this is long geez
Malaysian body wave hair and having
tried Malaysian hair in a very very long
time but oh here's my brush but I really
do like it I feel like it's lightweight
I feel like it's still giving me my fave
type of texture which is Brazilian like
anything Brazilian it's not too dramatic
it's not stiff it's not hard to like
detangle it doesn't give me any shedding
it's really pretty in the back you can
to see it's a wave where it's coming in
at I was just you know coming out and
messing up the top the front so that's
kind of why the constraint so I'm going
to leave all their information in the
description box below if you're
interested in purchasing from this hair
company their frontal is really poppin I
really do like it it's a great density I
think it's beautiful freaking hair it's
really soft
I'll just share with you guys the ends I
feel like you could still trim some of
this off I really do think so um I do
have all four bundles in from this hair
company so y'all and of course you can
you know you know flick your baby hairs
down if you want to I'll show you guys
how that looks if you want to do that um
motherhood hairs are pretty are pretty
long still on this wig but it's still
going to be okay
this way love you guys see you soon bye
oh my god lipstick on my teeth
there's this girl she was hopefully you
can't say that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
