and today I have in my age of grace
straight hair I told you guys that I was
going to review this hair really soon
because I was rocking the body waves in
the straight hair at the same time
pretty much you guys know that I make
wigs for myself so I can pop one off and
put the next one on so I wanted to make
sure the quality was the same with both
um hair textures even though there are
different textures this is the Brazilian
straight and then the other one is the
Brazilian body wave I think both of them
have the same quality you guys know that
I love Brazilian body wave hair and I
just feel like it fits me soothes me and
it also blends in with my edges or if I
ever want to have any leave out it
blends really good with my hair so
that's why I'm always gravitating some
Brazilian hair but anyway I'm going to
be straightening this hair today I do
have it braided at the top because I
don't want the hair down in my face at
all I'm going to end up wrapping
straightening this part and then
wrapping it around
please don't my nail broke today and I
do not even know how it lifts the whole
nail just popped off so I have to go to
the nose shop after this so I have to
speed this process up because I have no
appointment but anyway I was rocking it
like literally straight out of the pack
I didn't cut wash it at all I go wash it
maybe last week and I've been wearing it
like this for some time now because I
feel like it gives like a really natural
like looking appearance so I didn't mind
wearing me like this and it's still
really softens don't get like that at
all and I really love it so I feel like
this is a lot of hair for 26 inches I do
have four bundles of 26 in and a 20 inch
frontal I have all the bundles in so all
that links will be in the description
box below plus their body weight hair
because I also review that one you can
check that one out it was the Kim K
inspired wave tutorial so you guys can
check that video out and see which one
you like do you like the body wave do
you like the straighter let me know in
the comments section either in this
video or that video let's get started
alright
I'm going to actually blow-dry the hair
just a little bit so during the
straightening process it doesn't take so
long and I'm just going to use my paddle
brush to do that it's like so much hair
but it's so pretty and that's why I was
loving it
all right so I'm going to use my flat
iron slash curling iron you guys know I
really don't know the exact name to this
because it has no name on it but it's
from Connie air and it's the two and one
the the curling iron and straightening
arm you guys only only know that because
one of my studies found out the
information for me so thank you always
I'm not applying any serum or any
hairspray or anything like that to the
hair because I want to see how well it
strands without all of that stuff
so what I do usually is I take big
chunks and then I start straightening it
and then after like getting it to like
the desired straightness that I want at
first then I go in with smaller pieces
and then I strains smaller pieces of the
hair I didn't want to stray in my braids
because then it would have been like
really like annoying to try to braid it
because the hair would have been so
straight but I am going to straight the
ends of it and then I'm probably going
to braid it all the way to give me that
braid it flower crown or that braided
crown that was talking to you guys about
so that's how nice that looks
I'm going to go in with my poem also
I'm just chasing my phone with it with
the flat iron
and then what I also do is I take my
brush with hella bristles on it this
small annoying brush that I got for my
baby splash dollar and then I chased my
hair with this brush too
so that's basically what I do and I love
not putting any serums on the hair
because the hair already has like an
amazing luster to it so if I go and put
like a really oily product in here it's
just going to start looking stringy the
hair is going to start breaking apart or
either sticking together and then it's
just going to look like baby doll hair
and I don't want that because more let's
start seeing that the hair starts to
look oily or anything like that I have
to go and wash the hair like I can't
walk around like that and I don't think
you should either
it's just like your real hair if your
real hair starts getting oily aren't you
going to wash it too so let's watch is
how that's how I treat my virgin hair
just like my bro hair if I don't do a
lot too if I don't other than putting
heat on it like if I don't put a lot of
heat on my virgin hair but I will put a
little bit more heat more in virgin hair
versus my hair so yeah alright so i
zoomed out so you guys can see me and
this process a little bit more so I'm
going to take a bigger chunk run my flat
iron through it first
he's like stretch it
oh you guys like my shirt these are my
westcote mom shirts that's going to be
coming out soon so you guys can purchase
them
I'm so excited that's the W for the
Westco and then mop is down here and it
has pink coffin nails that I love I'll
let you guys know about these crew necks
I have hoodies and I have baseball tees
and I have v-necks and stuff like that
so I'll be showing you guys that in the
near future I'm just trying to fill out
how I want to do that video first
because I do want to have two different
type of hairstyles in the video and I
want my boyfriend or my cousin to record
me I don't want to do it all by myself
and I actually want to be out somewhere
recording that video so um if you guys
follow me on my Instagram you probably
already see me rocking these my stuff
already in my pink hair and in the corn
bed that I was in so you can check that
out on my Instagram I'll probably insert
some pictures in here so you guys can
see it
so you
I'm really excited because all the ones
that support me and purchase these
shirts and um I'm going to my website is
up-and-coming so once I receive my
support from these shirts I do way more
cuter shirts I'm going to have my crop
tops and other designs and other things
that stay on my shirt it's just not all
about West coma but of course I want to
see you know who's really out there that
supporting me so I'm really excited for
that my boyfriend loves the hoodie he
always wears it and I had to like you
know be aware that there's guys that
support me too I probably don't want
pink nails on the shirt so I'm just
probably going to put westcote mom just
the worst without the hand for the W
just like a cool W and but my boyfriend
he rocks it so that's because so alright
so I don't even really need to do all
those extra steps with my comb but I'm
going to do so because with this hair
blows and the wind is so pretty and you
just want to make sure it's not going to
get tangled or nape tub or have anything
crazy happen to it because you didn't
really strain it completely um as you
guys know I have so many straight hair
videos now and honestly it's so hard to
choose like which one is my favorite
because
look at how amazing this hair is is
honestly what you what your preference
is like any lights in here you may want
to check out the ones that I inform you
that it's thin and lightweight thin and
lightweight or like full and lightweight
but this is by in-between both like four
months of 26 inch this hair is really
full if I put another bundle in here it
will be crazy I don't know it only makes
sense to me but if you guys get what I'm
trying to say
it's my first time straightening this
hair after Co washing it and this is
exactly how it looked out of the pack
like it was so nice and literally when I
first got this hair I made the wig
because it was so pretty and I was like
oh my gosh and I didn't want to do
another unboxing video for straight hair
like you guys know what straight hair
looks like and I just wanted to rock it
for some time
and give you guys my honest opinion like
I always do and of course I got always
tell you guys I will scare you in the
wrong direction and even if you get hair
that I received from any hair company
not just angel grace I always recommend
you guys um do the water test do the
water test just to be on the safe side
because you never know or you can just
come and watch my videos because you
guys know that I will always do the
water tests for you or I would
eventually show you how it looks in its
natural state just like I did this one
so yeah this is how it looks after
co-washing it and now I'm straightening
the hair and now you know that it's good
to revert back to really pretty straight
hair and it's not going to be like a
wave or it's going to be hard to
straight I haven't received my ring
light yet but I'm super excited because
I'm getting a bigger ring light and
hopefully that just brings up my whole
room and then I have to get me some more
backdrop on fleek nasty and I'm getting
me box lights so I'll probably
eventually do once I receive all my
lighting and stuff like that
I will do like a lighting tutorial
because I know you guys always ask me
like one
I used to film and what light do you use
and all that stuff so I'm trying to have
like a techy video on my channel because
I've never had I never had one of those
on my channel before and the hair
doesn't shed I feel like no straight
hair that received sheds at all what
should what is your favorite texture
with here you guys like straight your
body weighs loose waves deep wave or
curly let me know alright baby loves and
I'm glad I am wearing this out today
because this this straight hair is
clearly fabulous so let me know how you
feel about the hair I'm not going to do
the flower crown I was going to wrap it
around and do this but it not happen
thank you so much for watching ladies my
camera is about to die now so I gotta go
I love you let's call my family just
wait just wait just wait just click on
it just wait on it to speak</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
