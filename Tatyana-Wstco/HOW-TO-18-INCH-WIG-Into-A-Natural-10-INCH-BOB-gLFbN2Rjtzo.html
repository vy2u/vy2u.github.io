hair wig I actually have a 18 inch unit
from this company and I'm just showing
you the inside of this wig just because
it's constructed really well it has four
combs the draw straps that I usually
talk about I'm just pulling them to each
size so when I pop this on I am going to
get it really snug fitted wig
remember wigs are always supposed to fit
snug so if you have to do that extra
step and add an elastic band to get that
vibe going on please do so because you
do not want your way to be sliding
around so this is their 18 inch
Brazilian body wave unit 130 percent
density so I'm gonna go ahead and do is
just cut off the lace and I'm pretty
much showing you how much I left on but
I'm gonna go and cut some more off and
I'm just gonna pop it on my head and fix
whatever I need to fix all right babe so
what we got to do now is finesse this
this hair line situation now it already
looks good don't get me wrong but just
in case I want to pop it up in a
ponytail I just don't feel like the
edges or the sides are as natural enough
for me just in case I want to pop it up
in a ponytail or whatever so yeah I'm
gonna go in and tweak all of that for
myself and it's a really tedious process
please take your time because you can't
put a hole in your lace and it can be
the worst thing that you ever did so
once again take your time this is
literally like an hour and 30 minute
process depending on the tweezers that
you use I do have tweezerman tweezers so
it's really not that long for me but if
you have regular tweezers please take
your time you just don't want to ruin
your lace
but I got you know where's Carson yeah
ever told I had better you know I go
through my quotes everybody - he's a
good man
about every single time when I'm with
you I could see the holeshot
all right so I'm gonna pretty much comb
through the hair just to get any dead
hair out of this unit and then I'm gonna
go in and start cutting this wig I'm not
using my scissors to cut completely
through I'm pretty much putting the hair
all the way to the back of my scissors
and just kind of like doing a raisered
kind of effect if that makes sense by
the way I didn't have to cut this unit
the quality of this hair was really
amazing
it still is it's just my personal
preference I wanted some extra life
added one to this unit just because the
hair quality was so amazing that I
wanted to kind of do something different
I really wasn't liking how the 18-inch
was sitting on me so you can do whatever
you know floats your boat I just wanted
to let you guys know that it wasn't
necessary for me to cut it I do have
another length and another texture from
this hair company so go ahead and
subscribe turn on your notifications so
you can see that unit and so you can be
notified when I post it I just want to
thank you guys so much for taking the
time out to come and watch this video it
means a lot to me and I will see you in
my next one
he's a good man everything about every
single problem when I'm with you I can
see the harsh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
