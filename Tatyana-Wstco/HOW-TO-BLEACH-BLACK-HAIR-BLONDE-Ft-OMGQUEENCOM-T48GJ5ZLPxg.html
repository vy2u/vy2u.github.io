clean hair like I promised and I have
some clips of me bleaching this hair but
I'm going to talk to you guys basically
through the process what I did to get to
this color so I do know exactly how I
want to do my hair later on today but
this is basically what's going on right
now I just kind of have it in the side
part and touch me how my ear so what I
started off someone would just using the
salon chair 40 volume developer and I
use the BW - I believe that's what it's
called lightening powder and I was going
to get it up to seven levels but I
didn't know if I wanted to do but maybe
a natural kind of color like a natural
brown or if I wanted to get it as long
as I possibly can with that product and
I went with as light as I possibly with
that product this is how it came out and
it was a hot-ass mess and I was just
like okay I can't do it I would
definitely say use that product if
you're trying to get to maybe like a
nice natural Brown kind of color but
when it comes to lightening your hair to
a blonde and getting it up to levels
honey's like you're definitely going to
have to get a product that's very
healthy for your hair during that
process and I will always go for blonde
brilliance I usually use this all the
time but during the time that I picked
up those two products it was a nice sale
going on so that's why then pick up
these baby and you get six of these just
spinning sixty dollars pretty much and
you know when you're dealing with 28
inches and stuff like that this is just
a little bit too pricy and not enough
for that because I would definitely say
you have to pick up four of these
products if you are dealing with twenty
eight inches because it's just not going
to be enough and to be on the safe side
you're going to have to pick up six now
this just has a great this just has
great ingredients inside of it such as
my keratin and coconut oil omega oils
and all that healthy stuff so I just
picked up a 35 volume developer they do
have different belts they do have
different volumes and then I just picked
up their lightening powder this is
supposed to lift your hair to nine
different levels so scratch out that
part
don't use that use this and this should
get you up to a blonde that you are
trying to get to now if you still get
that brass
uncover that I achieve you're going to
have the week your hair twice like I did
now I had to lift the hair again like I
said and I did that the second day the
next day and that's when I got a nice
brassy kind of yellow and not a orange
and not a recipe kind of looking color
so what I did after achieving that
brassy yellow pennant color I got my
wellas hunter and it's the PAP toner and
I mix it with the salon care for new
volume developer and I achieved this
color now when I achieve this color just
because I want to go the extra mile I
just used very lathering toner and this
is just supposed to cancel out any other
yellow tones that you may see in your
hair now I could turn this hair one more
time just so I can cancel out completely
all of it and get like a nice active
blonde kind of color but I really do
like this color and I don't plan on
lifting it or toning it one more time
because I don't want to damage the hair
anymore then it probably made look like
towards the end but stay away from as
mushy and you would put on your natural
hair colors and stuff like that when
you're dealing with blond hair after
processing it because it will look a hot
mess it will look damaged and brittle
towards the ends and you don't want that
now after doing all of this crazy stuff
to the hair I had to use a repair
conditioner treatment
it was the ion repair solution be deep
daily conditioner strengthen moisturized
weak damaged hair and this stuff made
the hair really soft afterwards I just
wrapped it in saran right and left it in
there for 30 minutes it said once 2
minutes or 3 to 5 minutes depending on
how damaged the hair is but because I'm
so extra I left it in there for 30
minutes and I got really soft hair now
the hair still moves around it's still
flowy and it's not stiff so that's what
I go for where I'm trying to get a
blonde here and it's I mean a blonde
color if the hair is stiff I'm throwing
it out I can't do I can be walking
around with sip as blonde hair and
Garrincha blonde hair so this may be
here come back to life it really wasn't
as damaged as you may think it was I do
have a piece of your hair right here
just because our best majority of the
hair you know starts at the roots
I feel like that's a lot
isn't as damaged as the copy would be if
I listed it completely from west to tick
and yeah so that's pretty much all that
I did I do still have the I will insert
the clips if I haven't done that already
now after I choose the hair color I did
blow-dry the hair and I say don't ever
do that this is the hair actually air
dry but blowing the hair out just causes
more damage to the hair after doing all
of that chemically stuff to it now the
only reason why I flew it out was
because I was going out last night why
thought I was going out last night and I
got really tired and I officially just
and I ended up not going out so I blew
it out for no frickin reason when I
could've just let it air dry but here's
the kicker so after blowing it out I
strained it so yes honey just a lot of
heat damage actually chemically
processing the hair but like I said I
still don't think it looks really bad
after doing all that stuff to it the
hair is holding up really good so I
promise you guys that I was going to
share with you guys how I achieve this
hair color and what I will be doing with
my own view Queen here so this is
basically what I am doing with it so I
