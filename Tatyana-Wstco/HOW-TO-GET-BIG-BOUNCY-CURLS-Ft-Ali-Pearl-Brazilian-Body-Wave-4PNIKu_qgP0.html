video and today I have in some Brazilian
body wave from Ally pearl hair it's
really nice and very natural-looking so
that's why I'm really excited about this
I've been going for like the very
effortless flawless lightweight type of
hair like I straighten is hair before
but I had to co wash it so you guys can
see it in its natural state again I also
bleach the nuts on this front so so the
wave is still there so I'm pretty happy
about that if this eye looks flat is due
to me like brushing it out today we're
going to stab his hair I don't know
exactly what I'm going to do I'm sure
I'm going to cut some layers in the
front but if you're interested in all
that links will be in the description
box below no foul smell no shedding
known aping no tingling no so I'm very
pleased with this hair it's just very
light and flowing I do have two and a
half bundles from his hair company
because I didn't want to put all the
full third bundle in there because I
have a 360 frontal and I want everything
to look very flat and um very nice and
no lumps and no bumps and stuff like
that so yeah so let's begin this styling
video all right ladies let's begin so
I'm going to be curling my hair away
from my face with my one and a half inch
Connie hair curling iron you don't have
to use this curling iron but this is
what I'm using today
I'll leave the hair on the curling iron
for maybe five to seven seconds and then
I'm going to pin the hair up using my
trusty duckbill clips and then this is
pretty much all that I'm going to do
throughout this video leave your hair
alone for maybe fifteen to twenty
minutes
after curling all of the hair and
pinning the hair up use your blow dryer
on this cool setting to make sure all of
your curls are cool and nothing is warm
and then you can run your fingers
through it to get this nice pretty
fluffy style and then I'm going to be
showing you other ways that you can
probably rock this hair if you're
interested in doing this look but other
than that all their information alley
pros information will be in the
description box below I love how this
hair turned out and I
how well this hair holds a curl I've
been wearing this hair in this staff and
maybe like three days now and it's still
really pretty so I'm really happy with
that but other than that I will see you
ladies in my next video thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you soon
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
