today I am going to be showing you guys
how to believe you're not on your unit
now you can do this with Brussels
closures 360 frontals whatever you want
to do to make it look more natural you
can do this method but a lot of products
that I've used in the description box
below I will also talk over the video
because I'm just saying hi because I
actually did it earlier today and I want
to show you guys how the final results
look so I'm going to straighten my hair
I just wanted to show you guys that no
it's not going to poof up throughout the
day because a lot of you asked that
question because you were interested in
purchasing this unit it's doing really
great the color looks really great
but I also want to show you guys how it
looks if I was to straighten this hair
and how well the strands because I know
that's also going to be a question that
you guys are going to have for me in the
future about this unit so continue to
watch you guys know how to straighten
hair I'm sure and just use a
straightener and this is a two-in-one
coming year straightener and before I
straighten this I do want to mention the
difference between a 360 unit in a 360
frontal now a 360 frontal and a 360 wig
is a big difference whether 360 wig is a
lot easier to maintain because it's a
wig you're not having to purchase
bundles with the frontal unlike you
would have to do with a 360 frontal a
360 frontal is just the frontal so if
you're going to have to purchase the
bundles with it and 360 it's going all
the way around your head so this unit
has lace four inch lace going from front
and to back but I honestly think the
back is not four inches I think it's
more like two it's not much space to
work with is what I'm getting at but the
front has a lot of space to work with so
it's definitely four inches up here but
I think it's like maybe two inches in
the back but it's still really nice
because if you want to go and get it
professionally styled on you on such as
you don't turn the got to be glue method
if you want to do it at home or if you
want to go and get a perfect
you know to apply the weight for you you
can do that and you can rock it just
like it was a sew-in or a installment
and you can also get them the stitch in
between the lace with your braid pattern
underneath it so you will be able to
wear it a lot longer and it's not like
Whiggish at all guys like trust me if a
wig is bulky and acting it's just like
like I can't even deal with it I'm not
even going to you know promote it you
can own sand so this unit feels just
like a soin it's very flat it's very
natural-looking it's not a spool base
unit but you can also get full layers of
units from this website so think about
that very comfortable I'm not running
around thinking that the wig is going to
slip off my head that's why I like doing
my freezing method with my unit I like
parting it and putting this in between
the parts and I also like making sure I
spray underneath the lace up here just
like it comes so this is up here up here
because it's kind of loose right here
cuz I didn't spring it all the way down
so I just like to use that freezing
spray the salon graphics freeze and
spray and I just like to put this right
underneath the lace right in the front
but then I also like going in like this
parting it in fraying
now in this video and you can see what I
parted you can see that it kind of looks
like scalp or it kind of looks more
natural than just parting it and it's
like a very dull color like it was
before when I first showed you guys this
week today I'm going to be showing you
guys how to make it look like this so as
you can see you see some color in it it
looks like you know it can be a frontal
or so so yeah so that's what I'm going
to be sharing this message with you guys
because it's a very good message to know
if you guys want to make your units look
more natural if you're interested to see
how I do this please continue to watch
I'm going to go ahead and straighten it
out and then enjoy the voice-over season
all right baby let's let's get it
started as you can see this is what an
inside of the wig looks like this is a
360 unit so I'm just going to focus the
bleach in the front of the wig and
that's why I'm pointing to show you
where I'm going to be placed in this
bleach now this is a 360 unit and I
can't put it in the back but it's not
enough lace for me to do any of that so
I'm not going to do that I'm going to be
using the Clairol pure
by 30 volume developer in blond
brilliance bleaching powder you can get
it from size view supply store and the
consistencies I like this product to be
is like a peanut butter consistency I
don't want it too runny and I don't want
it too thick when I go to put it on the
lace I do not want it to bleed into the
hair and with my hair now if it does
happen you need to seriously go and get
a damp paper towel and the water is just
going to prevent it from listing the
hair so I'm going to use a plastic knife
just to spread this all over the lace
and that's because I don't like using my
brush that I use for dyeing or bleach on
actual hair for this process just
because I feel like the bristles
penetrate the lace too much and then it
can actually get onto the hair and you
want to make sure you take your time in
the front it's just sped up so it looks
like I'm going this fast but I'm
actually going really really slow and I
just want to make sure you guys know
that the front is the most important
part so you want to make sure all of the
you want to make sure the lace is
covered completely in the front because
once again that's the most important
part now I'm going to use some foil just
to make this process lift a little
faster now it takes 5 to 10 minutes but
as you see I'm going to go in with that
damp paper towel because I kind of got
it on the baby hairs and you do not want
it on the baby hair trust me and you're
going to look crazy so just a damp paper
towel is just going to make sure the
bleach does not actually do its job so
I'm going to fold it I'm going to show
you guys that it's ready for me to wash
and now I'm going to use some Garnier
Hoagland shampoo or conditioner this is
the nourish and restore shampoo
conditioner and I'm going to leave the
conditioner in there for 30 minutes just
to rejuvenate the hair bring moisture
back into the hair and just so the hair
can look like life again because it was
looking real raggedy an ish in the
beginning but yeah so I'm just going to
let the hair air dry now and I'm going
to come back with the final results
this smell it doesn't matter but loose
mostly yeah I use your help with
conditioner and shampoo the gremlin yeah
and then knock that smell so you guys go
grab so this is basically the final
result after straightening it I hope you
guys enjoyed the video or you can see
this part looks a lot more natural and
thank you so much for watching very less
and I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
