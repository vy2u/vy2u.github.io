so excited because I have a new unit to
share with you guys and look at how
amazing this unit lays if you want to
put it in a pony so perfect for holidays
perfect for if you just want to you know
get your cute little style and this is
definitely what's going to get you that
look who's this hair from is probably
what you're asking me this hair is
actually from honey Queen hair this is a
unit from honey Queen and so I will list
all their information in the description
box below I actually have some bundles
from them and I will be sharing that in
the future this video is about this way
from honey Queen so I hope you guys
enjoy once again that information will
be linked in the description box below I
love you baby so much and I hope you
guys are excited for the holidays like I
love you and I'll see you guys in my
next one bye
alright so y'all know I couldn't leave
you hanging without letting you guys
know what I'm doing so this is how the
hair looks after Co watching it because
I had to bleach the nuts on this unit
cuz they were super super dark and I
could not get away with it so I did that
and this is how it looks after air
drying so the unit is really really
pretty in its natural state but what I'm
doing right here is taking a little bit
of foundation powder just to put
underneath the lace so it's not claw
Keable when the lace lays down on my
forehead because you know we need to put
it like above in front of our hairline
not above our head I'm sorry you need to
put the lace in front of your hairline
so your hair won't show so I like using
a foundation powder that matches my skin
complexion and this just helps when I
lay my lace it's not claw Keable once
again and everything looks like it's
seamless and it's supposed to be there
I'm gonna take this along graphics
hairspray and I'm going to use this to
make sure the lace isn't moving down or
lifting up now this unit has four combs
and draw straps and all that so you know
you can make it fit snug but this is
just the extra step that I do when I
want a little bit more security with my
unit so if the wind blows or anything
like that the lace isn't lifting up so I
like using the blow dryer or cool just
to make sure that is in place now if you
need to tweeze please tweeze before you
do this step because if you start
tweezing after your lace is going to
lift up you're gonna see me go back and
forth with this damn blow-dryer and
there's
Spray because I wanted to start tweezing
afterwards cuz I thought it wasn't
necessary to tweeze because the unit is
pre plugged but it wasn't pre plucked
enough for my liking so I had to go and
tweeze a little bit more so that's what
I'm doing right now taking some of the
baby hairs out and then I'm going to
start plucking in that area just saw
that thickness right up in there is just
a little bit you know more gradient and
everything looks like it's seamless once
again so then I had to go back put some
hair spray blow the arm hair spray down
so it can be secured and all that stuff
so that's what I'm gonna do back and
forth you want to see that and I'm going
to add some water on the unit to get all
of that extra hair out of the front of
the unit and it's just making the
process a lot easier and yeah so you're
just gonna have to do all of that and
once again if you need to plug please
please plug before you apply the unit
onto your head because it's just going
to be hella extra like I'm doing right
now so yeah so then I just started
realizing kind of like what direction I
wanted to wear this unit in for the day
so you start seeing that I'm kind of
going for a side part so then I'm gonna
have to start partying and then plucking
the part I'm gonna use some canned -
curling cream and I'm just gonna put
that on the hair and of course some
water comb the hair into a ponytail and
that's pretty much it so I'll talk to
you towards the end of the video but I
just wanted to kind of explain to you
guys what I was doing right here so
hopefully you understand what's going on
but I love you babes and I'll see you
guys in a second
there's much
you
you
there's much
with you
you got me
there's
my chance to be with you
to the fire
you got me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
