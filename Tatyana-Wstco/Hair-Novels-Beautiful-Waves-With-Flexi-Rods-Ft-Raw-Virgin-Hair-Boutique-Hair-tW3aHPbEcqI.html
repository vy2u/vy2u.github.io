hair video for Robert your hair
boutiques hair and this is their
Brazilian body wave I have four bundles
in from this hair company now I did a
review for this hair already and you can
check that out I only had three bundles
in the closure and now I have four
bundles and and I'm excited because it's
as full as I would like it to be and I'm
just going to be curling the hair under
with my flat iron and then using these
red flexi rods to get this nice curl
pattern that I really do like you'll see
the results at the end but you're gonna
hate me because I don't know if you guys
love seeing the flexi rods come down
from the rod but I lost the freaking
video clip I can't believe it but so
sorry so hopefully you're not too upset
about that but um we haven't got there
yet so what I'm doing right now is just
basically curling the hair with the
flexi rod and then I'm just wrapping the
no curling the hair with a flat iron and
then wrapping the hair around the flexi
rod it's pretty easy pretty simple I
think I'm gonna do
flexi rods on wet hair tutorial for you
guys because I haven't did flexi rods in
so long but I have so many flexi rods
now so I can basically get that done for
you and that will be a new and exciting
hair novel video for you ladies so yeah
hopefully you guys know how to do this
it's pretty easy you can get flexi rods
from your local beauty supply store they
have all different shapes sizes I used
red the most and then I ran out of it
when I started working towards the back
and I start putting purple and me back
all right maybes I'm done curling my or
I'm done styling my bra virgin Hair
Boutique all their links will be in the
description box below I did install the
fourth bundle so if you like the density
of this just get four bundles in a
closure in the previous video I only had
three bundles in a closure in so
hopefully you guys can pick and choose
which one you like so you guys can spend
less amount of money or more money just
depends on whatever you guys are filling
let me know if you like the 3 bundle
look and closed your luck or this look
but yeah that's pretty much all that I'm
gonna be doing with my raw virgin hair
boutiques hair I just love how the hair
holds a curl and as you can see in the
beginning of I just basically curled the
fourth bundle just like how I did that
previous video so thank you so much for
watching if you guys are interested to
