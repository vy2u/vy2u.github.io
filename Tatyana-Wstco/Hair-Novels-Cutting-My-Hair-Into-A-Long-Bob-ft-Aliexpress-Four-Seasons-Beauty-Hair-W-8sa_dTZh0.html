with another video and today I'm gonna
be sharing with you guys how I create my
Bob with my for season beauty hair I
just was telling you guys that I really
enjoyed this hair I've been rocking it
and it's super soft I know the first
time that she heard about this hair was
in the unboxing video that I did for
this hair company and I was telling you
guys about his flyaways and off with
this hair plus it's 360 band frontal but
I really do enjoy this hair it's really
soft it's really easy to maintain it's
just their straight hair and I just
wanted to put some life in this hair so
I decided to cut it into a bob so as you
can see I just wet the hair with my
spray bottle and I'm taking some
scissors and I'm cutting a long bob
first and then I'm gonna be going in and
snipping snipping and doing more
snipping you know because you don't want
to cut the bob too short because if you
cut it too short you just look like damn
bitch like that's all I'm left with I
got to work with this so I really tried
to focus on making the bob long first
and whatever I feel like I need to go
back in and trim and cut that's what
I'll do
so yeah so that's basically what you'll
be seeing me do throughout this video
I'm going to get into this blow-drying
session in a bit but as you can see I'm
just still cutting some layers and I
really won't be talking too much
throughout this video I just wanted to
come and say hi you guys and are you
excited we're like at 75,000 subbies I'm
super excited I can't wait to get 100 K
I think everybody that's you know coming
back to watch me in these videos and I
wouldn't be continuing to make them if
it wasn't for you guys actually watching
me do what I do you know yeah so as you
can see I'm trying to just make the
front a little bit shorter and then the
back or the other size or whatever just
because I want to add a little bit of
like small framed face layers in the
front of my face or just won't be like
just a blunt cut throughout the whole
bob even
though this isn't a blunt cut oh my god
like this bright freaking light that's
in my face because I'm trying to give
you guys extra lighting I can't really
even see what I'm doing half of the time
because I'm trying to stay seated I'm
trying to be focused and I'm not trying
to move so much and it was so annoying
but I felt like I did a good job even
though like I still had to go back in
and cut and cut and cut and keep cutting
and keep trimming but it was so annoying
but you know this is what you gotta
sacrifice because I want you guys to see
me do these Styles so I can't complain
all I can do is just get me another
frickin camera that autofocuses and yeah
so that's what I'll be doing so as you
can see there's blog pieces all over the
place and you have bear with me
so basically this is what you think that
is going to be but I'm still not
finished cutting I'm gonna give you guys
some life as I blow-dry my hair this is
my jam thumbs up for this new uh sure
song missing you this is like this dog
is so lit I'm singing with my hair to
brush
all right so I would even cut some more
if it looks shorter is because the day
is shorter and I'm still not done
cutting girls like bear with me now I'm
going to be round brushing this hair and
I'm using the warm setting the cool
setting in the hot setting and this is
just to tame all that thickness at the
bottom because I gave myself like us
semi blunt cut and I just wanted to take
some of the volume out at the bottom and
doing you know this round brush method
will do so it just makes the hair sleek
and chic and fluffy and happy and
lightweight and I really like doing this
all the time actually I even do this
when I curl my hair I you should do this
all the time and you guys probably seen
me do this before in my super old videos
but I just don't have the nozzle to the
blow dryer because I actually bought a
blow dryer nozzle but it just didn't fit
that blow-dryer so I'm just gonna end up
buying me a brand new blow dryer with a
nozzle on it so stay tuned for that
I'll let you guys know which blow dryer
I ended up getting I always just put it
off for some odd reason but I really do
need to purchase one and I need to
purchase a new curling iron so yeah so
that's what you'll see me doing it's on
a cool setting now like when you see it
touch my hair that's when it's uncool
and just putting it on cool after you
put it a little warm or hot just SILS
your hair makes it like shiny and
healthy looking and tamed any flyaways
or friends that may be on the hair and
yeah it just makes me not have to flat
iron the hair so much and it gives way
more body than if you were just to flat
iron your hair so as you can see I'm
still not done cutting it was just so
hard to do this while the same down but
yeah anyway now I'm gonna go through and
just rub my flat iron through this hair
a little bit bumpy hair under find any
other pieces that may need to be cut and
I did find pieces there you go right
there
right there we're almost there guys
we're almost there and I should be done
in a second just running through the
hair with the flat iron and I'm finished
I hope you guys enjoy and I'm gonna
you guys in a second watch me trying to
sit and record and do stuff is so hard
because you're trying to hear you up
you're not trying to you try to hurry up
hurry up or hurry up mom don't judge me
Oh country with certain words that I say
but you know my gonna look at heart my
own everybody's out you everyone to
top of that but all of those needs to
take is Oh
alright my babies I am done with this
video so this is basically all that I'm
gonna be doing with my Four Seasons
beauty hair and as you can see this is
some amazing quality hair I gave it a
thumbs up in the beginning of this video
because I was letting you guys know I
probably already said in the voice-over
but I really do enjoy this hair I
actually co-wash it after reviewing it
in that unboxing video idaten co-wash
the hair like I always tell you guys to
but you guys know how certain days we
are just all about doing the right
things and then other days we try to
take the shortcut you know and that was
the day I was taking the shortcut but
that's why I said like you always should
actually go and go wash the hair because
you never know what you're going to
receive after Co washing it and the hair
in the conditioner that I use with
co-washing is my whole blends
conditioner so I was really pleased with
the results after using that so I really
do think this is some awesome quality
hair that's why I didn't go ahead and
bleach it
or diet like I was telling you guys that
I was going to do because I actually
wanted you guys to see the hair in its
natural state and its natural color and
I actually wanted to do a style with
this hair because I don't have a bob
that's discipline I do not have a bob
this length and I actually wanted to
create one for my stuff because we are
going to winter and I want to do
something short for wintertime but I'm
sure in the future I will be coloring
this hair so yeah I believe this is
pretty much all I'm gonna be doing with
Four Seasons pan it's the first time but
I just wanted to show you guys how I
actually receive the hair I didn't want
to go in and manipulate the hair and do
anything like that but the stuff that I
didn't do was Co wash the hair so like I
said I feel like you always should co
wash the hair cuz you never know what
you're going to get after co washing you
can receive something amazing then you
can receive something that you don't
want and then you can always contact the
vendor let them know how you feel about
the hair and what's going on with it and
if you can get your money's back um if
you can get your money back if you can
share if you can get your money back but
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video I
think I did a lot in this video so
hopefully you guys learn something new
let me tell you guys about this 360
frontal this company has a 360 frontal
which is like an elastic band that has
hair inside of the weft of the elastic
band if you go I watch my own box
you will see what I'm talking about the
hair is actually in the band like it's
not glued on but it's actually in the
band and I don't really care for that
because why I couldn't really it didn't
fit around my head that's basically what
I'm trying to say it wasn't snuff on me
I felt like I was having problems with
how loose it was for me it depending on
your head size it may work for you it
may not and other hair companies have
360 frontals that have actually that
have actual adjustable straps on them so
you can loop it and pull it as tight and
fit it as snug as you want to your head
that's one thing that I didn't like
about that I was actually like curious
to know how I was gonna actually put it
on my head and fit it and how I was
going to make it not be so booth and
what I did was I created a wig for
myself like I usually do and I actually
like pulled the adjust you know I pulled
the band as tight as I needed to be
which wasn't isn't like a big difference
but it just needs to be pulled a little
bit tight towards the right side I've
made it like fit a little bit more snug
pulling it that way and then I sewed it
down it's hard to explain but hopefully
you guys understand what I'm trying to
say but I feel like we shouldn't have to
deal with that so um it's not giving any
lumps or anything like that but what I'm
saying is I don't think we should have
to deal with that I think every hair
company should just have the loops that
we can just snug on to make it fit
really um tight or snug fitting around
our head we shouldn't have to like have
to do the extra mile to make a 360 band
frontal fit but yeah so that's pretty
that's the only con that I have with
this hair company is the styling of its
360 lace frontal but other than that I
really do love the hair it's really nice
and soft it's flowy it really looks
great in this now and I think that's
pretty much all I want to say to you
