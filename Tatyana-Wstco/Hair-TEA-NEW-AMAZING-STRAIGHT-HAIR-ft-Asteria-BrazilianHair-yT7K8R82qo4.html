I hope you guys are happy to see me
again you know the kid hasn't been
posting a lot you know
you know pat on the back I'm going to be
talking to you guys about Asterion hair
and this is an Aliexpress hair company
I'm super amped about this hair because
it's some straight Brazilian hair from
this hair company I have in 326 inches a
20 inch free part closure so nothing but
positive things about this hair guys
like look at how freaking luscious this
hair is like full of life has movement
like popping like that's all I have to
say pop it ass hair it gives me so much
life it doesn't tangle doesn't shed just
a neighbor but the back of my head I'm
actually about to go out right now so I
just want to make this video really
quick for you ladies I have the part
going on to the side and um the ends are
not bad at all really not bad at all and
I really do enjoy this hair because I
love the density of this hair I have 3
26 inches and it's laying as flat as I
wanted to look it's not really thick as
me put it in a natural-looking ponytail
it's not chunky it looks like some real
natural straight hair you know like it's
growing from my scalp
I wish anyway those are got their
feedback section on their website just
to see if any girls have any other
opinions about um seria hair I am
receiving nothing but positive things
from this hair company it gives me so
much life and I don't plan on like
layering this hair or dyeing it or
bleaching it only because I look at how
much like this is giving like I don't
really have any straight black hair that
I haven't already put layers in or
colored it or anything like that so this
is enough for me like this is all 5 3 5
4 and it's touching like the bottom of
my butt so that's good enough that's
like true to its month right because
it's a wig like I make sure I store the
hair properly I put it away high up it's
not getting tangled something I can say
about this hair the closure is annoying
that's one thing I could say about this
hair because of the flyaways you see
all of this up here like I have tried
hairspray and all of that guys it is
still walking its life and even like
right here like they still try to pop up
and um I don't get that when I part the
hair in the middle but I parted the
closure on the side and that's why I'm
getting all of that but I still
shouldn't have to deal with that because
I've never really dealt that with any
other closures I've received and I call
wash his hair for the first time because
I haven't this is just the hair straight
out of the pack really really pretty and
this is how I'm going to be rocking it
for some look for a long time until I
feel like it needs to be Co washed
because I might just focus like the
shampoo and the conditioner at the top
like oh I'm going to try to wet this and
see what it does with this brush and I
used warm water it looks like it's
laying down this is one brush that I
didn't use I used another brush and this
pressure usually gets a lot of issues
out of the way but we'll see what
actually it really did something well
maybe it was just so yeah that is that
cuz now I don't even see them I just
added some water and then now maybe I
should tie D hair down what do you guys
think I'll be sharing with you guys some
of the feedback on their website with
you while um I lay my hair down at the
top because of the flyaways and we're
gonna do it just like this that's what
types of what people did in my hair this
is tight enough and yeah they have 97%
positive feedback on their website and a
lot of girls have five stars that's hair
so clearly we're getting some great
quality hair definitely did say this is
six a hair it says some girl set is very
soft has no smell it's very light yet
full that's exactly how I feel this hair
is like the perfect density very minimal
shedding I waited to actually use this
hair before leaving um a feedback I'm
really loving it the delivery was really
quick and I got it in four days like
it was maybe like three to five business
days for five to seven depending on your
location this hair is very thick onto my
Elsa the hair is really extremely soft
and bouncy no tangles shipping was
extremely fast the Scylla was very
commutative and helpful I've had my
installment in for three days so far and
I love this hair it's extremely soft
I literally combed it once a day because
it doesn't tangle or start looking
napping
I have tons of positive feedback there's
girls that have tried their bodyweight
mostly on this website so clearly they
wanted me to try their body weight but I
really was tired of doing body wave I
wanted to do something straight this
time and I have so much more body weight
to be doing for you ladies so let me
just take this off because I feel like
this should be good enough and let's see
what is giving feeling it I'm feeling it
ladies brush out this area where you
thing using a little bit of this um
holding spray - on this hair so yeah so
thank you so much for watching I hope
you ladies enjoyed this video make sure
