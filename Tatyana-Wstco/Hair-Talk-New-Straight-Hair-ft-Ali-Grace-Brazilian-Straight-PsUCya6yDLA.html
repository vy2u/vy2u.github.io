so upset in this video but I really am
but I'm going to keep a smile on my face
but what is the problem you may be
wondering well this is some more new
hair that have from a hair company by
the name of Ally grace and this is four
bundles of their Brazilian straight but
I only use three bundles and yet three
bundles for this unit that I created for
myself and let me tell you I did a
full-throttle wig tutorial for you guys
from start to finish and the footage is
gone and end up deleting the raw memory
card where the footage was on and now
I'm stuck with this little tiny ass clip
that I have of how I created this unit
which is just me laying the frontal but
am I going to keep that in this video
yes I am because all of my hard work is
not going to waste okay so today it's
going to be about Ally Grace's Brazilian
straight hair of course you guys know
what stray hair looks like so this
shouldn't be anything too exciting to
you but just in case you are interested
in purchasing some straight hair from
ally grants this is how it's holding up
it's really nice it's really easy to
maintain the hair is not shedding the
hair is not neighing and it's no foul
smell or anything like that see some
high quality hair I do have another
texture for this hair company which is
their Brazilian straight hair and in
this video I'm going to basically just
unbox their resilience straight I mean
they're Brazilian deep wave hair because
it will only make sense because I'm
going to be showing you guys this hair
in another video but for their Brazilian
straight hair it's holding up really
good and that's pretty much all I can
tell you guys because I was completely
styled his hair I bleached the knots I
put it on my head and I thought the
footage was here and I'm actually
recording another video but I went to go
and try to you know finish this video
which was me you know doing the way for
you guys and I'm like looking around
like where the hell is the footage like
what is going on I'm looking at my
spirit it's not there so okay this is
their closure and it may look a hot mess
but it's not it's definitely muffled
about but if it does look crazy it's
definitely my fault because I've had
that closure
for some time now but I have to co wash
it and do all that good stuff to it so
this is one of the bundles I'm not going
to open all of them because I feel like
this completes the purpose that's in
case you guys are interested in
purchasing the deep wave or the shirt
here just know that they're straight
hair looks really good and I'm still
going to leave the clip of me placing
the front row from the dome cap and
showing you what dome cap and I use but
yes so here is their deep wave hair and
as you can see it looks very ramen
noodle ish right now and it's just
because it doesn't have any kind of you
know real texture in it right now
because this came straight from out of
the pack and we don't know exactly how
this is going to look so I'm probably
going to create a wig record and show
you guys how I keep up and maintain my
wigs and in my unit and that's pretty
much probably what the second video is
going to consist of with this deep wave
texture so I hope you guys enjoy the
rest of this video once again the hair
is holding up really good this string
here so I'm really pleased with it but I
hope you guys I hope to see you guys in
my next one for Ally berries and praying
that none of my footage gets to leave it
again I love you bye alright baby loves
so here's my favorite dome caps it's the
stylist collection make your own wig
spandex dome cap and it's just so
snuggle my head so this is why don't
ever have to use an elastic band to help
make sure the wig is not going anywhere
because this is perfect so of course I'm
using the front so that came from Ally
grace and I'm placing it on top of the
dome pad making sure I'm stretching the
lace pretty much to each side really
tight so it's not going anywhere and
then I secure it with these nails I
would use my t pins but I can't find
them anywhere so I had to use the nails
and it was a flat nail so when I start
sewing it down it's not going to be in a
way so that's all of the footage that
was left after me losing all of my other
footage so I'm just creating these
little fake baby hairs and then I'm just
going to straighten the hair a little
bit and I got the wiz khalifa patch
going on because we've got only hair a
little bit too much but I don't mind it
I don't care it is what it is so this is
how I wore the hair today's voiceover is
pretty new so I've already created the
deep wave wig
so that should be up soon
but I love you guys I hope you enjoyed
the rest of this video I love this hair
is super soft and I get so many
compliments on it so make sure you check
the description box below to see all of
this hair company's information and I
love you and I'll see you soon all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
