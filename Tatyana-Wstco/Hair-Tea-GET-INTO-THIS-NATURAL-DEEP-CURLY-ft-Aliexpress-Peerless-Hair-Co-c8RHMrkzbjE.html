video and I have more hair from peerless
hair to share with you ladies I tried
their straight hair before and I really
was in freakin love with that hair was
super thick super straight it was like
bone straight and it was flawless so I
have some more hair from them and this
is their deep curly their natural deep
curly texture so I have four bundles and
a closure from this hair company so I'll
list the unboxing video for the straight
hair and the other styling video or
update a video for the straight hair in
the description box below so you can see
that video if you're interested in
straight hair versus like a natural deep
curly type of texture so yeah so this is
basically how all the bundles looks it's
in these little packets and then this is
the like this and I have two tweets no I
think I have all 26 inches yeah all 26
inches in these in this texture so if
we're going to open the first 26 inch
this is it natural curly this is what it
looks like I'm gonna co-wash this hair
so we can see what it looks like um and
then I'm gonna like let it air dry and
I'm gonna come back and show you guys
the results but this is what their
natural texture is looking like well
they're natural deep curly but it looks
like it's some pretty hair I can't
really run my fingers through it
completely just because I feel like
because of the texture so we're going to
put it run underwater but we're not
gonna do that yet so it's falling like
so the middle of my but if I stood up
and yeah so that's pretty exciting I
don't have any foul smell or anything
like that and the hair is pretty soft
same length as the other one to the
middle of my butt and then well let me
try to do this
okay so we're gonna have to run this one
underwater too because I can't run my
fingers through that one without really
like snagging and tangling up the hair
then this is another one and this is
what that looks like and then I feel
like I can run my fingers completely
through this one a little bit more well
yeah so I feel like deep curly it's
supposed to be my deep waves instead of
like curly but we're going to run it
under water to see if it still gets
something like if it still gives off
curly and this is another 26 hey and
then now we're going to open up the
clothes so I'm going to bleach the mess
on this closure and I'm gonna show you
guys how I do that in the next video so
you guys can see that because this is
pretty like white this is really light
for me to light for me so I'm gonna have
to bleach Lots on this closure so yeah
but this is what their closure looks
like I don't get any weird smell or
anything like that
so it's pretty much giving the same
texture as the bundles sober boys who
went all this hair and well I'm gonna
wet all this hair and then I'm going to
come back and show you guys the results
alright baby loves I'm going to show you
guys how the hair looks after me doing
my water test
I didn't co-washing hair I just realized
that I was telling you guys co-wash I
didn't apply any conditioner or any
products in this hair so I just ran it
underneath water and detangle it by
myself I did get a few strands here and
there but you know that's usually what
you're expect when you're dealing with
something that's like deep curly or
curly or like a deep wave trying to get
it out of its state that it came in on
in the bag but yeah so this is how the
closure looks and it's not completely
dry but I just wanted to kind of get
back on this before the Sun Goes Down so
here's how the closure looks and it
basically matches the bundles
I think it matches the bundles pretty
good and here's all of the bundles so
this is kind of the feel that I'm
getting with the deep curly texture and
I'm kind of getting a few snags like
towards the end of the hair but nothing
too too crazy I'm gonna rock the hair
like create a wig out of this like I
usually do but I rock the wig and see
how it does
while I'm rocking the hair but I don't
think it's gonna do anything too
dramatic I might end up bleaching this
hair like to a nice soft like brown or
natural brown color just because like
I'm you know I have that big-ass gallon
of bleach if you guys saw on my other
previous video so lightening the hair I
think will be a good thing because I
haven't did any color with a deep wavy
type of hair texture so or deep curly
type of hair texture so I think that
would be kind of exciting let me know
your thoughts in the in the comment
section below I'm going to probably end
up trimming the hair because it kind of
does look like it's getting a little
like frizzy at the bottom don't you
think yeah so I'm gonna let you guys
know how I feel about this hair and the
updated review I'm just seeing how it
looks in its natural state and I just
wanted to share with you guys what the
hair will look like if you decide to
purchase some deep curly from peerless
hair but all that information will be
