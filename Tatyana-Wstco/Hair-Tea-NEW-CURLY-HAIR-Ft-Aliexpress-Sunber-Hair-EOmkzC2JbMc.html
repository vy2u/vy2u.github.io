video and this is going to be another
unboxing video so I got some more hair
tea for you babies I'm actually opening
up some sunburned hair extensions for
you ladies this is an Aliexpress hair
company so you can check you can check
that Aliexpress website out I'll list
all their links in the description box
below but I have four bundles of
Brazilian curly I'm super excited
because I have some more curly hair for
you ladies and I hopefully hopefully
this is some good curly hair I haven't
opened this at all this is how I
received the hair also customer service
with summer it's really awesome so they
have some haircare instructions on the
back of this box for you
and yeah so if you guys are interested
in purchasing from his hair company like
I said I'll listen I'll list them in the
description box below before we start
this unboxing how are you guys doing
you're doing okay
that is awesome I've missed you guys so
pretty much I will be doing some
Westcombe on t-shirts for you ladies
soon and I'm really excited because
anybody that supports me can be a part
of this movement you'll be able to
purchase crewnecks or t-shirts for my
what's come up family but yeah so we're
gonna begin this unboxing now so this is
how the front box looks it just as
sunburn and it says 100% virgin here so
I just looked at my tongue my tongue is
super yellow because I hate noodles that
had some turmeric powder inside of it
because turmeric powder is supposed to
be really good for you so yeah so it's
supposed to be good for your skin and
all that stuff so basically this is what
I got in my box this is how it looks
when you open it they gave me some
lashes and they're so thank you so much
summer you guys are awesome I do have
four bundles like I said so we're just
going to begin with the 24 inch this is
how you'll be receiving your hair it
actually is in this plastic bag and you
can actually just pop it open and that's
really awesome because whatever you
don't use you can just put it right back
into this bag unprocess human here is
what is
is saying on here and this is how
they're Brazilian curly looks of course
I'll be doing the water test on this
hair just to see if it reverts back or
just to see what it's giving after you
know putting some water on this but it's
looking more like a wave to me rather
than like curly but that can just be how
it was stored so I definitely want to
put some water on this it doesn't look
so much like a wave wave but yeah it's
falling to my waist the 24 inch and this
24 inch let's see what this is looking
like
I might wondering why so hard they have
a rubber band around the side so this is
how the other 24 inch once again it
looks like more so of a wave than just
curly but I'm going to run it underneath
water first the hair is really soft it's
like really soft the ends don't look bad
at all it doesn't get like you know dead
at the ends or anything this doesn't
have a bad smell and this one doesn't
have a bad smell the ends are like this
exact same on this hair - how much hair
that you'll be receiving on this bundle
it's a nice amount so I'm really excited
about that and the beers don't look
crazy either I'm gonna open up a 26-inch
now so this is their 26 inch so it looks
like the same exact pattern as the other
hair so that's really awesome I can run
my fingers right through this hair the
ends not bad either and I'm going to wet
all of these bundles actually just to
see what it's giving and then I'm going
to let them air dry and we'll see how it
turns out I can run my fingers through
these 24 inches - the hair is super soft
and this is the other 24 inch really
soft and not hard to detangle at all
with your fingers and this is the last
26 inch this is how a 26 inch looks from
them again and super soft I did say
matching frontal but I didn't receive my
matching frontals so that is no bueno
hopefully we can discuss that we're
going to try to finesse this without a
frontal so I'll let you guys know what I
end up doing I'm not sure if I'm going
to find a frontal that actually matches
this that I already have for myself or
if I'm going to try to so this actually
down to my head and do like the flip
over method that's what it's called the
flip over method with this hair so we'll
see but let me go with us I am back with
this hair and I'm excited for you guys
to see it look at this beautiful list so
excited because it actually
is a curl pattern it is not a wave so
clearly it was just how it was stored so
that's why I always suggest you guys do
the water test before you try to do any
installation just so you can see if it's
gonna go back to that texture that you
really want it or if it's giving you
something that you don't want at all so
you don't want to spend your money on
the installation then go to wash your
hair and you're not getting not one kind
of curl pattern that one kind of body
wave not one kind of loose wave you
don't want that because you did not
express straight hair right right so
that's why I always say do the water
test this is basically what I am getting
I won't be running my fingers through
this hair anymore just because it was
super easy to do it the first time and
now it's time for the hair to dry so
this is what the hair is giving me and
this is how all four bundles look no
fast no don't have any smell at all so
I'm really excited about that and I have
the amount of hair that I've lost in
this hair the amount of hair is just
this like can you guys believe it that's
just minimum shedding so nothing to
complain about with that so make sure
you subscribe so you guys can see this
updated review on sombre hair for their
Brazilian curly I'm really excited to
install this hair even though I was
looking for my closure or my frontal
just in case any of you babies wanted to
see what the closure of the frontal
looks like if it matched but I can't
show you because they didn't put it in
my plan it's cool though it's cool I'm
gonna do the flip over method so this is
good this is gonna be a full
installation so yeah so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video don't forget to
thumbs up like comment subscribe and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
