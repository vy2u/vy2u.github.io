going to be showing you guys this makeup
look for the day I try to kind of make
this a chitchat get ready with me but it
kind of went all the way left what I'm
going to be talking to you guys about in
this video is these brushes from dandy
planet I actually have had this for some
time but I've never really got around to
using them I've used the ones as you see
missing in the Box I use the one that
you see missing in the Box today so I
hope you guys enjoy how my makeup look
turned out with using some of these
products and yeah so I hope you guys are
interested continue to watch if you are
I love you and I will see you babies and
my next one by Milani concealed and
Perfector one foundation be medium to
full coverage oil-free long where I only
wore this about three times and
yesterday I actually put it on and look
really really good
I want to pump some on the back of my
hand and this out I'm gonna take the
biggest brush just because why not you
know what I'm saying yeah so these are
really cute you guys know like my
favorite color is pink 7c my little pink
nails on my perch they like pop this on
my skin like this with this brush
and blend it out
I was going with my NARS creamy
concealer
hey your brush and kind of just like Pat
around where I had to stop you know
jacking the concealer at and this is
just so everything can look seamless and
what I like doing is just going over the
whole chin area just because I feel like
I don't want that super highlighted I
just want some color down there and I'm
just gonna do the same thing with my
forehead because I don't really want um
I don't want any things that look like
you know concealer foundation contour
kind of vibe so yeah so that's how it
looks so far it looks really really good
by the way you know I think I found my
new love for December I'm gonna take
this size brush now and w50 concealer or
just start contouring my nose how I
would usually Consular more control with
placing the product and making sure it
stays in that area a that little
concealer brush that I was using to
blend out my concealer and just go down
these areas just so I don't have any
extra
contour on the sides of my nose like in
this area if you bring the contour out
in these areas your nose will look
bigger and when I'm contouring I'm
trying to make sure my nose is slim we
just go ahead and tap the edges and
blend it and I really really like that
brush because this definitely gets into
the areas that I feel like sometimes my
Beauty Blender doesn't get into to make
sure everything is blended out and
that's super important your nose contour
needs to be super blended because it's
very easy to clock because your nose is
one less than an unfilled space okay so
what I'm gonna do now is take this mani
planning brush just using for my
foundation I'm just going to stick with
my Bobbi Brown foundation stick just
because I can't find my NW 50 right now
even though I just used it to contour my
nose and like how do I lose stuff this
fast that means I need a little bit more
organization in my makeup does so yeah
now we're gonna work on this eye look
it's paint pot from back to make sure
that my eyes are pretty pigmented need
it to be really really vibrates okay so
that's what this product is going to do
and it's also just going to pretty much
prime and make sure that my shadows are
going to stay on all day I'm gonna take
foxy from The Naked 2 palette and this
is just to set this paint pot so when I
start blending out my shadows everything
is going to be seamless and yeah dupe
for this even though I feel like you
know it works it definitely does work
you just have to put a little bit more
of that product 1 I feel like it's kind
of like what is what's the word I'm
looking for
it's kind of a sheer compared to this
and you just want to go ahead and if you
use that white base you want to do the
same thing but I would just recommend
you guys using a white shadow versus
this shave foxy this has been like my
new favorite transition color it kind of
reminds me like of the of the shake all
like tiki hut from makeup geek or it
might have been from Coastal Scents and
what I want to do is just pretty much
put that in my transition area and I'm
just gonna do swiping motions I don't
really want this to blend it out even
though it's in this transition shade or
the transition area I just kind of want
it to my pop still
and then what I'm going to do is kind of
like focus it right up in here now and
this is just to make sure this color
pops a little bit more like I needed to
and make sure you get this in the corner
you don't want it to be naked and I'm
going to take this brush right here that
I use to carve out my brows with and I'm
just going to place this product right
up in the center I'll do that and then
I'm going to do a wing yeah like this
unlike Allah
I'm going to take this shave right here
and mix it with this shade and I'm just
going to press this on my lid
liquid eyeliner and I just like starting
with one flick of the wrist making the
line like star all the way like right
here like by my brow and then I like you
know connecting it with a another line
so I'm just do it like that and then I'm
gonna connect
but I like looking straight ahead so
what I know when I open my eye if I move
my eye around it's not going to start
moving or me or anything like that
because I hate if I want to open my eye
or close my eye my wing starts like
moving and then it won't look how you
know I thought it was going to look so I
don't close my eye when I make my wing
at all and I just filling it and as you
can see
I don't know why it's likely so freaking
long to do a browse and also to I know
why I know why I was on the phone that's
what happened
alright so we're back here you know you
know we're back that hold us I like just
Pat happy
patting it into my skin and I think
we're pretty much done with those over
brushes cuz everything else I kind of
need it to be a little bit but luckier
you know man
and what I've been doing lately it's
kind of like letting my skin breathe
because my face is like you know or more
so of the textured side I don't want to
put too much my powder all over my face
or whatever the case may be
so it no it's not even that hot outside
so I'm not gonna be going outside
melting or whatever
I am combination skin so that means like
in this season I'm a little bit more
drier and yeah so I can get away with
using less powder so I'm gonna take
advantage of that
of course so what I'm going to do is
just highlight now and I'm just gonna
use this precious petals highlights from
wet around and I'm just going to focus
this I'm using this brush right here and
by the way that's a beauty mark on my to
highlight
just to see if I can get a little bit
more precision
this brush right here this might be too
big but we're going to try it out
because why not
and then I'm just going to use this for
my Cupid's bow as well with the bag yes
oh and with my next stay that but not
flat powder I'm gonna take golds in deep
not giving like you know to too warm I
think that's good enough because I do
have a little bit of bronzer on this
brush already but why not just be an
extra puts the more bombs alone why not
you know you know stuff this area too so
now I'm just gonna take this nyx bronzer
and focus that back up in here
same on this side
and if you guys don't know I don't
really like blush so I kind of like try
to use my bronzer as if it was a brush
if it was a blush like every time I put
it on I always regret it so I'm not even
gonna play myself today
yeah highlight with these drops today
and this is also going to make me look a
little bit more healthy and make my make
my highlights look like is glowing
within
I'll just use a speckle eyeliner because
I don't know my mother
yes right now
the one I'm really looking for is a
little bit more like Rosco
so it's really good a must get what is
your proxy like it is right now
then I will top it off with my
Mack
a little bit of this next blue
together a bit
razzle dazzle
and I think that's it babes so I hope
you guys enjoy my lashes may look a
little wonky I put ones that I really
didn't want to wear on but you get the
gist of it this is the holiday look set
my cream contour on my nose so I'm going
to do that real quick I had to sound the
cam but I love you and I will see you
guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
