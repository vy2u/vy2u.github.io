glittery eye look that I feel like is
very wearable or in the day or at night
or around you know the holiday season
Thanksgiving Christmas New Year's if you
just change the lip to a poppin bread oh
yes so I'm going to be using my wife's
el primer and these Sephora luster drops
and I'm going to apply that with my
Beauty Blender of course a depth a damp
Beauty Blender never dry and I'm just
going to make sure that is evenly
applied all throughout my face and I'm
going to use my charge water to enhance
this and also use it because I'm about
to put my foundation on so you guys know
that I have a new foundation that I'm
loving which is my Mac Pro Longwear
foundation in nc15 and it's just really
nice I really love the coverage and it
looks really dewy and poppin so yeah and
I'm gonna be using my la girl Pro
concealer and toffee to highlight today
and I like doing this underneath my eyes
in the center of my forehead in the
middle of my chin Oh
during this video you guys start seeing
my hair just getting all over the place
I don't know what I was doing this is
why I usually put my hair in a ponytail
but it doesn't look too crazy right now
but it's going to look crazy so right
now I'm using my brow gel from benefit
I'll list the exact name in the
description box because I'm not sure and
I'm just using a brown shadow to line my
brows to make it look pretty pretty
I'll do a brow video soon I'm gonna be
using my Mac highlighting pin in light
boost to do an even more dramatic
under-eye pop because you guys know that
I like my under eyes to be brighter than
the North Star anyway using a wet Beauty
Blender still and now I'm going to be
taking my airspun powder on a cosmetic
sponge to set off that concealer that I
used and I'm using my black radiance
sculpting shade to set the hollows of my
cheeks and around my face and down the
bridge of my nose or the sides of my
nose and I'm gonna go in my with I'm
gonna go in with my mac mineralize
skinfinish to set everything else and
this is in the shade dark deep and then
I'm going to prime my eyes and then I'm
going to take creme Brule from makeup
geek and I apply that above my
transition shade and I'm gonna take this
brown liner to create a new crease for
myself and then I'm going to use I
believe this shade is called Coco bear
from makeup beat from makeup geek and
I'm going to use that to blow out that
liner
and I'm going to be using a shade called
desert sand to blow out that cocoa bear
shade it's like a mustard yellow color I
need a new primer to make my eyeshadows
pop a little bit more what do you think
I should use I'm thinking about the
Paint Pots from Mac but I really don't
care for them as you can see I'm using
that brown liner to intensify the crease
again and then I'm using chocolate tear
from Coastal Scents to deepen up that
color and then I'm gonna go in with that
cocoa bear shade to blow out that
chocolate cover with that brown color
and then I'm gonna go in with the shade
called burnt umber from Coastal Scents
and I'm just going to intensify that
crease a little bit more so I can have a
little bit more color in it and I'm
gonna go in with corrupt from makeup
geek and then going to go in with that
Coco bear shade to blow that out and
just go back and forth with blending so
it can look very seamless and no harsh
lines are going to be in the way of your
flawlessness and I'm gonna use this
glitter that I got from my local beauty
supply store I'll list that name in the
description box below because I'm not
sure but it's a really pretty glitter as
you can see I love it and I'm just using
the same eyeshadows that I use on my
lids underneath to get that same smoky
effect and then I'm gonna highlight with
my back glow kit
the high points for my face the high
points on my face I'm gonna be using
that on my brows and my cheeks my lips
and down the bridge of my nose and I'm
gonna use this brown liner and this
clean color lip product I'm not exactly
sure the name of this one but I'll list
that in the description box as well and
I'm just using some peach twists Mac
blush and then that's pretty much how I
created this look really simple I just
added some lashes and a wing and made
sure I did like a nice black liner in my
waterline and that's pretty much how I
created this look ladies thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you
ladies in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
