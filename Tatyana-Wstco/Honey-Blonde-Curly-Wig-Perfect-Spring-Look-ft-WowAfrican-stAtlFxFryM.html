putting lotion on as soon as I got a
shower yet at the age of 22 and it's
getting ridiculous this is a you curly
I'm bringing it from this company and
yeah so it does have four inches of lace
parting at the top but what I did was
just go ahead and just pretty much cut
the lace I'll show you how it looks so
my hair is literally right here I'll
push the wig all the way back there
because I just wasn't here for it I
couldn't even wear my hair like this and
it would still look like you know it
matches the texture but I just wasn't
here for the lace so that's basically
what I was telling you guys before I
showed you this so I just pretty much
pushed it back and as you can see I do
have a stocking cap under that's why
that looks so great and right I could've
had went with a more neutral way cabinet
actually fits my skin complexion but I
couldn't find it and I just really
wasn't like about going through every
damn drawer and every box to find and so
so this is both sides wet obviously and
it's definitely up to you if you just
want to take the wig off Mike nobody and
they let it
they but because I have somewhere to go
over after I do this I'm just doing it
for you guys on camera and I'm gonna
also going to show you guys hot finesse
my little big hair so whatever so yeah
this is how simple that is this process
is very very simple to make your waist
look a little bit more realistic I would
say just cut some of the lace off and
like a rock your baby hairs in front if
the front isn't giving you what you were
expecting you know so yeah so this is
the hair really really pretty slight
shedding of course because it is curly
hair so I do have about 4 to 5 strands
each time I do too
each time I do detangle this unit it's
nothing too crazy though so I'm not
really sure it and especially because of
the color you know sometimes you can get
more shedding
depending on what color this cancelled
leave-in conditioner is really good for
making the hair smell really good as
well as just tailor the hair a little
bit
oh now what would I do is just use a
t-shirt just to like you know make it
bigger or like you know for more about
you might do me like this and it's a dry
it just a little bit but I don't kind of
a t-shirt if it means though I'm just
using my hands and you know you're
supposed to dry your hair with a t-shirt
- or like a specific Tavis make for your
hair because if you use a regular towel
it just causes some more frizz to your
hair to your natural hair into your
weaves so that's what I don't ever use a
real towel in my leaves so that is that
as you can see the pattern is super
beautiful at turnaround this is how it
looks
can't take a little bit of this leave-in
conditioner and I'm just gonna put it on
the back of my hand and use this to
pretty much sue my baby here as to how I
want it to be
so that is that my love's very listed in
low if you guys are interested in
purchasing this try to show you all the
strands that I've lost cuz I do have
some more over here so doing all of that
detainment this is how much if you can
see that this is how much hair I do have
coming out of the way so it's not a lot
especially powerful this unit is I
believe this bike under activity percent
density or 130 once again all that
information will be below in the exact
way but that's on top of my head will be
linked below so you can just click on it
and get all the details that you feel
like you need to know before purchasing
it also just do a little bit more
research on a company just to make sure
you know you're getting exactly what you
want and of course your money's worth
that is that I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I will see you baby in my
next one don't forget the thumbs up

would be helpful for others in this
world I love you my</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
