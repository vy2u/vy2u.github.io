peerless hair I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to wear this hair today just
because it's so much hair that I can't
deal with it just because it's so hot so
I really want to do some I want to do a
lot of layers in this hair basically is
what I'm trying to say it's just they're
straight peruvian or brazil you know who
believe I have to 28 and 826 but like I
said all the exact comments the info to
peerless will be linked in the
description box below I've brought this
hair in his natural state I bleached it
died in lifted it all that good stuff
and yes the hair still looks good
it didn't get brittle or drive on me or
anything like that it still has body it
still has movement it still flows it's
really really nice so as you can see I'm
just gonna be cutting kind of blood cuz
I really don't care I cut this much off
and then I'm just going to work at these
layers and start layering the rest of
the hair just so it can give it some
body
I feel like we're gonna get so character
in this hair these are really choppy
layers but it's going to come together
trust me I used to do this to my hair
all the time as good as I did and I was
actually looking in my camera monitor I
kind of think I want to do a child back
here just so when I go in and curlies so
like I said I do have four bundles from
this hair company
I do have four bundles and a front so
like I said but girl for it to be this
long the then I mean the thickness is
really great
so then you can go in and kind of frame
your face a little bit more if you want
to all up to you when it comes to very
bright hair whatever you feel like works
for you that's what you sign no I don't
know what was going on with me this day
I should have had pulls my wig back just
a little bit girl I know if I was trying
to have the Kylie Jenner forehead but
you know you know you love it you bury
so don't be in my comments and judging
me I see it before you I am I bet his
biggest critics they'll trust me I see
it
okay it won't happen again
their information will be listed in the
description box below
I know peerless hair was once an
Aliexpress company and still might be
once again listen well if you know I
mess anything up but yeah so as you can
see the hair looks really really healthy
now definitely one of the hair companies
that I've always room for it if you guys
ask me about hair companies that I
really really enjoyed working with on
Aliexpress I've always mentioned
peerless hair so I'm happy that I'm able
to share another texture from them for
you guys because I believe I try their
body wave last time and it was
phenomenal shout outs appear this hair
oh I didn't even tell you guys about
like the dyeing process in the bleaching
process so I know you guys are probably
gonna ask me about this hair color very
simple all I did was lifted to a brown
so you just leave the bleach on your
hair from maybe like 10 minutes to the
desired brown color that you want and
then I actually let it air dry you guys
know that I don't put any heat for my
hair if it's like completely drenched in
water I don't do that just because I
feel like when you air dry your hair a
chance for the hair to rest and get his
life back and born hair out is so time
consuming so that's why I like air
drying my hair so I let it air dry and
then I went back in with some bleach and
just you know did some highlights in the
front it really is not so much in the
back but I believe I'm gonna go in and
add some highlights in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
