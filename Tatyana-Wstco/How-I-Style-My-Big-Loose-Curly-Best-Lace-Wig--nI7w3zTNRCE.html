another video and today is going to be
an unboxing video for best lace wigs I'm
really excited because I have a new wig
from them
I've tried a wig from his hair company
Moore's before the video is on my
channel somewhere I'll listen in the
description box below but we're going to
jump in with the unboxing and I'm going
to show you how this wig looks I don't
even know how the wig looks honestly I
saw a picture of it but I haven't
totally like unraveled it yet so we're
going to begin this process so this is
how best lace wigs send out their wigs
so style number is GS W 1 to 9 it's a
natural brown color the length is 16
inches add a small to medium cast and
open it like right here you don't have
to tear the bag and just make sure
before you cut the lace off of this way
to try it one first and see if you like
it do not cut the lace and then say you
don't like it because if he's retarded
grab something on the way thing will not
accept that at all a deep way but then
it look yeah I think it's a deep wave
way but this is just the style attach
the picture that they have on the
website of how it looks because they
sent me a few options to choose from and
I chose this one this little car
attached just gives you some haircare
instructions so I'm taking it from out
of here look at this doesn't this look
so freaking pretty I do this for a
reason because I want to see exactly how
the hair looks if I'm purchasing some
hair so I don't like when people go in
and manipulate it and then tell me about
the hair I want to see the hair straight
out of the bog without that person even
doing anything to it so when I started
my youtube channel I definitely knew
that I would be doing unboxing videos
for you guys I'm expecting all vendors
to send out the same exact hair that
they send me yours should look exactly
like this right because mine looks
exactly like this and I didn't do
anything to it
I don't even 100
they actually have a return for Policy
return or exchange form so I know in the
last video for best lace wigs had a
curly texture and it was beautiful and a
lot of the girls said that they received
the same hair and they love the hair and
then a lot of girls said that they
didn't receive the same hair and they
had a problem with their hair but like I
always tell you guys if you have a
problem with hair you definitely need to
contact the vendor and refer back to my
videos or refer back to videos that you
seen I just wanted to show you guys that
they do have amazing quality hair and I
really did love and enjoy the last way
that I got from them I'll list that
video in the description box like I said
so definitely check that out but I'm
going to run my fingers through this now
and see what it is
you'll be okay so basically this is what
this is giving cuteness like I'm so
excited I haven't cut the lace off yet I
have to do some tweezing of course and
that's I'm just showing you guys how the
hair looks before I like pull it out way
too much I believe this is how much I'm
going to pull it out basically how much
hair I believe out on the side and to
lay this down if you want it if you want
it to blend out a little bit more you
can use like tape we'll get you some
face glue or you can get you elastic
band
you some concealer that's coming like
your skin tone and this is NW 50 studio
finish concealer from mac for me and i'm
going to take a concealer brush and just
touch on some things in the front that i
may feel like it can be a little darker
you can like split your baby pairs down
if you want to but in this video i'm not
really going to focus on there I'm
really excited for this look and I hope
you guys really really enjoyed this I
did a lot in this video it would really
mean a lot if I can get a lot of likes
on this I know that you like a video I
will continue doing those type of videos
but I really do think best place here
for providing this wig to show you guys
how to style and get a natural-looking
appearance with your wigs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
