and talk to you guys about how I'm going
to be taking care of my hair while I'm
in Miami I have to showed you guys
makeup for Miami this makeup look
just practicing I don't know if I like
it enough to where I will see how it
looks when I record but I mean it looks
cute it's something simple but I think I
might be a little bit more simpler than
this because it's just me when I'm on a
trip I think I'm going to just do
something a little bit more Brown and
sultry versus like having this like kind
of like whatever situation is on my lids
I'm obviously going to be getting into
the water right so I showed you guys um
like how to layer how I layered this
hair and I also showed you guys how to
make sure it's thing like tame
throughout the day so now I'm going to
show you guys how I'm going to take care
of it if I do get in the water so this
is my baby the Aussie shampoo what just
happened why am I not clear
let's go camera come on okay so this is
my baby right here this is the eysie
shampoo and of course you want to go
ahead and pick up the conditioner that
goes to this as well so I'm just going
to be pumping the conditioner in my hand
I will take a little bit of the shampoo
because this shampoo this is the mecca
voice champ ooh so you guys know how
sometimes shampoo strips your hair of
greatness
I feel like this shampoo doesn't do that
even though it's not a sulfate free
shampoo I feel like whatever ingredient
this has in it it just makes everything
look really really nice and also makes
your hair feel like is getting the
moisture that you need when you are
shampooing your hair versus it being dry
and brittle and all weird and then when
you go and put the conditioner in it
brings your hair back to life well this
shampoo doesn't do that it brings your
hair to life as soon as you put it on
your hair and then the conditioner is
just even better I have to run out
really quick and get some more
conditioner and some more deep
conditioner so I'll be right back I'm
back that was like a 20-minute trip so
let me show you guys what I've bought we
could do michael noland like a little
haul broke loose from
so I bought me a new 3 minute miracle
deep conditioner and three times the
moisture from Ozzy I bought me my new
conditioner and lord have mercy and I
put these little five no four packets
why does why does this a five piece
travel kit oh I guess because of this
situation cool I guess I bought this
like travel kit from Walmart so nothing
spills on anything I don't have time for
that I bought me two of them if you guys
didn't know my favorite color is pink I
bought me a new toothbrush so I don't
have to travel with the one I already
have
I bought me this hill softener by
Palmer's because I don't want my pills
to be ashy while I'm out there either I
also bought this hair insurance leave-in
conditioner from Ozzie I never tried
that and I'm gonna try that today bought
me some baby wipes because I like wiping
my booty with some baby wipes I really
don't like tissue tissues annoying to me
of course I get the ones that don't have
any scent so this is the fragrance free
soft insensitive skin baby wipes and
then I have the little hats for you to
brush I'm gonna give the blue one to my
best friend I'm gonna keep the pink one
for myself and I have me a travel sized
since the dying toothpaste I have
sensitive teeth though I'm going to show
you how I'm going to be taking care of
my hair for the trip so we're gonna do
this as no we're gonna make this as easy
as possible
I'm gonna take my towel around my
shoulders or this is also just how to
take care of loose wave hair in general
so I would just spray the hair I would
kind of like you're in shape or whatever
the case may be
so I'll drench the hair right in water
stop breathing so hard okay so what I'm
gonna do next is take this Aussie voice
conditioner so then I'm gonna pump it in
my hand I just might taking two squirts
cuz it's know is unnecessary to go ahead
and go handle this
but of course if this was ocean water I
would put the shampoo in there because
you know I just would want to get I
would want to get all of the like ocean
salt water and all that stuff out of my
hair so I would use shampoo but right
now of course I don't have that in my
hair so I'm not gonna even play that
game with you guys today so I would like
leaving the conditioner in my hair for
at least like 20 minutes you may not
have enough time to do all of that one
vacation but find this I'm gonna do it
because it will make a huge difference
with your hair if you do leave the
conditioner in your hair for about a
couple of them a couple of minutes like
maybe even ten minutes it's fine you
don't have to leave in air for twenty
because knowing me I would I won't have
the time to leave it in for 20 minutes
unless I get up earlier now you don't
have to do this every day I'll let you
get into the water everyday and then you
will have to you don't want to just keep
putting product on top of like ocean saw
here that's just a little bit
trifling if I do say so myself ten
minutes for this and I'll be right back
so I'm not gonna do the deep conditioner
today but once again this is really
really amazing if you feel like your
weave is a brittle and disgusting and
trifle and it needs some life use this
again this is the 3 minute miracle three
times the moisture a deep conditioner
from Aziz so it will be linked in the
description box below so that brings
your weaves back to life so use that if
you feel like you need to the best thing
about this hair is not curly it's not
deep wave it's like a loose wave so it
is loose wave hair so I feel like this
is the perfect hair for vacation because
you know sometimes if you vacate with
curly hair it's so hard to detangle if
you arguing it's a salt water it can be
a real hassle for you to try to detangle
it and make everything you know all
pretty again so that kinda is really
annoying for some people but it's still
really pretty hair of course curly hair
is always really pretty but you know
sometimes it can you can do it with
shedding and nape in the back of your
neck or whatever the case may be and
then deep way of saying things
deep way if you don't have a really good
like good quality if you don't have
really good quality deep ways that can
also be the problem cuz deep white hair
is obviously less coiling than curly
hair but it's still like a really deep
prominent wave so it's deep wave napes
up in the backyard neck and can be
really annoying with loose wave it still
gives you a really pretty pattern I feel
like people well I can't say that
because I don't know who thinks that but
if you do get body wave I feel like
people want this look whipped body waves
so get away from body wave because I
feel like with body wave hair as soon as
you wash it it's not giving you a wave
like this like you don't think body wave
is looking like this who knew when it
cuz it doesn't it's a slight wave but
it's nothing like this so loose wave is
the perfect hair texture for somebody
that wants a really pretty wave but
wants it to look natural and effortless
and it's really easy to manage if you
are born on vacation obviously as you
can see I just put conditioner in there
for ten minutes and this is how nice it
looks so what I'm going to do is take
this leave-in conditioner like I said
this is the first time I ever use this
and also when I was telling you guys
before was I use all of these products
all over my natural hair tubes so even
though it's not a sulfate-free line I
just thought what it does to my natural
hair this smells pretty good
it says it it says it instantly tamed
softens and smoothes hair so and it also
has a really nice smell to it I really
can't put my finger on what it smells
like but it smells good so just know
that enough cook and of course what on
vacation you want your hair to smell
good you don't want to have to put a lot
of heat on your hair because then you'll
start walking around smelling like a
flatiron
and you don't want that if you go into
somebody's beach I feel like you will
want this look now what you can do to
keep this look so when you are if you
want to keep this look for the day that
way wave you look just add the mousse
now and you might want to add a little
bit of hairspray in your mousse or you
can just get that moves back it's
crunchy and you know it makes your hair
hard but I don't like that so what I
would do is just take that leave-in
conditioner and then I was taking my
salon graphic hairspray put it on my
hand and then scrunch it up like that
and then if you have a diffuser attached
to your blow-dryer you would just want
to like do this with it and then it
won't get big and get you that crunchy
look but I don't like that so I'm doing
the crunchy look I want my hair to look
like this so then what I would do is
just add the hairspray right now and it
would it will dry like that I will add
the hairspray in the mousse and then it
will dry just like this and that will
make me happier then using a diffuse I'd
I'm going to tell on this trip I will be
sleeping with my wig on so this is what
I would do at night so I won't finger
comb with this pattern I don't feel the
need to use a brush just detangle the
hair with your fingers it will cause
less shedding and it will be easier for
you to feel like you don't have to go
and find your brush on your trip so
these pieces really matter like up in
here you need to definitely get into the
root of your hair so when your hair does
dry this hairs up here is a really soft
as well so don't neglect your frontal
because you want your frontal to look
like the bottom half of your hair as
well
okay so that's that so now that we got
this going oh I forgot to tell you I
don't dry my hair with the towel I dry
my hair with a t-shirt so that place up
in that plays a huge role with your
natural hair and with your weaves
because if you dry your actual natural
hair with a towel it will just make your
hair brittle it will break off it will
cause like tension to your hair
and it will add friends so a towel
doesn't do any of that I mean a t-shirt
doesn't do any of that put a t-shirt on
my natural hair and on my weaves
so yeah that's another pointer so what I
would do is braid it if you don't want
to braid it you can always twist any
doll take three sections and cross them
over it
each section if that makes sense and
obviously you need some elastic bands so
if you have any hair ties or rubber
bands that will work
start braiding all the way down
so that isn't that make sure you do this
pretty tight so I can stay it's no point
of doing this if it's not gonna be able
to stay at night because you're just
wasting your time if you try to make it
all loose and this will add a lot more
definition also when it dries and you
also will have another hairstyle so if
you don't if you like that braid out
look this would definitely give you that
and then you can wear your hair another
style later on during the day if you
want to this little guy right here isn't
lifesaver this is just out this is a
headband or a head wrap whatever you
want to call it you get it from your
local beauty supply store it does have
velcro but each size so you can secure
it just like that so what I would do is
putting my right hand my frontal area
and put it just like this I won't put it
underneath my braids cuz then you know
you can't cause your weight to lift up
and fall off just put it just like this
okay
and that is that that is how I will be
doing my hair at night when my vacation
so I don't have to worry about waking up
in the morning having to reapply my ways
or whatever the case may be I will be
bringing my mega hold hairspray my mega
haul hairspray from salon graphics to
lay down my wigs as well as this mega
hold spritz from Fantasia I think that's
how I used to pronounce it but this
stuff is amazing and it holds really
really nicely so yeah I will bring this
as well and I will be doing other styles
like you guys know my pony tail
extension tutorials I will be doing my
hair like that using my eco styling gel
and yeah so this hair once again guys is
from Alyssa hair I will link it in the
description box below
this is a hair that I will be wearing on
vacation I will be bringing another
bundle from
random company and I will also bring
another wig as well but I feel like this
wig will be the one that you guys have
tons of questions about so that's why I
decided to do three videos on this hair
company hair because you know why not it
is some pretty hair and I really feel
like you guys will enjoy it yourself
I'll work with you listen Eve in the
past may have another video on my
channel for this company and I think is
also forcing the deep way of hair so
maybe do some research do some research
on this company just don't take my
opinion but my bundles are amazing this
is 26 inches check their review section
up on their website and all of that good
stuff
watch other people that have reviewed
this hair on youtube but yeah I love you
guys thank you so much for watching and
I will leave their information in the
description box below once again I love
you and I hope to see you soon bye
before I got off the camera I do have
another tip for you guys if you do have
straight hair and you want to do this to
tame your hair or just to get some
moisture back into your hair because
like I said all the products that night
they use today brings like it
rejuvenates is that a good word it
brings your weaves back to life like
seriously especially this stuff right
here this saved so many wigs that I had
that I felt like was turning into a
disaster after a while back to life but
if you do have string hair and you're
trying to get like a loose wave look
this style will be it for you just braid
your hair just like this and I will go
in with this mega hold hairspray or even
this Fritz but what I would do if you do
use this instead of this I will add a
little bit of water in my hand after you
spray this into your hand and then just
put it on your hair just like this just
like go downwards bunny and then just
let your hair air-dry don't put any heat
on it or anything like that but you have
to make sure your hair is completely dry
before you take these braids out or
straight hair so you will be able to
have a long-lasting like braids out
loose wave kind of look washed your hair
because it is straight hair and it's not
supposed to be wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
