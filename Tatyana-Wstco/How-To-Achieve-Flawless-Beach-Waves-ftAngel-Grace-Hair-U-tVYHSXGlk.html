angel grade Brazilian body wave hair
this video is so oh this voiceover is so
new but we're just going to begin this
video Napoli's so I am going to be using
the hot glue gun method for this wig
because I was being really lazy and I
didn't feel like sewing my hair down
just because I had so much going on
during the time so it's not overlapping
I am cutting these wets but it's okay
it's okay just make sure you cut it
perfect so you saw all you need is a hot
glue gun you can get it from Michael's
or Walmart you choose some mini hot glue
gun sticks if you have a mini hot glue
gun and get you a styrofoam head or you
can get to like a block head from Amazon
there at a reasonable price but this is
what I had on hand during the time so
that is what I'm using and it makes my
unit still look really good hot on my
date so you can get this from your
beauty supply store if you don't want to
do the Amazon thing and then the next
thing you're going to need is a perfect
size dumb cat okay whatever you do get
you a dumb pet that fits really snug to
your head because you don't want to lose
that e you don't want to have a tight
mommy that is having your eyeballs
gathered out of your head by the end of
the day you want everything to fit
really snug and you don't want to have
to get an elastic band or combs or
anything of that nature
you want the dome cap to just lay really
flat the one that I'm using is the
stylist collection spandex dome cap and
this is perfect for me so all I'm doing
is measuring the webs to the dome cap
and I'm just going to glue them down
onto the dome cap and that's pretty much
all that I'm doing I hope you guys enjoy
this part of the video I'm going to come
and talk to you guys towards the end
when it comes to style so I can explain
to you guys how to get these cute curls
but I hope you guys enjoy I'll see you
towards the end
okay so take the curling iron and then
we're going to straighten the hair
pretty much and my friend Lana my
curling iron is a really freaking hot
that's why I love this curling iron and
I will never throw it away cause fish it
gets smokin so what we're going to do is
curl the hair towards our face pretty
much use your hand to wrap it around the
barrel and make sure you bring it all
the way up on the hair and then make
sure where the ends are completely
inside the curling iron like such and
then let it sit for a little bit and
after you let it sit take it out let it
cool off a little bit in your hand bring
it down take the end of the curl and
make it completely straight
you can go over a couple of times or
just once
depends on how straight it is and you
want to basically do it like that
alright then what you want to do is pull
the hair apart and this is how you'll be
able to tell if the pieces are straight
enough for your liking and for me after
life it can be they still have a curve
and you want to make sure it is like
bone straight almost like that okay and
they just wanted to bring let the hair
go I'm going to use my fingers to rest
of the hair and that was just loosen the
wave or curl whatever you want to call
this up a little bit and then as you can
see the ends of the hair are completely
straight about the top it's curled so
that's how you can get those look baby
loves now I have to leave now but so far
Ally pearls body wave hair is really
freaking nice I'm in love with it so far
I've put a lot of heat on this hair and
it's holding up really good so I hope
