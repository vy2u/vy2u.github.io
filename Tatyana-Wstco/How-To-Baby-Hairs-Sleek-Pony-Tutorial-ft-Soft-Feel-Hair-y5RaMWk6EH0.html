video today I am gonna be showing you
guys how to get this week she homies
helps out a part or anything like that
you know you can just wear this wherever
you want to because this look is very
suitable for any any any event occasion
or whatever all you gonna mean is a buns
oh okay
a nice nice bun dough I always recommend
you working with human hair for looks
like this because you can do a lot to
the bundle you can straighten and curl
it whatever you want to do add water you
know to get a nice little subtle wave
going on if you use synthetic hair it's
just going to be a little bit more
harder to maintain maintain the hair and
keep up with it and you're able to reuse
the bundle if it's human here you know
synthetic hair after you know where for
awhile it starts just getting matted and
crazy you can get your bundles online
Beauty Supply Store you can already have
a bundle at home whatever floats your
boat to make this look work for you
please use it I will always recommend
you guys using a texture that mimics
your hair the bundle that I am going to
be using today is from soft fills hair
it's so freaking luscious and pretty and
amazing and I'm so excited to be using
this for this look today I'll always be
Brazilian hair because it matches my
actual texture and I love it so this is
another bundle from this company once
again this is soft fills hair I'm not
receiving any fast mail from this
company's bun nose okay ain't no well
this one doesn't have a foul smell and
I'm sure
this one doesn't either I've worked with
this company in the past I work with
their curly texture so the fact that
their body wave is as you know soft as
their curly I'm really really pleased
with that and you know if they would
have brought his fingers the way and be
like let's just get started Apes let's
just get started
I like crazy by name but it's cool if
you guys want this makeup look let me
know yeah so what you're gonna need is
hair ties I'm gonna use two because I'm
eventually like wet my hair so it's
gonna be curly and it's gonna be a hot
mess
so I'm gonna have to use two hair ties
these are the goodies hair ties these
are my favorite hair ties they're at the
ones with the without the middle and if
you are gonna put your hair in a
ponytail please use the ones without the
meadow so you don't rip off any of your
hair okay so my favorite thing to use to
slick my hair down is the Eco styling
gel you guys know know about this I
actually found out they sell this in the
freaking dollar store I was in the other
day and I was just like holy I can
tell them that they can find it at the
 da store whatever I like
using a two sided brush to get my hair
slick I don't know should I do it like
up or should I do it like this so I'm
gonna take somebody go styling Joe now a
good amount of this to get that sleek
look that we all like
and of course go under like that yeah
don't forget about your bag because you
don't want the bag to not be popping you
should make a metal part or inside part
but today I'm just going to slick it all
back because that's kind of the vibe I'm
filling with this makeup look and this
is when the hair ties come along but of
course you want to make sure the back
part is smooth as well
go over with the soft side of the brush
now and we're just going to make sure
everything is smooth down just spray the
rest of my hair and then we're going to
put it in a little bun take a real
really small elastic band wrap your hair
around to a bun
and secure it like that this is really
soft guys we're really ready sauce I'm
excited I'm excited I'm excited we take
the little wet I'm going to take the web
I'm going to take the west of this track
and stick a small piece right in like my
button area and I'm gonna take little
small hair that is on this small piece
of web right here just to wrap around
the web and secure the web down okay so
this is no bobby pin team I'm out of
here
I don't like bobby pins so I don't use
bobby pins now I'm going to start
wrapping the West around the base of the
button from the base of the bun and I'm
making sure that the web is aligned with
the other wax I don't want any West
right off I don't want the West to be
all kind of crazy looking at
lining it with the rest of the web
making it making sure that they're
lining up right on top of each other and
there's nothing crazy going on okay
I'm trying to say all right so you see
that there's nothing like there's no
craziness everything looks like it's
like a market in place where it's
supposed to be what you want to do girl
that is what you want it to look like
now you can pull it as tight as you want
to
don't make it too tight because you will
like it in the headache throughout the
day so what I'm going to do is just
continue wrapping this around and then
we're going to take so now what we're
going to do is take um a piece from the
back and then just lay it down I'm going
to take a little bit more on the Eco
styling on my hair so it can look really
really sleek
my hair to brush and just you know use a
little bit of that Yuko styling gels so
I can make sure any gaps are filled and
everything looks really full like it's
supposed to
go over the top all right so now what
you want to do is just make sure you
don't have any stupid pieces like this
trying to ruin your life of this eco
styler in jail I mean ego styling gel
take a little bit of this leaving
conditioner on the tube brush and then
I'm just gonna start moving my edges
around how I want it to be
I'm soft those hair information will be
listed in the description box below I
hope you guys enjoyed the video thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you babies in my next one bye this hair
and its stuff freakin popping mic you
guys need to get it
it's super soft it's just hitting my
back like bitch I got inches okay inches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
