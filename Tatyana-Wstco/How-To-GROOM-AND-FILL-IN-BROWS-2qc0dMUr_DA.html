well as how I fill them in nowadays so I
hope you guys enjoy
I didn't blend out the concealer all the
way because I am about to finish my face
I'm not to wash this mask off but yeah
but I just wanted to do the brow
tutorial for you guys so I can have like
updated brow look just shaping my brows
this is usually how I rock my brows I
don't put any concealer on the top I
don't feel like it's necessary because I
cleaned up the top pretty good so I
don't really feel like I need any
concealer underneath there and as well
as the bottom but like I said I'm just
doing this because I'm about to finish
my eye look and put makeup on so anyway
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you babies in my next one bye
alright babe so what I'm gonna do today
I'm so up in self and person now it's
because we're about to snatch these
birth outs because I've been trying to
do a video for the last three days and
it hasn't been coming out fleeky cuz my
brows have been mad crazy I was kind of
trying to roll one of my brows out I
think it was this one because I kind of
shaped it weird yeah I don't even have
anything on my face I don't have any
moisturizer I just have this mask on and
I'm trying to calm my skin down I've
been using some new products because the
products that I recently have been using
I don't think it's working for me okay
so I'm gonna take it back to step 1 but
you guys want to know all of the new
stuff that I've been using on my skin
let me know in the comment section and I
would love to make like an updated
skincare routine video for you guys but
today's about these brows like I said I
kinda have to speed up this process
because my camera is about to die I just
need to put a little bit of moisturizer
oh my forehead cuz I think it looks how
they dry right them up right now see
what I need to you know trim and cut and
stuff like that my browser so Bush you
guys it makes no sense it might not even
look that bush you're on camera but
they're really bushy right now so what
I'm gonna do is take
I grabbed razor you can get it from your
local beauty supply store don't you just
taking all of this extra hair that I may
have around my brow and I just like to
shape them and get rid of them right so
hopefully you guys can see that any
extra hairs that's all the way up here I
just like getting them off
