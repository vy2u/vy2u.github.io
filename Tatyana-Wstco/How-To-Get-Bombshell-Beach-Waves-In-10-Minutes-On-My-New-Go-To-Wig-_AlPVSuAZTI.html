another video today I'm gonna be sharing
with you guys this unit from best lace
wigs I'm gonna be showing you guys how I
achieved these water wave beachy waves
on this unit very very simple this is
their 360 Brazilian party wave unit it
will be listed in the description box
below and you guys are probably gonna
ask me toss either the wig come this
color no baby it did not I actually had
to get this color myself I will list
everything that I use in the description
box below so yeah but anyway about these
curls so this is the so professional
curling wand that I'm gonna be using
today I actually picked this up from TJ
Maxx
it was a steal honey because it was only
twenty dollars and it came with four
different barrel heads
this is the medium barrel though so I
will leave that information in the
description box below so yeah so what
I'm doing is laying the hair flat on the
barrel and I'm keeping a inch of hair
out of the barrel so it can give that
beachy wavy kind of effect and I don't
want like a tight coyly curls so that's
why I don't put all of the hair on the
barrel at the bottom just because I want
that beachy effect so yeah so that's
pretty much it and I also want to let
you guys know that I alternate my curls
so some curls are going away from my
face others are going towards my face I
sprayed the hair with a little bit of
hairspray and I let the hair sit for
about 10 minutes and I use my comb just
to comb through these curls so yeah but
I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the
video I will let you guys enjoy the
music and I will see you guys in my next
one don't forget to thumbs up comment
share and subscribe I'll see you baby
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
