I've been away I was actually went out
of town for my mom's birthday party and
I took some extra time just to be with
the family you know just to feel the
love and support and just you know
couple things and just let them know
that I still love them and miss them you
know yeah so shout out to my family I
got inspired by my mom's birthday party
her theme was turquoise and she had an
amazing birthday like I was so glad that
I could make it and she had a blast I'll
put some pictures up of the party it was
so freaking beautiful so I got inspired
and I wanted to do these so if you can't
see all the colors I'm not surprised
it's just the lighting and how bright it
is but I really freakin love how the
color came out I'll have all kinds of
pictures all over my social media let's
get into V shine hair and how it's
holding up so I actually
Felicia's hair from that color that you
saw in that previous be shot an unboxing
video so that was like a 1b and I
bleached it to a 213 and I got so much
freaking shedding but it was okay
because it was my fault I didn't steal
the West and if you're doing something
that drastic in a short amount of time
you're going to get a lot of shedding
but I know how to take care of the hair
after just to hold the shedding down to
a minimum the hair to a 213 i toned the
hair and then I went with periwinkle pop
from Sally's Beauty Supply Store I got
an ex IBEW supply story it's not five
dollars Beauty Supply Store but I went
with that color periwinkle pop I'll list
the actual product in the brand name
down below or probably somewhere in this
video and it was it's a really pretty
color it's like a baby bluish kind of
feel and I really like that color but it
wasn't the color that I was going for I
really wasn't trying to do anything baby
blue so I had to also pick up a navy
blue dye from
and I got that one for my local beauty
supply store so what I did was took a
lot of conditioner put a dash of that
navy blue in that conditioner and I mix
it up so that's where you see the darker
parts going throughout and then the
other parts are the periwinkle and I
mixed up some other different shades but
other than that that's basically all
that I did to this hair to get to that
cover so navy blue periwinkle and the
hair doesn't shed like crazy anymore at
all you do get a few strands here and
there just because like I said I did do
a lot of bleaching but it's not anything
too crazy if you do want to do anything
213 from a 1b in a day sell your whips
probably want to save a lot of hair if I
did still my webs but it's okay because
like I said I still love how the hair
looks it's still freaking for you
wouldn't even tell that a lot of
shedding came out of a bug though or two
but they cut the hair into some layers I
did a lot of trimming to the hair just
basically all that I want to say about
this hair it's not this blue okay
I did this video in royal daylight
because this looks like royal blue I
don't know if it's just because I'm on
the viewfinder and that's how it looks
in a mock computer it may look different
with turquoise inspired so it was all
different kinds of shades of turquoise
going throughout the house and I was
really inspired because she looked
beautiful in that color Shh
I got my nails done in that color for
her for her party my stepdad was in that
color my brothers and sisters was in
that color but of course meeting tatiana
that's trying to find an album a could
not find anything to lose and I freaking
fell in love with the results I watched
the air out and then I D condition the
hair for 35 minutes and the hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
