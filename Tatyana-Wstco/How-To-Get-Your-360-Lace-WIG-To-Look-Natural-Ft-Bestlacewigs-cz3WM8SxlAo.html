wig from bestest wigs and I'm so excited
because this is one of their 360 150%
Brazilian straight units and I love it
so I've been wearing this hair off and
on for maybe two weeks now and it's just
given me so much life in the beginning
of this video
well when we start you're going to clean
me unboxing it and then you're going to
see me end up looking like this so when
you see me in the bandana that was two
weeks ago and now today is me showing
you guys another way to wear this unit
which is how I created these two braids
and shade them load the rest of the hair
and I ended up straightening the hair
for the first time with a straightener
today and this is how much is it has my
unit looking so I'm really pleased with
this unit all their information will be
listed in the description box below
this is best length length unit I'll put
this down number below as well and yeah
so let's begin this any of those this is
how the 360 wig is looking so this one
has four combs one on each side which is
this one one in the middle like at the
top and then one in the back in the
middle and then they have the drawstring
that you can adjust so it can fit really
snugly on your head I'm cutting the legs
off I don't want to put it too close to
anything so the first cut is going to be
me pretty much getting the large amount
of lace off of this unit and then the
second cut is going to be a little bit
more
Zito's so I don't cut any hairs or any
baby hairs or anything like that so the
front looks like it's a good density I
always tell you guys do not cut the lace
off on the wigs if you don't like the
wig try the wig one with the lace on and
if you don't like it you can return it
but if you cut the lace off of the wig
it's just a no bueno they're not going
to allow you to give
all right so this is basically what I'm
getting out of this this is what you can
do with your baby here text female nine
times out of ten after I paint the baby
hairs and I get them to lay in a place
that I want them to and do the lengths
that I want them to have messed them up
the next day and then I'm off with like
a natural-looking appearance but I'm
showing it like when I say the pair is
really friggin sauce like really fun
this is like the perfect density to
actually put your hair in a ponytail
knotting ends up really nice if you guys
are wondering about that really
natural-looking it really nice and it's
a perfect density faucet you haven't
really liked this way is just another
gems and I receive from best lace wings
and I hope you guys enjoy
for today so you just cute stout and
have your hair down and what I'm going
to do is because I use my hairspray to
lay the lace down completely because as
you see in the video it is lifting up
and I don't want that to happen to me
all day so I'm just using this little
stretchy wrapping paper it's stuff that
usually used to mold and using a
duckbill clip and twisting it around and
I'm going to let it sit on my hair for
maybe like 10 minutes so you can do that
and then I'm going to come back when
it's finished and I'm going to take the
baby hair that I had created just going
to use water because I don't want
anything too crazy oh but it's like the
comb is literally right here if you can
see it and I just don't like that so I
don't really and put this hair up it's
not really that bad but if you wanted to
do like a high ponytail it's not gonna
work for you but yeah I'm going to let
this dry a little bit and I'm going to
come back and show you guys the results
it looks really good to me and I'm so
excited because I know you guys are
probably going to love this unit as much
as I do because it's just so poppin like
and I just can't believe that this is
actually a freakin wig honestly because
the lace play is really flat the lace
matches my skin color really good and
everything just looks really natural the
density is a hundred and fifty percent
once again and I think it's a very
natural
looking density you can bump it up to
180 just depends on your preference so
yeah I hope you guys enjoy this video
thank you so much for watching and all
that information will be listed in the
description box below and yeah I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
