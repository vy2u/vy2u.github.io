review and this is willing to be well
this is basically going to show you guys
how I maintain curly hair this is a unit
from China based wave so I will list
their information in the description box
below this is there a Brazilian deep way
360 unit so yeah I lay this from so
using some hose and spray in the front
to kind of make it look a little bit
more natural looking great around my
hairline area and I also spray
underneath the lace and that's what
pretty much gets it to hold really good
and then I'll just use my blow-dryer at
all sides and some like you know that
white wrapping paper that you put around
your head to make everything lay down if
you guys know what I'm talking about I
use that to lay it down you can use a
scarf but I just had those I purchased
mine from Sally's Beauty Supply stores
so yeah that's how I get to lay it and
you don't have to use the whole de spray
you can use got to be glue you know
that's your thing out there whatever but
you know honestly I really want to get
got to be glue to try again I tried it
today and it's still super messy
and I hate that it is not working
me I just don't understand how y'all can
do it I don't know how y'all have the
patience to even hold it down that long
so it can get tacky but I'm going to get
this dust we glued methods and that is a
unit it has four cones jaw strength and
you know it does sit really snug so I'm
really pleased with the wig but other
than that I have been wearing a lot
that's why I was crazy today I was
wearing it I was going to three weeks
now so yeah we all those beats on the
hair it's holding up really good as you
can see is really soft really manageable
and it's just flawless and I get a lot
of compliments on it so I'm just taking
some water in a water bottle and spring
it on the hair there's no mixture in
here there's no hair products or
anything
start with the ins first because you
don't want to join it's not
necessary to drench the hair completely
but at the same time you want to get it
to a level of dampness you know you
don't want it to be extremely like wet
because it's understand what took some
of my Cantu coconut curling cream free
of all that harsh stuff so
works really well on hair like this so I
didn't really combing out I didn't want
to I didn't want to break the hair up
and then I caused it to be like you know
really really wavy that's what I'm
trying to say or maybe was just because
I was being amazing but I kind of just
use my fingers to break it up you don't
really need a paddle brush just grab the
section of your hair that you have not
touched yet do the same thing water
spray it towards the edge and then just
make everything
and then you also want to make sure you
get the top two now like right up in
here because that can get like matted
and dry and ratchet look it you want to
make sure you get that area and then
kind of like break it up a little bit
before you put the product in there oh
you want to mix the hair sample all the
big hair you don't let me dry pieces
left because of this gourds cause
problems when the hair starts to drying
some parts are not going to be as poufy
and others or some parts this may not
look as you know um wavy and really
pretty just like some other pieces so
make sure you pay attention to that or
to take a little bit of that curling
Korean from can to on and then this much
this much will work you know you don't
need to really feel me a lot run it
through your fingers and your palms of
your hand and then you can scrunch it up
or do like that I like doing like this
towards the top and scratching at the
bottom
make sure you get up here too you don't
want the hair to start drying and then
the topping flicking ratchet and then
the bottom is slang you know or the rest
of the hair is man so yeah this is
basically how I take care of my curly
hair very simple do the same thing when
it comes to my natural hair I'll put a
little bit more oil in my actual hair
like my mimosa hair honey I have to put
this in my hair but do not ever put like
grease or oil like this and really you
know and we say you had hair for maybe
like four or five to six months and you
know you took it out or you're trying to
revamp your curly hair maybe it's
bundles maybe it's a wig what you want
to do the same sex book hits which you
also have to do you have to make sure
you deep condition your hair but
whatever you are using just make sure
it's free of like harsh chemicals or
whatever or leave the conditioner in
their hair for almost like up to an hour
let it air dry and it's going to look
super phenomenal through your column so
you don't lose a lot of hair but always
remember starts from bottom to top or
you can just use a paddle brush and just
eliminate all the hassle of snagging and
ripping your natural nails as well but I
don't backed up so it's cool I didn't
really have to pluck a lot up the front
you know but I did have to go in and
tweet a little bit more like maybe on
the sides before it would like more so
up here but the pre plus is really true
if it looks very natural to you up there
