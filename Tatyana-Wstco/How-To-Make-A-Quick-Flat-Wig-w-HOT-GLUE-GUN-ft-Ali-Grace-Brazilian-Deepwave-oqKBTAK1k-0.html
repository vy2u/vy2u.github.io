into this video I'm using my favorite
zone caps to create this way today and
this is the stylist collection dome cap
this is the spandex dome cap and it fits
me so snug ladies like oh my god I don't
have to use any kind of elastic bands no
comb so nothing and a major key to a
popping wig is to make sure you find a
dome cap that is your size honey you
shouldn't have to go and find any
elastic bands or any crazy things like
that comb or Nothing you should be able
to pop this on and it should still like
it ain't going nowhere but you know
sometimes people want to do the extra
mile and do an elastic band which is
understandable but still at least find a
dome cap that's not too tight and not
too loose so as you see I already am
working on the closures I've centered
the closure in the middle of that dome
cap and use these nails to keep it in
place so once I start sewing as you see
right now it is not moving around and
just makes things a lot easier for me I
would use my pins but they are actually
in storage when I was doing this video
because I'm moving soon but okay so I'm
using three bundles of this hair because
I felt like the fourth bundle would have
been way too much I'm using my mini hot
glue gun and my mini high glue sticks
and I showed you the nylon threads that
I used to sew the closure down and
you're going to need some scissors so I
am measuring the hair right now and I'm
cutting the West and yet I am cutting
the web be careful on how you cut your
West because you can cause a lot of
shedding and damage to the hair because
you decide to cut the West nine times
out of ten I am overlapping my West when
I do create ways for myself this is
another method that I wanted to share
with you guys it's a really simple
method so just make sure you be careful
the hot glue gun can burn you please try
to do really small pieces
you know like I'm doing right here and
then placing it on the dome cap because
if you try to do the whole West and then
place it on the dome cap some pieces may
be dry some pieces may still be tacky
but it will be a hot mess and you will
have to redo it you know continue using
all of your glue and you just want to
you know take your time be neat with
this situation because you want
everything to look flawless and smooth
if this was a full-throttle so and honey
so I'm going to be doing this throughout
the wig tutorial and right you don't
want any you know large spaces or large
gaps you know if you have less hair than
three bundles you may want to space the
bottom out a little bit more and then
focus on making the top a little bit
more fuller but yeah I'm starting to
detangle the hair now as you can see and
I'm just using my spray bottle with some
water in it just plain old water and
then I'm using wide toothed comb and the
paddle brush to detangle this hair so
pretty I was so in love with his hair
and still am in love with his hair this
video is pretty old but this voiceover
is new so the last thing I have to do is
just to make sure everything is secure
at the top and make sure everything is
laying how long would like it to lay and
make sure nothing is showing and no no
solid black parts of the dome cap is
just peeking through so you want
everything to look as full as possible
at the top and yeah so you're ready to
slay so I'm going to do the same thing
to the closure and that's just using
some water to detangle it and I'm using
my paddle brush on this portion and you
want to start from bottom to top because
you want to do as much damage you know
by pulling less hair out by doing this
method and you don't want to start from
top to bottom because you're going to
pull more hair out by doing that I did
get a couple of strands but what do you
think this is deep wave hair so you have
to be tangle it you have to break it
apart so I'm just placing the hair pre
kind of innocence in the center putting
a little crazy part in the center
because that's how I want to wear it I
don't really like any perfect parts
because it's just too perfect I feel and
it doesn't really look natural looking
but I didn't want to show you guys the
ends because the ends are beautiful in
this hair I didn't cut anything I didn't
layer this hair everything is just
really perfect and I think you guys are
going to really really love this hair so
I'll leave all that information in the
description box below this is pretty
much all that I'm going to
with my ally great hair I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I'm going to let you
enjoy the rest without me talking I love
you all their information once again
will be in the description box below and
I hope to see you guys in my next video
