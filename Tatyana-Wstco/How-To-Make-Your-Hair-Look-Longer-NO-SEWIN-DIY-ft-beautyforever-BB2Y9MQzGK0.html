video today I'm going to be showing you
guys how to get this cute piggy tell
staff using my Beauty forever bundles so
let's get it started because it's very
simple so my hair was already in a style
before I started this book so that's why
my hair kind of looks cray-cray but it's
cool because my hair was already in a
middle part so it was really easy to get
this look done for you guys PS this
video is super old and that's why my
face still looks crazy in this video
you're gonna need a couple of elastic
bands ego styling gel water and of
course a two-sided brush and you're also
going to need some bundles and if you
click the link below you can get these
same exact bundles that I'm using in
this video which is beauty forever
Brazilian body wave bundles and yes
super super nice hair really soft really
easy to maintain it's really easy to run
my fingers through the lustre is really
pretty it's giving realistic vibes and
it match to my hair texture because you
know why because it's a Brazilian hair
and Brazilian always always gets the job
done for me so I'm never ever
disappointed when it comes to Brazilian
hair but you know of course you have to
test out the quality you have to make
sure you do your research and all that
good stuff but beauty forever definitely
has good hair so I'm not tripping about
it so as you can see I'm just flicking
and making sure I'm getting the
placement correct the placement of your
ponytail is up to you I like to have it
like at the bottom or the back of my
neck and yeah so really self-explanatory
just watch this part and when it's time
for me to start wrapping the rest around
my actual ponytail I will come back
is
you never
you will
all right babes now time for the fun
part so as you can see I'm wrapping my
hair into a little tiny bun and then
we're gonna start wrapping this West
around these little baby buns and super
easy so if you guys already seen how I
did my super sleek ponytail looks same
technique okay but we're just using two
bundles today and one bundle for each
side it's definitely your preference you
can put two bundles on each you know
ponytail not I because I want my edges I
want the nape of my neck to still be
full I just don't want to weigh my hair
down and cause a lot of tension to my
hair so what we're going to do is take
the West right take the West and we're
gonna wrap it around the ponytail and
we're going to use a little small piece
on the end of the web to secure
situation down and then we're going to
start taking the rest of the weft and
wrapping it around it's really hard to
explain but I'm a visual learner so
hopefully you guys are too so if you
guys have any questions let me know in
the comment section below and you just
want to take your time with it you want
to make sure the weft is lining up with
each other there's no like lumps or
anything like that and you want to make
sure you is secure enough you don't want
to have to apply too many bobby pins
okay I don't really like using bobby
pins I don't use bobby pins at all
unless I feel like I need me to but
bobby pins just gonna stab you in the
back and neck it's gonna give you a
headache you're gonna be frustrated and
I don't have time for that all you have
to do is just make sure you're putting
enough you know you know on your rap
that you feel real secure about it don't
have it super super tight and don't have
it super loose because it will you know
loosen up on you throughout your day and
you don't want that at all and then
you're gonna see in a minute after I get
to the end that I'm going to use the end
of the other side of the web just to
wrap around so you can look a little bit
more realistic
stop right here and you can cut off the
web or you can keep one and put the full
bundle in your heads
it's definitely up to you definitely up
to you so enjoyed this part
you never
you will
so alright babies this is how I keep my
little pony tail to piggy tail kind of
look I used two bundles to get this look
so one bundle one full bundle on this
side one full bundle on this side how
soft this hair is you guys know that
this it's gonna string really really
nice I don't like this look with like
stripey tails I just feel like that's
kind of like boring so I actually like
the little wave that is going along
right here and the hair is really really
pretty and really soft as you can see
there's no dead ends or anything like
that I do see a few flyaways but it's
nothing too crazy so just keep that in
mind and you can always just go wash the
hair shampoo and conditioner just to
kind of get the flyaways a little tame
but it's nothing crazy yeah the five
ways are not even bad at all I don't
even know why I said that
don't do different styles you can twist
your hair
don't make little cute little buns pin
it down like that and do the same thing
in the side just twist
all right babe so this is basically how
I get this look I hope you guys enjoyed
you so much for watching and I'll see
you babies in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
