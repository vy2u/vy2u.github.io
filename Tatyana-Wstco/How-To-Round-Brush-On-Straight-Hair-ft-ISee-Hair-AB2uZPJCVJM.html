video today I have my icy hair in and I
decided that I wanted to add a lot of
more a lot of more I wanted to add more
volume with his hair so I decided to cut
some layers into it today and I'm gonna
show you how to get your straight hair
from looking all flat and dull to having
all kinds of about bullying going on
with the layers so I'm just continuing
to watch see how I do the process I do
want to talk to you guys about I see
here it's just you know regular straight
hair it's nothing too crazy I just
wanted to add some character to the hair
and you'll see how it brings little hair
to life
it looks pretty you know basic right now
but the hair quality is really soft did
need some trimming at the end so that's
why I went ahead and just start cutting
it's not necessary to cut this blunt if
you don't want to but it just makes the
layer job look a little bit more bigger
so I feel like this video is more so a
video where you just watch and
understand and when you start getting to
the brown brush part all you need to
know is when you start around brushing
you need to get your round brush that
actually has the metal on the inside
because when you go to put the
blow-dryer on top of your head well on
the hair the round brush that has you
know the metal base is pretty much going
to curl the hair as if it was a curling
iron so I like putting the blow-dryer or
hot on a medium setting and then before
I let it go I like putting it around
cool so it can cool the hair down and
once it cools the hair down the hair
will look like it has like a really nice
curl to it so once again just watch you
know rewatch the video so you can get
the gist of it I did speed this video up
because it would be really really long
if I didn't do so but yeah I see hair
information will be linked in the
description box below make sure you
check that out I love you guys and I'll
see you guys in my next one
you always
hey baby love so this is basically what
I decided to do with my icy hair I know
this is a huge transformation
just from a straight boring look I like
doing my feel like this I used to do
this to my hair when I was in high
school and I loved how it turned out
it's wrong brush a round brush on dry
hair round brush when dry hair always
looks good so I hope you guys learned
something from this video I will tell
you guys how so pretty much do this
because I know you probably like how the
hell so you want to grab your hair from
the roots so like you can even like
brush it up and then start like making
the motion of a round brush so you can
kind of get the feel of how you're gonna
have to round your hair out and you can
see our hat put the layers in there
before I start doing this process just
so it could be way more easier it's up
to you how short you want your layers to
be and what I recommend you do is put
your this time is longer than this side
I just was pretty much finessing it
without really paying attention and my
glasses were in the way but it is
putting it on the lowest setting so it's
not below I'm really really high and as
soon as you get it to the lowest setting
as soon as you get the hang of putting
the blow-dryer on your hair while doing
this without burning yourself burning
your hand burning your chain while this
on your neck and then burning your skin
put it on the highest setting if you
start getting good at it when you start
getting good at it and then this process
will be a lot faster then when I like
doing after putting the blow-dryer on it
right after I put the blow dryer on high
heat I'm like putting the blow dryer on
a low setting and then putting it on
cool but in the blow-dryer to sit on my
hair and that's how we get the curl okay
and then that's what's gonna make the
curls stay and last a lot longer because
you're cooling your hair down with a
cool setting
and it's just going to keep the curl
kind of in place with the help of the
round brush and all of that good stuff
I got my round brush from Sally's Beauty
Supply Store this was probably like $20
but I believe it was like originally
like maybe 25 but I got it on sale this
is a good one because it has metal on
the inside of the brush so it heats up
so if I wanted to leave the round brush
on the hair for longer I can't do so and
then it's pretty much like I'm curling
my hair</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
