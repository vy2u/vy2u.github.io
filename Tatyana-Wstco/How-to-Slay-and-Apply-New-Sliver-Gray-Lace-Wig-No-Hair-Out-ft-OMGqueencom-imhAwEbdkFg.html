parent look honey and this is a new unit
from angie queen hair calm yes I am
selling it because of this color is
amazing so today I'm just going to be
showing you guys how I had to go in REE
customize the hair line for myself and
I'm also going to share with you guys
how I leave my units again yes again so
this is a pre plugs unit this is there
let me just read off the information
this is their Indian version highest
quality gray ombre silky straight 18
inch cap D glueless lace front wig cap
150 percent density light brown lace and
yeah this is their hot gray ombre long
lace wig high quality Indian virgin hair
so this information will be listed in
the description box below if you're
interested but like I said as you can
see it already has some pre plucked mr.
going on but I just felt like the
density around my hairline was still too
much for me so I have to go in and just
use some tweezers just to take some of
that hair out of the unit because I
don't need all of that around the front
I want it to be very gradient like and I
want it to be very natural looking so
that's what I'm going to be doing today
you want to just make sure you're
plugging in random areas and you also
want to make sure you're taking your
time because you do not want to cut the
lace and you do not want to punch a hole
into your lace you want to take your
time trust me
certain spots in this video are sped up
but I am actually going really really
slow so I'm just applying some water on
the front part of the way just so I can
remove all of that dead hair do not plus
and I just like adding the water just
because I don't want to snag or pull or
anything that you know doesn't need to
be pulled on and that's pretty much what
I'm going to do and I'm just going to
keep going back and forth finding areas
where I feel like need to be plus more
and tweeze and of course we're going to
customize some baby hairs and do all
that great cool stuff now about the
quality of this unit I really really
loved it it was so soft when I first
received it it's really soft now it's
actually on
head right now while I'm talking to you
guys but it is just like so amazing the
color is perfect like I love the color
honestly I thought the gray was going to
be like dark and just dead and dry but
this is like a like a silver like storm
Conda look and I really really love this
and I love going like all out and colors
like this so I usually don't have that
ombre effect going on I have it just
like plain like straight platinum from
root to tip but like I'm really selling
this ombre look and I just might know
start doing that just so I don't have to
be looking crazy all the time with just
the root to tip with one color but I
felt like this coloring job on this unit
was really really perfect it's not like
very it's not choppy at all and it's
going with the flow you know it's a very
clean ombre dye job so I was really
really pleased with that because I'm
always skeptical when it comes to wigs
that have this kind of color just
because it can look really choppy
sometimes and it doesn't look natural so
yeah so as you can see I'm still
plucking homegirl like I'm still who's
going we want to that gradient look we
want it to look like it's actually
coming out of our scalp and you can
always go in and add some foundation
underneath the lace if you don't want to
bleach the nuts the nuts I feel like can
be bleached but I did not go in and
brush them I felt like it was going to
be too much if I get onto that in this
video but I probably would do that in
the near future but if you guys do not
want to bleach the nuts on the video if
you guys do not want to bleach the nuts
on the unit you can always use your
foundation or your consumer underneath
the lace just to make sure you wash it
off once in a while just because you
don't want to break out just because you
keep putting old foundation or concealer
on your skin and that can just mess you
all the way up trust and believe me so
as you can see I'm just customizing
these baby hairs pulling out what I want
and then just brushing it back and I'm
bout to pop it on my head in a second
but here some before it's after Clips
I'm sorry my hand was still in the way
on the other one but you get the point
so yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed that
part
the video now is going to be about
applying it so now I'm using my salon
graphics pin Mac's holding spray you can
get this from Walmart for a couple of
bucks you guys know about this I just
spray it underneath my lace and then I
use of a blow dryer to make sure it's
secure now of course the combs and the
jaw straps on the unit make you super
secure but I just like taking the extra
step and that's why I like doing be
salon graphics Tim axe holding spray
just because I don't want the lace to be
moving around or I want it to look like
it's actually on my damn head coming out
of my damn scalp so you might have to go
in and retweet the baby hairs you might
have to take some more hair out of the
baby hairs whatever floats your boat
honey but I'm just using some motion
foam wrap to mold these baby hairs and
I'm going to also add some hairspray
just to tame them and but like I said
they two rows around your baby hairs are
going to be looking very effortless and
not for us so yeah so as you can see I
had to go back in and plug some more of
the hair out on that side for my baby
hairs and I'm just going to use a hair
toothbrush to tame them once again I'm
also going to part my unit on the right
side and I'm going to add some nw15
concealer into the part and I'm also
going to tweeze the part a little bit
more so it can look more visible so I
hope you guys enjoy the rest of the
video I'm going to stop talking now
because I feel like I've been talking
for about five freaking minutes and I
can't do right now so yeah all that
information will be listed in the
description box below
oh I do want to mention that the hair
should be straightened or if you put any
heat on this hair please let it be low
heat you do not want to miss this soon
it up okay like you want to keep this
unit really nice and really pretty for a
very long time because look at this
color it's amazing and I feel like
anybody and everybody can rock this but
at the same time you always want to take
care of your unit so if you have to use
heating protectant spray or if you have
to use the flat irons on this unit
please let it be on a low heat not too
high because you just don't want to miss
the quality up and I feel like this
color is so bright and like you know
light you don't want to get heat damage
on it or you don't want to have any
discoloration going on
in the unit so yeah so I'll let you guys
go now I love you all the information
will be listed once again in the
description box and I hope to see you
guys in my next video :
now kiss me engine
my heart I would never never ever hurt
you open my heart open my heart given to
you whole world I'm not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
