premiere lace wigs I know you guys seen
this unit in my previous video and you
guys were gagging over it so I didn't
want to inform you guys about that unit
in that video just because it was really
personal in our just was like I don't
got time but anyway so let me just get
into this info really quick so this is
premier lace wigs permanent roots hip
Indian really 10 inch natural color deep
middle part unit this is a medium cap
size I wish it was small but I believe
they're smaller out of stock 160 percent
density and light brown lace it has
adjustable straps as columns installed
and all of that good stuff it has about
4.5 lace party in the front so you can
do multiple styles you don't have to
keep the middle part but I really like
the middle part with these waves so I
wanted to keep it and as you can see in
the video I'm tweaking the middle part
well I'm trying to make it look more
visible so I'm just going to go in with
some tweezers and take all of that extra
hair that's in that part out of that
part and then I'm just going to go in
with a wet and wild nude eye pencil just
to go in that part in to make it look a
little bit more like natural then I'm
going to add some NW 50 concealer from
mac on top of that so it can complement
my skin complexion because the new
pencil is just all the way off from my
skin complexion but I just like how it
brings out the NW 50 concealer a little
bit more I did wish the not so if you
guys see some discoloration that is from
the not bleaching and that's why I'm
kind of going in to fix all of that
trial and error with the not reaching
but it's cool it's still going to let
you guys know how low maintenance this
unit is like super low maintenance the
curl pattern is amazing this is its
natural curl pattern I did co-wash this
hair in the past because I've been
wearing it pretty often but I really
really do like how all you have to do is
store some water in the hair and call it
a day I haven't added any like serums or
leave-in conditioners or curling creams
to this unit just because it's not a
super curly unit is a more syllable like
a natural curly kind of ways so yeah and
freakin quality of this hair is so soft
so you can't beat that what I'm doing
right now is just taking some of the
lace off in the front just because I
felt like I left too much on and then
yeah so you're going to see me throw
some water in it and call it a day I'm
going to scrunch it up and it's that
simple with this unit so I know you guys
were going to definitely appreciate that
summertime you don't want to have to do
too much you know and it's too hot to be
stringing curling your curls going fall
so if you can find something that's
really you know that comes already curly
or wavy that is the perfect thing you
can have during the summertime low
maintenance girl low maintenance so all
their information will be listed in the
description box below
once again this is premier lace wigs

beautiful I hope you guys enjoyed this
