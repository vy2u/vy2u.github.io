I don't know what we're doing today I
just decided I wanted to bring my camera
I'm gonna have to learn how to stop
looking at the viewfinder when I'm
talking to you guys my face is not so
bad today so hopefully I post this but I
love you guys and let's see what the day
we get I mean let's see what today
brings I believe it's like 1 o'clock
1:30 so yeah we have a long day ahead of
us hi guys I mean I care
we had chick-fil-a but I didn't record
that cuz I just thought that was
unnecessary weight of his bathroom isn't
this cute well you turn you guys around
hi this is me this is my outfit for the
day
very cash but I ate y'all so I'm like
really to it right now but I
think it's about the mess really cute
look at the shower
yes this is what I need like I need to
shower that like a little thing
I'm gonna put like
these little cute plants in there so if
you guys see and you asked me where did
you get this from
IKEA for only $5.99 this is a vibe
come sit down so we can see
you got it that's kind of bathroom at
the kitchen I look crazy I need to put
more lipliner
my boobs
not rest but girl this is a nice picture
actually movie dad here she just cut it
well I just finished cutting the rest of
it off I will put some before and after
pictures of how her hair used to look
it's her fault
we are going to Atlantic Station if you
guys see me here
where I should have been the day but
because of her I am NOT little Q spot
where you can go shopping all kinds of
nice restaurants you know pulled outside
a movie theater a gym I think they put
the Christmas tree up in this area they
have a theory of it I'm gonna ice
skating rink over here
I put a jacket on because I do not want
to be say I just got over my coat but
she's got a vest that's what I became
nervous be cute that's what the best is
what
she doesn't want to go ice-skating with
me guys please have like $20 and ain't
nobody out here my ass there's nope
there's nobody out here
bat-bomb make your baths a miracle
maybe if I do a meet-and-greet if you
want to bring me something bring me
these of course don't have them open
because I won't eat them
at my best friend's house and I just got
back from getting a new piercing we're
done it's hella dark outside like what
time is it it's 9:30
we've been out since wind just like 1:30
so it was a full day we were exhausted
we probably just want to kick in and
chill but I'm sure you guys have a lot
of questions about the bellybutton
piercing so this is how it looks he is
in the center it just looks a little cry
right now because I could swollen of
course that's really what you have to
look forward to when you get a piercing
it may not look like it's centered but
um for a couple of days or you know a
month depending on how well you he'll
and it's going to be fine after that
pain tolerance I would say it was
probably like a two for me on my scale
which means it wasn't painful at all
it's just a lot of pressure that is
gonna be applied to you if you are
interested in getting your belly pairs I
will do a more in depth video or mine
all of my piercings cuz I know you
probably guys you guys probably have a
lot of questions about my other
piercings and stuff like that will hurt
and whatnot I really wasn't going to
ever get one because I told myself that
I didn't want it to keloid on me and I
was really like skeptical about that
happening so I'm not really trippin I
think that's pretty much all that I have
to tell you guys I don't have any
tattoos in the place that I went to I
might be getting a tattoo from there
because I really like their work the
girl was really nice that I went and got
the piercing done by I went there before
I actually redid this piercing in my lid
and the second time I went I went there
the same shop
yeah but I think that's pretty much it
we're probably gonna I'm gonna probably
watch her do these shelves that she got
from Ikea because I don't feel like
going home right now
even though I show it because I need to
go to the gym I didn't go to the gym
today and I need to go to the gym but
yeah girl I'm out of here and I love you
guys and I hope you guys enjoyed this
vlog I had a good day I felt like it was
productive but it was more so just chill
and yeah I love you and I will see you
guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
