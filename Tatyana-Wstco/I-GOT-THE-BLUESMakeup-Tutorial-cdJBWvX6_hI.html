path with my videos you guys will start
getting a new life approach from me
sharing different videos with you guys
probably personal things in my life logs
and also just to UM sit down and talk to
you guys about you know me in general
I'm a very like close all fish person
when it comes to the Internet
I only because like I didn't feel like I
was ever going to be like a personality
on the internet you know I'm saying so
it was just post something kid or cook
something it off and also the box and
the energy that once we're having
weren't really good vibes around me and
it was always kind of like I was not in
good spirits all the time it's basically
what I'm trying to say and now that I am

other and learn from each other and
always support one another and know you
guys want me to do this split ponytail
give you advice about YouTube and give
me your life about where to get your
music for you too so those are going to
be future videos so I hope you guys
subscribe just so we can get this family
as strong and very um get a bond going
between us because I feel like it that
is very important thank you so much for
watching and let's begin let's get into
this island I created this blue like
monochromatic kind of look with just one
eyeshadow yesterday I'm really excited
to share it I actually only use one
brush too so I'm going to try to stick
with the one brush one shadow thing
today so let's start this so let's start
to Silas so we're going to start with
Mac's Paint Pot in soft ochre this is
the one that was good on all skin types
and I like that it actually enhances the
pigment of your eyeshadows so they don't
look dusty and dry you want to go in
with my 27 just to make sure everything
is blended up here a little bit goes a
long way you don't need a lot of this
product because it can get crusty and
kind of like like I could start like
looking like it's cracking on you and
you don't want that oh oh we're going to
use tape with this look
Lord all right we're going to have to
finesse the situation you want to apply
the tape before guys somebody
I'm just going to go back over the tape
where I want the line to be extremely
sharp back and then just ring it up here
so it's not as sharp as I wanted when I
go in with - with my concealer I'm going
to clean up the lines but if she isn't
so i with my Kat Von D metal matte
palette and I'm going to take this royal
blue it's called the Lord and I'm going
to use the m3 3-1 brush from morphe and
I'm going to slightly tap into this
color and then I'm going to take me up
here right but you want to make this
kind of you want this to be almost like
baby blue not as bright as the actual
pigment you know you don't want it to be
royal blue or the transition part the
help of this brush makes it blend out
really easy and then that's what you
will see the baby blue start to come in
to play and yeah and we're just going to
gradually start building this color and
then we're going to make sure we
intensify the crease so it can be the
actual color that you see the actual
velour color well once again you just
want this part to be baby blue that's
the best way I can explain it so if this
isn't baby blue up here start a brick
that means you went in too deep you know
and this palette is very pigmented so as
you can see I didn't go back into the
palette at all this is just what it's
going because this palette is
so awesome so you want to use circular
motions after a while and you don't want
it to be a baby blue you don't want it
to be like oh I barely have anything
there you want us to be able to see the
baby blue you know press it into our
crease and you can look up because it
will help you a lot more to fill out the
shape of your eye because if you kind of
look straight low and it's hard to find
your crease if you have hooded eyes so
am i kind of looking up in my mirror so
if you see me like doing this sometimes
in my video yes it does hurt my back but
um it just helps me find where I need to
place my shadows so they can look good
because once before I just like was
going in trying to make me a crease and
I have a crease but it's just hitting
you know emotions do matter your brush
choice does matter but your technique
and your understanding of placement with
shadows also will help you get better at
a shadows trust me
as blending is definitely key to this
book into anyone that you're kind of
trying to do like this it doesn't have
to be blue you can do this with a pink
look you can do this with a purple look
I kind of did this with a yellow look
but the technique was a lot different
and once again I've never wanted to use
this brush for some reason I just
thought they're so cute and so pretty
and I have like this little area where
I'll keep brushes that I feel like are
really pretty or just like I don't even
know girl I'm just weird but yeah so I
finally picked it up and it changed my
life yesterday when I did this look like
girl right you can clean the damn brush
I just use the brush because you bought
it for a reason it's another blending
brush but it has a tip the tip is like
the tip goes into a common point like
I'm not a column but it looks like a
cone but it goes into a point puts it
right where you want it because of the
tip and other brushes like other
blending brushes don't have that so for
example this is a blending brush even
though it's really dirty as you can see
there's no point and this one does have
a point once again this is the morphe
330 brush so definitely pick it up
because only a couple looks morphe
brushes are very affordable effort and
you know the inner part of your eye you
don't want everything just to be on the
outer part you kind of start having to
take it in and make sure you get that
color payoff in this area too and your
inner parts of your eyes so I didn't
understand that either but when I
started working with different brushes I
was just like okay I get that this brush
will make sure that I'm not packing too
much in this area and everything is
going to look good now we're going to
take some more of the color and then
start pressing it right on the outer V
of our eyes
we are done with the fade-out all right
so pretty much make sure you pack your
last pack right here not in there but
right here so you can get the tents
pretty blue mixing medium on my lid and
this is a lifesaver okay so let me tell
you guys this is mixing medium and what
this is going to do for you is make sure
this is from a Mac by the way this is
going to make sure whatever shimmer
shadow that you use for your looks it's
not going to UM transfer anywhere else
on your eyes so if you look up move
around whatever it's not going to go
anywhere else other than your lid if you
are applying a shimmer shadow don't you
sometimes if you're applying on your lid
don't you see it's on something your
creates a little bit if you don't want
it there and it's just like damage like
I didn't ask for you to go up there this
is going to be your best friend you can
get it online or you can get it at a pro
Mac store if you do have a card but yeah
like I said you can also order it online
so you're going to use this one like a
concealer brush or whatever enough so
I'm going to use sit on your eyes for a
little bit and do not look up because if
you look up is good I'm going to be game
over okay it's just going to defeat the
purpose so keep your eyes closed
don't put it too far in your crease
gradually you know get there and open
I'm going to keep this in East Center
I'm going to go in with pencil from the
palette blow off anything that can fall
off and then still keep your eyes closed
and pack it on there okay just to add
some spunk to the look because I don't
want this to be like all blue you know
you don't have to do the liner but this
is a visit escape color from NYX you
guys know I have every last color you
can get it from Ulta I'm going to go in
with ice cling to
I love muffins I am done with the love I
hope you guys enjoyed it I hope you
learned something by the way I wanted to
mention the things that I did office
camera that you may see different I just
added some green underneath my eyes and
I also put some glitter like glitter
dots in between it and it was just the
NYX glitters you can get all of the NYX
products that are pretty awesome from
Ulta if you guys can't find them in your
beauty supply store guys can try and get
a discount but also definitely happen if
I added some dots with the green liner
and I just put some 1:13 Ardell wispy
lashes once and for my lips today I
chose to go with a chi from colour-pop
and i also apply a clean color would be
and it's in the shade 1627 clean color
is an affordable matte lipstick brand
and then I found in my new supply storm
check out my beauty supply store near
you and I'm sure they have clean color
products in there but if not you can
always go online I actually have a clean
color video if you guys want to check
out the other colors that they do have
because they're really affordable in
they're really nice on the lips they're
not too crusty and crumbly some colors
can be like the brighter colors and the
darker colors but like if you stick with
your news and maybe like crochets or
brown shades they're not so bad we don't
