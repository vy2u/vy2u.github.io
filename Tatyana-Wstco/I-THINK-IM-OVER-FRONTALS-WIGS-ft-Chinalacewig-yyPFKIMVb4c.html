another video I have a unit from China
lace wigs that I want to share with you
guys so that's what we're going to be
doing today this is how the hair looks
I've already Co washed it and all that
jazz just because I went in and bleached
the knots and all that stuff so today
we're going to style it and do all kinds
of things to it just make it look a
little bit more funky I don't know if
I'm gonna cut layers into it or not but
you know usually back in the day I
really wasn't showing you guys how to
install your 360 lace frontals just to
make them look really really realistic I
didn't go in and tweeze anything I might
have to go ahead and do that I'm sure I
am gonna have to go and do that so we'll
just you know start this together this
is it 360 unit so it looks like this if
you were to receive or purchase a 360
unit this is how it looks so the lace is
all the way around and this company has
four combs so it can fit really secure
and snug they have one in the middle two
on the side and one on the back and then
they have you know the standard elastic
band that is back here well not elastic
band but you know whatever you want to
call this guy just so you can make it
fit as snug as you want I believe this
is like a Brazilian straight unit from
this hair company I know that I ruined I
received it was really straight but I
had to bleach the knots once again and
the reason why you want to bleach the
nos is just because when you go ahead
and part your hair it's gonna look a
little bit more realistic if you don't
the lace color will be in the parting
area in my complexion it just won't look
realistic if I just keep that color I'm
gonna use some way caps just to keep my
hair out of the way and that's really
important just because you don't want
anything
snug in and tug it on your actual hair
and yeah that's unnecessary you don't
have to deal with it don't deal with it
if you just can't go and purchase you a
wig cap it's only $1 and a beauty supply
store I will stick to the flesh tone
ones so what I'm doing right now is
cutting the lace off now you don't want
to cut a lot of the lace off you want to
start with something just you want to
start cutting enough of it off but you
don't want to cut it completely off just
because I'm going to show you guys the
method that I use you see that there is
some lace left on it but it's not a lot
and that's what I mean you don't want to
keep a lot of it on but you don't want
to like cut it all the way up to the
hairline where the little hairs start to
you know
sprout out a little fake baby here you
don't want to cut it all the way up to
that thinking I think this was the only
color that my beauty supply store had at
the moment but we'll see how this turns
out
so you just want to put your wig on I
hope you guys know how to put up a go
but like if you don't what I like doing
is starting from the back so I like you
know pretty much making the wig upside
down and then taking the back of the wig
so this is the back of the wig and then
just putting it on just like this okay
and then BOOM
so now you see we're not parted
that's what bleach and the knots does if
you don't bleach your knots it's gonna
look nuts okay and comb so this comb I
make sure that I took it pretty much
almost behind my ear behind my ear if
possible and you want to do the same
thing stretch pull and tuck so I'm
stretching it as far as I can and then
I'm tucking it either at my ear or if I
can get it behind my ear I kind of place
it behind my ear hook
and then take a pool
coolant up all right so as you can see
the help of the little place that I left
on is keeping it realistic so if I cut
the lace all the way up here it's gonna
start looking like it's away and we
don't want that okay a little bit more
security so pulled it out and then tuck
right underneath that wake at now so
this is how it looks so far now you can
go in with foundation you know if you
want to I'll take a little bit of
whatever is left on this brush just to
hit the lace so you know even if the
lace does show is not looking crazy
block your lace though you may have to
go in and you know cut a little bit off
a little bit more and my hairline is
kind of weird so you see my hairs are
shown right here so that's kind of why I
keep the lace still right there and you
see my hairline comes out right here as
well so I kind of try to make sure that
the lace is over
you know these parts of my hairline so
my hair doesn't show and you guys know
my famous salon graphics hairspray if
you guys have not you know been watching
my videos or what have you been doing
mom this is the long graphics hairspray
this is there freezing hairspray there
ten max holding spray now this is my
baby when it comes to making sure
wigs are secured and laid down you know
a lot of people you do other methods
they use tape glue can got to be glued
which is like a gel substance and it's a
post like hardened in time and you know
help the lace lay down
I don't like guys to be glue cuz it's
too sticky for me and I feel like it
just gets all over the hair if you're
you know not like careful you can go in
and tweak this a little bit more because
look I'm wigging
so I think I'm gonna just tweeze a
little bit of these hairs out before I
my hairspray method with you guys okay
so I'm just going to do this side just
because you're able to see this side and
I'm gonna do the other side off of the
camera so you can start off by just you
know plucking some of that in this
little part that we made right and these
scissors you know these tweezers are
actually from Sally's Beauty Supply
Store they're tweezerman tweezers but
they're the pointy ones you don't have
to get the pointy one but I got them now
my method to this madness right here is
to not plug in the same spot for too
long and definitely make sure you are
plucking your hair so don't be just
wasting your time just doing a whole
bunch of nonsense for no reason like
make sure hair is actually coming out
and how you're gonna notice that is this
is going to start looking like a rat's
nest up in here and then you start
brushing and combing out the X the
excess hair and that's how you get that
gradient effect so same thing with this
situation right here I feel like either
this is too much this is too much hairs
for the baby hair area and in this area
I feel like it has too many hairs where
it to be a baby hair kind of look so
this is also gonna help give you like
the gradient look because when you brush
it back or push it back it's going to
look effortless I'm sorry my phone it's
going crazy right now but yeah so make
sure you take your time because I've
been doing this for a while trial and
error type of situation I kind of know
you know what I'm doing kinda at this
point pulled out already just so you can
see how much hair I've already tweezed
out so this is just from the baby hair
section right here it's not a lot but
you of course you want to start off by
doing it like that like you just want to
start combing out and then re tweezing
just because you don't want to tweeze
too much out and
in you be doomed okay and if you pull it
back that's how much luck so far you'd
want to be gentle with this process now
I'm gonna show you the other big Noddy
way when I just be almost over the whole
situation and I'm just like a bitch I
can't be staying here for two hours go
to thank Shane if I'm not seeing nothing
immediately like immediate result
because I have my finger to get this way
my life but um so I just like you know
red I see in the school
how'd it go in and is like looking and I
just make sure I pull on the hair little
bit that's kind of helps me get the hair
out faster it also helps me stay away
from the lace just pull up your duffel
sequin up alright so now you know this
because I got cut off because it's over
argue like that and you know no big slug
be doing it but they just kind of other
people's heads are bigger smaller so
what I'm gonna have to do is cut off all
of this right here it's like an hour so
so I'm gonna finish this speed this
video up because I don't want you guys
to be sitting here
cut this extra lace to sew my ear can
pop out of course you want to be careful
you don't want to you know cut your own
hair so make sure your hair is out of
the way of course and make sure you're
looking in the mirror cuz this process
can be kind of scary and like that so
that's my little ear tab that I usually
cut off on every way cuz every wig is
like this that I receive I just spray
this right after my actual hair lunch
all around and just like you you know if
you do use the gossipy glue you're gonna
wait for this to get like you know I'll
semi dry before you put the lace on
there
all right so I like puttin the blow
dryer on cool and then pretty much just
placing the lace where I want its who
we're going to start cutting trimming
sweeping them into the position that you
want them to be in
you can use water you can use mousse
whatever floats your little boat so if I
pulled it down that's how it looks just
random sections using this hairspray to
hold down more areas of the lace so it's
not easy to lift or move
I'm just wanting to run my firing
through this just to see how bone
straight you can get
yeah I love you babes and I'll hope to
see you guys and my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
