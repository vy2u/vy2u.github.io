another video today I'm gonna be showing
you guys this look I have my beauty for
ever hair in in the other day I didn't
even wear that little half-up half-down
I pretty much wear my hair like this I
straightened it and all but let's get
into it I love you bye alright baby
loves I was out of the door right after
that intro so let's begin this face I'm
starting with my Smashbox photo finish
primer I love this primer is perfect for
blurring imperfections and just working
just having a really great canvas to
work on instead of just applying your
makeup directly onto your face so that's
why I really love this primer and I'm
gonna go in with my NW 50 concealer from
mac and I think this is the studio fix
concealer and it's just too like pretty
much use this as a what is it called
like a color correcting situation
instead of using orange I like using
like this super dark concealer from mac
to do the job and I'm going in with my
Milani concealer output I think this is
like the retouch any race concealer I
don't know but I will leave that
information in the description box of
course all the products will be listed
below and as you seen I went in with my
Tarte shape tape concealer in medium
beige just to make sure I'm getting that
really highlighted look that I like and
I'm gonna go in with my Bobbi Brown
expresso foundation stick and this is
just to contour for today
it's really creamy and it gets the job
done it's a great shade for my skin
complexion so I love it and I'm gonna go
in with my hourglass foundation in
golden almond and I'm using this to
pretty much bring my actual foundation
shade in all of this situation that I
got going on on my face so I'm putting
it in between that highlight in that
contour shade just to even me out and
make sure everything is seamless and
flawless after blending it out so of
course you need a damp Beauty sponge to
blend out this is the Real Techniques
Beauty Blender I love this Beauty
Blender it's really really affordable so
if you're not looking to spend $20 on a
regular Beauty Blender definitely check
out this beauty blender from Walmart or
Walgreens so I just like starting off
with my under eyes first and then
starting the contour and foundation
blend out afterwards just so I can get a
really chiseled look and I don't really
blend the dark shades into the lighter
shades because I don't want that to
happen so after all the disciplining I
am gonna go in with my Laura Mercier
translucent powder and that's just to
set all of this cream concealer that I
have underneath my eyes and I like
setting my forehead my underneath my
jawline and for my chin I believe I did
that this day and of course I like to
pinch my nose with this powder as well
this is my favorite favorite powder even
when I don't want to spend $42 on the
big sides I really regret it
regretting every time when I try to use
any other powder because this powder is
so fine but it does what it's supposed
to do and of course it doesn't have any
flashbacks so that's always important
you don't want any flashback because you
know you don't want to be looking
ghostly and you don't want to be looking
crazy and yet images baby girl so yeah
so I just like taking that powder I mean
underneath the jaw line just so I can
sharpen my contour so I'm gonna go in
with golden deep and this is from NYX
stayed matte but not flat foundation
powder and I just like to set that cream
contour with this shade and then go in
with my NYX bronzer just to get some you
know
and operation going on as one you know
because we need some color we need some
bronze art we need we need that in our
lives that's very important and of
course I'm gonna use that same powder
just to chisel my well just to set the
nose contour that I have going on and
this is also going to make it look like
I have a slimmer no okay so this is my
favorite bronzer right now if you guys
have another fave and let me know I
think I'm gonna pick up the Bobbi Brown
bronzer I heard great things about a bit
I just didn't want to spend fifty-two
dollars on a bronzer I believe that's
how much it was but anyway I want to
drag that bronzer underneath my eyes I
just like doing this just to bring some
color back into my under eye area I
don't know that that sounds weird but I
like how it looks on me so this is
definitely a personal preference type of
vibe here so I'm gonna take that bronzer
on my lids as well I didn't really know
what look I was going for I was just
running my mouth and I feel like my best
friend kind of like threw me off when I
was doing this so yeah as you can see I
kind of look like what the hell am I
supposed to be doing right now so I'm
gonna take my lorac Pro palette and I'm
going to use I think it was taupe and
then I'm gonna use that sable color and
then I'm gonna go in with expresso so
achieve this I look today so it's very
smoky and sultry and I like it because
my outfit was very like army fatigue
Olive vibe you know basic so I kind of
wanted to have my eyelids pop a little
bit a few ways if you would say and then
putting lashes on this day I pretty much
was being lazy but I also liked how it
looked without the lashes it wasn't
giving you too too much drama but it was
giving you enough and of course I ended
up wearing shades this day anyway so I
really didn't even need the lashes so
yeah girl I'm gonna drag that darker
shade underneath my waterline as well
just to get that smoky illusion that I
like having underneath my eye
it is always darkest before
when you write
alongside
I'm gonna go in with my highlighter and
this is the wet-and-wild highlighter I
forgot the name it will be listed below
and I'm going to outline my lips with a
dark brown pencil and I'm gonna use NYX
butter gloss to top that and we're gonna
get dressed so I'll let you guys watch
me from here until I start putting mouth
all right so white shirt actually from
Walmart believe it or not it was only
like three bucks oversized well it's not
oversized it's actually in the mail
section and I was needing a white shirt
one night I was going out and yeah
these boots are actually from Aldo and
the jackets from fashion OVA and I had
shorts on I actually got the shorts from
I believe it was like a thirst or a
long-ass time ago like eleventh grade
type of vibe going on now I'm gonna
start on my hair beauty forever hair
calm is where I got these bundles from
and I actually have a video showing you
guys how I installed this unit well not
this unit installed this hair into my
head which was a quick weave if you want
to see how I achieved this style it will
be linked in the description box below
know what I wanted to do with my hair
this day I didn't know if I wanted to do
the half way up halfway down just with
my regular hair of course at the top
without having to put that like an extra
bundle in it oh I actually just went
with this in this video but I ended up
doing a side part later on that day and
I loved how it turned out on beauty
