video and today is going to be Instagram
baddie makeup plus a updating review on
my work his hair so I've been rocking
this hair and I really do love how this
hair is holding up and of course I'm in
love with it even more this hair took my
color that I wanted so well and it still
looks really healthy and fabulous so I
have to give you guys a little
background so I have to give you guys
some little hair tea real quick before
we start this Instagram adding makeup
look so this is Wes kis hair this hair
is from Aliexpress so I'll list all
their information in the description box
below I have 3 bundles and a frontal
from his hair company 18 20 22 and a 16
inch closure or a frontal the 16 inch
frontal let me make sure I'm not lying
at all so I do have 18 20 22 and a 16
inch frontal from this hair company and
this is their Brazilian body wave so the
hair when I actually created this wig
for myself it's so freakin soft in its
natural color it's so beautiful like you
really must get this hair if you're
looking for some awesome body wave hair
I do have some clips of how the hair
looked when it first when I first
received the hair um but I didn't take
any pictures of the wig that I created
but take it from me but take it from me
this hair step so I was really amped
about you know bleaching this hair and
getting it to the color that I wanted
for a very long time now and finally I
really did end up doing it so I'm really
happy with the result and I'm really
happy how well West's hair took this
hair and for it to be a aliexpress hair
company and it's still looking this
great I am all for it so like I said all
their links will be in the description
box below if you're interested and the
hair doesn't make up it doesn't shed it
doesn't tangle it doesn't have any foul
smell it's so beautiful in its natural
state before watching it so what I
suggest you guys do is rock this hair in
this natural state before co-washing it
or anything when you first receive the
hair because it's so freakin soft and
luscious and beautiful but even after
washing it and making it really pretty
it's still really amazing
has an amazing way to it and you have
something there and it's nothing just
flat even when after washing it I didn't
receive a foul smell or anything
and after this bleaching job it does
still have like a slight wave to it so
I'm really pleased about that
you'll see it in the beginning of this
video but I do but I did brush it out
and I cost a lot of like you know
lioness filled to my hair so of course
my camera died so we're just going to
start with this makeup look now I'm
using my white cell primer today plus my
navy Assaf moisturizer like I always do
in my NARS all day luminous foundation
placing that on the parts that lead that
need the most coverage on my face I
don't know what happened to that side of
my face just pray for me
you know that's all we can do about that
so I'm just using a real techniques
foundation brush to apply this
foundation then I'm going to be taking
my damp Beauty Blender and blending that
all in to make my foundation look really
seamless and flawless
now I'm taking my la girl concealer in
the shade toffee just to give that
highlighting effect going so now I'm
taking my Mac studio no my Mac
highlighting pen in the shade light
booth and placing that underneath those
same areas and down the bridge of my
nose just to get a more highlighted
effect because you guys know I love
being highlighted and glam and of course
for instagram batty makeup we have to be
popping or holly has to be lit so I just
made sure I made my highlight look as
flawless as possible in this video like
I always do now I'm taking my Bobbi
Brown foundation stick in the shade
expresso to contour the sides of my face
just to give me a more chiseled
appearance and to slim that face down
girl because I have a round face and I'm
going to be using the leftover product
underneath my chin just to add a little
bit more you know slim face look and
down the sides of my nose to get a
slimmer nose and I'm going to go back in
with that highlighter pen to add some
more highlight down my nose now I'm
going to take my airspun powder you can
get this from your drugstore Walgreens
CVS Walmart or Target and it's in the
shade honey beige and I'm just using
that to set all that creamy concealer
that I use so it won't crease on me
now I'm going to be taking a real
techniques buffing brush just to make
sure I blend out all of that contour
shade so I can get ready to apply my
blunt blush from Mac and the hollows of
my cheeks just to give me a more slimmer
face now I'm going to clean up that with
my sheer glow foundation from NARS in
the shade Tahoe and this is just to cut
my face a little bit more to make it
even more slimmer you just want to blend
that out really good if you do this step
and then using that blunt blush from Mac
again on this side of my face
to chisel me out a little bit more and
now I'm going to be taking that same
product down the sides of my nose just
to get a slimmer nose and add some more
color back into my nose
and now I'm going to be starting this
island so I'm taking Omid tan from
coastal scents and placing it pretty
much all over my crease above my crease
and pretty much on my eyelids all over
basically and then I'm going to dust off
all of that airspun powder as much as I
possibly can and then dipping my brush
into some of my mac mineralize
skinfinish powder and dark deep just to
make sure i cancel out all of that white
powder off of my face so I won't get any
flashback when I take flash photography
D pros from Coastal Scents just to
deepen up my crease a little bit more to
add some more color in it when I do this
look I do this look because it's so easy
to pair it with any outfit or any hair
color that I got going it's really
simple and it's all about the wing
really for this look so that's why I
keep the shadows pretty basic so now I'm
going to be taking my Maybelline eye
studio blackest black gel liner to
create this wing today and that brush
that I'm using is from Michaels so you
can just pick that up from there it's
one of their go hair brushes and I'm
going to be focusing on my wing now let
me know if you guys want another
in-depth liner tutorial or something
from me
and because this brush is sold in Sonia
will be Sammy going with another liner
brush just to enhance this um gel liner
shade a little bit more and to
straighten the lawn a little bit more to
make it a little thicker and there it is
right there
and I'm going to blend out any harsh
lines that I've created with the eye
shadow looks now I'm going to go in with
a brown lip liner and plus another lip
liner from Jordana and um or Coco and
then I'm going to be that's a little bit
more of a red tone so I like that to top
that other brown liner and then I'm just
taking some regular NYX clear lip gloss
to finish this lip and then I'm going to
be taking my a pH that glow kit bubbly
and drip and go down the bridge of my
nose and I'm also going to be using that
to highlight my cheeks
I'm going to be applying some individual
lashes from ardell underneath my eyes
just to give this look a little bit more
drama and I've already applied my lashes
I got this these lashes from my beauty
supply store I'm not exactly sure what
they're called but yeah so that is the
lip combo that I use now we're about to
get into this hair in a second after
applying this highlighter on the inside
of my eyes oh and I'm adding some Arista
eyeshadow underneath my just to add some
color
so this basically completes this makeup
look and let's get into this hair ladies
so now I'm going to be taking some pink
flexi rods I got this from my hair
company I'm not sure which one and I'm
going to be taking a comb and my flat
iron and then I'm going to basically
curl the hair under but straighten it
just a little bit and then I'm going to
take the flexi rods and wrap the flexi
rods around the hair now some of you
asks why do I apply heat and then use
the flexi rods and it's because you know
usually flexi rods work on damp hair I
don't have time to sit and wait for my
hair to dry so you can use water but
like I said I just don't have time to
sit under a dryer or wait for my hair to
air dry while they're in flexi rods
because it usually like takes forever
so just applying some heat to the hair
and then using the flexi rods on the
hair and letting the hair cool down
while they're on the flexi rods it gives
an awesome result and it lasts for a
very long time
member
hey Lenny bugs I'm back I had to get
dressed because time for me to go out
and a little bit so let's begin tell you
guys about this bleaching process okay
so how I achieve this hair color I use
my favorite bleach ever which is blond
brilliance you can pick this up from
size beauty supply store it had like a
deal like if you get the developer you
get the lightener pop the light blue
powder half off or you get the lighting
powder and then you get the developer
half off whatever it is you get a deal
so that's awesome and you probably spend
like 23 dollars if you are a card member
at Sally's Beauty Supply Store so what
I'd say was just um what why I love this
bleach so much rather than like a lot of
colors or any other bleaches because you
can get your hair up to a 2:13 color in
like less than 45 minutes with this all
you have to do is like wrap your hair
and some foil and let it cook on the
hair just if you're not trying to do it
213 you can still use the foil because
it will lift faster but be careful
because this will get your hair to a 213
I also love it because it has awesome
ingredients inside of it such as mango
oil and coconut oil so it just keeps
your hair really smooth and healthy
during this bleaching process because of
this awesome ingredients and of course
it has a little bit other I mean more
stuff in it but those are the main
products that you need to know the
reason why it's not stripping your hair
or virgin hair of all its greatness just
because it has awesome ingredients
inside of it so I had the 35 volume
developer and the powder Lightner which
is blond brilliance Express 9 level
powder Lightner extra strength extra
moisture so that's how awesome this is
because it's like really admin about it
being um great for your hair and giving
moisture back into your hair even though
you are stripping the hair from black to
black it does have oil infusions and all
this other awesome stuff inside of it so
that's why I love that and if you want
to go to a to learn
and you don't want that brassy yellow
color that you know sometimes we get if
you're trying to go blonde you can use
their lathering toner and this is
awesome also it has of course it's
purple because it's supposed to cancel
out all yellow tones and I really do
like this so yeah and then after I
bleach the hair I just used my Garnier
ho blends shampoo and conditioner that I
always were and rave about I'll put a
clip of it right here somewhere that
stuff is amazing
leave that conditioner on your hair for
maybe like 35 to 45 minutes or even an
hour to if you need to just so you can
get all its moisture back in the hair
now if you want to take the extra step
if you go really light and you feel like
okay I'm scared what if the hair breaks
or starts causing like shedding and you
don't want that get you some coconut
milk and when you um while the hair is
air dry after you wash the conditioner
out put like a dime size of this in your
hand and then run it through your hair
now when you do this bleaching process
whether it's you're hit with whether
it's weave or on your head I suggest you
probably get somebody else to do it for
you if you are doing it yourself on your
actual hair um
I suggest you do the bundles by yourself
separately just so you can know what
you're doing you can see what you're
doing without it being installed to your
heads because you want to make sure you
get all of the parts that you want to be
bleached and dye and you want to get
that highlighted effect so what I do
when I bleach hair I just use gloves and
my hands I don't use really a brush or
comb or anything like that I just like
doing that because I feel like I worked
the product through the hair as much as
I possibly can with my hand you don't
have to do that but that's what I do so
what else can I tell you guys I think
that's pretty much it so I'll let you
guys know about wet cuz here after I
take this hair down so yeah hopefully
you guys love the color I really do love
the color I love how wet his hair is
still holding up after wick his hair
isn't that Express hair company so I'll
leave all their links in the description
box below so yeah I didn't um adding
flexi rods on the bottom I just curled
it regularly but you don't have to do
that I'm just like doing that because it
still keeps the links that I do have
really long at the bottom and after I
calm this out and brush this out the
bottom will still be
and then the top is a little bit more
curled and that's usually how I like
rocking my hair I don't like really
tight curls all over my head I used to
but not anymore
so yeah so this is what this is giving I
hope you guys enjoyed this video I've
done so much in this video and I like
doing a lot in my videos because I feel
like you guys learned the most when I do
a lot in my videos so yeah so what I'm
going to do is just let this like say it
right now I'm going to look at the clip
just to make sure I'm focused and then
we're going to begin spreading these out
with my fingers and I really do like how
this hair is looking this is the first
time I actually curled this hair so I'm
really excited about that so this is
what I'll be doing my boyfriend hasn't
seen this hair curled but he really does
like the color what do you feel how do
you feel about the color do you like it
do you love it and then this is what I
do just to get that you know backwards
bounce effect up here and yeah so I know
I'm going to be filling it it's about
how you guys feel about it now so let me
know in the comments section if you
loved it like it or hate it and uhm I
know you guys are probably gonna want to
see me actually do this color like in a
tutorial like the whole bleaching
process but if I can get my boyfriend to
participate in that video and hold the
camera and make it clear then we can get
that up but it's so hard for me to
actually you know hold and bleach hair
it just never works at all like at all
so yeah um this is going to be like my
signature color now just because I'm so
tired of black hair you guys don't even
understand and I feel like me doing you
know this signature color or all of my
hair you guys will know if like all
virgin hair bleach is the same or if
hair if you'll just know if the hair
actually looks really
after bleaching because I know a lot of
times you know you ladies want to know
if the hair um bleach as well or how the
hair looks after bleaching but it's all
about the type of bleach you use in the
process that you do while bleaching the
hair you don't just want to use any kind
of bleach or any kind of developer
because if that can strip the hair and
make the hair very um like nasty or
harsh it can be really harsh on my hair
so you have to be aware I did use a 35
35 volume developer on this hair and you
know the aluminum foil works just like
as if you're using a 40 volume developer
and you know you can just tweak that
without using 40 volume developer
because that can be really harsh on your
hair if you get what I'm trying to say
I'm really not great at explaining stuff
like this but if you understand what I'm
saying if you appreciate me talking to
you about this please thumbs this video
up and maybe I will work on try to
explain this a little bit better but
hopefully you guys get really what I'm
trying to say and yes
hey baby laughs so before I take these
 Braj oh okay

you can see and not I will put it in the
you know what I don't have
