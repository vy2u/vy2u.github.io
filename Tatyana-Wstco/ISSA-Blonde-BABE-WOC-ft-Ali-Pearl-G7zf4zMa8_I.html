today I'm gonna be sharing with you guys
some hair that I received from Ally
pearl hair I'm so happy about this and
it's 3 o'clock in the morning so let me
tell you if I start stutter stepping
don't trip on me ok anyway this is
Brazilian strange 6 13 bundles from Alli
pearl and I have 22 inches 3 bundles of
22 inches and a 18 inch frontal I might
have four bundles I don't know girl I
don't remember this video has been
recorded like two weeks ago
so I'm talking about it like you know
this is this is the past or this or is
this the future I don't know it's too
late for me to be playing that game with
mine okay myself right now but um yes so
when I we first received this hair
poppin y'all poppin back story the
reason why I'm doing a voiceover I lost
some of the audio in the beginning of
this video so you're gonna hear me talk
towards the end but I had to you know
get it together with this voiceover
really quick for you guys but anyway
when I received the hair was really soft
you know true days limped I was really
happy with it because it didn't come
like this really pissy yellow 6:13 hair
that is just so gross to me because then
I have to do more work I have to tone it
you know I have to use a silver shampoo
and all that jazz and sometimes you just
don't want to have to do that like no so
I'm just really happy that I found a
company that sells really really nice
exciting hair so if you're interested
you know girl the links will be listed
below I did go in and customize the
route now I have to pop in units that I
made for myself with 6:13 hair so this
one I actually died light ash brown
towards the root and the second unit
that I just recently customized and that
video should be up right now or you know
it might be that I do want to be showing
you guys how to DIY a dark ash brown
root on a 6:30 a frontal so I'm really
excited about it because I think it
turned out really really nice and I hope
you guys think the same I do
want to let you guys know that the
lighting is off around this point
because the living room lighting is just
pissing yellow so it kind of looks like
it's lighter than really what it is but
in the intro and the outro you're gonna
see that it's a bit darker than what is
showing right now so yeah I did I did
find some of the audio to this video
right here so I'll get a chance to
listen to this part so I'll see you guys
in my next video thank you so much for
watching and Ally pro information will
be linked in the description box below I
love you if you take these all the way
up here like that look so I'm just going
to keep it in as you know state that is
harvey in at the top and i just blew it
out with my blow dryer just to achieve
this like you know situation that's
going on up there and i just don't want
to straighten it once again just because
it's gonna look way too flat oh yeah so
this is their 613 i'm pearl frontal and
bundle information will be listed below
I kind of thought the frontal was a bit
yellow a little bit more yellow than the
hair but
after I you know blew it out
straightened it it blended perfectly so
no worries there you're getting the
exact same you know look with the
frontal as if you were to you know
purchase the bundles or whatever or if
you already have some six thirteen
bundles but you need a frontal this is
how the frontal looks but once again I
did die the root of the frontal so it
can look a little bit more like
realistic even though we know this is
not realistic um hey ash blonde no this
is clear all like the this is what I
used to go in with the root color this
is the Clara light ash brown it's in bo8
D I will leave it in the description box
below so if you guys wanted to get the
same look you know you can do so
um but yeah I'm going to take it on down
right now my creds Brown right now
please check out the links below to Ali
Pro hair because I think this is some
nice hair and trust me I've worked with
weave so much and you know different
colors with color weaves so I know when
something is already like a hit or miss
just by like how it comes straight out
of the pack how it takes dye how it
takes shampoo and conditioner and you
know you have to run your brush through
you have to run your comb through it so
I'm a row vet when it comes to this
hairs so I really know when it's
already good hair and when is like hair
that I already know that's gonna give me
a problem in the future and I can just
tell how this hair blew out of his hair
straighten how this hair was when it
first came out of the pack this is not
gonna give me a problem no time soon but
it's of course it's anything changes I
will let you know and I'm going to work
on my curling
process probably in a couple of hours
but yeah I love you babes that are just
going to come and let you guys know
what's going on on top of my head you
know just to catch you see it in a video
I mean a picture or something or a video
but I love you babes and I'll see you in
