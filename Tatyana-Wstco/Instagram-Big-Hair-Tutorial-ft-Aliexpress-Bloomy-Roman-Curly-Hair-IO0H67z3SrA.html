video and today I have in my blooming
hair and I'm excited because I like the
style on me
I'm going to be showing you guys how I
created this look with my blue me Roman
curly hair texture so I'll list all
their information in the description box
below I have three bundles and an 18
inch frontal from this company
the closure just doesn't match the
bundles at all so be very aware of that
I did tell you guys at the end of this
video about the closure that I had
tracks with their deep wave texture and
that closure was a little bit more
curlier than the bundles so maybe if you
do got if you guys really do like this
hair and you guys want to do a closure
try to get that closure instead of the
closure that is up here don't get me
wrong the quality of the closure isn't
bad but it just doesn't match these
bundles at all two videos in the
description box below that you can check
out the first one of the deep wave
texture and then the other one is the
Roman curly first update and it just
shows you guys how I ended up styling
the closure to match the bundles a
little bit like it wasn't a lot of
matching but it was just my image I know
that closure does not match but if you
had to finesse something it was like
that more of that kind of situation but
anyway we're going to begin this video I
hope you guys enjoy thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you ladies
soon really
me
you need a dose like an amateur you put
in overtime
the most for you from the inside but I
got you don't know where's Carson yeah
if I ever told you that I had better
yeah you know I got jokes in the movies
then you how I feel I'll go and go
through my quotes happy wedding dad he's
a good line everything about every
single time when I'm with you I can see
the whole shot

are they left so this is another way I
decided to stab my bloomie Roman curly
hair this is pretty much all that I'll
probably doing to this hair because I
don't think it can get really really
bone straight unless you have the time
and the patience and I just didn't have
that time in patience today I just
decided to get it as straight as
possible with my flat iron and then
throw some curls in this hair so this is
the type of curl that I wanted to do
with this hair super big super fun very
Diana esque and I think I really do
enjoy this look on me let me know how
you feel about it cuz I really love the
bundles even when I was blowing the hair
out did you guys see how nice I was it
was really freaking pretty yeah I think
with that deep way texture that they
sent me last time I think the closure
was curlier than the bundle so maybe you
can get that closure that I tried with
their deep wave texture with this hair
and maybe that will work for you they
should just sent me that closure
I don't know well check out that deep
wave texture that I have up in my
channel so you guys can see how the
closure looks to see if it would um
float your boat what it is I'll see you
ladies soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
