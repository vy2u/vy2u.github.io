today I have in my honey Beauty hair I
wanted to come on and share with you
guys the look that I decided to do with
this hair companies hair and I wanted to
do a halfway up halfway down with honey
Beauty hair this is their Brazilian wave
so I left my hair at the top I have left
my hair out at the top and I pretty much
focus all of their bundles in the back I
do have three bundles installed and yeah
so I'm just pretty much styling my hair
at the top because I'm gonna either put
in a really small bun or either I'm
going to have it down that day I put it
in a bun and then you're gonna see day
two I actually had my hair left out and
yeah so I wanted I wanted to do like
little connects with rubber bands and
trying to do like a little funky style
at the top just so it won't be a basic
halfway up halfway down look I think I'm
gonna redo this look with some more hair
just because I kind of know the
direction I want it go in a little bit
more and I might use colorful rubber
bands but yeah the hair is really soft
it's really easy to detangle if you're
trying to revamp it all I would say is
just put some water on it and call it a
day it's really low maintenance hair so
I didn't have to do too much I've found
that the wefts were super thick on the
on these bundles I don't know if that's
like a good thing a bad thing I feel
like that's kind of like a good thing
because you won't get a lot of shedding
or anything like that because they're
really really thick and hard I don't
know but I noticed that about the hair
and I didn't receive a foul smell or
anything like that I do eventually go in
and like use some water to maintain it
because day two I slept on this hair and
all that jazz so I just wanted to make
it look a little bit more popular or
whatever but the hair is really really
full for it to be three bundles and yeah
all that information will be linked in
the description box below I did receive
a front slip from his hair company but
once again I really didn't want to use
the front so I wanted to use my hair out
at the top so that's pretty much what I
did and I was just trying to show you
guys that you know the hair is really
nice and hue and how I got this look I
actually did like the quick weave method
so if you guys want to see how I do that
there's a give you a video on that on my
channel and you guys can check that out
but other than that it was a really
simple process I want to redo this look
like I said because
like I can make the top look a little
bit more cuter you know but yeah so this
is pretty much what I'm giving and then
I'm going to revamp the hair in a second
but I'll be back towards the end just to
say just to tell you guys to buy and all
that good stuff so I hope you guys enjoy
but to take some water and just use it
to see what it's given because I didn't
Co wash the hair and the hair is pretty
poopy it's not bad poofy but it's like
big poofy so I just kind of want to tame
that but I didn't want to but I didn't
want to do it without you guys I am
going out tonight and I don't want it
too wet I just want to bring like the
volume down just a tad bit this is a
really really pretty ear so all the
informations who honey Beauty hair all
the honey Beauty hair information will
be listed in the description box below
if you guys are interested and of course
I will always want to hear if you guys
work with this hair company or not there
was nothing wrong with the closure by
the way I just knew that I wanted to do
a style like this and I wanted to do up
halfway up half way down again but I
didn't want to use any hair I kind of
wanted to you know keep my hair out so
at the top I'm gonna bump my hair just
so it can kind of mimic the hair once I
straighten it and blow it out and curly
and all that kind of stuff I did try to
straighten this hair it would not
straight in like it was it was gonna be
too much I didn't want the hair to be
smelling all burnt and disgusting and
stuff like that so I just decided that I
wanted to go in and curl it you're gonna
see that towards the end but I think
that's pretty much it babes I'll let you
guys enjoy the rest of the music and if
you guys have any questions of course
the comments section will be open so all
the Pony Beauty hair will be listed in
the description box below I do have a
wig from this hair company so make sure
you turn your notification on and like
comment share and all that good stuff
and of course your notifications the
little bill needs to be on so once I
record or upload you will be notified
when I actually post the video and yeah
so I love you guys and I'll see you
babies in my next one bye
gasps this is basically how the hair
would look if you decided to blow it out
I was going in to try to straighten this
hair I can already notice that it would
be really really difficult to strain and
I don't even know why but it does have a
curl going on right now so at least it
does that and the hair is really pretty
I hope you guys can see I'm trying to
stand as far back as I possibly can so
you guys can see what's going on I did
add some layers in the hair so you can
kind of see that um I did that last
night and yes so I hope you guys enjoyed
the video I just went in in my bump of
my hair I'm kind of like re straighten
it a little bit and then just kept like
a little tiny bump at the end but yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video I try to
do enough so you guys can see if you
would like to purchase honey Beauty here
or not but I think the quality it's cool
for what it is this is something that
you feel like you will be interested and
I really really like the layers and I
love the length of course and yeah so
thank you so much for watching babes and
I'll see you in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
