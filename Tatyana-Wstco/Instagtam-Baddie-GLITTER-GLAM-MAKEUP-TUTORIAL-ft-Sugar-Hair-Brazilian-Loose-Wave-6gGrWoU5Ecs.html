and today is going to be on this makeup
look but before I start this makeup look
I did want to talk to you guys about my
hair so this hair is going to be from a
hair company by the name of sugar hair
this is another Express hair company and
I've actually did an unboxing video for
this hair company so I'll list that
previous video in the description box
below if you want to check that out and
I first received the hair it was so
fabulous and full of life so I was
really excited to install this hair so
I've been rocking with this hair for
some time I was rocking his hair in
another video also which was the
dramatic sultry eye look I created a wig
with this hair of course so I've been
taking it on and off on and off and I've
been wearing this hair out to the club's
outside just to hang out
I've actually installed this hair like
so the wig down to the perimeter of my
head I rocked like that I've pretty much
did everything that you can possibly do
with this hair and now it's time to give
you guys my honest opinion which is
nothing but positive things about sugar
hairs brazilian loose wave hair and I'm
so freaking love so I know I have four
bundles on a closure from this hair
company and like I said when I first
received it it gave me no problems I can
run my fingers straight through it it
was the softest hair that like almost
ever received and it was really easy to
detangle it wasn't giving any foul smell
or anything like that so keeping the
hair and rocking the hair for some time
now I can tell you guys that I still
don't get any of those things at all I
don't get even shedding anything any
tingling anything like that it doesn't
have a foul smell this hair is in its
natural state so I co wash this hair
I'll put some pictures up upwind I had
this hair in this natural state a lot of
you asks what hair I was rocking in that
with sugar hair straight out of the pack
the hair is so beautiful so I recommend
you guys rock this hair in its natural
state for some time before you co wash
the hair and I really don't have any
cons about this hair at all because best
loose wave hair that I've ever received
you see how it kind of looks like
ringlets and then
wave it's just really natural looking it
just looks like some nice healthy virgin
hair which it really is so that's why I
don't have anything negative to say
about the hair shipping took five to
seven business days communication with
sugar hair was really awesome and a lot
of you guys in my unboxing video stated
that you've actually rock sugar hairs
hair and I was gonna love it and I
actually do love it so thank you so much
for you know leaving your experience
with sugar hair in the comment section
below because that's always helpful to
me and to anybody else that's looking to
buy this hair or buy any hair that I
that I review something I do end up
dying this hair bleaching this hair I
will come back on camera and let you
guys know how sugar hair hair is doing
just in case if you guys want to bleach
them hair you know how the hair is going
to stand afterwards so thank you so much
for watching and I hope you ladies enjoy
the rest of this video
hey babies okay so I'm done with this

my Jordana cocoa brown or no with my
Jordana modern matte lipstick in the
