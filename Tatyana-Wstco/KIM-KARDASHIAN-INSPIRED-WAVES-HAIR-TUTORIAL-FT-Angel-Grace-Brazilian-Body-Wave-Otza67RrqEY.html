and I have angel grace hair this is an
Aliexpress hair company and I have their
Brazilian body wave in my head I'll list
all the information in the description
box below if you're interested in
purchasing from this hair company I
actually received to 26 inches to 24 and
a 20-inch frontal I believe you know I
said that with confidence but I'm not
sure I'll list the exact length how this
the exact nuts in the description box
and if it's not Brazilian I'll list what
it is but I really do think it's
Brazilian um anyway I actually was
rocking this hair for a very long time I
was rocking it and its natural state for
a very long time which is this color up
here but I was like this hair is so
pretty that I feel like I need to give
it some life and add some color in it so
I just bleached the hair to get to
achieve this color
I left the bleach and a little longer
towards the bottom then up here because
I wanted that you know
I guess ombre ish kind of effect going
on I really do love how these curls came
out I feel like this side ended up being
tighter than this side but this is the
side that I was trying to go forward
throughout the whole look but it still
matches I feel like but let me know how
you guys feel about this video let me
know if you actually rock rocked angel
grace hair before I know they have a ton
of positive reviews on their Aliexpress
website so you can actually check their
feedback section if you want to get
other opinions and not just youtubers
you know you guys know how you feel
about youtubers you feel like but you
guys know that I'm super freaking honest
with my hair so if you feel that way
about me and you're wrong okay you're
wrong but anyway thank you so much for
watching ladies you guys know that I'm
always your guinea pig and I'm going to
tell you some honest and triplet things
but I always tell you guys to get yours
first second third fourth fifth opinions
before you go and actually purchase this
hair I love it I've always feel like the
vendor you know make sure they're
sending the exact same qualities whoo
youtubers to everyone we're no one
special we're just people that do
YouTube videos anyway
thank you so much for watching ladies
and I hope you guys enjoyed this video
Oh before you guys get to this next clip
my freaking light died in the midst of
this video but I've had that damn
battery in bitch charger for three days
straight and it's still not charging so
it's broken clearly so I have to order
me into one Monday it's Saturday so I
can't order it to the weekend because I
want to do next day shipping and of
course Mel's it's real on Saturdays but
yeah so I'm still sorry about the
lighting well I'm actually trying to
show you guys how to get this style but
I didn't want to come and talk to you
guys in a different lighting which I'm
in my room right now and I should have
just did the whole video in my room I
don't know what was wrong with me
I thought the lighting was gonna be
really bad in here because it's a really
like yucky day it's very cloudy but then
it goes in and out and I didn't want all
of that in my video but I'd rather have
that than having like yellow nasty
lighting but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video
all angel grace links will be in the
description box below I actually have
some straight hair from this hair
company too so make sure you wait for
that video if you guys want to choose
between angel grace body wave or angel
graces straight hair I actually have
four bundles of 26 in the straight hair
I believe and not believe it's Brazilian
too but I've been rocking back hair at
the same time as this one because I
wanted to make sure I was getting the
same type of luster and flawlessness
with the straight hair and the body wave
hair so of course you guys know that I
make wigs for myself so I'm able to take
one off put one on here no because two
to beat beat that's what happens when
you make wigs for yourself and you won't
kind of snatch edges all the time anyway
thank you so much for watching ladies oh
let's talk about my frontal real quick
can we sell
we never let that song go my little sis
used to watch them all the time anyway
thank you so much for watching these and
I'll see you guys in my next video
he doesn't look fried or damaged or
anything like that I really got like Kim
K inspired with this hair color I didn't
want to go blonde really but I didn't
want to have some color because I am
getting tired of just natural brown hair
but I really do love how this hair
turned out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
