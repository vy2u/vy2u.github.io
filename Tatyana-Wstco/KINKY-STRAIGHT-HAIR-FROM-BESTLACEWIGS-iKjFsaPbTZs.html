wanted to get this video up really quick
for best late they sent me another way
to review their kinky their natural
kinky way that's pretty popular on their
site so they wanted me to try this out
for you ladies but this is how you're
going to be getting your hair as we've
seen here from them your hair is gonna
come in this box and it was wrapped up
it was wrapped up in this also it has
their tag and their label and the weight
information on it in my style number is
GSW 147 this is a natural brown color
hair length is 16 inches a cap
construction catch oh not this is how
the hair comes it's supposed to be
really thick and I believe this is 150%
density and it just has a net over it so
I'm gonna take the nib off and this is
how the hair looks fresh out of the pack
and it's really thick I can see myself
doing so big flexi rods in his hair the
construction of the wig it does have um
four cones inside of it two other side
one in the middle and one of them but it
has two drawstring so you can make it
tight around the nape of your neck so it
gets it really snug on you it does have
a baby hairs on this wig and I'm
sited to try this out because this is
really different for me so if you guys
do not fill this hair at all when you
receive it or if you guys participate
from best place please do not remove the
lace if you have a return policy form in
the box for you guys to return they care
if you guys do not like it just do not
remove the lace and it won't be a
problem so if you're interested in this
way all the information will be in the
description box and I will put all the
information in the details and there and
I hope to see you guys in my next video
for me styling this way and I'm excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
