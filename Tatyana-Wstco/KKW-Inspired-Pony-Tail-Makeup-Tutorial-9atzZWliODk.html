was contemplating on doing a voiceover
just letting you guys enjoy the video
but I know a lot of you probably were
gonna have a few questions so I'm just
gonna go ahead and tell you guys what
I'm doing right now and as you can see I
am brushing my hair enough for me you
both because it just feels so good
um this is my natural hair I am natural
so what I'm gonna be doing today to
create this look it's just using some
eco styler gel and a couple of elastic
bands and I'm gonna be using some West
kissed hair to make my ponytail way
longer and luscious like Kim K's and
yeah so you're just gonna need like
obviously a comb a brush bundle and
elastic bands and that's pretty much it
self-explanatory you guys see me do this
plenty of times so what I do want to let
you guys know to get her look I used a
like a scrunchie like one of those
old-school scrunchies but then I didn't
really like how it turned out so I ended
up using like a headband and I just
wrapped a headband around my actual
ponytail and that's how I got that like
you know that elastic band look or
whatever you want to call it so that's
pretty much it for this tutorial it's
nothing too crazy
once again I just use eco styling gel
the olive oil one you can get it at your
local beauty supply store the dollar
store you can get at Walmart I believe
and yeah so and of course you know the
makeup portion is going to be simple as
well nothing too crazy it's just a blue
eyeshadow that you are going to need to
create the look and all the products
will be listed in the description box
below if you guys are interested to see
everything that I use it will be linked
below but I just want to thank you guys
for tuning in and watching I really
appreciate you guys so much you don't
understand and I will see you babies in
my next video my next video is going to
be a quick weave so make sure you guys
subscribe and turn your notifications or
in so you are notified when that quick
weave tutorial is going to be up I try
to explain it a little bit better than
the other ones so hopefully you guys
understand it but I love you babes and I
will see you guys in my next video
know it to be silly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
