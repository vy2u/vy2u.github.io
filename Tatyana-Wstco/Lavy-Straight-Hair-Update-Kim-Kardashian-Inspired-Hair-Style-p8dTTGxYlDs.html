review for laggy here I did our unboxing
video for this hair company so if you
want to check that out it'll be in the
description box below so you can watch
that after this video or you can watch
that before and then come back to this
one basically what I want to let you
guys know is how well this hair is
holding up I read this hair I 10 out of
a 10 literally like this hair is the
best straight hair that I've ever
received in my life
utter song this is their silky straight
range the Brazilian range I have been to
lists - 24 - 22 s and an 18 inch frontal
the frontal was already bleached so it
was less work than I hadn't deal with
it's a 13 by 4 frontal so I have a lot
of lay space to work with and do a lot
of like awesome styles with so I really
like that I have in about three and a
half bundles and a frontal the leftover
bundles I put back into the lab' hair
bag that they provided me and this is
how your hair is going to come it's
going to come inside of this soap back I
don't put any serums in this hair I just
run my flat iron through it and it's
amazing and he I didn't wash this hair
yet I didn't cold wash this hair like
this is how fabulous it looks straight
out of the pack and I love the fact that
I don't need a brush around at all
that's how I know when I have amazing
quality hair if there's no Navy at the
neck or I don't need to keep a brush on
hand just in case like my hair gets on
crazy throughout the day is up to 22 to
24 is in the 18 inch front so if I
haven't already said that this is like a
natural black natural brown so I'm about
5 4 5 3 and this is how the hair lays on
me and it's like stops in the middle of
month but have a discount code for you
ladies I'll put it right here and I'll
also leave in the description box below
so you can check that out and actually I
just wanted to show a quick tutorial on
how I get my Kim K inspired slicked back
hair look so you're going to need some
elastic bands a brush a flat iron and a
comb so what I like doing to start this
hairstyle is basically putting my hair
behind my
so this is what I got me to where I want
to put my hair in a ponytail so I'm
going to part all of this all right I'm
going to take all of this back into a
ponytail right here on this back it's
like you have to just take some hair out
you can
it's just what you're concerned how
thick you want your bangs look and how
much hair you want but down at the back
so you like this hopefully see
in the bank today it's usually not this
much but I know your home 50 bucks video
thank you so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
