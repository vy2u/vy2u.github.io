video I'm going to be shared with you
guys some more hands that I've received
from a hair company by the name of Ali
moto but before I get into this unboxing
video I want to talk to you guys about
the elephant in the room which is my
freaking hair color so you guys know
that I actually did aces inspired hair
color and I have that video on my
channel so if you're interested in
watching that video you can click the
link that will be listed in the
description box below if you want to see
how I achieve this bob that video will
be listed in the link below as well but
since we got that out of the way because
I will be doing a updated video on how I
stab his hair and talking to you guys
about how I felt about this hair in that
styling video so I don't really want to
make this video all about this hair but
I just wanted to address what is going
on on top of my head but I really do
freaking love this hair so I'm excited
to share that video with you I'll
probably record that video right after
this one but okay so about Ali moto once
again Aliexpress hair company for
bundles oh my god wrong textures I was
telling you guys loose wave the whole
time and this is actually Malaysian deep
curly from Ali Mota so please disregard
me saying loose wave throughout this
video this is actually Malaysian deep
curly hair for bundles and a matching
frontal and the links will be listed in
the description box below
keeping this hair black and probably
straightening it or doing something else
that I haven't really done Tarot before
but I have been dyeing so much freaking
hair so I don't know if I want to dye
that here or not but um let me know what
you guys want to see with that hair if
you guys have any suggestions but once
again I just might just keep it black
and straighten it for you guys and see
if it's giving what life is giving after
straightening it who knows because I do
have some straight hair that I actually
do want to share with you guys soon
which will probably be up before this
video anyway but yeah let's open these
bundles this is a 24 inch and no foul
smell the hair is pretty soft I can
actually run my fingers through this
and we're going to run this one
underneath of water this is how the ends
look pretty they're not dead or like
scraggly and I feel like this is a
decent amount of hair it's not a lot but
if you have passed 22 inches definitely
get four bundles and here's another this
one's really pretty no dead ends no foul
smell I'm gonna wrap this hair for maybe
like two to three weeks so I can give
you guys my honest opinion I think we
can so much the exact same while all the
bundles look like the exact same so far
I'm going to stretch this one I am five
four five three and it's going to like
like the top of my butt if you don't
want to Co wash it you can break your
hair just like this a little bit and
then you can just wet it later because I
am your guinea pig and I have to
actually go wash it or I do have to do
the water test on it so I'm not able to
just rock the hair just straight out of
you know the bundles even if I really
wanted to yes it's not fair to you guys
because I feel like you should know if
the hairs will go back to lose weight
after putting some water in it you know
what I'm saying so yeah so the hair is
really friggin soft I can definitely say
that and I'm still not getting any foul
smell so I'm really excited about that I
can run my fingers straight through this
one so yeah how do you guys feel about
this the ladies are you sad about this
oh my god you guys are going to love
this new hair color that I do I just
bleached it but like how about bleach
the hair I just leave sorry impractical
and longer than others and it came out
really freaking pretty I'll be doing
that video soon so be able to look out
for it that their frontal is poppin the
density is like perfect and you can see
this it's not too much tweezing that
I'll have to do I'm just going to bleach
these nuts I don't wet these bundles
really quick with just water and I'll be
right back I don't run to the store
really quick because I was so excited
about the
how it turned out go get me another dome
cap to create a wig out of this hair so
I'm super excited it's so soft it's not
completely dry but you guys get the gist
of it the wave it's very defined and
even if I decided to bleach it and do
some highlights and lowlights with this
hair as you can see it's going to still
have a wave so I'm really excited about
this and I'm so excited that the front
hold matches the hair perfectly um the
front sort of almost dry so you can kind
of get the feel of how the hair is going
to look when it's completely dried it
with a pair of us hair but I'm super
excited to do some highlights and
lowlights I'm going to create this wig
now I'm going to bleach it now and I'm
going to start rocking it so I can give
you guys my honest opinion so I'll see
you guys I may be three weeks
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you soon ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
