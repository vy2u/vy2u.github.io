and I'm back with another video like I
promised
so here is my max glam unboxing review I
just wanted to open this with you babies
so you guys can see my first impressions
of the hair and let's begin so this is
how you're gonna be receiving your max
glam hair it came in this plastic and
all the bundles are label inside of it
and it has their little note card on the
front with all the information about the
hair how they care for their own email
and their phone number okay 22 inch
which is this one a 20 inch and a 18
inch 16 so I'm okay so I'm gonna undo it
across the actual length this is a I
express hair company by the way so this
is their I want to say there's their
deep waves yeah this is a Brazilian deep
with his hair feels so soft and I'm kind
of getting excited right now but I don't
want to show it but this hair is so soft
and it doesn't have a best mil and I'll
be able to run my fingers through it but
I just don't want to mess it up but for
the sake of this video I'll rush look at
it okay
it's all pretty is this bad that I act
this way over virgin hair like look at
this amazing
smack this face that that hair is this
would be great a 6/8 hair and look at
how amazing this is this is how it looks
after I have ran my fingers through it
so that's the great that would be any
like bad pieces at the end so that's
awesome
there's no like Denton's or anything on
the okay a terrible thing happened while
I was doing my video I lost some of my
footage and I'm very upset about it but
I have to keep moving so what is the 22
inch the 22 the 22 inch goes by to start
in false and the top of my budget and
the 20 inch is about my ways so this is
how the 20 this is how we 18 inch looks
really nice as well look the hair
doesn't have a bad smell at all and I
could rub my fingers right through this
very awesome it's the perfect amount of
density in this closure so I'm excited
to install this as well so this is how
the closure looks if I seem down my hand
down because I lost it I can show you
guys okay so the hair is still a little
damp but this is what I'm getting I'm
still receiving a wave at least the
closure still matches the hair texture
so it's not that bad it's still
beautiful hair so I like it
the insider mattador of the hair looks
really healthy and still so it still
doesn't have a bad smell that washed it
just with water so this is how you'll be
receiving Max Glenn's curly hair
extensions and all the information will
be in the description box below
I'm talking on all of my social media so
you guys can keep up with this hair as
well and I want to thank you guys for
watching and thank you for all your
support</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
