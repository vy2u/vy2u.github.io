how to get this sleek middle part
ponytail it's awful because I can just
fit to see how I achieve mine let me say
that one more time this is how I achieve
mine so if you guys wanted to do the
same technique this is the reason why
I'm showing you guys because I know
there's so many different ways to do
this I know there's so many different
ways to add extensions to your actual
hair okay but this is how I do mine I do
my so I hope you guys enjoy the video
while your going to need is a hair tie
of course I like using eco styling gel
on my natural hair I am natural I am
natural and I am a natural use a comb
you're going to need a two sided brush I
guess you're gonna use a bundle you can
use two bundles you can use one but no
but this is the look that I decided to
go for once again so I hope you guys
enjoy this in I think that's pretty much
all you really need I finessed my baby
hairs off the camera you guys don't have
to do your baby hairs like that but this
is usually how I do mine I don't have my
favorite my favorite hair toothbrush
with me right now so I was forced to use
a different one you are gonna need a
bundle or two I will leave Julie here
information in the description box below
if you aren't interested this is the
same hair that I use this when I was
doing my hide Ninja long ponytail
tutorial so I will leave their other
video in the description box below if
you're interested to see how I got that
look as well but yeah I love you and
I'll see you guys in my next one
all right babes I'm gonna start off with
my Eco styling gel or semi wet hair as
you can see I already have my middle
part going and I'm just going to use
this product just to help me get my hair
super slick like I need it to be for
this look and I'm gonna put my hair all
the way in the back of my neck so you
don't have to have your hair this low
while your ponytail is low but I wanted
it like that this day so you know that's
just personal preference and yeah so I'm
going to put my hair in a ponytail using
one elastic band of course the elastic
band that I'm using it has no metal
that's really really important just
because you don't want anything to be
snugging and snatching your hair out
well no I'm gonna braid the remaining of
my hair that is left out in the ponytail
and then I'm going to start wrapping the
bundle with around my ponytail and of
course I'm gonna put my ponytail in a
bun
alright time for the fun part so now I'm
going to focus on this bundle and I'm
going to use this to make my ponytail
look a lot longer so of course I'm going
to put this little part in a bun before
I start wrapping the swept around and
I'm going to take this little piece of
the weft of this bun know of this bundle
and I'm going to pop it like in the base
of my ponytail so you see I'm taking
that really small piece that I'm holding
with my finger and I'm going to take
that piece and wrap it around my base
with my ponytail and I'm gonna use that
little small piece of hair that is on
that piece of weft and I'm going to wrap
that around the base of my ponytail as
well just to pretty much secure that way
and this is how I do mine once again
it's not difficult at all you know
there's so many different ways you can
do it you can you know take the weft and
put it in your bun with a bobby pin and
then start wrapping it around like that
but I don't like doing it like that it's
just too many bobby pins for me
personally so I just do it this way it's
gonna start wrapping the rest of the
breasts around the base of my ponytail
just to get the thickness that I want
you don't have to use a full bundle or
you can even use more bundles if this is
not full enough for you personally but
this was full enough for me so it's
really easy for you to just watch me do
this person II really kinda explain to
you guys how to do it so hopefully you
guys understand what I'm you know trying
to show you in this video I try to make
this video as clear as possible and yeah
so I'm just going to straighten the
bundle and just make sure everything is
laying how I want it to and that's
pretty much all that I do to get this
look so I hope you guys enjoy this video
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you baby
enjoy my middle sleep counting territory
oh so I'm so glad that I finally was
able to record this for you guys cuz I
know I'm a lot of you been asking me
about this so I promised you that I
would do that and yeah so I hope you
guys enjoy this video once again julie
