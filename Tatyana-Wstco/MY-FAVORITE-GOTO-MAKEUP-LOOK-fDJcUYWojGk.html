another video and I'm going to show you
this quick simple easy makeup look that
I believe I'm doing when I don't want
much on my eyes and I just don't want to
wing so yeah so are you applying my Mac
strobe cream and I'll list all the
products in the description box below if
you miss anything or if I don't say the
exact names properly or if I don't
mention the exact color or something so
I'm using soft ochre Paint Pot through
tamil is taking the shadow of Evelyn
just like that paint pot on top of that
to set it take them like this mustard
orange shade in the crease and then
taking this tangerine orange color color
in the crease as well but then packing
it on the outer V just intensify the
shade so I'm going to go in and create
this winged liner now with my ELF
liquid liner and I'm going to go in and
pack this red marune is kind of color in
the crease above the crease to blow it
out just to give me some more definition
and it looks like I really did something
when I do a do that damn thing with this
eyelid so it's really simple I like it
because we blended all those colors
together and now it was kind of fancy
well not right now but when it all comes
together you're going to see what I'm
talking about
alright so I'm just using some concealer
got a contour shade going on in my cheek
colors you know for watching you look a
little chisel for this around face that
I got and I'm going to apply some nc15
Pro Longwear foundation I call in to all
my stains and then I'm going to set that
under-eye concealer with my Laura
Mercier powder and this is a yellow one
and I'm going to go in with the Bobbi
Brown Foundation stick and expresso just
to deepen up this contour just so I can
look a little bit more cheerful because
I'm so over this round face right now
setting that with the black radiance
coping kit and you can find it from
Walgreens let me know if you guys want
my drugs for full face beat for me or
something because I've been finding so
many gems lately in the drugstore so let
me know if you guys want that and like
this video if you need that in your life
all right so I'm tight lining and adding
some gel liner in the waterline just as
how to look together a pod my falsies
here created this lip look that I didn't
like so I switched it up blew out the
under eye you don't really need to do
this if you don't want to but I was
wearing glasses today so I kind of
wanted to did a brown lip and it's lost
well a brown liner in a gloss and then
this is the outfit that I wanted to
struggle with today as you can see check
out this previous video if you want to
see the school cut crease that I created
love you guys so much thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
