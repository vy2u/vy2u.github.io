routine featuring my vanity planet spin
for perfect skin face and body brush
using my dove sensitive skin salt in my
exfoliating brush head from the system
and working that all over my face I
really love this dove soap because it
doesn't break out my face at least my
skin feeling really soft and radiant and
also this brush head its life it's
fading away my acne scars and all the
money perfections and I really love that
and it's been in my morning routine
night routine like ever since I bought
this I really love this brush system so
if you guys are interested I'll leave
the coupon code below in the direct
links to their website so you can check
out what they have on their website rush
system comes with 4 brush heads it has a
body brush a foot zone scrubber and soft
brushed and exfoliating brush and then
you'll be seeing me use my Garnier
blackhead eliminating scrub all over my
face and I really like this product
because I do have pores in my nose in my
chin so I really like working the
product in those areas in the help of
these bristles just burst the beats
openness in this face wash and it just
gets right in my skin and makes me not
have too many blackheads and just
control my bumps so now you'll be seeing
me using my garden a cleansing mask and
I really like this because it makes my
skin feel nice and smooth and I'll do
this twice a week and I'll leave this on
my face for 15 minutes and for 15
minutes what do i do just clean my house
get on my phone and in another video do
something like that and then yeah so I'm
then I'm just going using my exfoliating
brush to wipe that off of my face with
some soap and
leaves my skin feeling baby stop rubbing
it all off my face I'll be using my
Nivea soft moisturizer this product is
life I can't believe I'm just now
getting hip to this I don't know where
it's been all my life like what's been
going on I put that all over my face now
