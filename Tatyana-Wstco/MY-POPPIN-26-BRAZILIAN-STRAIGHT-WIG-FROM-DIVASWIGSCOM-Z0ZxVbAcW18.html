because I cannot light my candles in my
home because he continues to take all
the lighters with it thanks a lot okay
this video by saying hey ladies I'm back
with another video and today I'm going
to be sharing with you guys what's on
top of my head and it's a wig from
deepest wigs so excited to let you guys
know about this way because it is 26
inches of long Brazilian goodness from
their website and this is the first time
that I'm ever dealing with Deemas wigs
so super excited to share with you guys
my experience so far with this way so I
have a pamphlet where it gives you some
of the DS from the hair and I'm going to
read off basically the exact SKU number
of the hair so if you guys want the
exact hair type and it's the HC one zero
seven eight and it's Brazilian virgin
hair and the hair colored number one so
that's jet black lace color my brown
hair of the 26 inches cap size petite
size and it's a glue this lace cap cap 3
and it's 150 percent density wasn't a
clear part so I took some tweezers and
just plucked some of the hairs out of
the lace and then that's what made my
part a little bit more visible little
bit of baby hairs out like right here so
it can look a little bit more natural
and I've also put some layers in it and
I just did that today not knowing that I
was going to do it but I do have a
tutorial on how to frame face layers so
I'll leave that in the description box
below so you guys can check that out and
I'm thinking about putting some more
layers like in the back so it can be a
little bit more flowy and
natural-looking wig is constructed
really well it has three combs so it has
one on this top two on the side and not
one on
I had all these like but it's so perfect
because I hate when I receive a wig and
that comb in the bag - starts digging at
the back of my neck I hate that with a
passion so we can fit snug on you but
it's like eight different notches where
you can hook the drawstring poem verses
like maybe four and three I'm Way more
comfortable to wear the wig and I'm all
about comfort so it's nothing there
that's like digging in my neck or
causing me to like want to move the wig
around so what I received in my box when
I got my wig was these wig caps and um
this brush and they're starting to put
these scarves in your box now if you
order from them it's a really cute scarf
everybody needs an another scarf sweet I
did so I was really thankful for this
because lord knows I'm always losing my
scarves and it's a really cute scarf so
you can like styling with your hair if
you are about that star flyff um so yeah
so I got black wig caps I like using
like a more flesh tone type of wig cat
but that's what I received in my box and
I'm so pleased with this hair all I do
is run my flat iron through it a couple
of times before um I go out and this is
how silky straight it looks so when you
first receive the hair it may not look
like this silky straight but all I did
was run my comb through it with some
water and then I put my scarf on the top
so it can lay the flyaways down and then
after the rest of the hair was like
drying I ran my flat iron through it so
the comb wasn't drenched in water I just
went with the comb and I just ripped it
through so hopefully you guys understand
what I'm saying
if anything I'm gonna go and try to do
this right now so you guys can see what
I'm talking about okay so this is how
much water that I had on my comb so it's
not a lot and then what I did was rake
it through like this
and I did it on this side also but I
added more water I just don't feel like
getting back up and I stumped my
toe on the side of the wall when I got
up you guys should have heard me scream
so yeah so basically that's how I did
that put my scarf on tied it down let it
do its thing then I put my flat iron
through it and it got silky straight up
I just want to thank Deepa wig for
providing me a awesome a swig and I
recommend this way to anybody that's
looking for a way that's really easy to
maintain have it look amazing the next
day so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this
video I also wanted to show you guys the
lift without flashing you guys too much
so this is how the hair looks
all the way down so I cut these layers
and they hear it myself and then I just
love how thick the ends get like there's
no dead ends or no straight pieces at
all it's just really healthy hair and
it's a long 26 so how I store this hair
at night is just put it on top of my
mannequin head you can get a mannequin
head from your local beauty supply store
for maybe like two dollars and I just
placed the wig on top of that and that's
how I basically make sure it's safe
actually all that I do
I recommend this way to anyone that's
looking for a pop and adds stripes
silky soft smooth easy to maintain
Brazilian straight hair in a way for
guess what this is a all-over lace away
so I went and made my part a bit deeper
and so excited so what I did was use
this eyebrow razor and I just made the
part just be careful because this is a
razor and this is lace so you can rip it
um but if you are not comfortable enough
with using this you can use tweezers
this process is just a lot faster than
the tweezing process and then when I
went in with a brush a pointed brush and
some of my NARS radiant creamy concealer
in caramel I just made that part a
little bit more visible by applying my
caramel concealer I want to thank you
ladies so much for watching I had so
many more videos coming your way more
makeup tutorials that means my boyfriend
tag thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
