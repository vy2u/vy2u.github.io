Westco and I'm back with another video
excited to share with you some products
that I use on an everyday basis to keep
my skin happy healthy and glowing so
let's jump right in with the first
product that I want to mention so I have
to let you guys know about my vanity
planet spin for perfect skin and body
brush system I love this systems it
makes my life so much easier when it
comes to cleaning squeaky cleaning my
face and body because I'm dealing with
bristles brushes and cool stuff brush
come quick for different brush head it
comes with a body brush the soft brush
foot stone scrubber and exfoliating
brush that I already have attached to
the brush and holder because because I
use this system literally every day
cannot wake up without using it or go to
sleep without using it because it's been
making my skin look so flawless late mom
what I use with this brush system I use
my skin um duck soap I swear by this
stuff because yes I have sensitive skin
I do not like using makeup removers or
anything on my skin because it's way too
harsh for me and they tend to break me
out and I do not have time for that so I
just stick with this so when I'm ready
to wash my face in the morning night or
remove makeup this is what I'm using
with a once I know everything is
completely clean off of my face I go in
with my Garnier blackhead eliminating
scrub love this stuff as well this is
the blackhead eliminating scrub so it's
what it's supposed to do is unclog your
pores Clary complexion and this
literally has been doing that for me
most I have charcoal bits inside of it
that's supposed to be a magnet for all
the germs and oils to come out of your
pores and that's why this scrub is
supposed to be super awesome and it's
literally been doing wonders for me so
if you already use this let me know if
it has been doing wonders for you also
use these other two facial scrubs but I
do not have them by my side right now
because I didn't run out of them but
these two facial scrubs they just
rejuvenate my skin and make me feel like
my skin is bright healthy and glowing a
lot of natural ingredients and then by
everyday moisturizer I use my Garnier
moisture rescue gel cuz I do have combo
skin and I don't want anything too early
for my skin so with the gel it just
makes my skin feel smooth cool and knots
not too tight not too oily but like
smooth and cool so that's what the feel
that I try to go for for everyday you
gots a good moisturizer to keep under
your foundation or makeup routine so
that's why I like using that and at
night I like using coconut oil I use
100% virgin coconut oil I love this
stuff live I get I put this head to toe
from hair nails toes eyebrows all of
that after I get out the shower I'll put
that all over my body and it just helps
fade away blemishes or keep your skin
happy and glowing and healthy when I
feel a bump coming um I use these two
products alcohol in that specific area
and then I put this mint facial mask on
after I got this from Walgreens is by
Studio 35 it's a mint facial mess like I
said it's supposed to clear all so clear
blackheads and eliminate pores and what
I feel like it does it just gets all
that gunk and junk out of your skin the
sensation just makes me feel like it's
actually working deep within my some
pores and cleaning out all of that junk
in dirt and bumps are literally going
the next day or the day after
and once I use this product and if it
doesn't work that fast for you continue
using it and you will see a difference I
promise you and honestly ladies that is
all that I have to show you guys I don't
do anything too crazy with my skin
because I am dealing with sensitive skin
