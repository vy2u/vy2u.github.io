RPG hair unit this is their 14-inch
150% natural color glueless lace front
wig yaki straight bob lace front and the
style number is l fw 4/4 I will of
course leave that information in the
description box below so you guys can
check it out if you're interested I'm so
excited about this wig that's why it's
all up in your face like this girl so
even though it says yaki remy it's
amazing it's constructed really really
well by the way has four combs these jaw
straps that I use to pretty much get a
snug fit on this unit and this unit
actually came a small cap size thank God
so I'm gonna be really excited
throughout this video showing you guys
this wig so let's get started no kinky
straight from this hair company it's not
super bone straight like most of the
units that I review on my website so and
this is moreso of your you know vibe
please feel free to check out the link
in the description box below I like hair
like this just because it gives you a
more natural look if you like this hair
type if you like it to look less shiny
more real more thick definitely check
out hair like thinner you have to
definitely be careful with roaming hair
because I feel like you can't put that
much heat on it like you could put heat
on it but I feel like it's safe for you
to stay away from so much heat or Remy
type of hair so just because you want
the weight to last for a long time and
you don't want heat damage to be the
reason why longevity is not long anymore
so this is how it looks on their website
and it looks just like that right now
I'm just gonna have to rub my flat iron
through it a couple of times just
because you know we're now walking out
the house looking like this
buzz girl look at this look at that I'm
yanking as you can see I hope you can
see the vibration has my wig move in
where is it
so say go back at this I don't have to
use this today and some days I don't use
this on my ways all the time but I feel
like what I don't have to use it like
girl it's that's a good look that's a
good look honey and that's for it to get
hot I'm using my Connie air two-in-one
curling iron / flat iron to straighten
this bad boy
I haven't yet got the Chi I don't know
what I'm waiting for
I just feel like spending like a hundred
dollars on a flower and it's just too
much especially if this one gets the job
done you know what I'm saying I know you
know what I'm saying
I'm gonna put my comb in the hair and
run my Flatiron and do it just like that
so we call this the chasing method okay
but let me just talk to you guys about
this part like it's snatched already I
don't have to do much I just need to
make sure it's centered with this girl
they're gonna think that this is a
poppin as installation they just might
even think this is your hair just
because it's snatch that's hard
so definitely shout out to you RPG
because I remember when I worked with
RPG for the first time I thought it was
RPG hair show but it wasn't and I was
just like okay what's going on here I
have experience good and bad with this
company so I feel like they have been
stepping their game up and that's what
you know life pretty much is
and now like the past two units that
I've reviewed from this hair company
girl amazing may zing I know this so I
know there's going to be more units from
this company on my channel as long as
their quality is staying like this and
their weight construction is this bomb
girl like I will be buying every wig I
will be getting every way from this hair
company I will be purchasing every wig
from this hair company
I love how this hair is straightening
Mike definitely giving me natural hair
blowout vibes from the dominican
Harrison line
I literally wanna go outside and do a
photo shoot like that's how that's how
extra this wig is having me fill yes and
it's just like getting better as I
straighten it girl you can't beat this
you can't be this at oh look at that
this is like Aaliyah bomb-ass hair vibes
yeah I'm not getting any foul smell but
I still feel the same way when I say use
the less heat on yaki remy hair just
because it's not a virgin hair so the
quality can last for a long time as long
as you're storing it properly
I would definitely say keep the bag that
it came in keep the box that it came in
or even if you have a minikin head I'll
store it on top of your mannequin head
but make sure that mannequin head is
stored in the right place so it's not
falling over girl when I say this wig is
so like slow on my head that I can sleep
on this anymore for office right now and
shout out to this Jackie Remi like what
this ain't no Brazilian you ain't saying
you foreign or whatever you saying that
you yaki bitch bitch my Jackie is more
popping in your Brazilian what do I do
you need it you need to get this way you
need to feel what I'm feeling an even
girl if you're not a small cat sighs
just get you a smoke just kidding look
like PS this is the Henley medium brown
lace I made it a point to get a medium
brown lace it might even be dark brown
but I think it's medium brown and as you
can see I don't have to go in with any
concealer this part is clean honey you
can't go wrong with this unit this is
definitely like a girl I got something
to do my man is coming over but my hair
is not done live wig okay this is that
time you know what to do
the link is in the description box below
a gym is all I have to say thank you RPG
hair calm for this unit
came in this box right here don't mind
when I'm covering it has writing a check
it out on me
check it out honey make sure you do what
you need to do I tried another unit from
this hair company so if this one isn't
your tight one is it making you feel how
I'm feeling definitely check out their
body ways because that unit was fabulous
as well I just didn't feel the same way
about the cap size vibe but anyway the
hair was really really really really
really pretty so check it out remember
to store your hair in the right way so
you don't have to keep doing what I'm
doing right now which is straightening
the hair and girl if you have a cheat
this is probably gonna look ten times
better
this is so pretty guys like this is
giving you I just got my hair cut
trimmed took an inch off but my is
still giving you life vibes like can we
get this like it every color RPG can we
get this in like a neon orange a neon
blue neon yellow a lime green can we get
