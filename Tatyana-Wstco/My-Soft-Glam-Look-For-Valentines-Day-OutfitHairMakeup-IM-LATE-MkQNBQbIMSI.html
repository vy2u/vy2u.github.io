people I'm so excited because I think
this look is really cute okay even
though I know I didn't get this up
exactly on Valentine's Day or before
Valentine's Day
look it's Valentine's Day right now but
by the time I get this up it's going to
be the 15th and kill me but use this
later you know what I'm saying so cute
look festive and you know spring summer
is coming up and I think this is a cute
look for that as well so anyway we're
just gonna show you guys how I beat my
face for Valentine's Day and I hope you
guys enjoy so let's get it happen I'm
already primed and of course it's about
glowing beautiful skin healthy-looking
skin so I'm gonna prime with my prime
light primer from Milani and I'm gonna
go in with my concealer of course and
I'm using the LA girl Pro concealer in
almond and I'm gonna go in with my APA
generation stick and walnut to contour
and of course you know contouring is
about snatching the face I haven't been
in the gym lately and that's due to the
fact that I'm just living my life and
I'm just happy right now and I'm
distracted but I'm gonna get back in the
gym because I don't got time for this
face to be swollen all over again but
anyway I'm gonna use my two favorite
foundations to mix together so I can get
the proper foundation color cuz you know
I'm in between these two shades wanted
to read one it's too light so I like
mixing the two so this is cappuccino and
caramel and then I'm going to blend all
that together using my morphe 439 brush
and I'm going to also use my Beauty
Blender to blend out this concealer and
I'll be back when it's time to do the
next step oh of course I'm gonna set
with Laura Mercier I was gonna make this
an affordable look but I started
grabbing more higher-end products but at
the same time you can find dupes and all
that jazz I will try to list the dupes
in the description box below because I
definitely have some juice for
everything that I do use but everything
is pretty much affordable the only thing
that I didn't use I was affordable is
that foundation stick and you can use
NYX foundation stick to contour and you
don't have to use the NARS concealer if
you don't want to but I still use the LA
girl Pro concealer
you
bro dude
it's going to pretty much blend all of
this in I'm using this a vanity planet
brush I love their oval brushes you guys
have to get them I made a video on them
but I think I'm gonna remake the video
just because I felt like my skin looked
so terrible during that time and you
probably wasn't focusing on some brushes
because the skin but girl I love those
brushes I have to clean them so that's
why I haven't been using them but as you
can see I'm studying with my Laura
Mercier powder I mixed my Laura Mercier
powder with my Sacha buttercup powder so
if you feel like it looks a little bit
more yellow or thicker whatever the case
may be it's because I have another
powder inside of this powder as well so
I'm just
chisel out underneath my cheekbone just
because I want my face to look snatched
cuz I've been missing my appointments to
the gym so you know we're gonna use this
makeup as our exercise today and then
we're gonna pack that in because you
guys know I do not like doing the
sweeping unless I feel like it's really
necessary but then still I have a slight
powder on this brush that I use so
there's no patchiness going on I use my
Sephora micro smooth powders who set the
rest of my face and I use this brush to
do so so some of that product is always
left over on the brush if I don't clean
it and yeah and by the way my updated
skincare routine is coming it's coming
I'm so excited for you guys to know all
of the products that I've been using to
save my freaking skin I just can't wait
so make sure you thumbs up this video
for that so I can get it up sooner then
later I'm using my concealer to prime
today or as a base for my shadows I'm
just taking this true match foundation
powder I'll list the number in the
description box below but I like using
this to bronze up my face
I already bronzed up I don't know why I
didn't put that clip in there but anyway
I'm using that same powder so like
bronze up my eyes as well and I'm using
this fancy highlighter stick as you can
see it's right there I'll list that in
the description box below because I
forgot the name of it and I'm just using
that to make sure I am glowing for the
gods of course you've got you guys don't
have to use this there's so many dupes
in the drugstore that do the same thing
the loonie drops you can use anything to
get the same effect but I just like
putting this underneath my powder
highlight just so it can pop even more
and you guys are gonna see how pop my
highlight is in this video if you
haven't seen it already in the intro but
yeah so we're just gonna comb these
brows up using my micro brow pencil from
NYX affordable you guys can always get
that from Target and yeah express it
like I said I'm just going to pretty
much do these brows this wasn't a good
broad day but it's cool because you know
it is what it is every day is like a
brow day but Valentine's Day should have
have been a good broad day but you know
matter because it was going it's looking
off anyway so I carved out my brows with
my concealer but I'm using my
highlighter the same highlighter from
Rihanna I'm using that in the center of
my lid just so I can get this glowing
look going on and then I'm just going to
use these rhinestones that I got from
Michaels and I'm going to put in the
center of my lid and also underneath my
eye so I can get that little vibe going
more these little crystals are so cute
so I feel like it was really festive for
Valentine's Day because they were pink
so yeah so I'm just gonna apply some
mascara and then I'm gonna pop some
lashes on and the lashes that I use are
my favorite salon I forgot salon
something I'll list the name in the
description box but they're from Walmart
the number is 6:14 and they're my
favorite lashes and we stocked up on
them yesterday so I was able to use them
in this video
I was watching Selena that's why I'm so
into it like I love love Selena anyway
I'm just dragging that staying true
match powder underneath my eyes just all
that you can't either look in together
you know journal he's you know nothing
nothing dramatic nothing too crazy on
the eyes because we don't want to scare
but I'm convinced I made sacrifices I've
been balling ever since yeah I did
something wrong I had no trust in my
defense someone watching over so shakos
actor now also use another chocolate
cover just to get some more dimension in
my eye look
all right so those are my favorite
lashes and I'm going to put some glue
apply them and a pop apply the other one
and there they go look at all fluttery
and wispy and I didn't even apply any
mascara on them yet so I was really
excited well I'm always exciting when I
pop these lashes on like they're my
babies
what's next time to outline our lips I'm
using downtown beauty from NYX to
outline and just kinda to fill in my
lips because I am using a really really
pale pink nude kind of color so if I
didn't do that
like inner lip thing with the liner it
would have looked really really crazy on
me
so I'm gonna go in with this Becca
highlighting palette it's for you know
they made this one for shadows but I
feel like this is just a traveling
highlighter palette you know for your
face but I use the pink once a day just
because I was feeling pink for
Valentine's Day and it was my first time
using the pink one but it's a blinding
sis I love it so I'm using this fake
flash palette I actually got this one
off of I'm gonna say Amazon and or eBay
and I mix the hot pink and the white
together to get this light pink and I
used to line my waterline and it was a
bitch like I was trying not to you know
cry because I got one of this going on
underneath my eyes and stuff but yeah so
I'm just gonna add some gloss because I
didn't really want a matte lip I hate
matte lips nowadays I don't know why but
it's just not my forte and I do have a
little bump right there and I have
another little bump and the other side
of my face right there and the other
third mole is just a mole that I always
play it's not a bump I just put it down
there just for fun and what else am I
gonna do I'm gonna take some selfies
because I always like taking selfies to
make sure there's nothing that I've
missed you know to see if I have any
imperfections and stuff like that but
the imperfection that I see right now
after editing
well after filming the video was you see
that line from that stupid headband I
didn't blend that all the way out but of
course I did that before I went out cuz
I went in the bathroom I seen that so
yeah but hair information I will list it
in the description box below so you guys
can check it out if you are interested I
think I'm gonna change all my wig colors
into this just because I really really
like it it's like a action blonde kind
of color so yeah but anyway happy
Valentine's Day babes I hope you guys
had a great Valentine and I hope to see
