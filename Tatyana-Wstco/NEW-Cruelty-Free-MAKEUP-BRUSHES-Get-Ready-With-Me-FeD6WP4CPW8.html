by the name of vanity planet this is
vani planets professional importable
makeup brush collection just now getting
this video up is because I wanted to
work with these brushes so i can give
you guys my honest opinion so this is
their powder brush really am in love
with this brush super soft on the skin I
used to apply powder foundation or blush
this is their kabuki brush so it's
definitely meant for a mineralized
powder the product that I use with this
the most is this this is max mineralized
skin finish powder in dark deep my face
looks really nice after using this like
to help blend everything out and make
everything look seamless so this is
their flat top stippling brush this is
for like foundation or creamy products
what I use this for is to actually a
sweep off excess powder underneath my
eye this is they're angled contour brush
this brush right here it's so perfect
right in these areas really flawless
finish and really soft on this games
lifesaver this is their fan brush this
is another one of my favs when it's time
to dump my brush into the highway this
is my baby if it's right in those areas
down the bridge of my nose right up here
right up here I mean I put it on your
hand and warm up their products you can
dunk it use it just helped buy it on
there and then blend it out with a
beauty blender but when it comes to like
powder contour and I wanted to like be
really sharp and precise I like using
this and I like using this with powder
um I'll use this brush for cream contour
products in the hollows of my cheeks or
the bridge of my nose or my foreheads
there concealer brush really nice for
concealer so if I use this on a client I
will dump the brush into the product and
then I'll apply it and then use a beauty
blender yes they're medium sized
splitting brush I really do enjoy using
this brush for like the crease areas to
blow out my eye shadow it is very
precise and blended so you see how this
is like a little bit more out than this
one but I
love this and you can never have enough
blending brushes gosh this is their
crease shader brush to intensify color I
really like using that brush for that
and then using their blending brush to
blend it out so this is the angle liner
brush and they said this is for precise
eyeliner application but I use this to
carve out my brows really good for that
I love air precision concealer brush
this I use this for like getting in
areas like maybe in the tear ducts just
to pack some like no highlight in there
or no down the bridge of my nose it
problem on it to be a little bit more
precise than the other one expert i want
to show you guys is they're rounding
liner brush I use this for liner as well
as to do my brows I use a dark shadow
for my brows so it's really perfect to
get in there and tentative on your brow
shape or do they use this for you know
gel liner applications any eyeliner
application you can use this to this
smudging brush is used to like blow off
eyeliner or eyeshadow underneath your
water lines is the last and final brush
in their collection this is their lip
brush this is my baby go out your liner
your lip liner to make it look seamless
and to make it look like a perfect ombre
I really do love every last one of these
brushes from this brush collection so
you definitely need to pick it up I'll
have a discount code for you guys to use

thumbs up comment subscribe I'm going to
begin beating my face now before you

bye
you
bye
member
bye
okay so that's basically all of what I'm
doing to my face today um I didn't use
the smudging brush of the precision
concealer brush um or the liquid
foundation brush but I just didn't want
to get all of the brushes 30 is
unnecessary to use system brushes with
one makeup look that's how I the links
will be listed in the description box
for the VP brushes and yeah so thank you

thumbs up comment subscribe and let me
go run and show you guys the case that
it comes in great way to travel them
with your brushes so your bristles won't
get messed up or your brushes has these
little slot if it's all 15 brushes in
air to close it all you do is roll it up

open so a really good way to keep your
brushes stay see you ladies in my next
