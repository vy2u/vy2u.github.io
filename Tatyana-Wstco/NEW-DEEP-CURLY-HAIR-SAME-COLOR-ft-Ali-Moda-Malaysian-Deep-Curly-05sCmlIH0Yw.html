video and today I'm going to be sharing
with you guys my ally moto hair so it's
going to be a updated video for this
hair company I actually had an unboxing
video for this hair so you can actually
go and look at that video if you're
interested I'll list the link in the
description box below so I've been
rocking this hair and I'm in love like
this hair so freakin saw that I was just
like I need to get on camera it's felt
like I needed to share this hair with
you guys because I'm in love with this
freakin hair and this hair is soft as
hell like I don't have any cons with
this hair ain't no shedding I don't have
any foul smell I don't have any like
weird things going on at the back of my
neck like the hair nape enough or
anything like that it's really easy to
detangle and I got me a little braid
going on up here and this frontal is so
poppin like I don't think I ever said
that about a frontal they have like the
little dips in the hairline so you can
feel like it's like really your hairline
we use this frontal at all I did leash
the knots on the frontal but no tweezing
no plugging these little baby hairs
basically already came on the frontal
and then what I did was use my eyebrow
razor to cut the little baby hairs a
little bit shorter and just lick them
down with like a little brush and my
toothbrush my hair to brush so yeah so I
definitely would say get to a frontal
from Ally moto hair company because I
don't know how they did it and how I
didn't have to tweeze and pluck anything
I'm going to be coloring this hair I
actually colored some hair that I'm
going to cover this hair and it was that
peerless hair drops telling you guys
that the closure just wasn't my friend
and I love that freaking color and I
love those bundles but that closure was
giving me a hard time and I love that
hair color don't forget much then I'm
just like I can't I can't just not rock
that hair color just because that
closure is pissing me off
so I'm going to be bleaching this hair
to that color and I'm really excited
about it because that color just turned
out so poppin all I did was bleach the
hair like if you guys go watch my says
inspired hair tutorial or hair color
tutorial you guys can see how I bleach
my hair and Dad
so just take those tips from that video
and don't leave the bleach on that long
oh it's the same concept I don't do
anything different and um yeah but
anyway this is a Lee motor hair I'm so
excited and I'm so in love with this
hair it's super soft I don't plan on
straining this hair no time soon after
doing the bleaching process because it's
so nice but I know I am going to end up
curling it and styling it and layering
it for you guys because I love you guys
so much
and I know you guys are going to want to
see that video up for this hair because
I am going to be rocking the hell out of
this hair ten times more after doing
that cover and the fact that this is a
frontal so I'm going to be doing all
kinds of styles so I'm so excited so I'm
going to bleach this hair now because I
don't have anything else to do right now
other than to do what I need to be doing
and yeah so I hope you guys are excited
to see that after I get the results of
bleaching I'll come back and show you
guys so I'm super excited about that but
anyway I love you guys so freakin much
thank you so much for watching
anybody is a new day happy to be back
with you guys to share this hair color
that I just did last night for you so
like I said I was going to come back and
tell you guys how I achieved this hair
color and what I'm going to do is just
I'm going to leave the tutorial of me
showing you guys that is inspired hair
color in the description box because
it's basically the same thing that I did
to this hair I use the same exact
products I believe it's quick blue in
the salon care developer 40 volume
developer and what I suggest you do is
this is basically a shade down from the
scissor color so do not leave the bleach
on there for a very long time like I
would if I wanted that brassy Orange
common color that she had I didn't
really time the hair because by the time
I was finished with slapping all the
bleach on all this freaking hair it was
basically almost time for me to wash it
out the process of me putting the bleach
on took maybe like 10 to 15 minutes and
that's basically how long that you
should leave the bleach on there and if
you go super fast with applying the
bleach just leave the bleach on there
for maybe like 10 to 15 minutes but
check it in the meantime
like you can wrap it up how I wrapped it
up if you want to but please check it so
you can see if it's getting up to this
color
don't go blonde don't go brassy or so I
love the results I don't get any dead
ends no shedding no freaking shedding at
all so I was so excited about that no
problem with the frontal you guys know
that I will be honest at the front so
it's fried it will look fried right now
but doesn't it look just like the
bundles so yeah so if you feel like you
see like little darker pieces and darker
strands here and there in the hair I
didn't do anything fancy I didn't like
separate hair pieces or whatever and
make sure I like no bleach was on
certain spots I'm going to slap the
bleach on the hair literally and call it
a day
just like I did in that video when
you're trying to get to this color
you're going to be more aware of what
the bleach is doing versus you really
just trying to leave it on there to lift
as much as they possibly can to that
brassy orange color but like I said I'll
leave that video in the description box
below so you can check that out same
products that I use same technique to
make sure you watch the bleach
on the hair because it can get to that
brassy color and then if it does get to
the rising color you're going to have to
wash it out and then you're going to
have to find a dye discolor now I don't
think you want to do all of that
especially if you can just get bleached
to achieve this color you get arms and
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I just want to say that I am in
love with le moteur hair for taking this
color and for looking this amazing after
taking bleach and the frontal is not
fried super pretty and can we talk about
this wave pattern still like it's like I
never put bleach on it and I'll list all
the information - Ali moto hair in the
description box below this and this is
their natural deep curly hair texture
and I really feel like it is an actual
deep curly type of field because at the
bottom it's more like ringlets and then
at the top I feel like it's like a wave
or a deep wave or something like that so
thank you so much for watching ladies
and I'll see you guys in my next video
don't forget to thumbs up comment
subscribe and bye
