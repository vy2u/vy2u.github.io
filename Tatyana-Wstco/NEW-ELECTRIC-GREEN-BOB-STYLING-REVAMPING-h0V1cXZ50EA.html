gonna try to finesse this and make this
look cute but the backstory about this
this actually is a unit from oMG her
hair I will list it in the description
box below but this is the unit from them
and I really really like it so they're
almost lifted to a 6:13 so I decided
that I wanted to put a funky color on
air and I actually put a couple of
different dyes now I know it was like
adore green like adore emerald green at
the top and then there was a like just a
lime green and it was another color but
I'm trying to list the names in the
description box below this is actually a
unit from oMG her hair calm film this
video like three times but I just didn't
like how it turned out each time I think
he was my makeup that was thrown enough
so today we're gonna try to you know lay
down again and make it look cute pretty
much is the most basic makeup look that
I could possibly do nothing on my lids
just pop some wax going and have a
neutral light lip gloss kind of it so
hopefully it turns out how I want it to
turn out so I'm going to use some
conditioner just to co wash it and get
it back to its natural state we're gonna
blow it out and all that jazz so this is
how it looks after co-wash me this is
the unit after Co washing it I just
popped morning wake up curl so it does
have four cones and you know the
standard straps to make it fit more snug
okay the hair is a bit longer than this
but I cut it just because I was gone for
like a really short look the numbers
weirdness here so now I'm just going to
I'm gonna kind of like mold how I want
the hair to layer me since this wet
process will be a lot easier
so I'll blow this hair out and then I'll
be back when through that part is to
finish you guys know how to blow air out
all right babe so this is basically all
that I'm gonna do with this unit so I
hope you guys enjoy all the information
- this unit will be linked in the
description box below
I did call this myself though don't
think it came like this and I will try
to remember all of the dots and I use
because once again I had this unit for
like over like three months at this
point but yeah yeah I love you enough
babies in my next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
