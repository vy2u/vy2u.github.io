Giulia hair this is their Malaysian
10-inch and this is of course curly and
I wanted to go with 10-inch because I
was like I'm so tired of long hair
that's really curly like this I have a
ton of hair that is long and curly and I
really haven't gone on the shorter size
which with curly hair and the fact that
this is Malaysian here I knew it was
going to be really big and full and have
a lot of body so I wanted to do this
texture in this style so you can see the
hair is all of my face the best what
we're going to be working on today I'm
going to basically show you guys how I
maintain tickety's curls to look like
this the hair is so soft guys like if
you ever work with doing your hair let
me know in the description box below if
you ever work with doing your hair calm
please let me know in the comment
section below because I would love to
hear it you guys love their hair not
because this hair and freaking soft and
I don't know what I do have three
bundles of their Malaysian curly in and
so what I'm going to do right now is
just add water there's nothing in this
ended up going to add some leave-in
conditioner in the hair you don't have
to do this but I like doing this because
the hair is so curly and so pretty I
just want to revamp it for you guys and
I'm also going to cut the bank aback
first I want to wear any like this so
yeah so um I don't want to tarnish it I
just want to dampen it and I'm going to
roll my brush through it and then I'm
going to put the rebate conditioner in
there but yeah so I do have three
bundles in and I have a closer in as
well the closure is just literally right
here and then it stops in the back like
in the middle so um I think this is a
really cute style for the summer time so
that's a while also wanted to go short
I'm always going super long with curly
hair so I wanted to try something
different for me all that information
will be
in the description box below if you guys
want to try this hair out
I made this unit myself I just used a
mesh dome cap and tell you how like I
haven't been using mesh dome cats and I
just recently started because I couldn't
find the dome cast a table using expert
and girl the mesh is a life and it fits
me really freaking snug so I don't know
if I want to cut it in banks now because
I'm filling it like this too but I know
that I'm not going to always to want it
in the middle and I know that I'm not
always going to want in it but I think I
will said want to cut it why not right
what do you guys think you think I
should I'm just going to cut a little
bit so I'm just going to do this is
really pretty it doesn't have a self
smell or anything like that and it's
really easy to comb through because
you're not getting these super long
mints is definitely going to be worth
the purchase and of course you're not
going to be breaking your pockets when
you're in conditioner in this hair I
actually put my motions foam so that's
what I'm just going to do today
so yeah I was pulling for like a keri
hilson like in that one video kind of
vibe but i feel like i don't have to
keep the bank like extremely sure i just
at least need to get like the points
that are going to be all the must face i
think i'm going to do the bangs guys cuz
I can just see me wearing it like this
more often
so clearly I don't want to blunt cut so
that's why I'm using messages like that
so I still have a room for some
versatility like if I want to flip it
over because the banks are not extremely
short I want to get stream then anybody
start working with the graduation and if
you notice my makeup is inspired by
Rihanna's new song with dj khaled I love
that song at first I had to grow on me
like I love the original song but I was
like doing - singing it and I heard it
like more and more and I was just like
oh yeah this is definitely going to be a
hit for the summertime okay so this is
the motions from styling motion now I
like this because it doesn't get hard on
you you're still able to have slow eNOS
going on with your hair and it's not
like making it extremely harsh and hard
or anything like that and let's just
drop it all over the floor and why don't
you Tatiana no I'm just running because
I remember I didn't use leave-in
conditioner so I'm just going to run it
through my hands and put it through my
hair
have you guys been watching the oranges
women blackleg I'm so pressed I have not
finished the season yet and I don't want
to binge watch it even though that's
what I was doing while I was doing my
makeup but I just saw when I finished
the season like it one day because I'm
not going to have anything else to watch
that I really love watching so I pull
the hair just literally down here this
hair is going to be so pretty even when
I straighten it because half of this
body because of all these curl
all right so now I'm just going to let
it air-dry and I'll come back when it's
finish air drying just to show you guys
the final results but I have no cons
with this hair at all baby doll outside
as you can see in summer hair is
definitely a gym and I have to say this
is probably one of my favorite units
I've ever made myself just because it's
really different I just I died in a jet
black I'm pretty much trying to dye the
front jet reckon that it will Oliver jet
black because I might you know want to
do a different color with this hair and
I don't want it to be extremely hard for
me to lift the hair in the future but at
the same time it's a perfect purchase
just because look at the season we're in
super hot but I think this is very like
beachy vibes or if you want on a
vacation and you want to look cute you
know you don't want to do too much and
you're looking for something that's very
manageable and very like low maintenance
I think you guys are going to love this
one
so I hope you guys do but I'm going to
leave it alone up and as you see I'm
just messing with it I honestly just
thank you to a closure you know it's not
about that funk like always even though
like everything I really review in the
frontal or has like a lace frontal wig
or 360 frontal way but feel closures are
still popping - and they're very
versatile you can just place your
closures like that rectly in the middle
and then just shift your wig over
whenever you just want a middle part I'm
going to let this dry and I'm going to
finish watching my large swimming black
and I'll be back with the final result
nobody laughs no baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
