video for this hair that I have on top
of my head right now and this is
peerless the natural deep curly hair
texture and I really do like this hair I
have a closure and four bundles from
this hair company and I have a comb with
this hair the closure I do not like at
all
it gets matted and tangled and stuff
like that but I just decided that I was
going to always end up having the
closure up because there is no possible
way that I could actually rock the
closure down with the actual bundles and
I don't know if it's because I bleached
the nuts on the frontal and then like I
have like a little bit of extra bleach
on the hair that is about the same color
as the bundles but I didn't expect it to
do that but other than that but the
bundles are really pretty
once again this is Brazilian deep way
from natural deep way from this hair
company this is the Brazilian texture
I'll list all their links in the
description box below but we're going to
start this session up straightening and
curling I'm going to do the blow-drying
part off of camera and then I'm going to
come back on here when it's time to
straighten and stuff alright baby loves
let's begin look at how big and lush is
this hair guy after blowing it out I was
really filling it like this but then I
was like don't lose concentration start
the straightening process so I'm using
my two-in-one flatiron slash curling
iron from county air and I'm going to
use this to straighten the hair or to
get it as straight as possible because
it didn't get bone straight but I got it
straight enough that I was okay with
curling the hair and then I start going
in with my teasing brush and I just
start chasing the brush with my flat
iron and just this just makes it a
little bit more straighter so this is
why I do that and that's pretty much it
if you guys were wondering what serum I
used to try to like tame any frizziness
or prevent any breakage it was the
coconut milk anti breakage serum that I
got from the organics line so you guys
can use that or you can use a heating
protectant spray instead of a serum but
now we're getting to
curling the hair with my one-and-a-half
inch curling iron from Revlon and I got
this from Walgreens so you can pick that
up from there and you notice in a second
that I start layering the hair with my
scissors because when it was just one
like length I could not keep a curl in
this hair and it was so weird and I knew
wasn't the hair that was doing it I just
thought it was just the curling iron
being so huge and I was like well we're
going to try something before I just
give up completely and tell you guys
that the hair doesn't curl either I
decided to throw some layers in it and
it actually curled so I was really
excited about that
because I loved how big and like
voluminous the curls were if that's even
a freaking word but anyway this is
pretty much all that I'm going to be
doing with my hair I actually alternate
the curls I curl them towards my face
and then I curl it away from my face
sometimes so it just depends on what
kind of look that you're going for I
love how these curls turned out I hold
the curls for maybe like five seconds
and then I let them go and then I keep
curling iron on the hair for maybe like
five seconds also so you can just do
this to achieve the same type of
hairstyle if you want this hairstyle and
yeah I really do like how this hair
turned out I but all their links will be
in the description box below I am going
to come back and talk to you guys at the
end because I actually go and co-wash
the hair or just run it underneath water
just to show you guys that it will
revert back to a curl pattern that you
may be looking forward to seeing if you
were to style this hair at any point of
time if you do order hair from peerless
hair but thank you so much for watching
ladies and I'll see you guys in my next
video bye
Oh your round ball Fanny crying it's
lovely venue
how it looks after me running the hair
underneath some water just to see if it
was going to revert back to its wave
pattern and it actually did so like I
said I love the bundles the closure is
just not my friend thank you so much for
watching all the links will be in the
description box below I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
