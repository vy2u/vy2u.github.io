video today I'm gonna be sharing with
you guys some hair that I received from
Sparkle diva hair calm this is their
Brazilian straight
I have 224 222 in in the beginning that
you seen I rocked it for some time just
to see how the hair will hold up and I
did receive a lot of shedding so I went
in and cut the hair so after cutting the
hair to this style right here the
shedding was at a minimum this video is
pretty old but I just really wanted to
try out the hair for you guys before I
even did an initial review so yeah so
this is basically what I came up with
but I plan on going shorter I didn't
want to go shorter without letting guys
know what's going on so far with the
hair but let me know if you guys want me
to show you guys the short cut that I
ended up doing with this if you want me
to film the new shortcut that I'm gonna
do with this hair let me know in the
comment section below but I'll let you
guys enjoy the rest of the video Sparkle
diva information will be listed in the
description box below and I would love
to hear if you work with this company
before in the past I do want to let you
guys know that they let me know that
maybe it was because of the long lengths
the reason why this hair was shedding so
you know that may be something that you
need to take into consideration when you
are purchasing hair from this hair
company if you're going with the 613 I'm
sure they're straight natural bundles
don't do this but like I said this is
basically what I'm experiencing with my
Sparkle diva bundles so you think maybe
those I am back today and I just wanted
to talk to you guys about this new 613
that I have in my head it's actually
from a company called Sparkle diva hair
I actually got it maybe like um two
weeks ago I want to say two weeks ago
and I did my fair share of testing and
doing all that jazz right so when I
first received it it came like a regular
six thirteen color and it was honestly a
little lighter than six thirteen so I
was really happy that that yellow
colored wasn't really in the hair but it
was still slightly too yellow it was
slightly too yellow for me so I didn't
know if I wanted to bleach the roots or
if I wanted to
the Harrigan 2a t18 ash blonde from well
a toner you can pick it up at Sally's
Beauty Supply Store if you're trying to
cancel out any brassy shades going on
with your hair
but with blonde hair I'm already
expecting it to be really like difficult
to maintain only because it's blonde
hair one i'm brown skin my makeup is
brown skins so if i put makeup on i have
six thirteen hair on and then forgets on
my face sometimes it turns out to be
dingy and all that madness but that's
not the main problem because you can
wash the hair but if the hair is like
brittle and stiff then that's when it's
a problem i honestly use a lot of heat
on this hair too just because when when
i first toned it I had to co wash it so
I co wash it left conditioner in there I
even got a mask for this hair just so it
can like bring itself back to life but
girl it still does some shedding but
today we're gonna go and cut it some
more just because I want it short
yes
alright babe so this is my Sparkle diva
hair I hope you guys enjoyed this video
I hope you enjoyed the transformation
literally all I use with some shears
just to thin this out if I would've did
it in here if I would have done that in
here my room wouldn't look like a sheep
that died so I didn't do that in here oh
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
