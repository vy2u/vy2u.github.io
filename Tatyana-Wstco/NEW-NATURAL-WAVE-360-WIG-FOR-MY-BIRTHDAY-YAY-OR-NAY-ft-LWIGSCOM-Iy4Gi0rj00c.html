today I'm going to be sharing with you
guys my new way from El wig so we're
just going to jump right into this
unboxing I'm going to show you that how
a thousand this is their 360 laid awake
human hair 180 percent density 1b and a
number 30 so this is their to toe wig
and you can get this unit in a solid
color you guys don't feel the color but
I love this color so I think you guys
are going to let it do but this is a
natural wave hair style and I have a
small cat size I do have a natural hair
line bleach knot with combs and Clips so
this unit is fitting really snug I'm
really pleased with it so throughout
this video I'm going to show you guys
how to super customize your way to make
it lay properly and how I feel about the
unit throughout the video I'm going to
be explaining that as well you got it
just actually continue to watch for yes
so this is how it looks so once again
this is supposed to be deep wave and I
hope you guys can see the natural color
because it looks Brown it may look Brown
on camera no I think it's picking up yet
picking up the natural comment this is
really pretty it does have a smell it's
not like unbearable but I don't know
it's going to have to get co-wash so I'm
going to Co watch this way but I'm going
to stab it first of course you guys know
but I have to do this because I just
want to customize a lot it can fit in my
liking but the color looks really pretty
you can tell this is the actual pattern
because of the texture it's not super
like oily or in a tight I know I can
tight style is our problem base I'm
going to have to put in order to see how
dark brown it is like I guess this is
considered dark brown it doesn't really
look down grunts me usually athletes the
nuts so I don't know if I'm going to
have to go in and bleach the nuts but
that would probably will be the second
video so I can tell you guys how to
bleach the knots previous video I was
asking if you guys wanted to see how to
reach the nozzle anyway so I might just
go ahead and do that in the second video
but today I just want to stand up for
you guys and for combs so
si1 like in the back in the middle it's
not right in the lace like I tell you
guys I hate that because I usually have
to cut the middle comb out and of course
one in the back all the way in the back
so you can tuck it underneath your wig
hat so of course I'm going to start off
by putting my straps and death hash
dress adjustable straps and this is just
to make sure your weight is fitting as
tight as you want it does not look like
crazy when I'm doing that so I'm very
pleased with that and I want to cut some
of the length off first because you guys
know I feel like that defeats the
purpose to put it on and then have to
take it back off the comb
can you see it I'm going to tuck it
right underneath um my wicket I like
making sure it's right at my sideburns
pretty much so I guess it really good on
me when I go to customize it and lay it
down with my hairspray okay whatever cut
all of this off and I'm going to keep
this part because I still wanted to
cover my sideburns so I'm going to start
back here pretty much to cut the blades
off and I like just poking a hole where
I feel like I need to fix it and then I
cut it in like that and cut so this is
how much I cut on in some wigs just come
with the bin here is very easy for you
to find but as you can see with this
unit it was like pushed back in the hair
now we kind of got all of the shorts
baby hairs that are in this wig out and
ready to trim in all of that good stuff
does this have a back look if you would
like to put it in a ponytail really nice
and natural looking so keep that in mind
I'm going to work on the baby hairs now
I'm just going to apply some most on the
baby hairs that I would like to keep out
use my toothbrush to pretty much
customize the baby hairs and I'm going
to also cut them with some scissors but
I'm not going to bluntly cut them like
straight across I'm just going to use
the scissors as if it was like a razor
and do it like that so yes so I'm going
to speed that hafez up that's why I'm
telling you that right now
what I decided to do with my Elvis
weight today I really do love the color
after I visit like a green value on
Sierra inspired kind of color I love it
on this plane of custom colors like this
with my wigs
in the past but I really really do like
this color with me
my birthday is tomorrow so I'm super
excited about that I'm not sure I'm
going to wear this way from over there
or not I don't know if I want to wear
this wig or my gray silver wig whatever
you want to call it but I'm really
really so this way so I think you guys
were enjoying it it does have a slice to
know when you receive the way I won't
worry about that and I kind of smelt it
when I put the water on there a little
bit I don't know what the smell is maybe
it's just because you know the process
of covering it and stuff like that
whatever they use that probably is what
caused the smell but once again it's not
like I can't wear this way because the
hair smells that bad it's like a
chemically kind of smell if you guys
give it up and that's not bad here
because it does have a wave it's a
really really pretty waist it covered
well because this has to be like a
custom color that they did the hair does
come in a solid like 1v color if you
guys want it this one is just the
two-tone color one so you can keep that
in mind if you just want the actual wig
in a solid color or natural color and
yeah I really do like it I love the wave
pattern it's not completely dry but as
you can see it's going to drive really
really nice because it's in line
why I didn't spray like I didn't drench
the hair with a spray bottle but I did
make sure I went through the hair and
make sure all of it was wet so when it
dries is almost to be an even look so
I'm really really excited about it I
think you have to really love this way
I'm going to update you guys and I'm
going to also reach the not wanna switch
so that's gonna be my next video for
this unit it's going to show you how I
bleach the nuts for my unit to make it
look natural so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
