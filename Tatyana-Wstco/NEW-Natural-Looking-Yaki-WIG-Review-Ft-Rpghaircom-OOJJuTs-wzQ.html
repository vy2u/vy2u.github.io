we're just going to make sure we get
through this one all right babe let's
get it done I love baby labs I am back
with another video and today I have in
my second RPG hair wig that I promised
to show you guys and you haven't seen
the first week that I received from this
hair company I will list the video link
in the description box below so you can
check it out because I was in love with
that wig as well and I'm still in love
with it it's holding up really good and
I don't have any cons with it so far
same with this one it fits really snug
it has four combs drawstrings pull it
it's still in like a sew-in once again
it's really really tight on my head and
I really really appreciate that and the
fact that it doesn't have any wealth and
falls in the back because I did make
sure I pulled everything as tight as
possible
and for it to not move and you know just
so me or whatever so I think you guys
would really appreciate that because I
take that into consideration when I'm
rocking wigs because I do not like my
wigs to be moving around oh wait is a
wig and it's supposed to be really easy
to maintain it supposed to be really
easy for you just to pop it on take it
off you know so not always do I use my
holding spray to lay down the link so
with this wig I didn't have to do that
all that extra steps to make it lace
really slow on me and it's just doing
what it's supposed to do you know
straight on the box so I'm really
pleased with that I haven't ran you know
any curling irons or anything through
this hair or a flatiron I guess in where
name is necessary or putting it in a
ponytail or doing like halfway up
halfway down types of styles with this
hair but today I'm going to try and curl
it for you guys so you guys just so we
can see if they hold the curl or not but
if you guys a little bit more
information about them going really
quick so this is the lfw 3-3 360 ways
away it's a natural color 18 inches 150
st. Tiffany and it's a Yacky wig the
texture definitely mimics natural hair
so I definitely think you guys will like
this and this is my second time working
with a Yacky texture and what I can say
about the previous yes again and I
worked with was it helped an amazing
curl so I'm very excited to curl this
hair for you guys and I just might start
some flexi rods in this as well just to
see how tight it will get cuz this is a
360 front so you can't party wherever
you want in the front and a little bit
in the back the back is just a little
bit of space to work with so just be
aware of that but you they do have tons
of other textures tons of a styles and
all kinds of stuff on their website that
you can check out I think they even have
bundles but I'm not exactly sure but all
of their information will be listed in
the description box below
Thank You RPG hair for another wig I
really do appreciate it because these
wigs are really really poppin like I am
very pleased
so get into this look because I think
you guys are going to love it
just let alone this hairstyle right here
is giving me life so I am pleased with
it I feel like if I let the curls in the
flexi rod a little bit longer will be
tighter but it wouldn't make any sense
because I was born with us that like
this due to the fact I'm going to be
messing with my hair all night but all
the RPG hair information will leave it
in the comment not in the comment
section but will be listed in the
description box below so you can check
that out I will leave my previous video
the links to my other thing that I
received from this company in the
description box as well so you can check
that one out because I love that one as
much as I'm gagging over this
one so I will see you babies in my next
videos don't forget to turn on your
figure notifications so you got to see
the girls lay in her next one
