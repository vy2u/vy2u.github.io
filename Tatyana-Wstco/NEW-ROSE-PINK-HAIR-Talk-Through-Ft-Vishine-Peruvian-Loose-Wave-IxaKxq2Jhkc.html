hi to you guys I'm going to be quickly
styling this hair with some big curls
using my Revlon one-and-a-half inch
curling iron
I actually bleached this v Shawn
Peruvian loose wave hair to this amazing
freaking color and I'm super excited to
share with you guys how I achieved it
I'm going to be explaining to you guys
at the end of the video on how I got
this hair color it was really easy quick
and a bleaching process when this hair
did really good the hair didn't get
brittle or damaged or anything like that
I really didn't have to go in and cut
any ends off but I really really really
love this freaking color so if you love
pink I think you should definitely try
this color on you I used blonde
brilliance developer and bleaching
powder
I said color blue color brilliance in
this video but it's blond brilliance
and then the dye color that I used was
by color brilliance the eye on rose
quartz but I'm going to let you guys
finish watching this video I just wanted
to come on and say hi like I said and
I'll talk to you guys towards the end
love you bye
you
I wanted to talk to you guys about how I
achieved this color because I know you
guys are going to ask me a ton of
questions which you should because it's
an amazing color and I feel like every
girl in the world that loves pink should
go and try to this color on themselves
anyway I use the color brilliance
developer and bleaching powder on this
hey I use the blonde brilliance not the
color brilliance blonde brilliance on
this hair I spoke about this product in
another video I'm not exactly sure which
one but you guys know I love this
because it led to lift your hair to 9
levels so meaning like you will go from
A 1 B to a 6 13 and I think that's
amazing
it has a ton of great ingredients inside
of it that's not going to strip your
hair and make everything look brassy and
brittle it has like keratin coconut oil
mango oil and it's just supposed to
smooth and make your hair very shiny and
healthy looking and it's supposed to
reduce dryness you guys know after
bleaching hair it can be like a hot
brittle mess and you have to do a lot of
deep conditioned you have to put like
oil treatments or something like that
it's infused with great ingredients so
you don't have to worry about all of
that crazy hot mess stuff so after
getting it to a 6:13 color you're gonna
want to tone it into tone it I use the
same color brilliance companies toner
it's the cool blondes lathering toner
and it has all the great ingredients
inside this too so what this is supposed
to do once again is cancel out the
yellow tones purple cancels out yellow
tones so you're going to be left with
like a cool action blonde kind of
looking color I just like the hair being
stripped of all of that yellow and then
I like to do my own thing with the hair
so if you see lighter pieces is because
I did a lot with this dyeing process so
what I did was I bought these three
boxes and I this is the color brilliance
ion color umm rose quartz and I actually
put it on my Instagram so you guys knew
that that was the dye that I was going
to be using for this hair color and then
when I went in and did was I took my
raging red hair dye from a door and I
just dabbed a little bit inside of a
bowl that had a bunch of conditioner in
it and I made three different colors
that I wanted to have
in this hair so I wanted to highlighted
like type of effect in this hair so I
put all of the three boxes eyes on this
hair and then on top of it I created the
three different shades of pink with that
raging red I made like a hot pink Barbie
like Pink Panther pink and I did like a
really pastel edge kind of pink and
that's pretty much why you see like all
of these highlighted colors in my hair I
didn't do like one solid color on this
hair so yeah so that's pretty much all I
did after washing the bleach out of
course then that's when I did the colors
I let the hair air dry I didn't blow it
out with a blow dryer because I don't
like putting a lot of heat on hair that
I just bleached and sometimes the ends
can be like brittle and stuff even
though these ends weren't like that I
just made sure when I wash the bleach
out I use my whole blends shampoo and
conditioner on the hair and I'll let the
conditioner in there for maybe 45
minutes so it can get all is healthy
nutrients fact that whole blends
conditioner provides and I was pretty
pleased with the results
I loved the hair color it was super
super pretty I may put a few pictures of
how it looked after I'm washing the
conditioner and shampoo out because I do
have a few pictures on my phone and
that's pretty much it after I did the
coloring process
I left the hair on there I let the color
on there for a little bit
not too long because I didn't want
anything too crazy like I didn't want
anything to be too to vibrate and of
course the kind of light that I'm in
right now you can't really see the
actual color but I'm of course we're
going to do more videos in the daytime
so you guys are going to see that and
I'm actually getting my ring light
thanks to my mummy she um she got that
for me for Christmas so it's going to be
on its way and yeah I'm super excited
about getting that ring light blue but
you guys will be seeing the hair a
little bit more in the future when I do
more videos so yeah thanks so much guys
for watching shadows of Ishaan because
I'm so happy that this hair held up
amazing during all of that I was very
therapeutic it's always therapeutic when
I'm doing my hair
they're like it's like it takes me away
from all like the thoughts that I may be
thinking about when I'm not bleaching or
dyeing my hair if you guys don't really
care for doing here you probably won't
ever understand but whatever makes you
feel at ease just think of it as that
and that's how I feel when I bleach my
hair you get on sand or just do my hair
in general so other than that ladies
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
