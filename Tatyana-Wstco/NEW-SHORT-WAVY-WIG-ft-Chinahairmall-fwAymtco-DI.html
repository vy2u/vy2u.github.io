how gross is that honey I don't even use
anymore but that is just sick take 75
won this video okay let's get it
hi everyone I'm back with another video
okay let's look at the camera when I say
hi to you guys have a love muffins I'm
back with another video and I have a new
unit for you guys if you're interested
and I think you guys are going to love
this unit
why because I think it's poppin and you
should think it's popping because you
know I ain't gonna steer you in the
wrong direction lady alright so this
unit is from China hair mall and it's a
Malaysian Wave place from wig and the
SKU number for this wig is lfw 0 6 7
malaysian virgin hair 12 inch natural
color all that information will be in
the description box you guys know how
that goes but let's talk about this hair
really quick so I did go and manipulate
this hair just to see for you guys if it
was going to have a wave pattern if I
decided that I wanted to win it now what
I did after wetting it I even did the
extra step to add in some leave-in
conditioner just to see what it would do
and it left the hair really soft and
easy and manageable it didn't get
conjugating it hard and they do anything
weird and I didn't even have to put that
leave-in conditioner in there but it was
just sitting on my counter looking so
beautiful and smelling so amazing and I
just wanted to slap that in the hair and
see what it was going to do because I
wanted that wet beachy kind of wavy kind
of look with um this hair today and I'm
going to leave a clip of how the hair
looked before I manipulated the hair
with water and can't to leave in
conditioner and that's how a look was
really pretty and really soft but what I
ended up doing was sleeping on the unit
one night by accident and I just wanted
to revamp it in the morning time so
that's what I ended up doing and I was
just like why - well you know see how
well it holds up if I did want to put
some water in it and if it was going to
have a wave and it did have a wave once
again I didn't have
leave I didn't have to put the leave-in
conditioner in there but I just wanted
to just because once again it was
sitting on my counter and I just love
the smell of that leave-in conditioner
but so you guys know that I'm being
honest about the fact that the hair does
have a wave after I'm going to spray my
hair down with a water bottle in a
second with my spray bottle in a second
so you guys can see how amazing this
wave is without the can to leave-in
conditioner but yeah so the hair does
have four combs
in it one at the top one on each side
and one in the back and it does have a
drawstring that you can pull really snug
if you wanted to favorite least up on
your head and it's just very easy it's a
very manageable if you guys just want a
wet and go type of look this is the wig
for you this is 130 percent density so
it's not a lot that you're working with
it's not a lot of hair that you're
working with and I just think it's very
affordable at the same time very easy to
maintain once again so I'll list all a
whole list I will list all the
information to this wig in the
description box below if you're
interested this unit that I have on top
of my home but yeah I love you guys so
much thank you so much for watching and
shout out to China hair mall for giving
me this poppin wig so I definitely was
wearing this all holiday if you guys
follow me on snapchat you probably seen
me rocking it love you but okay I'm
going to show you guys how to here looks
sprang the hair down with my spray
bottle really quick so let's get it
all right so we're going to let the hair
do its own thing for a little bit so you
can see I thought I seen the bug I was
about to flip out but as you can see um
I didn't really drench the unit I just
put some water in there just a little
bit just to get it all damp not like
super wet and I just use this comb that
really doesn't comb through the wings
exactly and then as you can see I just
took this comb and just try to tame the
top a little bit you know slick it back
comb it back that's pretty much it I'm
going to let it completely air dry and
then I'm going to come back until guys
ladies basically how the pattern is
going to look and so going to look
really pretty
um I'm probably just going to lay in my
bed for a little bit just because this
light is freakin blinding me right now I
love you guys so much thank you so much
for watching and I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
