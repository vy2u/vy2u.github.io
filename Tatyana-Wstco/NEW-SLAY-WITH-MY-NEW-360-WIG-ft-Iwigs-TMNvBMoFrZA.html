video and today I thought I was going to
be here with you guys I makeup look but
it didn't turn out how I thought it was
going to turn out but I do want to talk
to you guys about my hair
so this hair is from I wave hair and yes
it is a wave honey it is a 360 lace
frontal wig or however you describe
these type of units meaning like you
know where if you had a nice frontal it
will be ear to ear and this one actually
is all the way around 360 in this unit
it actually is 4 inch of parting in the
front and two inches parting in the back
so you can pretty much do whatever you
really want for this hair halfway up of
depart a side part but in the middle
it's still machine WestEd so you can
still see the West if you were to try to
part it completely down the middle it
just won't work because you still have
the West showing and this machine what
they once again in the middle part but
four inches of parting in the front two
inches in the back that's still really
good and you can do like a really nice
braid or something like a braid
wraparound type of style it's really
really snug or my head I'm really happy
with how this wig is constructed this is
a cap size small and it does have four
columns one in the middle to other side
well one on each side and one in the
back and it does have two I'll show you
so you can pull it really snug to your
head so it can fit really good on you
this is how the back looks if you were
to put it in a ponytail and I think it's
really cute it's where the girls are
just want to throw something on but
still you'll be able to do different
styles with you know your hair and I
really do like it I wore out the other
night for the first time and I ended up
wearing it half way up half way down and
I took it down and just did like a
really deep side part with it and not
flipped it over and I really liked it
like that and I really do like it half
way up half way down
well can I tell you about this wig it is
a body wave wig as you can see this is
its natural wave pattern
it's 200% density it has a natural
hairline had bleached nuts it's actually
a pre plus wig and pretty much the front
was pre plus with the size I felt like
could have been plucked a little bit
more because we want our size to look as
natural as possible as well and I had to
go in and pluck it a little bit more
because it wasn't really as natural how
I wanted it to look and let's see them
and I think that's something very
important to look forward to when you're
purchasing a 360 frontal is the density
and how bulky it's going to look and
without ways you're not receiving
anything too crazy nothing bulky perfect
entity to wear up do's and styles like
this is laying flat to my head and it's
not too thin it's not too thick I want
to zoom in so you guys can actually see
that pre plug frontal area
if I was to take this offense exactly
how it looks and I just think it's a
really awesome unit if you were
interested into getting something that's
really easy to maintain other than that
this is pretty much I wigs hair I'm
going to probably do a halfway up
halfway down stuff for you guys quickly
so you guys can see other ways that you
can rock this wig and I'm going to take
the hair down I just wanted to share
with you guys how the weight looks in a
ponytail if you were interested in
wearing it in a ponytail and once again
this is how it looks again I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I will list all
the information in the description box
below if you are interested in
purchasing from this hair company all
the information that I have for my wigs
will be listed in the description box
below thank you so much for watching
guys and I hope you enjoy the rest of
the video
