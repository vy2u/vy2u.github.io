video for you ladies because it's close
and I wanted to do something a little
bit more toned down and simple for the
girl that doesn't want too much on a day
and just want to you know do something
really subtle with the eyes and maybe
like a bold wing and a nice little lip
matte lip or you can just put some gloss
on top of this it doesn't really matter
but before I get into this makeup look I
do want to talk to you guys about my
hair because I'm so in love with this
freakin hair so I had this hair for
almost a month now this hair is from
Annabelle hair it's an Aliexpress hair
company I did receive two different hair
types from this hair company this is
their Brazilian straight of course and
I'm so in love with this hair I the only
thing that I've done to this hair was
add some layers in the front so it can
like frame my face a little bit more but
nothing too too dramatic the ends are
really pretty I'm gonna stand up so you
guys can see the hair where it falls
it's really nice and I love this hair
it's so pretty like I have you know you
don't lose them I love this forget no
tangling no name paint no weird things
no shedding and this is some long hair
for it to be 24 inches and 22 inches in
city is perfect so if you guys really do
you want 24 22 you can get about four
bundles for it to be as full as this one
or you can get shorter lengths and you
will only need about 2 to 3 bundles if
you get shorter lengths under 24 and 22
inches so yeah but by the way I did
bleach the knots on this hair and if it
looks green or blue or whatever is
because I decided that I wanted to put
my blue dye over the hair and thinking
that when I had balista knots I kind of
got some of the some of the hair of like
blonde and you know by that brassy
orange color and I just thought some
dark blue navy blue dye would just turn
it navy blue and it won't look too too
dramatic and too drastic but then I
should have known that it was gonna do
that because it was a rinse blue dye and
not a permanent blue dye so when it was
coming out it was just turning the hair
like green and like this weird kind of
color but I don't mind eh I think it's
unique I think it's a little different
so yeah I plan on doing a different
color with my hair soon but not with
this hair because this hair is so nice
and I don't want to bleach it I don't
want to cut it I don't want to do
anything with this hair other than keep
it this long keep these little frames in
the hair and because this has to be one
of my favorite units that I made for
myself because it's just it's so flat to
my head and it's really easy to maintain
I don't have to put any heat on the hair
once again like I never really had
straight hair that I haven't had to put
a straightener through it and the only
thing I do when I pop this wig on my
head is run my comb through it in the
morning time and I call it as a
girlfriend so I hope you guys enjoy the
rest of this video I think you guys will
love and about hair but I always tell
you guys to do more research and get
your second third and fourth opinions so
I love you guys and I hope to see you
guys in my next video
enjoy the rest of this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
