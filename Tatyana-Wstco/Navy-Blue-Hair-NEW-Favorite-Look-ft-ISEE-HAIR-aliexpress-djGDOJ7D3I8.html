make our spot off and I think I want to
smash up guys today I'm gonna be showing
you guys how to get these curls with my
icy hair this is enough this is inelia
express hair company so if you are
interested I will leave their
information to their Brazilian embody
wave 24 inch then plus their front so in
the description box below it's three
o'clock in the morning but I had to get
this video for you guys hey love muffins
I am back with another video today I'm
gonna quickly stop my Icee hair from you
guys I recently just dyed this hair
bleached it and I've is hair blue so
hopefully you guys like it I like it I
like how dark the blue is it makes me
pretty excited I would like the hair
till I kind of stay like this today but
I just want to curl it just to get it
into another style because I really
haven't curled this I really haven't
curled this hair like I would normally
curl my hair's I kind of been wearing it
just like this and this like greatest ow
this is their body wave hair by the way
so if you are interested I will leave
their information in the description box
below I am going to be reviewing some
stray hair from this company also once
again this is my express hair company I
don't have any cons with it so far
because I have lifted the hair which is
bleaching there and because I'm bleached
the hair and dyed it and I haven't been
receiving any problems I'm all here for
it so I won't keep you guys posted what
I give you guys an update
and the straight hair video but so far
so good with this so what I'm gonna do
is just pretty much alternating my curls
I was gonna do wrong curls I think it
would look really pretty on this hair
but you're like doing wrong wrong curls
right now so I just want to show you
guys how well this hair curl that maybe
I'll do wan curls on the other side so
just let's see what it brings I might be
in a mood I might be in the mood in a
couple of seconds so we'll see so just
bear with me but like I've worn this
hair out a couple of times now I wanted
to add some character to some hair you
guys know I've been blond lately and I
haven't review coming up with that video
so you guys know how to get the blonde
color the only thing about that video is
to talk through on how to get it it's
not a DIY like do-it-yourself kind of
video so you guys might hate me for that
but I I pretty much didn't even know
what I was going to do with that hair
and I just went ahead and just bleached
it on my own time so yeah but once again
this is IC hair and I'll leave the links
in the description box below I do have
three bundles of their 24 inch bazillion
body wave hair in + and 20 inch frontal
so some curls are going away from my
face others are going backwards so
alternating is just each of one curl is
going one way the other colors going in
next way so some curls are going towards
my face or the curls are going away from
my face and as you can see I don't have
to hold the hair on the barrel for long
so that's really good I didn't put like
a serum in the hair before I started I
started curling the hair
and that's just so when I break it up I
don't have to put the ceremony
afterwards I hate that like greasy kind
of look we're here and I feel like it
kind of ways the hair down so I kind of
try to stay away from that process
before I mean I try to stay away from
having to do that after it's doing my
hair so I'm basically gonna do the same
thing to the other side because my
camera is about to die I'm just gonna go
ahead and turn it off and like let it
charge on the battery so I can do my
outro with you guys but I'll come back
when it's time like to break up the
curls I'm not gonna add any hairspray I
don't feel like it's necessary you guys
know I like having my hair loose anyway
but I really really like this color and
I didn't dye the roots well I just put I
didn't lift the roots like I didn't
listen
the frontal so much at the top so that
helps keeping the hair really healthy
like if you go up with their bleach all
the way up to the frontal sometimes it
can damage the frontal because you never
know how well the frontal is gonna take
the bleach so I kind of try to shy away
from doing bleach so much on the frontal
because if the frontal messes up there I
just am sabotage I don't have anything
else left to do other than complain
about the hair and sometimes it's not
even the hair sometimes it's not even
the hair sometimes it's just it's just
the bundles I mean sometimes it's not
even the bundles it's just the frontal
that will cause the problem and image it
will make you feel like the hair is just
bad overall but sometimes you have to be
really careful with frontals because
they're not as strong as the bundle
because it's a really delicate it's a
really delicate situation going on with
a frontal because it's a small piece of
fabric that has all kinds of tiny hair
follicles on it that's only secured by
it being like knotted in between each
little little stitch or PO and then with
bundles you have a full weft so if the
hair can't stand the bleach on the
frontal then it's gonna be a problem
I always have to come back and do these
pieces anyway that's what I'm kind of
doing here see if I could find you
things I need to fix I've had to switch
out my batteries but so this is what the
hair looks like crap
so we're going to kind of like finger
comb them out see if it needs to look a
little bit wavy er that's where I was
kind of like brushing the curls a little
bit because I don't what they're really
really tight reason why I was letting
them go so fast I ever really want them
on the barrel for too long cuz it just
makes the curl tighter if you let it sit
for a long time so I'm just gonna squeak
some pieces and while I do that we're
gonna talk to you guys about the dyeing
process so I you can use whatever bleach
you want to use to lift your hair the
bleach really doesn't matter the best
bleach I like using but I didn't even
use it on this hair which was uh the
bleach I like using is law and
brilliance bleach but I actually didn't
use that on this hair I used bw2
this time for this company it wasn't
that hard to just lift it to the color
that I needed it to lift to which was
kind of like a honey blonde you don't
want any orange hue and your hair when
you're trying to do like a deep tone
blue because it can't go green on you
it's kind of weird but uh so
after that I used or died in royal blue
or Royal Navy I will listen in the
description box below because I have a
little bit left underneath my sink so
yeah so that was pretty much a I used
three bottles of dye on this hair that's
how many you'll need if your bundles are
24 inches I let it sit for almost like
two hours so that's pretty much all that
I have to do to achieve this color by
the door you can buy a door dyes from
your local beauty supply store they have
so many colors that you can choose from
bunny but I mean at least you know at
least at least you know if you want to
go to this hair company you know it
lifts really well and how I maintained
in that night if I want to sleep with it
I just put a little bit of this argan
oil coconut oil serum in my hair before
bed and I braid it just how you see me
has those little cute little braids in
before I bring my hair and then I just
arrived it with a scarf and that's
pretty much how that's pretty much what
I do I just noticed what I was doing
which was not alternating the curls like
I was supposed to like idiot hey
this one was going away but I didn't
curl it high in the air my forehead when
I was off the camera yeah
my face is finally cleared and I'm gonna
put it in a burn mark on my forehead
it's always something throw this piece
away so I can give the illusion that my
hair is massive style all right so this
is icy hair I hope you guys enjoyed the
video really basic straight to the point
kind of tutorial nothing too fancy I do
like how for this hair looks and yeah so
I will leave their information in the
description box below believe it or not
reason why I sound like about to die
right now it's because it's like 3:30
I'm here to make you all happy so yeah I
love you guys let me do so many cute
little toss toss turn turns for you guys
and I will see you very much in my next
video I can't even see myself I don't
know because - wait my vision is not
working but I love you and I'll see my
next turn in my toe and spot off and I
think I wanna smash I'm out now speed up
guys
guys I'm accustomed to mismanage what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
