have in my well i have my best legs
wiggle and i'm going to be showing you
guys how I'm going to be styling this
wig I don't know exactly what I want to
do with it I'm not exactly sure if I'm a
fan of it yet due to like the
highlighted extreme highlights that's
going on in this hair um I don't even
know I don't even know how I'm going to
do my makeup today but I'm going to talk
through this video and hopefully we
figure out something no I feel like my
brows are Super's art and they shouldn't
be then start with blonde hair but we're
just going to work with what we have
today so the first thing I've already
applied my foundation like I mentioned
this is the insoluble Pro matte
foundation from L'Oreal and this is like
a demi matte finish not really as met as
you know you would think a matte
foundation is supposed to be I really
want to grab a high-end foundation so I
can kind of fill that out a little bit
more and see if I really want to
gravitate towards a super matte face but
I've been liking how I've been doing my
makeup lately and it's a bit different I
will be talking to you guys in a more
like in a different video about my
updated routine and stuff like that in
the future but I'm going to start this
eye look I want to do like a matte look
but on top I want to put like a shimmery
shadow on top of the Mac I don't really
know so we're just going to jump right
into this I think I want to concealer as
my primer today for this look so that's
what I'm going to do and this concealer
is fawn from la girl and if I'm looking
over there it's because my mirror is
over there
what I'm setting my eyes with is this HD
foundation with a mixture of this
Maybelline shine free powder and this is
just to kind of get the same color as my
complexion because I don't want to use a
super bright primer today to prime my
eyelids because I kind of want this look
to be a little bit more smoky so I'm
going to take the m44 one brush from
morphe and I'm just going to grab a nude
and I want to say this is called oatmeal
tan and this is either from makeup geek
or Coastal Scents this palette that I
have created for myself it's from those
two websites so I hot glue gun these
little pots down just because I'm
grabbed so got the wrong eye shadow
palette holder thingy from Mac and it's
like returning it so I just had a new
gun my individual eyeshadow pots Ramon
who is that palette so I'm going to use
chocolates here this is this color right
here and once again either from makeup
makeup geek or Coastal Scents and it's
just a very subtle chocolatey brown
color it's not too harsh and it doesn't
have a lot of red tones so on my back
and we're just going to dust that on the
lid and I don't want this to be really
harsh I really just want this to be like
a subtle look because once again this
hair is loud enough seriously
you can just tweak this look you don't
have to do the exact same thing but this
is what I'm doing today
pressing it in the area that I wanted
the most in and then just blending it
outwards upwards and just sweeping
sweeping motions back and forth to get
the intensity that I do want because
eventually I will get it is just a lot
of blending that comes with this I'm
going to use some mixing medium to make
this vibrant so you can get this online
from Mac or from the pro store this one
so just pack that that's it for my eye
makeup and then what I'm going to do is
to grab my concealer using la girl
concealer I have to go and pick up the
parts the new tarts and fillers I have
not done that yet and I've heard so many
great things about it I don't know if
heart always had that many colors to
choose from in their concealers but I
know they do now and I am going to pick
some up I want my under eye to be really
bright
I'm to add some of my contour shade
studio finish concealer from mac and NC
50 you just see that to contour because
it's not extremely dark
so basically what I have on my face
right now is this Maybelline Charlaine
free loose powder eye with a Walmart and
I was looking for a new under eye
setting powder because I freaking lost
my Laura Mercier powder
I lost my white one and I ran out of my
banana shade and I was like okay bitch
well you're gonna have to do a few
makeup looks and you know can I go into
the mall because every time I get up and
want to go to the mall guess what day it
is it's either Friday or Saturday and I
can't stand going to the mall on those
two days so yeah um that is what's on my
face and I mix it with some of my HD
like cheesy powder if you guys have
watched my previous videos you probably
know what I'm talking about but it's
this cheesy powder that I got from my
beauty supply store and it's way too
cheesy or like way too yellow for my
skin complexion and I don't even know
why they have that color but I'm sure
it's to mix you know certain powders
together with it just because of the
color choice that they had so I just mix
some of that powder with that powder and
I feel like it makes me look really
flawless so I just thought to mention
that so you guys so what I'm leaving
right now is this L'Oreal True Match
super blendable powder and it's in the
shade in seven and I really do like it
because as you guys know I'm not read my
undertone is more so on be like yellow
side and um this and you can see our two
different shades but when I put this one
it's no problem like I don't look
ghostly or weird I look normal and this
is my undertone but it may not look it
but it really is but this as you can see
this is just way too red for me like and
I like mixing the two together but
sometimes I just use this one
so yeah that's what I've been doing
lately but I will mention this in
another video I just haven't really told
you guys about it you guys probably see
me hold it up
but this is what I have been using okay
so yeah so that's what I've been using
and I like it so as you can see I don't
look crazy I look normal and I just like
putting this a little bit over the
setting powder but what I do with a
setting out of it I just like pressing
it into my skin okay so I'm going to
take a little bit more of that powder
and touch up over here
shadows that I use for the top and I'm
just honestly going in with that Brown
and dragging it right underneath my
waterline and I'm going to slow this out
so I have snatched this area again I'm
sure I look crazy but I just been doing
different techniques with my makeup and
I feel like I've been getting a lot
better
I've seen in previous videos of myself
and I just be looking like bitch and
back in the day when I really wasn't
talking to you guys it was more so me
trying to learn and to show what I know
and now I feel like I know some good
information to be shared to you guys my
makeup come up I am proud of that it
came a long way
it's basically what I'm trying to say
you must put that in too much good
you're not dusting it away books or
Takada so it's not giving a harsh line
and then what I'm going to do is go back
over with that L'Oreal powder in this
area
this brush again
mascara lashes and I'll be right back
I'm sure I'm going to keep this color on
which is spike from Mac see the makeup
is complete want to try to tweak this
wig and the first step what I'm going to
do is just put my foundation underneath
the wig and then I'm going to tweeze it
basically what the inside of the wig
looks like and I'm just going to put my
foundation all vary up in here it's
connected to the last month on each side
and then I just took the comb right
underneath the gray caps that I will be
wearing my NW 50 concealer is basically
how it's going to look the comb is
literally right down the center of the
part but you know what we can do we
could just pop that column right out
okay so what I'm going to do next is
take this one a razor that I have is the
eyebrow razor image and you want to be
really careful with this I've done this
a lot of time so I'm not really trippin
on cutting the lace but be careful
because you can't cut your legs
all right so this is basically how much
hair I just took out right now so as you
can see the part is getting a little bit
more visible same color concealer that I
used but I'm sure you guys understand
what I'm hearing I really didn't want to
keep the part really like smack dab in
the middle so this is basically my part
right here
I can go in and deepen it up a little
bit more in the future but I just wanted
to basically come on and share with you
guys my new best lace wigs what I can
say about this unit is the hair is
really soft the loud highlights
basically your preference I wanted to
try something different before I get off
of camera I do want to row my Flatiron
through just a few times just to see
what I get and I might just go ahead and
pop a curl in there while I'm doing that
so I'll be right back
you
if I was to curl it I guess that's how
it looks so I will pass on the curling
this because I don't want to curls right
now but we're going to show you in that
piece pretty much the back is brown you
see I'm just trying to show you look
that in like a really pretty brown color
so it's just giving you like Christina
Aguilera tease like I don't know what is
given but I'm feeling it but I do have
to get used to it you know
