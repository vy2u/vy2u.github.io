update on proven hair companies hair so
as you know I had in the deep wave
texture and Brazilian and it's in the
limbs 28 26 or 228 to 26 to 24 22 and 20
inch closer as you can see it's flowy
bouncy it has all its life still of
course the pattern kind of went away
just a little bit because of the
bleaching I bleached its hair three
times to achieve this color and I'm
still not done yet I'm pleased with how
it looks at how the hair is still
