are going to work on this flinch
monochromatic look that you seen in the
beginning so I hope you guys are excited
to see how I got this look you guys
already know the basic steps to my
foundation contour highlight routine but
let me quickly run over the products
because I'm just gonna let you guys you
know watch this part and enjoy the music
I use my la girl Pro concealer use my
foundation stick and walnut' from a BH
to contour and I also went in with total
control foundation from NYX in the shade
cappuccino and caramel mix those two
together to get the shade that you see
right now so when it's time to work on
this eye I will come back and talk to
you guys but all the products for the
base of the face will be linked in the
description box below
all right so let's get into this I look
I'm going to start off by priming my
eyes using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
I'm gonna take a cream shade just to
pack on top of that Paint Pot
so the shadows that I use are going to
blend out really seamlessly and it's
going to look flawless
so I'm gonna take that color right there
from the Jaclyn hill palette and I'm
just going to sweep that in my
transition area so there can be you know
some pigment up there in some color and
yeah a really simple look this is pretty
much it after this I'm just gonna take a
shave from my 35o palette from morphe
and I'm just gonna pop that on my lid a
blending brush first and then I'm gonna
go in with a packer brush and just make
sure the color intensity is how I want
it to be and I'm just popping with some
Ardell whispies I'm going to come talk
to you guys towards the end of the video
letting you guys know all the products
again but I love you guys and I just
hope you guys enjoy the rest of this
video because this is pretty much it
yeah I love you
you guys enjoyed it I do want to let you
guys know the lip color that I used was
from a man called loves Coco is in the
shade he doesn't have a shame it just
says number 10 and this is how it looks
I really really liked it I outlined my
lip using downtown beauty from NYX and
yeah so I achieved this look by just
using my morphe 35o palette I used the
burnt orange and with my Jack my halo
palette using this color right here for
the transition color so very simple look
and I also popped up on some our tail
1:13 lashes use the white pigment in my
waterline so you can enhance this look
and also make my eyes look bigger thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you babies in my next video bye baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
