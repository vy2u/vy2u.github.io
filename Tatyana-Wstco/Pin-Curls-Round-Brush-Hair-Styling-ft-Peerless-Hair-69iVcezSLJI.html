peerless hair as you guys know I love
this weekend hair company so I'm so
excited to show you guys how I run brush
these curls and got these curls and all
that jazz so if you're interested to see
this look please continue to watch don't
forget to thumbs up share comment
subscribe and I have a video showing you
guys how I cut these layers I cut a
little bit more layers in this hair
today so you're going to see that but
make sure you check out how I achieve
the layers like you know to get it to
look like this in the first place so
thank you so much for watching I will
see you guys in my next one peerless
hair information will be listed in the
description box below this is their
straight hair I believe I have tried
their body waves so you can check out
that other video for their body wave if
you're a body wave kind of girl but I
love you guys so very much I will see
you in my next video but I love muffins
so we're going to start with straight
hair and then we're going to get into
this curling process so what we're going
to need is some duckbill clips a wig
brush a curling iron and some scissors
also a round brush I forgot to show you
that the most important part of this
tutorial is letting you guys know that I
am curling my hair away from my face
throughout my head I'm not alternating
any of my curls I am curling them away
from my face so not towards my face but
away now if you guys don't really know
how to work with the curling iron you're
just going to have to practice practice
practice because trust me I wish I used
to struggle with curling irons but it's
really about the flick of your wrist and
also how you hold the curling iron and
also how you hold the hair into the
curling iron because you can curl your
hair multiple ways so I'll figure out
what's best for you
don't let that curl drop either pin the
curl immediately to your head and then
keep working throughout your head now I
also put some hairspray on the hair
after letting it cool off I'll leave it
I'll leave the pins in my hair for about
20 minutes and then I put my blow-dryer
on cool and then I just blow-dry it a
little bit on the cool setting just to
make sure that everything is cooled down
before I take these duckbill clips out
of my head
so I think that's pretty much all I
really wanted to let you guys know
I do round brush the curls out just
because my preference of curls I like
them to look very like effortless and
flowy and beachy and voluptuous okay
once again not necessary but I'm just
letting you know what I was doing and
why I was doing it it's definitely about
preference but I hope you guys enjoyed
this video thank you so much for
watching and I will see that in my next
one don't forget to thumbs up comment
subscribe thank you so much for getting
one video that I just posted to like
6000 views in one day
means a lot to me we're getting you know
our lives together over here
thank you again Dave I'll see you in a
second
