ochre Paint Pots and Mac only a little
bit of this product every time I saw the
video I swear I got it does not fail
this is my boyfriend now
let's see we get to say hello babe she
can walk Rio for the look he's
making me food making me food after
using that Mac sauce okay we're going to
take and be more feet for 12 brush and a
little bit of this classic from the
Tarte palette and we're going to place
that right on the top of right on top of
that soft ochre Paint Pot and this is
just basically to set it so our shadows
can go run a lot smoother so now what
I'm going to do is grab my little cocoa
since my actual makeup geek palette that
I created for myself and I'm going to
grab this color right here which is
oatmeal pan and take a little bit of
that tap off any excess that may be
falling off and then pretty much place
that in like above your lid in this area
right here our transition shade and
bring it in here so you can have some
color in there so it just won't look all
pale and nude keep going into the oh
milk pan until you get the intensity
that you're looking for want to grab
innocent from the Tarte palette and
pretty much take that in the same area
but not completely over the entire
oatmeal tan color pressing that in just
so I can get as much color payoff
using the same brush and then I'm going
to go into my Kat Von D intelligence
because this is what I did for this eye
and I just want to make sure I do
exactly the same thing that I did to
prevent eye to the eye that I'm doing
right now I'm taking French from the
metal matte kat von d palette and then
I'm going to place fringe on the lid
pretty much using the same brush packing
motions not sweeping it at all so the
color can be intense
now I'm going to grab my morphe 4-3-3
brush and take fringe a little bit more
on this brush and try to push it in the
crease area but then I'm going to grab
some more of that innocent shape from
the Tarte palette and then I'm going to
work that color and the crease a little
bit more with this dense brush mod and
all in all really how to bring that up
and blend that out for definition
I'm going to go back in with innocent
and bring that color up a little bit
more and press it in the area once again
for more intensity versus just swiping
first and now what I'm going to do is
just pretty much carve out to the area
where I want to put the glitter first
with my soft ochre Paint Pot just so I
can kind of like make me a bigger leg
space for that
cheek from the palate a little bit of
that hot pink stuff in that palette and
place it in more so of the center and
then tapping it out so it can kind of be
more of a dirty pink but then going back
in with chic and I'm using the NYX
glitter glue and you don't want to look
up yet you kind of want to keep your
eyes closed and then I'm using this
glitter right here and I got it from
size we supplied Thor that's always
beauty supplies so I got it from Mike
Michael and I don't know why I'm
thinking about here right now but what
I'm going to do and just take it on the
same side and a place that glitter glue
and then tack it on D
