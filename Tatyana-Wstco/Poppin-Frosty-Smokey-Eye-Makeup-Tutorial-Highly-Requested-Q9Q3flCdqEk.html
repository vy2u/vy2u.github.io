makeup look it was really requested in
one of my videos so I decided to
recreate it so now I'm going to be
starting off with Oktoberfest above my
crease and I got this from Coastal
Scents
all these shadows are from Coastal
Scents today and yeah sufferer going to
be intensifying that Oktoberfest color
above my crease blending it out packing
it in blending it out packing in and I
love this color for my transition color
and then I'll be going in with oatmeal
tan to help blend that out so to get
ready for this nice transitioning shades
that I got going on so now that is
called melt and I'm helping blend out
that Oktoberfest with and yeah so you
don't have to use the exact same colors
just try to find any colors that you
have by your side that may look like
Oktoberfest or nice orange you can use
by Mac red brick or something and now
I'm gonna be taking deep rows deep roast
it's like a nice brown shade and I'm
starting light but I'm gonna be packing
that color and on my outer V and running
it inside of my eye and you know
intensifying the shade but right now
just start light and then I'll be going
harder in a second and there it goes
you're kind of seeing the color come in
and yeah I really do like this shape
also Coastal Scents has some really good
Pat foams some really good hot pots so
you can definitely keep a lookout for
Coastal Scents shadows because they're
only a buck literally
if you catch it during their so so yeah
people look out for that and you guys
have a discount code after you sign up
for closer sense I believe if you're not
already signed up so yeah definitely
keep a lookout for that so i'm just
still feeling blending in that deep rose
color in my outer-v so now I'm packing
on this get it or ydk whatever however
you pronounce that shade in my naked 2
palette it's amazing I love it with on
my heart this is what makes this look
honestly and it is amazing so I really
do like this shade and I use water or
fix+ or Urban Decay spray or whatever
you want to use to intensify the shimmer
shade and it just turns out beautiful
every time I use it girls so this is my
favorite Naked palette which one is your
favorite Naked palette you have a
favorite Naked palette if not you need
to get this one because this one is
amazing I love it yeah so you'll be
seeing me doing that for about 30
minutes if I didn't ask for this or
speed it up now I'm gonna be using my
eye studio Maybelline eye studio gel
liner in blackest black to create this
nice wing that I got going on here so I
haven't did green liner since like
summer 15 like oMG but I start
practicing again and I'm getting back
into my killer winged liner
slay you know so yeah I'm still
practicing I'm not
a piece like I was back in the day but
I'll get it I'll get it
keep trying never give up now I'm using
my highlighter pen from Mac it is in the
shade light boost and it's my fav you
know I like that highlight it looks when
once I you know get my foundation on I
already had my foundation on now it is
the all day luminous from NARS and my
favorite foundation why am i whispering
this is my favorite foundation and I'm
using my blending model I'm using my
Beauty Blender to blend that out ladies
you don't have to use a beauty blender
you can use a real techniques sponge
that works the same and it's cheaper
it's about like ten dollars from your
local drugstore
yeah or you can get it from old Walmart
or anyplace like that this does the same
thing and it's really soft just like
this and I use a damp it's not dry
please don't use it dry now you'll see
me using my airspun powder from Walmart
this was about ten dollars also even
though it may look scary on
because I am just a woman of color you
know and you might think I get this
flashback and once I take a flash
picture but I don't you just have to
make sure you dust it completely off
your face you want to add some of your
face powder over it just a little bit
just to make sure you've got all the
back powder off and yeah it looks really
good it just modifies that cream
highlight that I have going on and sets
everything in place it makes me look
flawless flawless like Beyonce just
kidding now I'm using blunt blush to
contour my face in my nose and I really
like this because this shows up on women
of color and it's really pretty and I
love it and I'll be doing the same thing
on my nose it's working and working it
just like in it and break it
how're you guys doing today what other
look do you want to see me doing makeup
I have so many looks that I got going I
have like 4 videos going we're ready to
go up okay so now I'm using my locate my
back low okay look at my toes oh God
anyway I'm using high light brown or
medium brown Jordana lip pencil and my
Milani matte liquid lipstick and self
aware from Mac and I'm blending those
shades together and lining that lip
again and putting that lip liner through
all of that work that I just did to
create this cool shade that I love and I
think everybody should do this combo and
let me know you love it hate it or like
it let me know okay yes honey I am
finished I hope you guys enjoyed those
