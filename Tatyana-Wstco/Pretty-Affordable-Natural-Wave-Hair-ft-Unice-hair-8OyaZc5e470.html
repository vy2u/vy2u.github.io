with some popping hair this hair is
actually from Eunice I will list their
information in the description box below
this is their Brazilian natural hair
natural hair natural wave texture and
just really really pretty hair so I'm
excited to share it with you guys I
decided that I wanted to go ahead and
curl it because because it was in this
natural wave just looking this bomb I
felt like damn like what else am I
supposed to do and I just decided I
wanted to put the wig back on another
day and just curl it for you guys
don't mind the frontal I know it's mad
close to my eyebrows but I just need to
hairspray down really quick so I can
actually just curl it for you guys I
didn't go out anywhere this day so don't
mind that once again I'm just using my
hot tools curling curling iron this is
the one and a half inch and I'm using
this just to curl the hair away from my
face and I'm also gonna put flexi rods
on certain pieces just to see the
difference you know between just letting
it loose and then just have enough flexi
rods in there for a couple of seconds
after finishing my whole head really
really self-explanatory process it's
nothing too crazy I was just bored and I
didn't have anything to do this day so I
decided that I wanted to chat on the
phone and turn my camera on while I
curled it just to see how well it will
hold the girl cuz I feel like you guys
probably wouldn't have been interested
to know that if you are going to
purchase this hair
I haven't straightened the hair but I
don't doubt that the hair um can't be
straightened I have worked with this
company before and I have actually
bleached their hair and the hair
actually turned out really nice so I
didn't have any cons with it so with
this natural wave texture I haven't had
any problems with shedding or Nathan or
anything like that but I always say you
know do your research check out unis um
reviews on their website and stuff like
that just to get others opinions on
their hair but as you can see the
natural state of their natural waves is
really really beautiful and these curls
you're gonna see how pop and they turned
out in a second but I love you guys the
tool that I use will be listed in the
description box below also the hair
information so make sure you check that
out once you finish the video and yeah I
love you and I'll see you guys in my
next one
enjoy the rest of the video
this is what it feels like
this is what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
