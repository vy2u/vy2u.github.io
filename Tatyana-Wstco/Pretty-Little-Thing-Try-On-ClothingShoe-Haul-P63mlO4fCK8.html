going to get into another haul from
pretty little things I'm so excited
because you guys really really enjoy my
last haul so I'm here with another one
for you guys I actually have something
to do but I just want to go ahead and
get this out of the way I don't hit a
lot of traffic because I'm doing this
right now but anyway this is how you
want to be receiving packages from
pretty little things isn't it adorable
it has unicorns and it's pink
like what girl is there going to love
this we got that green out of the way
I'm excited about this unboxing because
I got shoes this time I'm gonna start
off with shoes because you know the
other one was closed so I got these
shoes right and I got them in black Q I
can already stock and fit them because I
know my shoe size this is a size 5 UK
sizes so make sure you pay close close
attention
I will try these one I'm gonna slow down
on the dancing because I don't have time
and then I have another shoe that looks
just like that and look at this it's
pink it's freaking pink and I haven't I
don't have a I don't own a pink shoe but
I'm here for it so you guys know I told
you I love camo like camo is my thing
like like I told you bringing cropped
camo trucker jacket so this is the camo
jacket it's cropped yes you don't I'm
here for it if it's cropped and yes you
guys were right this is I didn't read it
if I would have have read in my last
haul but I had known exactly what this
is what this is it says please do not
remove unless you are satisfied with the
garment returns will be not will not be
accepted if this is removed and you know
you try to return it so no it's not
gonna work for you sweetheart but I got
this in a size 4 um this is also a UK 8
so just keep that in mind you guys know
that my sizes were between 4 &amp;amp; 6 I
thought I was a six and everything was
way too big for me so I got 4s and
everything
almost everything worked in my laptop
except for one pair of pants these are
their lace rib shorts in a size four I
can tell I'm gonna be able to fit them
why because these actually have stretch
lace trim cycling shorts in a size four
so these are gonna be so cute but look
at this bathing suit it's so cute you
had that snakeskin vibe going on and
this is in a size four by the way it
will be a thong
I will try this born but I don't know
how you guys are gonna be feeling about
you seeing my bottom because personally
I don't give it two shits yeah this
isn't a sex
unfortunately so you have to buy these
separately and the reason why I love
this is because it's given turtleneck
vibes but it's cropped and it has long
sleeves so I've seen somebody actually
wear this on their Instagram and I loved
it so I decided I wanted to have is the
stone pretty little thing in bordered
rib dress and it has pretty little
things on it and it's nude you guys
don't understand like I try to shy away
from getting nude camel tan gray but
it's just so hard when this color is so
puppet against melanin so I'm here for
it middlin kind of dress but we'll see
what my body does to it you know I got a
little booty on me now girls oh yeah
cream button front open back long-sleeve
cute like really cute it's like a
cropped situation in the back you gonna
have to see it on its Collard and it's
just something that's I feel like it's
really different
the sleeves are really cute it has like
a cut open situation let's see so yeah
look at that this is a gray marble crop
off the shoulder sweaters like I said
great I try to stay away from
therefore it like look at this you're
gonna have to see it or because it's
kind of it kind of looks weird right now
but I love the scrunch the scrunch is
perfect this is the shape black strength
bodycon dress and I just wanted to get a
classic black dress but this like plain
little weird strings like this they
actually spiced it up with giving you
some diamond tees okay so jewels or
whatever and this is a size 4 everything
is the size 4 by the way but this
sweater actually is in a size small but
yeah so the next thing is the shape
nudes silky square neck unit are someone
that has the shorts with it but this is
this little cute number right here
we want to talk about favorites here but
this is my favorite one so far this one
is definitely fitted how I would like
the black wants a fit and the bad thing
about this this is a size 4 so once
again you just don't know but that's why
you're here to watch my video so if you
are going to order from this company you
know which you should be expecting
alright so put one black one pink
because like I said I'm in a rush I have
known to walk that's what's perfect
about this situation I wouldn't wear
with this dress dress personally but is
willing to get it out the way I'm
palpable into the second shoe or the
other cases this is a look right here I
will wear this just like this with this
I have a pink jacket that matches these
perfectly but yeah so this has to be my
favorite one if it's just like the black
one who's really really nice size 5 as
well
if I found me a juicy sweater white
preferably or even this color I would
wear it with that so yeah so these
fairly nice you might come here for it's
just a cute little pieces to put on if
you just want to run and do some errands
really quick during the summertime
springtime whatever so yeah high-waisted
team I'm here that is snacks instead of
buttons perfect because I don't have
time for buttons right now so this is
the camo jacket really really cute of
course you know you can scrunch up the
arms you can do whatever you want with
it but this is the perfect camo color
it's not give you that ashy didn't you
kind of camel look it just looks really
clean and popping I would take real good
care of this make sure you read the
instructions on how to wash it nice by
hygiene bootie will look good with this
but I'm not doing all of that today or a
black booty a little short black booty I
don't know
so this basically consists of today's
haul for pretty little things thank you
so much for watching it means so much to
me you guys appreciate it my last haul I
know I didn't do a lot of twerking in
this one I just wanted to tone it down
maybe you guys like this some more than
the other twerking halls that I did for
you this day but you know some days you
just do a little bit more because you're
more happy than others so yeah but
anyway I love pretty little things
website when they actually get my sizes
right you definitely have to do your
research on this website you have to
definitely pay attention to that size
chart make sure you get the proper sizes
because I'm gonna read what their return
situation is you can return within 28
days of receiving your order for as long
as they're in the original condition
unfortunately we do not offer free
returns and this must be made at your
own cost which means if you're trying to
return a simple little box that is this
big to go back to the UK is a hundred
and fifty dollars we recommend that you
use economy trackable services to top it
off returning something to the UK you
are not able
to track that package with USPS tried it
already they told me you're gonna be
spending $150 for this small box and you
won't even be able to give them the
tracking number so that's why I mean you
don't want that salt to avoid all of
this just make sure you just make sure
you look at the size charts when you are
ordering from this company of course
this is on their website so you can
check it out to get a little bit more
information if I miss anything so if you
already have ordered from pretty little
things and you're worried about like
where's my shipment they do have track
your order on their website so just get
that what it's like think it's like a
six digit number or a ten digit number
you just put in there and then it shows
you what's going on with your package
and yeah with that being said I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching all of my social media
accounts will be listed in the
description box below if you like these
unboxing calls whatever you want to call
them please give this a thumbs up and I
will do my own I don't have to do
companies I will go into my closet I
will go into thrift stores I will put
outfits together I would do more
clothing videos if that's something that
you want to see from me just please
