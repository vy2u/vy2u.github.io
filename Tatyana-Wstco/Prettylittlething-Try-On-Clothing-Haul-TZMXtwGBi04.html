another video today I'm excited so so
excited because I have some clothes from
a company so it's gonna be closed from
pretty little things and I'm so excited
so contacted me asking me to pretty much
do a video and also promote their
clothes I'm just gonna pretty much show
you guys the clothes I'm going to try
the point yeah I'm going to read you off
how many items I have you had nine items
from this company and I'm gonna give you
guys all the backstory information about
working with them prior while trying to
work with them prior to what happened to
me because this is the second time that
I got a order from this company and it
just just dude sub sizes being way too
big and I thought they were going to be
too small this is a UK brand once again
this is pretty little things their
information will be linked in the
description box below hopefully I am
cool enough to actually link the
hyperlinks to every item that I have
below as well as until hi I am about
that description box I just kind of get
lost in the sauce gonna try this
two-piece
I'm doing a photo shoot Monday and I
might wear this because I'm going to do
like effortless and I want to do
something sexy but at the same time you
know I just want to be me at the same
time and this outfit literally is me I
might have to go and put a regular bra
on because I don't want this to be
peeking through and messing up the
outfit so but before I do all of that
this is the set right here so this is
pants and a top and if they're nicked
and it's perfect for what it's
going home with this weather right now
I'm so over it
I'm just was excited in another video
letting you guys know Oh guys I'm so
excited springtime is almost here and my
eyes done it on this end up there and
then today it was like 40 degrees and
it's snowing in New York and I'm just
like what is going on
but isn't this so cute like I love like
the detail right here I love like the
arms cuz they scrunch up as well just
like the bottom the pants do the same
thing at the bottom it's just like a
really cute two-piece so are you so
that's the first scent from this company
and I got the sizes for everything
should be a size for the other orders
that I had got from this company
everything was a size six and I could
not get down with it but this is
actually a small so this becomes small
medium or large and I'm deciding to get
a small so that looks like it's going to
fit exactly how I want it to be because
it's gonna be a little oversized I think
I'm gonna do a black booty with it I
don't know I don't know if I'm gonna
fully put outfits together because I
want to be able to like to take a
picture and you know like the necessay
with different hair styles and stuff
like that so I think that would be a
little bit too much I'm excited about
this item which is
they're black pretty things striped
track pans this is the only color they
have available in a size poor girl I'm
excited I can already tell like if I
pull out the sixes I can't pull out the
sexy because I actually have it wrapped
up in a box ready to ship back to them
but yeah the sixes look like 10 so be
careful make sure you do your research
measure it something you need to check
out the model that's wearing the clothes
because I'm thinking that I used to be I
thought I was gonna have to do with us
deal with a size 6 because you know this
is a UK brand and I work with the UK
company before and the size and us like
a 4 was way way way too tight there's
clothes that I can't even fit that I had
in my closet too tight from that company
but um yeah so this is the track pants
it has pretty little things written on
the size of them and they have this
little cute situation going on I think
this is the string that makes the pants
tighter or I don't know what this is go
figure it out we'll be putting on these
fit really weird it's like all of this
right here is hella tight like it has no
stretch and I know a 6 will probably be
way too big for my waist I don't know I
stock I think all of these that they
have that fit the size 10 to be
completely honest with you guys you may
see me in tight clothes
- I'm gonna 10 but honestly like I'm a
lounger like if I could wear some loose
pants and a tight fitted top that's
literally what you would see me in and I
just I don't know why I like that so
much but I was just like I need these in
my life and it's just a cream bottom and
it's a
it's like tapered at the bottom and it
does have the jaw streams to make sure
your pity votes nug and this looks like
I'm going to be able to fit it I'm
excited because when I first pulled out
the last order girl I was like what the
hell happened
cream like knit tie front top this is
gonna be so cute on me are we know
everything like I said is a size 4 in
this now I was supposed to be going to
Miami that's 13th and I thought this was
gonna be really cute for that trip so
it's a tie front type of situation so it
has like the two little strings that you
tie up across it you guys know the other
little knitted cream-colored one I have
or like what I say like a tan color it
kind of gives you the same vibe as this
trying it on right now for you guys and
hopefully you like how it looks I got me
some biker shorts this company has
really really cute
cycling bicycle shorts and this is my
thing I love these little guys these go
with everything compare them with
anything you can wear with a sports bra
you can wear with a long sleeve you can
wear with a tank top a crop top this is
just a little cute little stitch and
it's army fatigue if you guys don't know
the girl is obsessed with army fatigue I
love army contain anything anything
anything
khaki camo print psycho shorts size four
okay so the next item I'm going to show
you guys is this bodycon dress I love me
a bodycon dress it just makes you look
snatch sense and I'm all here for that
snatch look I was really debating on
getting this one or another one that I
had that they had on their site but
because the kid doesn't have the boob
job that she needs in her life I felt
like the dress that I was going to get
it was like a v-neck and it goes all the
way down and I hate
those time addresses on me because my
boobs my boobs sit-up but they don't sit
up how I want them to in addresses like
that so you know what I'm talking about
those those dresses that come all the
way down here like they just don't work
for me and that's just me being
completely honest with you and with
myself and this is like one that goes
off the shoulders and I'm really really
filling that look it's ruffled on the
side and this is a size 4 and I know
this woman to fit really good make my
butt look good make my boobies look good
and yeah put it in here so there better
be a size 4 yes this is a size 4 and it
looks like it's going to fit the waist
that I have on me is kind of skeptical
but then this is definitely a statement
piece if you're wearing this just know
that you will get looked at okay I can
see myself wearing this so I might I
know that I put this on the cart I'm
here for it I should be trying it off
for you guys and I hope you guys like
how it looks I don't know what I'm gonna
pair it with so nothing is popping up in
the head right now but um there's
actually something on their site that
would actually look really really good
with that so I might have to go get it
the next thing I want to show you guys I
actually got this because I want to wear
this body suit with the with these pants
right here I want to wear with them
these pants and this is the stripe track
pants from pretty little things they
have the one that has the label on it
this top I've got this to go with that
it's gonna be a cute little a cute
little outfit or whatever's so looks
like this and this isn't a size 4 all
right this is the black contrast sports
stripe thong so as you can see it's
giving you black and white tees with the
track pants that's why I wanted to wear
it
once again you see tight top loose
bottom nice boot nice hill you know you
can't go wrong with that kind of outfit
orange jacket I think it just so cute
you guys know how about me you know how
orange looks really good you guys know
how orange looks really good on melanin
you know what I'm saying
the orange is a bit different than what
it looks in the picture is giving you
really really like pump not even pumpkin
orange it's like giving you tangerine
buy of orange bottled up we're going to
finesse this and make it work for us
it's like a cropped orange jacket it has
like the distress at the bottom it has
the four big buttons and this is a size
4 they have the button on the sleeve as
well and the distress one of the sleeves
awesome so I'm here for the colors pop
it and what does it say it says
attention caution washed separately
color may transfer onto other garments
I bet you it well you know why because
it's this break so I was
thinking about playing this with this on
a nice summer spring hot day if we can
get one of those
goodness gracious mother nature but I
think this outfit would look really
really good I'll probably get me a camel
top or just give me a white top to go
with this where some vans or if I want
to dress it up with some heels
I have camel Hills and I could wear the
camel Hills with the camel pants and
then put like a white wife beater
underneath it like a distressed wife you
do I cut it up and rip it like at the
top you know and rip it at the top and
then have the matching boots with the
matching shorts and the white cropped
white beater I'm here for it you know
this is already here to make the outfits
for you guys so all the information for
pretty load things up will be linked in
the description box below
I love videos like this even though I
don't do them I feel like I should be
doing more clothes because I am a
clothes a clothes I am a junkie when it
comes to clothes I love shopping I love
shopping anywhere I'm here to be bougie
yet affordable yet stylish and also what
to say like pocket-friendly okay so I
like drifting I'm like going to forever
I like gonna Zara I like going to
Topshop it doesn't matter what the store
is I like shopping and Adidas Nike
anything works for me you can go to Ross
TJ Maxx any store or online shopping I
kind of shy away from online shopping to
be completely honest with you guys less
like a company
to me up and that's just because the kit
is a really really I don't really have
patients so like I get antsy waiting on
things that I'm like excited about so
well in my shopping it's something that
I really really really want then I see
online that I would you know of course
go get it but I don't really like
shopping online for that reason so yeah
so you guys my thoughts about it my
camera is about to die everything was
fine besides those track pants my pretty
little things with the little name on
the side of them and that is really
heartbreaking because I was really
looking forward to that you seeing in
the beginning that's like the first
thing that said I was really excited
about but it's cool you know you know
sometimes things just don't work out you
just have to make all have an option to
get like shapely things and I guess
shape on their website means stretch so
pay attention to that so if it stretches
you might want to get a smaller size cuz
you never know but it's really a gamble
with this company when it comes to the
sizes if you know your exact sizes then
you're going to be straight but if
you're kind of up in the air body please
understand this is a UK company I went
to the postal office and went to the
postal office and I was told that a
really small box like I'm gonna show
this is a small box to me okay it's not
a toy it's like you know wine or
whatever the case may be but it's not
huge this box to return it to the
company is a hundred and fifty dollars
so understand that if you have that coin
that you want suspense who return the
items and get your correct sizes please
do so but understand that it's going to
cost is a pretty little penny just to
retire some clothes because it is a UK
company and I don't think they have
return labels and if they do have a
return label it's still you're not going
to cover the sending back fee
so let me see let me bring something
else to you bye let's go to class real
quick
it says not happy with your pretty
little things no prompt you can return
your items within 28 days of receiving
your orders for as long as they are in
the original condition unfortunately we
do not offer free returns they recommend
that you use economy trackable service
try to tell you it says to make a return
simply follow the easy steps below
complete the above table with the items

a secure water proof package with labels

working with a uk-based company having
to return something that may be needing
to be in a box like this you can get
these boxes from an actual post office

where they you know get their money from
before I got all sizes and everything
was too big except for this piece in the
last quarter quarter that's in this box
right here so the only thing that fit
was this
yeah yeah skirt was so cute and it's
stretched so so nicely and that was a
size four once again yeah let me know
