going to get all up in this d sore hair
this is actually their deep wave bundles
Brazilian I have 20 22 18 and the 18
inch from so from this hair company I'm
just using water to detangle it because
in the beginning you see it was looking
kind of cray-cray and that was just
because I've just just installed this
hair so I kind of brushed it out combed
it out and all that kind of jazz so in a
second you're gonna see how it looks in
its natural state after you know I'm
putting a little bit of the Canton
curling cream and water in it just
because of course I want to tame the
hair and make it look a little bit more
appealing and the cans who curling cream
comes in handy because I feel like the
frontal was a little bit looser than the
bundles so if you just put a little bit
of this product in your hair and then
scrunch it up it's going to look nice
and Kweli and pretty and when it air
dries it's just going to look really
really nice so in this video I'm going
to revamp the hair we're gonna put it
through the straightener test the
curling test just to see how well this
hair you know does all of that but the
soar hair information will be linked in
the description box below I will see you
guys in a hot second I love you alright
baby so I'm sorry the video is kind of
like all kinds of chopped and screwed
I'm pretty sure because this is actually
the second day of me wearing D soar hair
and I really really like it so I wanted
to pretty much test it out the day that
I started recording this but um yeah I
was actually I had a movie date with my
best friend say well I went out with the
hair it's trying to see what it would do
and held up really really nice but
here's the thing so I really feel like
you have to put a little bit of like
leave-in conditioner in this hair or
maybe um like a curly cream in the
frontal area just because I feel like
the frontal is a little bit off it's a
little looser than the bundles now you
probably can't tell because I have been
putting the curly cream can't
Oh curly cream in the can to leave in
conditioner a mixture of both in the
hair and that's why it looks really
really quickly and pretty
this is brazilian deep way from this
hair company and it is holding up really
really nice what I can definitely let
you guys know the hair is really soft
but I did have to go in and plug a
little bit more in the frontal area just
because it wasn't as gradient and
natural-looking how I wanted it to be
and yeah just pretty much see what I can
do with the hair like kind of loosen up
the curls trying to see what it's given
because I don't want it really tight
this is a deep wave I have a curly
texture I have a body wave and a
straight so I'll probably be doing bub
Malaysia and curly next that I have from
this hair company just to see if it's
true curly hair and there are some long
lips so I'm excited to try out the curly
because the body waves is really really
the deep wave is really pretty as you
can see but you can notice but the hair
it's a little deal
I've bloomed my hair out like I told you
that I would I don't even know how this
video is going right now but anyway I'm
going to strain a piece really quick
just so we can see how other strands and
then we're going to get into style
just to see how well of this hair does
everything because you
if you're purchasing some hair you want
it to do everything under the Sun you
don't want to be half steppin
all right muffin so this is the hair
strand I was gonna curly I probably will
still do that but I just wanted to turn
the camera back one but um I think the
hair looks really nice I feel like the
Lester is very like realistic it's not
giving you like baby doll vibes and it's
not silky straight so yeah this is how
it looks I just kind of put it up in a
half way up halfway down style don't ask
me why but they do neck so this is their
strand and I think it looks realistic
thing before I put a little small curls
somewhere in the front but I just
straighten that again just to see how
well it would you know strain again what
I can say I'm noticing the frontal is a
little bit more huh let's see what the
board can I use it's not difficult to
straight but I see that it's a little
bit more poofier than the actual bundle
so that can be like the you know issue
if you guys are looking for and the
frontal to do the exact same thing the
bundles are doing but does nothing too
drastic I would just tell you guys to
use some hair straightening serum
dime-sized not even a dime sized like a
little pea-sized of this put it up in
here chasing method and let's see what
that does
still kind of looks goofy but but of
course this is deep wave hair so you
know it's not really meant to be
straight but like I said I just wanted
to show you guys the versatility in this
hair and also just to see if fish turns
because I was interested to know that
too because the hair was really really
soft and usually when hair is super
super soft it's really easy to
straighten it so that's what's going on
here sorry if this light is going in and
out I don't know what the problem is I'm
gonna have to get a little bit more
lighting because I don't like how that
top light light looks I think it looks
annoying but this is the air so let's
see what we can do with it I might have
to take this robe off because I don't
want hair all over this nice pink fluffy
robe when I go and cut it so I'm gonna
put something going and I'll be right
back I'll probably put my trey songz
concert t-shirt on but I'm gonna be
using this razor to help me cut and make
my you know bangs and all that jazz and
then we're gonna go in and curl it girls
so I hope you guys are still here with
me cuz I'm doing a lot in this video
alright man so this is basically what
I've decided to do with my destroyer
hair I hope I'm saying that name right
click on a link below um hair super
versatile hold it in a nice holds a
really really nice curl I didn't know
really what look I was going for I'm
just trying to get the Mayoress to be as
popping as I needed them to be and then
lycra curl and brush out Rico that's
pretty much what I did to get this
process I kind of like that flowy
effortless like big but still loose kind
of curl so I just wanted to put some
images right here showing you guys after
doing all of that I win the shower and
dunk my head under water just to see if
it was gonna give me this
malala's deep wave texture again and it
did so that's always a pleasure so all
of their information will be linked in
the description box below babes and I
will see you guys in my next one

huge Halloween sale going on amazing
