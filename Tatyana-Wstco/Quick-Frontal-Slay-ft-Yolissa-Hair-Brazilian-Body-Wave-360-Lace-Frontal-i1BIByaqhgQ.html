my darlings I'm back with another video
and today I'm going to be sharing with
you guys so new hair that I received
from a hair company by the name of you
listen here this is an Aliexpress hair
company and I have three bundles of 20
inches and an 18 inch um
360 band lace frontal so I just want to
talk to you guys about the hair really
quick this hair is really freaking soft
I'm really excited about this hair
because it took my color really well and
I'm very pleased with the results and
there's no shedding no Navy no tangling
or anything like that if you're
interested in purchasing from this hair
company I'll list all their information
in the description box below they have
tons of positive feedback on their
Aliexpress website so make sure you
check that out before purchasing
purchasing this hair so you can get a
second and third opinion okay so what
I'm doing with this tweezing process I'm
just parting the baby hairs that came on
- that came with this frontal and I'm
just thickening the part up a little bit
so I can look a little bit more natural
because I will be cutting these baby
hairs and laying it over the lace this
time so every time I do a frontal it's
usually different from the last time I
created the frontal and I just tried
different techniques new techniques just
to branch out and try to do new things
with my frontals so I really do like
highlight this front so today so what
I'm doing is tweezing the density out of
the around the perimeter of the head and
also in the baby hairs so it won't look
so Wiggy and then you'll just see me
doing that throughout this video the
whole time and I'm really excited
because I really do like how this hair
turned out I will be parting this hair
and putting some uniform curls in so it
can kind of look like a pinup fill but I
did want to talk to you guys about the
Front's are really quick so with the 360
band you there's two draw strings on the
band so you can pull it really snug onto
your head so it can lay really flat and
other than that I think this is like the
most creative thing that the hair
industry has ever did because you can
put your hair up in a complete ponytail
and it's going to be lace all the way
around so you can party and do whatever
you want to do with this 360 band lace
frontal so I was really excited to get
my hands on one of these I think I have
another one that I will be doing a
review on so yeah other than that you'll
see me just pull me
extra hair out of the perimeter so it
won't look so Wiggy like I told you
before and this isn't like a five-minute
process or a like eight minute process
this really takes like an hour and some
change but I just wanted to speed up
this video and cut some extra parts out
just because it was just going to be way
too long and I didn't want you guys to
be sitting here for like freaking 30
minutes watching me do this video but
yeah so as you can see I'm just going in
between that area that I parted so I can
so I can look a little bit more natural
looking and then I'm pulling some excess
baby hairs that I do not need in there
because you don't want your baby hairs
to be really thick and then you're going
to be seeing me go in between the parts
that I want to look a little bit more
natural and this is just going to give
you a little bit more like like a more
natural appearance clearly so yeah so
this is basically all that I'm going to
be doing throughout the hair what else
can I tell you guys oh do not use sharp
tweezers for this process please use
some freaking dull tweezers because if
you rip your lace you're going to be
crying and trust me I had my fair share
of ripping lace and thinking that I can
go this fast honestly and it was just no
no this video is sped up like I told you
guys so don't think I am going this fast
and even with dull tweezers you can
actually snug and rip something so still
be careful and you'll be seeing me mess
with these baby hairs a little bit I'm
cutting them and I'm using like
literally putting the hair all the way
to the back of the scissors and cutting
the hair like that as if it was a razor
you don't have to use scissors you can
use a razor you just don't want a blunt
cut with your baby hairs because it's
not going to look natural looking so now
I'm just going to be moving the baby
hairs around to make sure I don't have
any really long pieces and as you can
see it's starting to come together
and I'm going to be cutting the lace off
of the baby hairs I'm cutting the lace
off the frontal now and I'm going to cut
the lace as close as I possibly can to
the baby hairs so there is a small piece
that I did miss but I'm going to fix
that after I turn off this camera I
didn't notice it until I got off this
camera because I was working in a very
small mirror so yeah
so clearly I'm still fondling with these
freakin baby hairs and now we're about
to cut them cut the lace and that's that
side and let's get into this side right
now and I do pretty much I do like three
different ways to form your baby hair so
what I'm doing is right now I'm actually
taking a blow dryer and like roughing up
the baby hairs because I don't want them
to be really straight when the baby
hairs look really straight it just looks
very dull like and I don't like it and
even if you're like if you like um like
taming your baby hairs with some water
or anything like that it still looks
very like dull like and I don't like
that look so that's why I use the heat
with the heat from the blow-dryer to
just get that together and now I took a
little bit of water on the brush and I'm
slipping the baby hairs down so you
don't have to do this if you don't want
to but now I'm taking a lot more water
and slick on the baby hairs down and
just because how I'm rocking the hair
today I want the baby hairs to be a
little bit more prominent because I am
parting it and I'm about to stab me here
right now
so you'll see it's all going to come
together it may look crazy to you but
it's cool it's cool
as you know like you can you don't have
to do the baby here is this strong you
can just do the other techniques that I
just showed you and yeah so now I'm
taking some serum on this hair and I'm
about to start styling this hair with my
flat iron and this hair is still
freaking pretty I love this hair so much
like you don't understand anyway I'm
taking the flat iron and curling the
hair under and I'm going to do that all
throughout my head so this is pretty
much this is pretty much all that I'm
going to be doing with unisza hair all
their links will be in the description
box below if you were wondering what
bleach I used
it's called blond brilliance and I got
it from Sally's Beauty Supply Store and
the purple hues once again is from my
tawny shampoo but I really do like the
purple I think it adds a little know a
little
it's about here um yeah so what else can
I tell you guys about you listen here as
you can see look how soft and beautiful
this hair looks after like you know
straightening it with that flattering a
couple of times so freakin pretty and
it's not dead at the end at all so I was
really happy with that because as you
can see like the hair is really light
towards the ends don't know what this
flatiron is called at all so please I
don't even know I think somebody
actually found out what this flatiron
was called so hopefully they can come
back under my video and mention that to
you guys because I have no idea and
that's pretty much all that we'll be
doing to Ulysses hair today I can't wait
to do some more styles with this hair
but I really do enjoy this one the most
it makes me feel really girly and happy
I was going out this day this video is
pretty old I've been rocking this hair
for some time now and I'm just now doing
the voice-over for it and just now
putting it up but yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you ladies in my
next one bye
