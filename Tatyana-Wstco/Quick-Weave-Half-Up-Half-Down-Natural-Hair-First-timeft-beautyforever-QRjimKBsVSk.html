alongside
I'm back with another video today I just
wanted to come on and try out a new
style that I have not tried that I'm
gonna do the pretty much the same method
that I did in my previous video for the
Quigley's and I'm gonna give you guys
like a little rundown on like some of
the questions that you were asking me
about the quick leaves so I'm gonna
start off I already had my hair braids
as you can see and I'm gonna do like a
halfway up halfway down kind of style
but I'm gonna put all of the group all
of the tracks that I'm gonna glue down
right back here and actually keep my
hair out at the top it only tried to
glue the tracks down in this area and
then I'm just going to use one of my
bundles to do like a halfway up halfway
down style at the top so hopefully that
makes sense you're good so hopefully it
comes out how about expecting it to come
out so of course we're gonna start off
with wig caps because that's what's most
important I'm gonna do it the same way
that I did the quick weave I'm just not
going to glue up here of course so I'm
gonna use brown ones this time just
because I don't know where my black ones
are but I'm going to put this over my
head just like I did the previous look
like I said before so yeah the hair that
I am gonna be using today is from Beauty
forever hair I'm gonna leave their
information in the description box below
but you guys actually like how don't I
get Google on my hair without um how do
I do this without getting clue on my
actual hair or how does it stay secure
well the blue does the blue it is going
to get on your hair it's going to sleep
down on your hair but it's not going to
get all over your hair and kind of weird
it's not like a super secure style
that's going to outlast you for like a
month it's called it quickly for a
reason so just understand that and like
usually when I do I look like this I
take it out the same day or either the
next day and then how I remove it I just
use a shampoo and conditioner and I just
put the shampoo or conditioner on my all
over my head and I try to like get it
underneath the lake house and I just let
it sit and let it do its thing for a
little bit and yeah and then I just kind
of like gradually like pull the wig cap
off but I kind of like letting the
shampoo and conditioner marinate so it's
not really hard for it to like slide
right off so I let mine sit for about it
like the conditioner shampoo sit on the
hair for maybe like ten minutes and yeah
so this hairs from Beauty forever I have
not to try three tone bundles at all
from aliexpress guys I believe this I
express the hair company they might
actually have a hair store now but I do
have three bundles from this company in
a frontal but I'm not going to use the
frontal just because their frontal
actually didn't come this color it
actually is just regular black and that
probably was just thinking too
bleech the frontal to achieve this look
but now I'm got sorrowful over that
so this is 26 above 26 inch so I do have
three 26 inches and a frontal from this
hair company but we're just going to use
the bundles and now what I'm gonna do is
just pour much pull this hair in part by
the way this hair is super soft and I'm
really really happy with that just
because this is a three-tone situation
so you're kind of expecting the ends to
be hard or rough just because it got so
it really bright blonde towards the ends
but just not giving that at all and I'm
not receiving any foul smells you're
going to need hair glow for this and
scissors of course so yeah I use the
salon Pro exclusive anti fungus hair
bonding glue super bond made in USA I
get it from the local beauty supply
store near me I'm sure you have it buy
yours so doesn't make sure all of your
hair is covered and of course I don't
have to leave any leave out out just
because half to my hair is left out at
the top this time you want to measure
where you want the first web to be and
you're gonna need your scissors to cut
the web and you want to cut the web
really really gently you don't want to
just go in and cut it without looking at
it just because you can't cut some of
the hair off that's how you're gonna
cause a lot of shedding when I did my
first quick weave the previous quick
weave I didn't get any shedding at all
so I cut really good so that's really
important
and if you want to be extra and you miss
like do this method and you want to kind
of be extra in don't want any shedding
to have them to you you can always use a
weft sealer but wet similar to me just
mix the hair really hard like makes the
wet really hard to work with so I'm just
going to just kinda let this air dry a
little bit for maybe like 10 seconds and
then I'm just going to start placing the
web on the back of my head and you want
to use your blow dryer to help you
secure it as well
before you
alongside
Oh
all right so this is what I came up with
and I really like how it turned out for
hair super soft and it doesn't have any
dead ends and it goes like to the middle
of my but if you can see that hey yeah
so I had a running over my toes fix
while I let my camera charge so that's
what I went to do and the hair looks
really really good and just slick my
edges down with some leave-in
conditioner right now so you can see how
I do that with my hair to brush and by
the way this is their frontal super
super soft like eyes no foul smell this
is how it looks and I hope you guys
appreciate these type of videos a little
bit more that really don't have frontals
involved just because like everybody is
not gonna like a frontal everybody is
not gonna want to rock a frontal so this
is another quick wave once again and so
it is going to get on the hair a little
bit but because I put two stocking caps
on it and not one it's not one thing
here a lot and how I remove the hair and
how I remove the glue or the actual
piece that's glued down I just go in the
shower and take some shampoo and
conditioner and let it soak and of
course after washing up and doing it
thug thizzle in the shower it's gonna be
super easy just to pretty much pull off
so I'll start from the back I would say
I definitely suggest you guys start from
the back by pulling it up it should
remove really really easy but if it's
not please don't pull on your hair just
add a little bit more shampoo and
conditioner mix into your hair and let
it get you know Sophie and sunny and
then pull it up and then just take some
shampoo and conditioner on your actually
here get your watch's comb and comb it
out this is not an everyday thing this
is definitely not gonna last for a month
and I advise you not to do this like
really on your edges so when I said in
the previous video like I don't want the
glue to get on my hair I was talking
about the hair that I am gonna be
leaving out during that time like my
leave out section in the previous video
for the middle part and I didn't want
its who of course to get on this section
that I've left out just because I don't
want that to happen so maybe you kind of
got thrown off when I said that but
hopefully you guys understand what
I mean I hope you guys enjoyed this so
much because you guys showed a lot of
love in my last video and I just felt
like we finally got something going here
you talk keep these videos up and coming
I will do my lower slicked ponytails and
all that other jazz that you guys want
to see so if you guys want to see
anything else please leave comment in
the comment section below because it
would mean so much to me but I hope you
guys enjoy it once again baby loves and
beauty forever information will be
linked in the description box below I
hope you guys like how it turned out
once again I will see you babies in my
next one bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
