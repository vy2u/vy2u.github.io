video ever on YouTube we're gonna do
that today I'm bored and offices like
why not because my probably falling off
so the first video that I ever made on
the tube kid was back in 2013 November
19 okay
that's how long I've been on YouTube but
you guys know that I took like a major
break on YouTube so like you anyway yeah
okay alright so we're just gonna watch
it we're gonna watch it we're just going
to watch it right so this is this one
what am i doing why why don't I feel the
need to add the pin up music with the
pin up look like a sex operator mess
either demo pause before before we go
any further my highlight was so
don't like that you want to see that I
look like I have a I don't even know
what I look like I have on my end like
that was the worst part
listen to this this makes me cringe and
want to punch my computer screen listen
like I should delete this I've sometimes
thought this video of taking this off
this is just the best my words pretty
stuff you guys were doesn't mean trust
me I was already present then here we go
with this mouth thing when I do my
makeup that has not changed
why am i so close but it just wasn't
even topping is my brows definitely want
it let's spin amidst am i clear this is
so unnecessary to those struggling to
make the lion country but I can't make
that wing is very much so step okay I'm
still using that favorite liquid liner
this is from ELF hi love outliner
I really wish I had all of my music from
my old videos but the videos going out
with Ruby will fill the world's best
friend I love me some Ruby would ever
like a first lipstick I've ever bought
it was blow kisses oh I thought I was
popping when I found the sound effects
and for my youtube videos okay so I feel
like that was mad short let's go watch
another one you know which one I want to
watch this one right here favorite
lippies photo sister loves this video
this was three years ago raisi 2014
creamy big new without a liner
saint-germain
I just bought bags because I wanted a
paint I hated it hi look for me I hate
how they look so me this summer
okay let's listen what this now because
this video was going hella fast a minute
and 29 seconds like why would I even
post that next
this was the Nicki Minaj purple lavender
lipstick I would wear it just like that
like with my face that bear I don't even
know what that was
but I still use quiet I don't even know
better
that was unlink please me from Mac trash
I think that on me
mehran or me garbage fashion flower
glaze that was mine I used to dig my
nail in because I went back to I went
back to Mac and they told me that it
discontinued and I was just lying no use
it all the time media trash I lied that
was a real septum but I could not find a
frickin septum piercing so I used a girl
I used this thing from the arts and
crafts store to putting my nose I've
bent it almost broke my damn fingertips
trying to finesse the situation for this
video and if it wasn't even cute so I
don't even know why I did that
and then why do I have that bracelet one
like but what I found that night moth
really looks that popping even though it
look you make sure look rusty so if you
would put night mouth all over your lips
I would suggest you guys do a scrub
before you do that but yeah
look I was pressed that looks so really
good in my memory card bro
mmm psycho I'm still that correct this
is when I was getting to something in my
mind this is the daytime smokey I can
help you I was just like I was getting
into my little crafty like you know
Nizam look stuck in the cheekbones in I
don't know that was a thing for me i
Loki still do it so I don't even know
why I'm playing myself right now but you
know but my hair was really nice and
really well I'm really healthy during
this time but yeah I'm using that room a
room liner as a base I guess that's so
dark
still use the LA girl Pro like that's my
go to consider bitch using my Real
Techniques Beauty sponge dirty I don't
even know how my skin was clear right
now

don't even have this on no more I got
the partition again hey hey I'm using
mullet to contour don't do that anymore

thing okay and I used to put black
eyeliner on them so much my super black
Beijing here won't brush in my using for
highlights like I used to girl I can't
but it came out good I did what was this

lip gloss and not even biting my lips
