Westco and I'm back today to share with
you ladies a new way that I received
from RPG show hair company and I'm super
excited to share this experience with
you ladies because this is my first
unboxing video on YouTube
so I'm super excited to let you ladies
know how you'll be receiving the hair if
you decide to purchase some RPG show
hair company and all the goodies that
come inside of your box when you do
purchase from them thank you for
watching don't forget to thumbs up
comment subscribe and we're gonna jump
right into how the Box looks so this is
the box that you'll be receiving your
way and it says RPG shadow by Anthony
cut and the other wise is by Anthony
cousins because RPG show actually
partnered up with a hair stylist by the
name of Anthony because of he actually
has his own ways that he cuz it creates
for PG show your company this is how the
inside of the box to love sweetie open
it so of course this is the wig and this
is how the biggest story in the actual
home wig storage pouch and underneath
that is a wig brush little detail of the
wig is on this piece of paper I'm having
a wig cap they also have a magazine the
magazine I won't open so I won't spoil
it for you ladies I'm super excited to
open a window so let's see so the way we
come out of here in this ditch and it
has RPG shows name on it and it says
bold head sexy hair doesn't net over it
so we're going to undo it from the label
okay so this is how quick who loves
straight out of me with this this is a
lace wig so of course you're going to be
having your lace in the front so you can
make your own hair line look as natural
possible like as if you want to mimic
your hairline and just like you would do
with a frontal or the closure
you'll be basically doing this thing
with this I know that people use blue -
laser face down I'm not sure how I'm
going to be doing mine yet but yeah so
this is the cut I got a bob because I
was more into doing short hair right now
I don't know I think I'm tired of long
hair for some odd reason but short is
the way to go for me right now so I
decided to just go ahead and get a sure
buff from them and it is called Anthony
elegant black Bob Anthony cuts
0:13 hair color is jet black so that's
one hair length is the left side is 11
inches the right side is 13 inches the
hair textures so keen on ya key lace
colors like brown cap construction is
cat3 blue this cap and the cap size is 1
this is how the inside looks it has
three combs two on the side and one in
the back and it has to draw strings
where you just grip it in make it as
tight as possible so I and I'm just
going to go ahead and pop this on my
head to see how I will want a rocket or
anything because my camera is about
style jump right back on the camera
after I do the cutting of the lace and
so thank you so much for watching I'll
leave all their information in the
description box below so don't forget to
look in there once you're done watching
this video don't forget to thumbs up
comment subscribe ladies thank you so
much for all your support and thank you
for watching
she's excited to make it fit me perfect
perfect perfect so this is for how they
can but warns without me cutting face
you can see the left side is little
longer there so left side is 11 inches
- no bruise right you're 13 inches and
this is the way brush that it comes
let's go to go ahead eternal rock really
somehow it looks more me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
