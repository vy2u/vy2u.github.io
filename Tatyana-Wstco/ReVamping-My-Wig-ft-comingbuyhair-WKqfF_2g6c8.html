this is from coming pair I went out with
this wig up to you nights ago so that's
why it's kind of looking crank ray so
I'm out to revamp it right now I'm just
going to throw some curls in it I cut
some of the hair off in the front so I
can have like me a deep sigh bang the
wig is not completely on I still have to
like lay the lace down so special if
it's looking crazy up there that's why
so I'm going to start curling my hair
now and going to speed this process up
because you guys pretty much know how I
wash down my hair so yeah so hope you
guys enjoy the deal and I'm going to
come and talk to you guys about the unit
towards the end what about the way
what about the way
so far the air is a really frickin soft
I don't have any problems with it way
cap is kind of loose for me because even
though I got pulled you Josh drinks and
I pull my clothes underneath my wig cap
it's kind of still a little loose so I
believe I got a cap size small so just
be aware of that um even when I put the
drawstrings to each side I don't get a
bulk in the back and I really really do
appreciate that because I hate when that
happens when I'm trying to make the wig
fit release love on me and I'm having
issues with sticking out in the
back so the fact that this way doesn't
do that I really do appreciate that a
lot
but I hope you guys enjoyed this video
is very simple bombshell waves I guess
you can say that this style is I will
leave all that information in the
description box below thank you so much
for watching baby love and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
