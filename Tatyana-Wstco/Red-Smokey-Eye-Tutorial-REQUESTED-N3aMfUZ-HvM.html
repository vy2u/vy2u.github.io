video today I'm gonna be showing you
guys how to get this look I recreated it
from the previous video that I did you
guys have so many questions about how I
achieved this red vibrant eye so we're
gonna jump into all of that today if I
miss anything it was because I was
filming this on Instagram lives so you
you're gonna see the video kind of
probably be all over the place a little
bit of the products that I did use in
this video will be listed in the
description box below alright so I had
to cut myself off because I was about to
start rambling for no reason so let's
just get into this video now i'm gonna
be using soft ochre Paint Pot from Mac
and this is once again a Paint Pot and
it's supposed to just ensure that your
shadow is going to last all day and of
course make them more vibrant my eyelids
are pretty dark you know so I like to
use this to pretty much prime act as a
primer and also just to make sure you
know I'm getting the best intensity that
I made what I am going with colorful
looks like this when I am going for
colorful looks like this I don't know
it's early on I'm trying to do this
voiceover okay so as you see I'm
dragging that underneath my eye because
I am gonna give like a smokey illusion
underneath there too I'm gonna use my
NYX white eyeshadow base just to make
sure this eyelid is really intense and
vibrant as much as I would like it to be
so you can use this or you can just
stick to the Paint Pot or you can just
use milk jumbo pencil from NYX whatever
floats your boat to get the intensity
that you want I'm taking kisi from the
joy of a magic palette and I'm just
gonna place that color right on top of
that just so it's easier for the shadows
to be blended out okay and it's not
gonna look patchy or anything like that
and I'm just using nunna from the magic
palette to get this transition shade so
it's gonna be above my crease and it's
just gonna work as a transition shade
just so there's no just blank nothing at
the top you know what I'm saying
so yeah I'm gonna be using orange
because I would like a burnt orange
because I am gonna go in with red so
it's just going to look really great in
and really nice so that's why I do that
and then I'm just going to make sure I
pack that to get the most intensity that
I want and
then start doing sweeping motions back
and forth with a blending brush and then
I'm gonna go in with my Smashbox palette
this is the colorful one that they have
I would list all the products below once
again but yeah I'm taking that orange
from this palette and it's just going to
help intensify the outer corners of my
eyes and make everything look snatched
okay so keep blending until you get a
release like subtle gradient kind of
vibe going on and then we're gonna go in
with the star of the show but not yet
let me just finish this bottom half of
my eye underneath my waterline because I
want this to be a smoky as well now the
star of the show is this red from the
morphe 35o palette and I'm using that
hot red just to apply all over my lids
now because I have like hooded eyes or
there's like you know a little small
little baby lid whatever you want to
call it I'm just gonna make sure I'm
making the shadow above that and also
making sure it's rounded out because I
have a really small lid but you can
always make an illusion you know with
makeup you can make it look like you
have a bigger lid so that's basically
what I'm doing and if you need to do
this the best thing that I could say to
do is look up in a mirror you know had
the mirror sitting in front of you but
like tilt your head up and you can start
forming where you need to place this red
eyeshadow and yeah so I'm just gonna
speed this up just because it took me a
while it really wasn't even as high as I
wanted it once I stopped before once I
stopped but I'm gonna fix it later on in
the video after I put my lashes on and
stuff like that
so you don't want to go too too far up
but you still want it to be able to be
visible when you are looking straight
ahead a clean blending brush and a small
blending brush just to make sure
everything is seamless and you know
everything looks like it's supposed to
be there I'm going to use the micro brow
pencil from NYX and this is in the shade
expresso to snatch my brows and then
we're gonna start doing this face
yes so I'm gonna highlight right now
well a lot of you be like the water
watching my makeup like this but it's
because I really don't like that cakey
look to my skin when I am wearing my
makeup so I don't like putting a whole
bunch of foundation like all over my
face then topping it with concealer and
then putting contour and then putting
powder on it just makes my skin type
look really cakey and I don't like that
so yeah all right so this is toffee once
again and I just put it right underneath
here and on the I'm in the middle of my
forehead just to even me out all right
and then I'm gonna go in with my Bobbi
Brown foundation stick and this is an
expresso I used the foundation stick to
contour and I do that because I really
like this undertone it's not too dark
and it's not too red and it doesn't get
muddy on me so I like that about let me
just put some of this concealer down the
bridge of my nose I just used fawn
so I'm using total control foundation
cappuccino someone put it on the back of
my hand
I'm gonna use my Real Techniques Beauty
Blender to you know blend this out you
desert sunny and I always use a damp
Beauty Blender so it works the best from
me I'm not gonna tell you not to work
with the dry cuz some people like it
drive but I feel like it just gives me
more of a flawless thanks to what I am
using a damp damp not extremely wet
because they will mess up your damn
makeup
no dummy ain't no loyal team like and
you say that you won't laugh at me maybe
that's left me and you laugh at me
I like taking my beauty but my beauty
blender dance still I didn't read my
Cree win it or anything like that but
I'm just going up put this right
underneath as if all of this bread isn't
under my eye I still need to set it okay
but I'm not gonna go over it too too
much but it still needs to be set in
this area and I like this powder cuz
it's real fine
oh by the way guys I'm going in with my
Laura Mercier
so I'm going to use my morphe t22 brush
to start contouring my nose
and with my stamina flat golden again is
to set the rest of my face and I didn't
set it and this is because we use cream
products and you don't want to go and
start doing circular motions one cream
products because it's just gonna start
looking patchy and muddy so I like
lightly I like lightly setting this
first before I start all of this
nonsense like this color a lot okay from
the next day met enough flat and I like
pretty much focusing that one back here
right
so this is Nick's bronzer
taiyaki is we is we focus in the
highlight is mega go if you guys want to
take a picture of this that's how it
looks get me out of the tie light type
of team girl don't give me line I just
might be an extra ballet now when I did
this look right let me get this out of
the way before this camera died</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
