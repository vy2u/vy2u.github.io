how crazy I look right now I have powder
on my lashes and I don't have any
mascara and I haven't finished my eyelid
yet so I wanted to come on and just show
you guys how I'm going to cut this bob
because I'm wearing this out today this
sake unit from RPG hair calm this is
very yaki twelve-inch 150% operating
yaki indian remy glueless placed frontal
wig all the information will be listed
in the description box below because you
know the title always be how long for no
reason but anyway so what I did was it
was goodness so far we just add these
little highlighted pieces in the front
it didn't come like this I actually do
that myself
and it was just because I was trying to
give this unit a little bit more
character because I really wasn't
filament to be honest with you guys I
just didn't like the ombre kind of feel
to it so I want to cut the unit shorter
and I want to add some pizzazz to it so
I think we want to do it without you
guys and if you ask me questions and I
also wanted you to see and I also want
you guys to see the unit in its natural
state so the only thing about this hair
I don't like its texture I don't like
Jackie anything yeah he just gives off
like horse hair if that makes us to you
so I haven't put any heat or this unit
and that's what I'm going to be doing
right now so what I did was this
actually was a middle part but what I
did was just twist the unit so that's
why this part looks shorter this part
looks shorter than this side so I just
put the part on my right side of my face
and I just put the part with the right
side of my face so I'm kind of going for
like one of those bobs that you know
tough behind your ear and then this card
is like hanging and this part is short
but this part is a little longer like an
asymmetrical kind of five so that's what
I'm going to be doing today all that
information will be listed in the
description box below I actually have my
wares
I actually have a worthless wig out
anywhere just because I was trying to
finesse it
or I did so so I pin or wearing it out
tonight if I like how it turns out
I haven't straightened it I haven't
curled it I haven't done anything like
that so I feel like the little
highlighted pieces really do add some to
the hair so I'm glad that I've decided
to do something like that honestly it
was just like I had leftover bleach and
I was just like let me pull out this
unit and I seen the color and I was
actually trying to go for like
highlighted pieces throughout the unit
but I didn't feel like doing all that
either so I just kept it like this just
highlighted the SPRO part so I'm kind of
basing this off of this picture that
I've seen online that I really really
like and honestly her hair looks like it
was this color too so I'm going to try
to guide myself with that picture just
to see how I want it because I kind of
want it that way let me tell you guys
about my day today was definitely rough
today was not my day or like I was gonna
do okay so I'm kind of going to just
keep it like this I moved it over a
little bit more just so when I go like
this I can link the unit kind of where
it belongs but not so much but it's not
going to kill us if it doesn't go
exactly in the area it should just
because it's a wig and we can take this
on and off and I'm going to take small
pieces just because I don't want to do
anything too thick and then it'll be
hard to like fix my ear so it looks like
it's pretty much on her neck like up to
here so I'm going to cut it a little
longer than what I should only because
if I have to fix anything
so that's short enough I ain't going to
be shorter than that
and I'm just going to pretty much guide
myself this is not going to be perfect
just because I'm right here and I can
barely see and this light is not even or
sorry
so I was kind of going to cut this at an
angle okay we're getting somewhere
so I'm going to angle this too
okay so what I'm going to do now is take
this off put it on my mannequin head
really quick and cut what it needs to be
fixed but this is how it looks so far
okay so this is basically what I came
out with when I put it on the
mannequin head it just made it shorter
but it's cool it's cool longer this part
is longer because we'll be bump it up
when we go to bump it under you should
look they should it look cute all right
let me snatch my life really quick with
you guys I don't know who I thought I
was cutting this hair in the smallest
mirror that I ever had to work in and
think that it was going to turn out to
be perfect but girl is cool you know you
make Charles and air as you learn from
your lessons but what I can tell you is
at the end of the day the end results
were cute I think they were cute but
when I should have have done with bendy
hair out with some shears because it was
just too thick for it to be in her type
of bob I just think I was just over the
fact that I was cutting and it just
didn't turn out how I wanted it to turn
out but just giving you guys the back
information about this hair texture and
the quality of his hair I actually but I
like you seen in the beginning I was
stating that I really wasn't feeling the
texture but once I start running my
Flatiron through it I really enjoyed how
natural it looked if you guys agree with
me about you know what the heat vis to
the hair thumbs up this video or comment
below and let me know if you feel the
same way when it comes to yaki like you
definitely have to put some heat on yaki
before you kind of really judge it so
yeah so I actually finesse it a little
bit more when I was off of camera in the
next day and I kind of was filling it I
kept it in a more strength style you'll
see it in a second or if it's not
already you know shown but other than
that I really do like how the hair
texture was the style it definitely
could have been way perfect in this but
you know once again trial and error
I hope you guys enjoyed this video
though all of RPG information will be
listed in the description box below I
actually have a 360 unit that I am
working on for this company right now
and it will be up soon because I love
this unit that I am rocking currently
while I'm doing this voice over it
turned out so nice in a 360 body wave
unit I can't wait to share that with you
