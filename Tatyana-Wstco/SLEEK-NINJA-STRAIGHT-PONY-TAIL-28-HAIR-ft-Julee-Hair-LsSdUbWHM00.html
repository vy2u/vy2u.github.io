another video
okay who we got this fight is my elbows
Ashley I think it's that today we are
going to get to this highly requested
ninja bun not fun ninja ponytail until
the hair that I am gonna be using for
this look is Julie here it's a a great
virgin brazilian straight hair I have
three bundles um 28 28 26 in a 360
frontal now the 360 front room was 20
inches and I just didn't really want to
use the 360 front so I really wanted to
do a crazy funky sleek ponytail look and
this is basically when I came up with
the day I received the bundles I fell in
love with it I opened it and I was just
like oh my god this hair so soft is so
perfect and that's when I created that
look because I just want wearing really
sleek ponytail but I went in the
ponytail to be really long so I used
both 28 inch bundles that night so now
we're gonna be working with a 28 in a 26
bundle let's get it poppin if you guys
are gonna see this makeup look let me
know and become a section below it was
really simple to do this PS is like 1
o'clock in the morning while I'm doing
this I'm eco styling Joe you're gonna
need the olive oil 1 because this one is
alcohol-free so that's why I really like
that one it is olive oil base so however
high you want this look to be that's
where you want to start off by placing
your actual ponytail in that area let me
just see where I want this so what is
pretty high but I don't want all the way
on the top in my head so I'll probably
like put it like right here so when my
ponytail falls
probably my gray hair alright so when my
pony falls it's like at a good lip
Oh styling gel and I'm going to put it
warmly
so what we're gonna do is just tuck this
underneath the base of the ponytail and
we rats the little small piece of that
little small with another little small
weft that we stuck underneath the base
of the ponytail and this is just born to
secure it so it won't go anywhere
we're gonna start wrapping the West
around the ponytail I like wrapping it
once right but then what I like doing is
going up on the bun and start taking
some bobby pins and sticking bobby pins
through the weft and sticking it
directly in my bun so when I do have
this high ponytail this part of my butt
is not going to stick out and that's how
you stop that from happening
you just start wrapping it how I usually
wrap it and that's just wrapping it
underneath the base of my little button
now you want to make this really secure
but you don't want to make it too tight
because your head is going to start
hurting throughout the day you don't
want to lose any circulation cooling
ahead girl okay that's how you pass out
nor your Wendy Williams shorty
so as you can see we're not happy going
back you can't see you know that other
video that I had what the halfway up
halfway down and the little my little
bun was sticking through I was like girl
we can't we can't do that anymore all I
know is this hair is really nice um
little thing around it this one and this
one looks like it's a little bit on the
shinier side then this one and I feel
like I like this bundle better than this
one I don't know but Bertha will see the
I can tell I can definitely say this one
is a lot fuller than the other ones that
I work with and the ends are looks like
they've been trimmed already so I don't
know this is eight a hair
they said this ain't a hair so the other
bundles aren't holding up really good
because I did this hairstyle a couple of
times now some of you guys asked me like
how long can you you know sleep with
this or whatever however long you want
to keep this in this is a ponytail look
there's no build up with that product
there's no flakes or anything like that
so you don't really have to wash your
hair if you don't want to and of course
you're not supposed to wash your hair
hair every day anyway so yeah but anyway
this is how the 26 bun dough looks this
is how long the 26 inch bundle is
literally arm length so yeah we're going
to use for cars gonna use this whole
thing we'll see okay do the same thing
wrap in the little piece around the base
of the bun now I'm not gonna make this
one too tight because the other one was
already really tight
take you see how I have a little piece
left over I'm going to take this piece
along with some more hair in the back
like right next to it and what I'm going
to do is take this and make this as my
band so we're going to use this to
pretty much create I'm just trying to
see if I need some more here but I don't
think I mean I think this is good enough
so I graphics holding spray and I'm
going to spray this on this part and
then start working fast so it won't dry
and you still remember we have to wrap
it around this way and have your calm
right by your side because you needs a
slick and smooth as you start doing this
process
what I like doing is take them up here
to brush on taking my hair to brush in a
little bit more of this eco styler gel
now I'm gonna try to do something
different you don't have to do this
and of course just take out Shaw's edges
and if you want your ponytail to be
higher you can always take like a little
clip and put it in the back of your head
alright so I took the clip out just I
didn't have time but yeah so that's kind
of how you make the ponytail look a lot
higher whatever if that's what you're
trying to do but you know you just want
to make sure everything is sleek and
chic I wouldn't put too much hairspray
of course you can do this with synthetic
hair you just won't be able to reuse it
and you can always just buy you some
more synthetic hair is really cheap or
you can just get you some Julie hair
bundles girl and be looking like a true
Jim alright
really thoughts and it's giving me real
mystic vibes doesn't it
so that is how Tommy gets hurt
ninja Pony I was gonna put some lashes
on the bobber tonight listen it's 1
o'clock in the morning and we not about
to do that I'm just prepping my hair for
tomorrow so when I pop up in the morning
I can just get up and go like the wind
okay so yeah thank you so much for
watching baby loves Julie hair will be
listed in the description box below I
know you guys are gonna really really
really appreciate this video because
like I said it was really highly
requested and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
