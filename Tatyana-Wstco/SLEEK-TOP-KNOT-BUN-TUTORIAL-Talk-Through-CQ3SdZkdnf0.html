if I'm Slapton is because I'm trying to
get you guys to see this whole full
fledge hairstyle right now so today
aren't you excited by the title of this
video you guys are gonna see how I
create my top knots
this is usually a style that I wear what
I'm trying to give my hair a break when
I just pretty much we want to do
something with my hand I don't want to
wear weave honestly even though this
still has a weave in it but you get what
I'm trying to say I don't want to make
this video too long I just wanted to say
hello I hope you guys enjoy the video
and I hope you guys learned something
new let me know if it works for you if
you do recreate this look that would be
so exciting to see how it turned out for
you guys and yeah all of the products
that I use in this video will be listed
in the description box below but I'll
just run through a little bit just to
show you guys what I use so you're gonna
need a wig brush or depends on honestly
everything depends on your hair type
you'll see my grow hair in this video so
you'll see what works for me and it may
not work for you but I just get a
regular wig brush you can get one of
these I use a two-sided brush this one
one size is the soft side one side is
the hard side and you can even get you a
smaller version soft side hard side I
have this little tiny brush that I use
just to slick up the sides of my hair
and I use a hair tube brush you're also
gonna see my leave-in conditioner in
this video and this is a Cantu product
you're also going to hear me talk about
this organics beeswax so I will list all
of these products in the description box
below but that's pretty much all I use
oh oh oh and the major major key alert
is this Eco styling gel I can't do my
hair without this honestly it just keeps
my hair intact and it changes my life
every time I want to do a slick look so
yeah if you want to see how I get this
look with curly hair let me know because
usually it's never straight my hair is
never straightened
I am natural so my hair is actually
curly but yeah so I'm gonna do a
storytime really quick - just because
I'm waiting on my friend
and I feel like I can fit a story time
in by the time she gets here so I love
you guys and I'll see you guys in my
next one so what I'm gonna do is take
this little tiny brush right here and
I'm gonna dip it inside of the Eco
styling gel okay just like this make
sure you co all of the bristles and I'm
just going to do this right
get back make sure you brush up and this
is just so my hair doesn't curl up
so just go however much joke you feel
like you need to put one you're here
I like coating this on the parts that I
need it to look really slick my hair is
pretty fun so it's not super thick it's
not super thin but it's like right in
the middle so when you guys ask me how
do my hair look how do I get my hair to
lay so flat as you can see my hair is
already like on the thinner side so
that's how I'm able to do that
I like you from the hard side but this
hard side is hard as girl this is
the brush that I usually use but see I
like my pony toes to literally sit like
right dab in the middle almost like all
the way to my forehead
you always
alright so smooth up now very softly if
you have the same hair texture it's mine
cuz girl you make one wrong move and
there's the end of your life Brill Dale
Holyfield toothbrush hair to brush
I like going up on a Tuesday
twist my actual hair you can braid it
you can twist it but I like twisting
okay I got my tiny rubber band and now
we're gonna wrap it around the baby bun
so now that I look like a sumo wrestler
I want these out because these aren't
actually going to stay out so don't mind
that he wore this hair out last night
like this well not like this it was
another style but I'm showing you guys
how to do so what we're gonna do is do
it my way
okay it's my way or the highway I don't
got time to be bobby pin it down even
though I have the bobby pins I like
being able to take this off immediately
when it needs to be and I make it secure
like when I'm finished with this style
like you'll give it I'm talking about so
I'm just wrapping the weft
I wrap the weft underneath the little
small baby bun and then what I did was
take a little piece of this hair and
start wrapping it around the weft okay
and this is just going to make sure that
wet that first weft that I used to wrap
around the little baby bun is going to
be secure and it's not going anywhere
so take your time make sure it's lining
up with the rest of the wet that's
actually getting wrapped around don't
get things long hair that's out stuck in
your little sections cuz that's gonna
look tacky just take your time is
basically what I'm trying to say okay
so as you can see nothing okay
no left is showing and that is so
important you don't want your wife to be
peeking through
you will
so then at this last part what you want
to do is just make sure the hair is nice
and detangled straight pretty much
because what we're going to do now is
use this piece of hair okay you can grab
more if you want to but I don't like
grabbing a lot I want to grab more
though so I'm gonna grab some of this
that's right next to it and I'm gonna
comb it and then I'm going to make sure
it's straight up in here
I want it to straight only because I
don't want it to be hard for me to wrap
it around and tuck it so that sternum
so now I am going to wrap this pick this
up wrap this around now you don't want
to wrap it too tight because all its
gonna do is go underneath okay Connor
don't want it to go underneath you want
it to kind of be seen you know how
sometimes people I make they're super
thick unless I'm going for that look
before that this look is not required so
I just like popping it underneath there
I don't even use a bobby pin right now
girl like nope nope no bobby pins no
bobby pins need it so that's how this is
looking right now if the back looks
crazy we're gonna fix it just because
the hair was just hit in my head
detangle the hair because that's very
important
all that this needs to be smooth okay
and this is why I like Brazilian hair
because Brazilian hair kind of mimics my
hair you might want to swim underneath
it as well
start twisting twisting keep twisting
girl this is 22 inches by the way
keep twisting keep twisting this is the
topknot Chronicles remember keep
twisting girl start molding it to how
you want it to go and this is my topknot
you favorite hair ties they don't have
these other goody care ties they don't
have any metal on them that's so
important so it's not snagging your hair
out so what I'm going to do is just wrap
this around the bun
and there we go voila my little top not
a girl so what I do now girl you should
see how I'm sitting just so you guys can
see me so I'm gonna do now is take my
toothbrush
take a little bit of my gel or the
toothbrush and then hit this part back
there
I need a new chair this chair is
literally falling apart and I don't know
why I think my boyfriend put it on wrong
why are you doing this to me right now
I like when nothing is on the brush even
conditioner that I like using an excuse
not to brush it looks kind of ratchet
when I did that that's not cute I'm
gonna use the leave-in conditioner
because I had time for that I'm just
gonna take whatever is on the back of
this top and not just like making sure
the bristles are coated lightly and then
I like and I just start forming my baby
hair is how I want them to be
make sure you go and light on this
product just because you go heavy a
white residue kind of left on your hair
and you don't want that so you see if
you see anything white over here that's
what I mean am I focused
but what I did have five ways I use
organics beeswax and this will make
stay in place I wouldn't suggest you use
this on your edges just because it would
just look too crazy and this product is
just too heavy for that but I usually
like putting this if I do use this if I
remember to use this when I am doing my
buns I just like putting it right up in
here and this is just so everything is
laying how I want it to lay and I know
that it's going to stay in place all day
type of thing so yeah so this is my bun
tutorial beds I hope you guys liked it I
loved it I hope you learned something
new

friend you know I'm saying
