back with another video and i wanted to
get this unboxing video up for step my
hair and i'm super excited about this
hair company because i saw a couple of
reviews from his hair and I've heard
that their hair quality is super amazing
so i'm glad i got my hands on some of
the tears to let you ladies know about
it and i'll see how well this hair holds
up for me so they have a future
promotion going on on their website
right now so a lot of the prices are
reduced doubts so make sure you check
that out they have an official website
now so it's still a hair com I believe
but if not i'll put it in the
description box or I'll put it right
here so make sure you take advantage of
that big promotion that they're having
also let's get on with it unboxing part
so this is how obvi seeing my hair um
comes in the plastic and it looks like
it has a bag inside for me all these the
care labels um have their names on it
it's I think they actually do have a
little bit yes okay so the men are
actually at the top of the bundles so I
received a 26 inch of the body waves of
the Brazilian body wave i received a 24
inch and 18-inch closure I believe or
this might be a front and 22 inch so
let's start off with the 34 inch of the
Brazilian body wave and let me make sure
this is actually resilient body wave yes
this is a Brazilian body wave in 20 to
24 to 26 and an 18 inch frontal so yes
so that's what I have so I'm going to
open the 24 inch for you ladies so
hopefully my camera
because last time you remember what
happened to me I was so sad oh my god
this hair is so nice this hair is so
freaking nice wait like this hair is
thick as hell but some body wave I've
never received thick body wave before
and it's a good thick it's not like a
super thing what is my healthy thing
like this is some healthy hair Oh indeed
I'm excited so you guys know how to get
about virgin hair so this is some pretty
ass hair I don't see any dead ends at
all on this hair this hair doesn't have
a foul smell at all I'm lucky enough I'm
not receiving any terrible hair
companies that have nasty smells because
I hate that okay so let's move on to the
grave 6h I'm happy I'm at it I'm a kid
freaking can you come Philippe okay so
this is the 26 inch look at that this
looks like something yo for my birthday
I really do not know what I want to do
with my hair like I don't know if I want
to do a crazy funky colors not know I
actually ladies about my hair but i'm so
indecisive right now I don't know if I
want to get braids or put in some
popping hair with some nice color in it
oh let's move on to be 22 inch so the 22
pitch the 22 inch looks like this and I
don't see any dead ends on this either
I'm not getting any strands running my
favorite this hair is so soft guys I
feel like it's like a real natural body
wave and it's not like a process way
that somebody tried to steam press and
trying to make it a wave and then when
you go and wash it there's nothing there
i'm so happy that i actually got a
frontal cuz i believe i thought they
said they ran out the front door okay so
with the frontal this is how the frontal
looks
I'm so happy with this because the
density is perfect hate pc make Nick
frontals like it's so annoying because
we already have to deal with trying to
plug it to fit our hairline and when
it's just just super super thick is just
someone or to do with they have the baby
hairs on this frontal this probably so
beautiful like we'll have to take care
of the hair so maybe you guys need to
read over this if you guys really don't
know too much about virgin hair but or
you can watch a couple of my other
videos that I let you guys know how to
deal with virgin hair just my biggest
tips are two when you're detangling or
installing try not to cut the West
because it causes less shedding and
start detangling from bottom to top
because that costs less shedding um oh
and don't cut the West but overlap them
so bring them over and store your hair
in a nice place if you don't use all
your bundles so with that being said
step my hair provided me a nice little
bag so I'm sure this comes in
everybody's on bag when you purchase
from them you guys can put your leftover
bundles in that so because I will be
installing this on property by next week
or the week after and I'm gonna put this
in the bag for right now and yeah so I'm
you really don't need four bundles like
I think two would even be enough because
this is something pretty hair to in a
nice size in a nice length frontal and
for the lips this hair is really thick a
lot of times when you deal with virgin
hair and virgin hair companies they try
to put less hair in the vulgar bundles
because of course it's more hair and it
costs more but the thickness of this
hair is so awesome that I feel like you
wouldn't even have to do with trying to
purchase like four or five bundles just
to achieve a thick and natural-looking
we've because his hair
really think other virgin hair companies
when you order like maybe 26 and 24 inch
you have to order make like four or five
bundles just because you need to hit you
need the hair to look on natural with
this as you can see like this is enough
and this is three bundles like this
imagine putting all this in a ponytail
plus a frontal so that's why I feel like
you would be safe even with two bundles
and a frontal Oracle I will be rocking
this hair for a couple of weeks so i can
give you guys an honest review so I'm
just so excited that I can be shared
with you all some new virgin hair and
some great body wave here because I
haven't really got some good lad I got
this hair and leather stuck with this
because I actually thought I wanted to
get like more of a curly from them but i
think they convinced me with the body
waves because they felt that i was going
to be more satisfied with that but i
think they were right so i hope you guys
are interested make sure you check the
description box for all the information
its stem hair dark stomach hair com is
their official website now yep so my
hair down calm them and they have their
telephone number and stuff on the bag so
you can contact them with their email so
that's awesome so make sure you check
them out because I really believe they
have great quality here so don't forget
