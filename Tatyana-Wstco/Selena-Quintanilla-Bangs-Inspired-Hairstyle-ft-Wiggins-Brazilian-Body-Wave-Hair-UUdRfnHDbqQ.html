maybe let us solve this is basically
what I'm going to be doing with my
Wiggins hair I'm so in love with this
freakin hair is so soft I actually did a
little quick tutorial on how I cut these
bangs I'll list that video in the
description box below but this is
Wiggins Brazilian straight hair is super
soft and I cut the ends because I felt
like they weren't like a little thin and
then I got two bundles and a 360 frontal
and yes this is a 360 frontal so of
course I wasn't rocking the hair in
bangs the whole time when I actually
created this wig for myself with Wiggins
Brazilian body wave I was actually
wearing it in its natural state and also
curling it and styling the hair all the
time and I just decided you know I want
some bangs for myself for this holiday
why not share how I create these bangs
how I create my bangs all the time when
I do one base on my channel I actually
have a bang video that I did with super
big curly hair and I usually never do
bangs with super big curly hair and I
ended up doing bangs that time with
super big curly hair and it turned out
so horrific that I couldn't believe that
I actually ended up putting that video
up on my channel but it was cool because
I end up pinning today some of the hair
back and getting like the sparse kind of
things that I ended up that I really
like but this style of bangs this is how
I do my bangs all the time with body
wave hair loose wave hair straight hair
or anything like that when I am wanting
bangs for myself so to get it really
sparse and very like natural-looking
I actually just create a little small
triangle for myself and then I just bump
the hair under and call it a day
I do the small triangle because if you
end up trying to take a whole bunch of
your hair like you like this part over
here this part over here and then trying
to snip your bangs when you after
holding it and letting your hair loose
after cutting it it's going to be so
wide you're going to have to deal with
trying to bump bangs all the way over
here and then when you want your hair
down it's going to be like all the way
back here but your bangs are going to be
all the way right here it's a hot
miss if you guys like your bangs like
that I'm sorry but I don't personally
and it's just about how people like
rocking their bangs so I don't judge but
those kind of Nicki Minaj bangs and blac
Chyna bangs they just don't work for me
I love that type of hairstyle on them
but I just can't do it for myself anyway
so if you guys are interested to see how
I created these bangs I'll list that
video in the description box below
because I did a previous video for
Wiccans hair and that sharing with you
guys how I cut these bangs so once again
that would be in the description box
below and you can check that out and I
also want to say after creating the
small triangle if you feel like you can
add a little bit more hair just part
your hair and like a bigger triangle
take a really small section and then
pull it towards you inside of your bangs
that you already created yourself and be
like okay do I want this much hair in
there or not and then take a little bit
more of a smaller piece and then just
cut it into that and then you'll get
your bangs will be a little bit more
fuller because in that previous video
you see that my triangle is really like
tiny and then like right now if I pull
the bangs the triangle isn't there
anymore and it's because I added a few
more like pieces like around here into
the bang so it won't be so sparse but
still it looks really natural looking
and this is the look that I go for when
I want bangs so if you guys get what I'm
saying like just gradually add a little
bit more hair in your bangs if you feel
like it's not as fold as you want it do
that this hair is so frickin flawless
like mmm perfect perfect perfect perfect
now when it comes to 360 frontals
because like you guys know I got a 360
frontal from this company um I got two
bundles and I asked for two bundles
because dealing with 360 frontals you
want the same density as your frontal
you don't want your bundles to be like
overpowering your frontal because it can
it can look really bulky and crazy at
the top because you have so much you
have so many of your bundles in and it
just doesn't look really like natural
looking so when you do your 360 frontals
you want to be able to do this to your
hair and
things look really natural looking and
really flat now I decided to put four
bundles with a 360 frontal I would look
crazy because when I turned to the side
this will be all bulky and big and my
head would look like this versus like if
I do this it looks really flat and yeah
so just be aware of that okay so I'm
going to try to explain to you guys what
I was talking about like adding like a
little small piece of hair in your bangs
if you feel like um if you feel like
your bangs need to be a little bit more
fuller or if you feel like you have too
much of a gap over here like I feel like
like my brow should be covered a little
bit more over here so I'm going to take
this piece right use my nail and this
piece already has like a triangle form
in it I'm going to use my nail and bring
some of this hair over and if you guys
pull the bangs apart we'll pull the hair
the amount of hair that you grabbed
apart and be like okay so when I cut
into this this is going to go this far
over here but it's not going to be super
dramatic so what I'm going to do is pull
down my Banga I've already created for
myself and it's going to stop right here
and then I'm going to have to go and get
my scissors because I don't have them
fit more too so just use your nail or
use a comb I like using my nail because
sometimes it just makes it a little bit
more sharper or I probably just made
that up because I don't have my comb
near me
anyway so this is how much hair so if I
spread it apart it's still gonna be a
good amount I feel like the other part
was going to be too into this area right
here so okay now pull this hair down and
then cut I get wider so let's make sure
I'm going to cut into it a little bit
more
I'm going to take this curling iron that
under a little bit and we out
alright baby though so this is why I
love Wiggins hair so freakin much I
think it's super soft this hair super
soft I don't get any shedding napping or
tingling or anything like that
I love how nice and soft this hair is
because of course my bangs are as nice
soft and airy and fluffy as the actual
hair so it just makes my hair look a
little more natural looking and when I
go out on this thing people think this
is actually my hair so I always love
that because I can just be like no girl
this is actually a wig if I want to tell
you this wig this hair does hold an
awesome curl I actually did curl this
hair before and it's really nice it's
very lightweight guys and it's so
freakin pretty I ended up chopping the
hair at the ends because I felt like it
did need a little bit of a trim not so
much but still something to make the
hair look a little bit more thicker and
fuller I'll leave all their information
in the description box below if you're
interested thank you so much for
watching ladies and I'll see you guys in
my next video bye and Happy Holidays I
hope you guys have an awesome
