back with another video today I'm going
to be sharing with you guys my IR hair I
do have two bundles of 24 inch in a
frontal to match all the links for this
hair will be listed in the description
box below but so far so good
I'm not receiving falcinelli me maybe
any tingling give me about two more
weeks with this hair because I've had it
in for like a week and some change but I
really really wanted to get them on and
show you guys how I want to style his
hair so I'm going to be taking a lot of
pictures tonight but though you guys are
props going to ask me a lot of questions
about it
I have not curled this hair yet all of
this is just my bomb a flare drop that I
did by myself so I'm really really
excited about it because when I curl it
I know it's going to live ten times
better and I think I'm going to be
adding flexi rods into the hair today I
went with a deep side part Conda was not
that deep but just deep enough for me
cuz I don't really like having my hair
in my face like this but the fact of the
bangs are layered like this it makes it
a lot easier not like it strands of hair
just all you know in my face it's more
so like in a uniform still and it's just
like loops over and it's really really
nice so I'll probably end up doing my
hair in the style again on some
different hair just like to show you
guys my layer technique for it but other
than that I don't think I really have
anything else to say
I will give you guys an update video I
our hair so I'll let you know or if like
I said it's only been a week and some
change so just give me some more time if
you work with this hair company before
and let me know this is a hair they told
me and I'm really receiving nothing but
flawless that's going on it's really
nice and luster it's not giving you like
a Barbie doll fill and yeah so I love
you babies and let's begin this curling
process using my one and a half inch
Revlon curling iron today and I promise
I'll throw in some flexi rods towards
the end just all the hair can hold a
longer lasting curl because I am going
to be dancing tonight no I'm not wearing
this
he's just in that much coma
skies so don't leave the bangs alone
right now and I'm just going to focus on
the bottom half of my hair I told you
guys this is 24 inch so I'm not
expecting it to like so I'm not
expecting the curl to fall but maybe if
we turn on the flatter
we can get somewhere a little faster I'm
going to put this all the way up to 30
you guys let me know about the chi or
the blitz flattery whatever you guys
want to call that Flatiron let me know
if you guys have a curling iron I have a
long pro video I definitely need to
check it out because it's a really good
long curl tutorial and I think you guys
will love it so yeah so I'm going to
come back when this is actually hot so
my camera won't die and I'll see you
guys in a second all right baby love so
yes we're going to start with the bottom
half of the hair and we're going to
leave the bangs alone for right now now
just curling the hair under with my
curling iron and then I'm going to flexi
rod the hair very simple I spot the hair
because hexans weird distinct smell when
I put the heat on it and I'm gonna lose
because I kept the combing are really
really high or 425 but day two I curled
it again just to see if I had the same
smell but I did not receive the smell so
if you have an awkward smell with IR
hair before let me know in the comment
section below but you can start seeing
that the the flexi rod and the curling
process starts getting a little wonky in
this video and that's because the hair
was so hot in my hand like I could until
I couldn't flexing on it anymore just
because it was burning the out of
my hands so I was trying to focus on the
bottom half as much as possible because
that's the longest length and you don't
want to lose your curl throughout the
night because it will eventually fall if
you're going to go out and dance like I
was this day so yeah so I'm just going
to let you guys enjoyed the rest of the
video take the curls down and I'll talk
to you guys towards the end I love you
Oh
and somewhere we could get away if you
want another play just to be with never
leave a child
thank you anyway you
lazy like and I remember you out of the
darkness into the sky early night summer
we could get away if you want find
another place if you would never leave a
chain Thank You anywhere you
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
I'm not shying all sorry for the
reckless my hair with the hair restoring
a high half the time that I couldn't
keep it all on the flexi rod so yeah I'm
sorry about that but it was wretched but
it look it turned out really good these
layers are definitely part of the reason
honey so these layers will be up so on I
hope you guys enjoy the video let me
know what you work with I our hair beat
so I love you too bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
