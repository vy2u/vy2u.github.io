actually lifted this hair and also dyed
it to achieve this color so don't think
it came like this but this is their
Brazilian straight hair and I've
reviewed a couple of other textures from
his hair company so if you are
interested I will link those videos in
the description box below so you can
check them out guys yes I am orange for
now you guys know I always change up my
hair but if you are interested to see
how I got this you know simple glam look
I will leave it I will leave it let's
continue to watch I love you bye my
Clinique beyond perfecting foundation in
the shade golden I believe this is
golden I'm gonna also takes some NARS
creamy concealer underneath my eyes I
drag my concealer down pretty far to
conceal and to highlight at the same
time so you don't have to drag yours
down this far but that's what I do
I'm gonna take my morphe 439 brush to
stipple over my foundation in and make
sure there's no harsh lines and then I'm
also gonna take my Beauty Blender to
blend out my concealer because I like
that looking really seamless and
flawless and yeah so that's what I'll be
doing for about two minutes
by the way if you see me talking a lot
in this video it's actually supposed to
be a chitchat but I lost the audio to
this video so you're stuck with this
basic ass voice over
I'm gonna go in with my NW 50 concealer
from mac to bring some color back in my
face as well as the contour and chills
with my nose out a little bit and I'm
gonna go in with my micro smooth powder
from Sephora and I'm just gonna use that
to just set my face because this
foundation does seem to look a little
bit oily if I do not set it but that's
with any foundation that I use so I'm
not really trippin on the BET but you
definitely should set this if you are
oily or if you have combination skin
I'm gonna take my NYX stay matte but not
flat golden powder - pretty much use
this as a bronzer just to bring some
color back into my face you know to set
my contour areas I'm gonna do is take my
Laura Mercier powder I set my under eyes
so my concealer won't crease as well as
underneath my jaw line just so I can get
a more slimmer face because this day I
was looking real bit but I'm gonna take
that golden powder also on my lids just
to you know give me some color I'm gonna
take this NYX brow pencil to fill in my
brows
anyway I'm going to use this elf liquid
liner to create this wing
Oh what about highlighter I believe it
is and it's in the shade crown of my
canopy and I'm just gonna take a little
bit of that one the high points of my
cheeks down the bridge of my nose and
also on the inner tear-duct of my eye
and I use what is this naturally
transform cork liner and a clear lip
gloss to create this lip I'm just going
to straighten my hair today I'm nothing
too crazy this hair is already straight
but I just want to let you guys know
that to get a full look I definitely was
saying you need about four bundles and
the reason why I say four bundles is
because three bundles you're pushing it
because for some reason they're shorter
lengths are as thin as you know long
hair and if you were trying to only get
two bundles of juice or hair it
definitely won't work for you I
definitely recommend you guys getting
four bundles but other than that the
hair is pretty soft really nice flow and
I like it as you can see it lifts really
well it took color really well and yeah
so I'll see you guys in my next video
all their information will be linked in
the description box below I love you
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you sir</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
