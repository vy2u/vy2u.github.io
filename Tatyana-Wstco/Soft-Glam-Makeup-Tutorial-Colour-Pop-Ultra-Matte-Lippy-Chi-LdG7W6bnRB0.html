makeup tutorial not sure where I'm gonna
be calling this eye look but let's begin
so I'm gonna be starting with oatmeal
tan above my crease to start with this
transitioning color or its transitioning
shade then I'm going to take my X jumbo
milk pencil and I'm going to blend that
all over my lids just sent into five
this shade that I'm going to be applying
in a second and it's from Coastal Scents
and it's called fool's gold it's super
pretty really love it it's like a baby
puke color and I'm all for baby puke
you're gonna be seeing me laugh or act
crazy throughout this whole video
because I was talking to my friend hi
Carla
she is dope she always makes me laugh
and every time I do my makeup I try to
call her because she just gets my mind
off the thing so I love her shout out to
use the Chi yes I'm gonna be working
that in my crease pretty much all over
my lid blending blending cuz I'm only
using like three shades so ole miss Han
was goat and I'm gonna be using golden
avocado huginn and this I love and all
these shadows are from Coastal Scents
I'm so annoying
I can't yeah and I'm gonna be blending
that out going between two blending
brushes a more dense one and a more
fluffy one and I'm gonna be working that
all throughout my lids and that's
literally all that I'm going to be doing
and then I'll come back and talk to you
guys when I'm applying golden avocado on
my lid
all right so we're about to open oh I'm
not applying that I'm still blending
still blending you can go back with
oatmeal tan and like help you blend out
the harsh lines and the folds gold
shadow
okay so now I will be applying the
golden avocado a golden avocado love
this shade it's like a gold but it has
green reflex and it's really pretty in
this month favorite shade ever so yeah
packing that on the lids you can apply
some fix+
or some water so it's into five this
shade and I'm going to be working that
on top of my lid and then blowing that
out with fool's gold again just so I
won't have any harsh lines
so unfortunately I lost my clip where I
was putting this runner on but I'm using
my Maybelline eye studio blackest black
gel liner and now I'm going in with my
airspun powder I know I look crazy but
this powder is amazing it helps me not
have any creasing underneath my eye
after all that concealer and stuff that
I usually apply and I'm just working it
on my chin around my nose my forehead
underneath my eye so I'm going to be
applying some of bubbly and dripping
gold on my nose and that's from the a BH
that glow kit and I'm gonna be applying
the same colors on my brow bone and now
I'm gonna be dusting that pattern off of
my face and it you need to make sure you
really dust this off if you do want to
use this in your about my skin
complexion because it can cause
flashback if you do not dust it all the
way off and after dusting it off I go
over it I go over it with my mineralized
skin finish from Mac and the shade dark
deep just so I can make sure I cancel
all of that like white mists out of me
so yeah I'm gonna be applying some of
that highlighter in the inner of my eye
inner corners for my tear ducts whatever
you want to call that and then I'm using
the same shades that I used on my lids
underneath to cause that gradient effect
false coat and go to an avocado again
underneath the eyes and now I'm gonna be
lining my lips with medium brown Jordana
lip pencil clearly you know I love this
lip pencil because I've been using it
like crazy and now I'm using chi from
colour-pop love this I'll be making a
video of my
new color pop the bees because I love
them so freakin much and now I'm going
to take George in ismene and brown again
just to outline that and make sure you
smudge it out or blend it out I didn't
lend it out too good in this video now I
just applied some Urban Decay oil
control I don't even know why I got this
I just bought it just to buy it I should
have brought some of the Smashbox
setting spray and now I'm taking that
gel liner and putting it in my waterline
and now I am making sure I put some of
my face powder on my face to get the
color back in my face I'm posing and I
hope you guys enjoyed this blood thank
you so much for watching us see you guys
in my next video
love you bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
