gonna be showing you guys how I got this
look I actually did this video on
Instagram live or did this book on
Instagram live with you guys so you guys
might have seen it on there but I told
you guys I will have all the information
in the video so here I am I'm using my
Tarte shaped ape concealer and I believe
this is in deep and I'm just putting out
any of my eyes are already like color
corrected with my orange concealer from
la girl Pro concealer so if my face
looks a little orange that's why I also
wanted to go in with my Estee Lauder doe
foundation but I forgot that's why I was
like oh
so I just ended up using my Lancome
foundation in 460 suede I'm going to
have to go up to 470 I believe but you
know I was able to tweak it just a
little bit because you know I am a
little darker because of the summertime
springtime whatever you want to say so
yeah so I'm just gonna simple that all
over my face and we're gonna go in with
some more concealer and of course
contouring with my anastacio expresso no
yeah I think this is the shade walnut
yeah
it's their foundation stick and I'm just
using that to cream contour so just
watch me blend this out because you know
it's really important to make sure
there's no line demarcation or anything
like that going on I do have lash
extension so I'm sure the title of this
video is gonna be like how I do my
makeup with lash extensions something
like that because it's really difficult
honestly but I really really like how my
lashes turned out so I'm here for it but
yeah so just the typical typical
situation you guys haven't seen me use
my foundation all over my face in a
while but I wanted to because I know
that I really really love this
foundation and it always looks really
flawless on my face so I didn't mind
plating this foundation all over my face
so yeah but really simple if you guys
have a favorite foundation let me know
in the comments section below I'm always
looking forward to trying new
foundations I will end up doing the
Estee Lauder Dell foundation tutorial
with you guys because that's my first
time ever
that Foundation and I heard I heard a
lot of positive things about it so I'm
excited to like show you guys you know
how it is for me like what do I think
about it and I will leave you know the
information in that video too the color
that I actually got matched to so as you
can see I'm just contouring my nose and
just highlight it a little bit more and
I'm using the same Beauty Blender just
to blend out my face and my contour and
this just makes sure like the you know
color is you know kind of comes back to
my face and nothing is just flat
contouring is just about adding
dimension and squeezing things in to
make it look tighter or you know wider
or whatever your type of thing is when
you do contour and highlight so you know
it wouldn't be a tutorial if I didn't
add a little bit more concealer so I'm
just going to conceal again and I'm also
going to use my Laura Mercier powder to
set my under eyes and a set around my
mouth I am combination skin so I do have
to set my makeup I don't like sitting
all over my face with the Laura Mercier
powder but I like just doing underneath
the eyes around the mouth those are the
areas that gets the most oily so I just
kind of feel like I need to put extra
powder on it I do want to do the Jacke
on a method that she uses powder
underneath her foundation just to see
how well it will work for me personally
so I think I might end up doing like the
jacket on a tutorial whatever you know
that little thing that was going around
YouTube so trying to trying to
follow somebody else's tutorial so if
you guys have any other suggestions you
guys want me to do for that type of
video let me know in the comment section
below because it's about doing other
things with my channel I don't want to
just you know bore you guys with the
same stuff so yeah and if you guys were
interested this hair is from Dease or
hair this is their loose wave I did cut
it it didn't need to be cut but I didn't
really know what I wanted to do with
this hair I felt like I have so much
loose wave you know that I just kind of
wanted this short but it actually came
24 inches and I cut it up to probably
like 20 inches but what I just used on
my face was my makeup revolution drops
in the shade gold and ice just to give
me like a more inner glow before I go in
with all this powder and of course I'm
going on top
with a powder highlight towards the end
I went with I went in with my Laura
Mercier powder and mixed it with my
Sephora micro smooth powder and this is
just to set the rest of my face I'm also
gonna go in with my Sephora like Sun
bronzed kit and I'm just using one of
those shades just to pretty much bronze
on my face I mean I'm here for it
because I feel like it gives like this
like really like natural looking like
bronzy look to my skin but it's
something about it after like it's a
little bit too red and it kind of like
reminds me of blush and I really hate
blush on my face but you know after I
set my face I feel like it all like you
know just melts into my skin it looks
really really healthy so I'm not mad at
it but I just have to you know wait for
the finished product for me so as you
can see I was like all up close and
personal to you guys just let you guys
see how it looks and to also make sure
that there was no like line demarcation
with my neck and from that because I am
two different shades to be honest with
you guys and it's so hard for me to find
the perfect foundation shade for me
especially when I'm in between like my
summer my you know summer shade and my
winter shade I went in with artist
couture and I also went in with this
Becca highlighting palette palette I
will list it in the description box
below because I don't know it off the
top of my head so yeah and I just used
that same bronzer just to put underneath
my eyes and on top of my lids but I used
some of my foundation just to cover all
of my hyperpigmentation on my eyes so
yeah I'm just gonna waterline I'm using
my wet and wild nude pencil and I'm
gonna go in with my mary kay mascara for
my bottom lashes and of course i don't
need any for my top because i have lash
extensions so really really simple i'm
gonna go in with quark and i'm also
gonna go and I'm gonna go in with court
and I'm also gonna go in with naturally
transformed in a clear lip gloss you
guys know that this has been my favorite
lip combination I just have been really
born with my lips and I just don't know
why I really feel like this is just my
favorite favorite so why would I switch
it up you know it is what it is don't be
mad at me but I'll try something new so
I promise I have so many lip shades but
I think I'm just getting comfortable
with this one
so yeah so I'm just like decided that I
wanted to wet D saw his hair just to you
know give it some more body or whatever
or bring the curls back to life or the
wave back to life now this hair super
super soft so I dyed it jet-black and I
just love this hair the only thing about
the situation is I ended up having a
closure in my package I didn't want a
closure I wanted to the frontal I don't
like closures at all like I hate them
with a passion because I make wigs for
myself so it's like sometimes I like
doing stuff like this and I feel like I
can't flip my hair over because like
it's just a closure like so if you're
into like weave and you wonder if you
should get a closure or frontal I will
always say get it a frontal because it
just makes more sense but I just added
some Aussie leave-in conditioner spray
in it and I just wet it just a little
bit with some water and that's pretty
much it glasses from a mall kiosk I
actually got it no actually I got these
glasses from our beauty supply store
it's a black-owned beauty supply store
at that so I was here for it I bought
three shades from there but anyway I
love you guys thank you so much for
watching and I will see you babies in my
next video all the products will be
listed in the description box below
my time I have to be catching niggas ie
is that kept mean you guys can't get
lipstick on my life is our passion
see I shouldn't have been I'm a ninny
humming you come here man no penny
brothers out the airplane when they
up but my brother
hey blow on this necklace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
