video today I have my soft feels hair
and this is an Aliexpress hair company
and I'm so excited because this is some
Brazilian kinky curly hair texture from
this hair company and this is the first
time I did not have to add any product
to a frontal because I needed it to
match the bundles okay
get frontals and closures because we
want it to be as low maintenance as
possible we don't want to have to go and
find a product to make some damn curly
hair that's supposed to be curly curly
that doesn't even make any sense because
this company doesn't have that issue
that's a gym and so even if you have
some curly bundles at home that you feel
like this frontal would match please
feel free just to purchase the frontal
in the closure or both or just one you
know what I'm saying so girl I'm excited
as you can see so let me bring it back
down what I did to the hair so far I
made a unit out of this it's me so good
I didn't even have to go in with my
salon graphics hairspray so that's a pat
on the back for me we definitely have to
pet soft Phil's hair for the great
quality on this unit because clearly I
couldn't have done it without them but I
also did with this hair is add some
Brown highlights in it you can kind of
see it I hope you can see it I didn't
really go so much towards the bottom
with that color just because I'm
business bang so because it said soft
Phil's hair I was definitely having high
expectations for this hair company just
because it says soft feels hair so when
I feel that a bit abuse off so trust me
they met that expectation honey so I
know when I go in and blow this hair out
with a blow dryer and straighten it it's
going to look so freaking good just
because it's that perfect density - it's
not that heavy hair and that's probably
because I don't think I've three bundles
but at the same time you know how
sometimes three bundles can just look
really really just outrageous definitely
getting more hair in 20 inch of bundles
than you would longer lengths and
sometimes the hair can just be too too
much I do want to say I did have some of
the hair left I do remember that I
pretty much left this long of a weft out
of this hair just because I felt like if
I put that in here it would have been
outrageous and I feel like this is
definitely a perfect density for this
type of unit you have to co wash curly
hair I mentioned in a ton of my past
like reviews for companies that I feel
like co-washing hair is so important
before you install the hair reason why I
said is
because you want to get its natural
texture honey you don't want to go in
get an installation and then when you
wash the hair it's not even the
patterning that you're looking for
there's a problem with it there's a foul
smell that's going on with the hair you
don't want to deal with any of that
honey like you want to make sure you're
getting what you want getting what you
pay for and by co-washing the hair
you're definitely going to see that
socco watching is watching the hair with
conditioner you don't have to do that if
you don't want to I'm trying to give you
all of the nooks and crannies that you
need to know before purchasing the hair
and if you do purchase the hair this is
what you also need to do before
installing it because if you see a
problem after installing it it's in your
head what are you going to do you can't
do anything other than take that
out of your hair and be upset that she
wasted your money because if you already
installed it you cut it you got it you
bleached it you did all of this and
they're gonna say it's your
careful how much you bleach aliexpress
hair just because the quality can save
virgin hair but who knows really what
this hair is like I definitely feel like
the reason why I do these type of videos
is to share the gems that I have
received on Aliexpress because there are
some hidden gems in a huge world of hair
vendors on Aliexpress and certain ones
are just garbage to be honest with you
guys and once again this company whole
name is softails hair so I was just like
okay honey your hair is soft I mean see
if it's soft let me make sure it's soft
hair because I don't want you know my
viewers who be getting gypped for their
money ratings are so important don't go
on ratings and just be like oh I see 4.9
stars so this hair has to be good don't
do that click that damn I was already in
the ratings that's a lot was struggling
that don't just look at this right here
Aliexpress shopper it says Canada and it
gave it five stars doctor just being a
damn Aliexpress vendor finding or making
a random
and just going to put positive reviews
underneath it once again I'm not saying
soft Phil's hair and does this I'm
letting you know T about Aliexpress make
sure you hit that view more and keep
going down until you feel like you know
you start seeing some real humans with
real positive reviews and with pictures
because I feel like pictures are so
important once again they have tons of
positive reviews for this actual hair
company so I just wanted to make sure it
was truthful it's a lot of reviews then
just have the flag and just like ratings
like 5 stars without saying anything
but you know you keep scrolling and you
see girls that's taking pictures of
their hair and saying that they received
nothing but positive things from this
hair since installing the hair is also
installed
don't fight go off I'm just bringing
somebody with the pack of hair and being
like when the hair is still in the
wrapper and they're trying to stay it's
good like how you know it's good you
know but people do reviews based off of
different things like they do a review
because they received the hair and
they're thankful for receiving it
they're thankful that they received it
in a timely manner once again they're
having an amazing sale going on on this
website so you get fifty six percent off
whoa can't be bad oh yeah looks they
have two-tone kind of vibe going on they
have all kinds of nice virgin hair on
here I see that they even have units on
here so girl you better get you a pre
plug in it before it's cool so if you're
looking for a really nice affordable
hair please take the time out to
definitely check out soft feels hair
they have wigs they have 360 frontals
lace frontals closures all that good
stuff so definitely check it out you're
getting a hot deal of 90
point-8 positive feedback on this
Aliexpress vendors site so soft Dale
hair factory store doesn't want to see
anything different with this hair like I
said I plan on blowing it out
straightening it just to see how I love
you know if you guys want to see that
