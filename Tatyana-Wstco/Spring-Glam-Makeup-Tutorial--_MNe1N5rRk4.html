another video today I'm gonna be showing
you guys this makeup look so I'm just
going to get right into what I'm doing I
already color corrected that's why you
see the orange of my face I use la girl
Pro concealer orange color correcting
and then I'm using my Allegro Pro
concealer and fawn and I'm also going in
with my Anastasia
no this is yea Anastasio walnut shade in
their foundation their foundation stick
and I'm using that's a contour and I use
my milk foundation I think it's like
golden almond or something like that I
will listen in the description box below
this was my first time using this that's
why I decided to record this video just
to test this out to see how it will work
and I really do like it but I am
combination skin so I do get oily like
you know by like the center of my face
and also like around my mouth area so
just be careful if you are a combination
skin you will have to set this
foundation I just like using my Laura
Mercier they said it but I still seen
that it was seeping through so you know
this might not be for the oily girls but
if you are normal or even if you're dry
I feel like this will work for you but
it's a really flawless looking
foundation I really really love it so
yeah I'm just gonna blend all of that in
and I'm gonna use my Beauty Blender just
to blend out the concealer and then I
think that's pretty much it and I'm
gonna go in with my Laura Mercier powder
and set my under eye and I'm also gonna
blend out back contour my nose of course
and yeah so just watch this you guys
know same same things I'd be doing but I
just decided to show you guys this
because I'm using a new foundation like
I said so we're gonna start this I look
really soon I do want to let you guys
know that I prepped using the Mac soft
ochre Paint Pot and I use that to
basically enhance the eyeshadows and I
end up carving out my eyelid using my la
girl Pro concealer so you'll see that
but let's get it
so I used my Mac mineralized skinfinish
powder because I didn't felt like the
laura mercier wasn't gonna do enough but
I mixed the two together it still didn't
make it as like you know mad as I wanted
it to but yeah it's just still a little
bit too oily for me so I don't know I
don't know but yeah I just are use this
for Sun bronze palette I will list in
the description box below I use one of
the shades in that palette just to like
chisel out my cheeks a little bit and
I'm gonna go in with my Laura Mercier
powder just to step underneath my
cheekbones so I can get like a shark
contour or you know so my thanks since
I've been going to the gym I should be
able to stop doing this really soon but
anyway I'm gonna go and with soft ochre
Paint Pot like I said and then use a
nude like shadow just to set that and
I'm also gonna go in with this like Coco
berry shade so like start this
transition look and also just to bring
in my nose contour and my you know all
that snatch that was together all abouts
oh yeah I believe this is either from
Coastal Scents or makeup geek you can we
check out both sites because I created
this palette maybe like two years ago
for myself and I hot-glued them down to
this Mac palette it wasn't a magnet
palette so I don't even know what the
names are on these shadows anymore so
same palette that I created for myself
I'm winning with like this brick red
shade and I'm just going to pop that in
my crease and I'm also gonna go in with
my Smashbox rainbow palette I don't know
what this exactly is called but you know
what I'm talking about all the colors of
the rainbow are in this palette i'm just
using red to enhance that maroon shade
girl you know and brushes are important
okay I get one of my brushes from
morphine okay so I've been having these
brushes for two years so just you know
squares are there brushes a little bit
because it
really makes a difference on your eyes
blending brush blending brushes are
really important and Packer brushes and
no shadow brushes and you just don't
want to have to keep buying it's my
cheap ones over and over again because
they fell apart or you have like makeup
brush brush little hairs all over your
makes your face because you know they're
cheap or something like that so just you
know save up your money and get some
good brushes because like I said I've
been having these for a really really
long time I'm gonna go in with carving
my lids out using my la girl Pro
concealer now I have hooded eyes so I
feel like I have to do this because my
little baby lid ain't enough for me so
yeah I gotta make sure you know you guys
can see what's on my lids so I'm gonna
go back with my Smashbox palette and I'm
just gonna use that red again just to
you know hit the outer V's of my eye so
that sharp line and simply there anymore
and I'm gonna go in with my Jaclyn hill
palette and I'm trying to use like this
maroon shade in the palette I would try
to list it in the description box below
and I'm gonna go back and forth between
a blending brush and a more dense Packer
brush and this is just going to
intensify the shade and also keep it in
the place that she wanted the most
because of the shape of this brush
I'll put try to mix all the brushes in
the description box below but you know
it's a little wasting butter I'll try I
promise anyway this is the jewel waver
palette don't get me trying to pronounce
her damn name and I just used like this
this like new shade but it was mad white
like I felt like I look sick so I ended
up putting like some of my highlighter
in between the maroon shade and the
white and it gave off like this lavender
shade so I was real cool with that
because I felt like my eye was missing
something I feel like it was missing
like some shimmer so I ended up doing
all the same steps at the bottom of my
you know my eye and tied everything
together with some lashes and some white
liner put on a clear lip gloss and
you know did my hair for you guys and
that's pretty much it I will try to list
everything in the description box below
I used naturally transforming my lips
with downtown beauty lip liner and a
clear lip gloss I really didn't care for
it
but I feel like I'm so much going on on
my eyes could do anything both on my
lips that's pretty much it babes I hope
you guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
