now this is Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and
I'm using my e27 brush to prime my lids
and it's just make sure that your
shadows are going to be vibrant and last
longer throughout the day for a while
now so take foxy from the Naked 2
palette in a pretty much place in this
right on top of that primary when I go
to blend out the other shadows but I'm
going to use today it's going to be
really easy for me to blend them just
going to be patient I'm going to grab my
start Pro palette color right here it
kind of looks like a hot pink and it's
in the shade mod and I'm going to use
that to press above my lid into my
crease and a little bit above the crease
area pressing it before blending it out
so you can have as much pigment that it
can offer on my lids
Oh going in with this pencil brush using
mod just to help in terms of five does
color a little bit more
I'm going to take this 441 brush just to
blend out any harsh lines that may be
going on up in here and I'm going to go
in with some of this Paint Pot again
using my finger and I'm going to press
it on my lid and I'm going to create a
new crease for me basically with the
help of this little eye pencil I'm
pretty much using it as if it was the
jumbo pencil
my kat von d palette in the middle mess
I'm going to use this pinky peach shade
for my lid I'm going to take the 408
brush from morphe grab some of that and
press it onto the lid not dragging up
not not dragging it at all pretty much
pressing it in first
are you Ultima ha open my heart
into you oh come on baby
object this is another NYX liner and
visit petal and you can get this from
Ulta and this end of pink one and I'm
going to use this cheap create a line
from NYX glitter glue and I'm going to
use this really tiny brush actually I
think this is a liner brush that came
with the L'Oreal liquid gel no gel liner
mining right underneath that pink line
that I made
six different litters and yeah six
different letters and I'm going to take
this white one bite reflex green so I
want to take a little bit of that using
the same brush and I'm going to press it
into that glitter glue to take an ice
cream from makeup geek and I'm taking it
put it right in my brow bone area so get
a really pretty highlighted effects gone
and this helps tie the look together as
well as lift your brow a little bit
you can be mentioned him I have to be
like my first eyeshadow palette that my
mom bought me ever in life and this is
the two eggs
Lux pearl fusion shadow and I'm going to
add that on my brow highlight so it can
pop a little bit more Lee Briana this
one that's what I'm putting on top of
ice cream please this is a super old Mac
lipstick that I thought was so pop in
back in the day if you guys want and how
I did mine make makeup and you guys
wonder how I did my makeup back in high
school video thumbs up this video and
let me know in the comments section
below so hilarious this brings back so
many memories and Nicki Minaj Viva Glam
I'm lining it with this brown I don't
really know what the name of this is
just as brown and it says the lip pencil
yeah this is better than cork cork is
kind of too Brown for this look

on the flat side and pretty much gives
me this glove
