caramel and cappuccino depending on how
many drops you apply to your face is
going to determine if you're going to be
the sheer coverage or a full coverage if
you guys are interested I picked mine up
from Sephora so that's before I'm sorry
okay so yeah so I'm going to take the
shade cappuccino first okay so those are
my four drops one two and then it's
going to be the fourth no rights mirror
for that side and then I want to take
care of Mel and I try to keep it in the
center because I don't want it I don't
want no to be really light around the
perimeter of my face hella crazy I'm
going to grab my morphe 439 brush and
this on both look my phone already just
started this video guys it's Dibble it
all over my face I'm going to try to mix
the two shapes together while stippling
it and then of course put it on my
forehead when I get the color the
desired color kind of look
I'm going to take to conceal is now warm
honey and fawn from la girl Pro
concealer using my finger to apply this
this is a tarp do you find I'm going to
take the tip to blend out the concealer
all right maybe lab so now that that is
blended out my NW 50 concealer from
Magnus just to darken up the hollows of
my cheeks to give me that chiseled look
and I'm going to go in with a buffing
brush and pretty much live that upwards
I'm just going to take it down the sides
of my jaw line and just to give the
shout-out or the appearance as a you
know box base with a little bit more
slimmer because this is will contour is
a heart-shaped Cape concealer as well
just to brighten me up a little bit more
and I've put a little bit of that fog
concealer above that I'm going to set my
face with Laura Mercier powder the
translucent powder and you can of course
mix the powder to get your desired color
that you really want I mix it with this
cheesy yellow HD product a generous
amount of this product and looking up
and then I'm also want to pinch my nose
to set the rest of my face using be true
match lendable foundation powder in in
seven and I'm going to pretty much press
it right in this area right here
and this is just to set the foundation
before I go in and set my contour area
card school with the Black Radiance
light to medium contour palette and
taking these two shades on the right and
this is to also bring color back into my
face and to send that concealer /
contour shades that I use the NW 54 Mac
this is to set that as well and to
deepen that color up somehow i down the
bridge of my nose really quick using the
naked half-baked shade in the naked 1 or
naked 2 palette and I'm just going to go
down the bridge of my nose with this
eyeshadow creating a pitch no suspect
now I'm going to start with my eye look
pray for me because I don't tell me what
I'm going to be going today I'm going to
take my e27 brush from morphe and mex
soft ochre a little bit goes a long way
with this product and discipline to make
your shadows a lot more vibrant and last
a lot longer throughout the day without
getting dull and crusty looking I'm
going to take a shade that matches that
pink pot this is just to ensure that my
eyeshadows are a lot easier to blend out
when I am blending them I'm going to
grab classics from the tart pro palette
to set that primer
I'm a girl
no Coco bear I think this is Coco bear
this is from either Coastal Scents or
makeup geek let's put this in my
transition area this is the m16 9 brush
from morphe want to blend that out using
b4 for one from morphe I'm going to go
in with whimsy now and pretty much apply
that in the same area and blend that out
using a smaller blending brush and this
is the 5 for 1 brush from morphe I'm
going to go in with the 4 3 2 1 brush
for grabbing edgy from the Tarte palette
blend this out using that same smaller
blending brush brushes I was using for
those brighter tones the drags that
whatever is left over on the brush
underneath my lash line we're going to
take edgy and tap into my lash line of
blue I'm going to use a four three nine
and this brushes looks like a straight
line flat brush and I'm going to press
that closer into my waterline teddy I
call from Max and avoid my waterline
with that I applied some more of edgy on
the center of my lid so I believed in
Silas's complete home actually from
lugging it a lot and I'm going to the
straightest powder on the side of my
nose by pressing it into my skin it's
not swiping because I feel like swiping
just leaves me looking really patchy and
then when it gets down to here that's
when I kind of like it I'm going to rub
her so I can blend into my you know
bronzer blush is the telescopic Solorio
mascara blackest black want to grab some
of my luminizing drop naturally you
should be glowing all the freaking time
I'm going to go in with that glow kit
from Anna Sophia and I'm going to take
bubbly and driven gold I'm going to go
in with this color right here this is
1628 from teen color I'm going to go in
with Orcs lip liner to line my lips I
think I want to make this into a glossy
lip I don't want it met so I'm going to
apply some lip gloss on top of this

will be right back I hope you guys are
