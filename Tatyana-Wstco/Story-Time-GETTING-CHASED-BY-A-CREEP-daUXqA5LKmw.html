video and today's gonna be a story time
video and it's gonna be about the time
that I got chased out of the mall
recently so literally this happened
maybe like two to three weeks ago so I
was in the mall one day and I actually
had to go and get my computer fixed
because I thought I had a virus she says
Geek Squad she didn't listen to them
but anyway coming to find out that
wasn't the case but let me slow this
thing down and give you guys some
details so it's around maybe like 7:30
and I could sue the Apple store around 8
o'clock so it's a 45-minute wait the
mall closes at 9:00 so I'm just like ok
cool like I'll be in there and I'll get
my so you know problem solved so the guy
Oh disclaimer I am NOT naked I do have a
whole top one so don't think that I'm
naked and so I'm sitting in the Apple
Store and time is going by coming formed
by and then I don't know I don't know
where this guy decides that he wants to
come up to me and ask me if anybody was
sitting next to me my table is pretty
full I'm my clothes Luigi nice bar where
I would actually have to go to to sit
and talk to a boy advisor about my
computer so it's really not enough space
for him he can go somewhere else
honestly but he I guess just wants to
sit next to me so he's like is anybody
sitting here and I was like no actually
it's not but like I tell you guys there
was an Apple advisor in front of me with
a whole bunch of stuff and whatever so I
grabbed his chair and I moved it over
like a closer to me but I scooped myself
all the way over to the other side
basically and I was like putting myself
in the middle between the other person
that I was sitting next to am i right
and then I was giving him a little bit
more room so he like lasting giggle
about the situation like oh you didn't
have to do that you made it a little bit
harder for yourself you know about a lot
of Senate there and I was just like hot
okay well actually was trying to help
you out but anyway no so Sonny was like
oh no I was just kidding of Allah and I
was just like okay but as I'm looking at
him I noticed how he looks like he has
baby oil in his hair for a hair product
and he's about a little darker than me
he looks like he's black but that baby
hair that baby oil hair threw me off
like I didn't know what he had
but it is going to say he was black
because I think he was or maybe he was
and he had like a button-up on and it's
all the way buttons like the last button
at the top the khaki slacks and just
dress shoes or he had the shirt tucked
in and he just looks weird he looks like
he has like five kids in his basement
automatically and that's how I thought
of it like he just looked like he was a
creep and for some reason I attract
creeps but it's cool it's cool it's cool
he's talking to me at this point and I
feel obligated to like at least respond
back because I'm not rude at all I don't
like being rude to people and I just
tried to have like the basic mm-hmm
smiles on my face when you talk it to me
but I don't try to I don't try to give
you a reason to keep talking to me kept
talking to me right and I was like
giving him them like you know and then I
was just like well why are you here and
cuz I really want to know at this point
cuz he just kept talking he kept talking
about like what he does his music and
what he was doing before he walks into
the store and how a woman was irritating
him because he kept talking she kept
talking to him and he was actually
trying to leave what he was actually
doing to me so I don't understand how
you can I don't understand how you could
say that about somebody else but now
you're doing it to me okay so you know
it's cool it's cool
so he's like um I'm actually here to
charge my phone so I said all right well
you know the mall is about to close I
think you should make me charge the
phone and he's like yeah and he pulls
out his phone as an Android I'm like
this is the Apple Store how you gonna
charge your hand oh no here bah blah
maybe you have a USB cord but I didn't
really like you know how your bucks say
something but you didn't say I said
that's an android phone so how and not
stop and I was like okay cool he was
like yeah I know
this is the atmosphere and I'm just like
okay motherfucker I know you knew this
was the motherfucking out the stores
don't fucking play Oh completely
like y'all where is this Apple have
either one like where where are you I
need you guys save me so no nowhere to
be found yeah I'm still sitting there
still struggling still chewing at my
fucking nails
so he's like two days to so I just
screwed a laptop over next to him and I
was like there you go there's your
computer check your emails now stop
talking to me um so he still does not go
to check his emails like he got to the
website and then she start talking about
something else and guess what he starts
talking about he starts talking about
how he's a singer and he actually sings
for the people in jail okay cool I said
well what kind of music do you sing like
at this point I'm intrigued and I'm
interested
and I'm like youth you sing like oh okay
that's the last thing I thought you were
doing I thought you were actually trying
to saw children's arms off for fun you
know it's like when I was like oh okay
so I was glad that I was being nice to
him and I wasn't being so rude you know
because he's a child of the Lord and he
actually is doing a good deed I'm
guessing in society right so okay so
then finally the apple of Iser comes and
I'm about to get I don't even get up I
shot up out of my seat thank you thank
you thank you thank you for saving me
so then um as I'm getting up this man is
like what do you mean where am I going
I'm here to get my computer fix I don't
know what you're here but I'm here to
get my computer thing so I'm going to
see the alibis are now so then he's like
yeah sure
I'm sure your listeners know like well
you have all that time to show me your
videos you know what you kept chatting
about shit that you shouldn't have been
talking to me about the first place so
like oh like you know how you're trying
to talk and walk at the same time like
not trying to give it answer but you
still go now that like yeah no yeah no
yeah no yeah no like no hell no I'm not
going back oh I started talking to the
hippo advisor I was going over my
computer and after I told him the
situation I literally was like can you
please do me a favor
hey you ready I said he said yeah sure I
said well there's a guy that I feel very
uncomfortable with in your store and
there's a guy that's in here that I feel
really uncomfortable with and I feel
like he's going to harass me when I
weakness source so I actually need you
to walk me out of this store at least
just to give me a head start of like
getting away from this person and he was
like who are you talking about and
there's a whole bunch of young heads in
the store jeonghan's meaning young guys
he's pointing at you know him him him
and I'm like no him it him like him over
there and then he's like it's not nice
to point don't point but I had to point
cuz I had to make it clear as day so
he's like oh
mm-hmm I see why you're kind of afraid
cuz you guys don't know what he looked
like like the description that I just
gave you guys was something short and
sweet
but the real description he really
looked like he had some kids in his
basement and he looked like he was just
trying to sky stuff he had a backpack on
his vibes and demeanor was kind of off
he was kind of goofy he was kind of
weird he was like laughing at himself
too much he was just doing too much for
me and I just felt very uncomfortable
and the hypo advised me I was sitting
across from me was looking like bitch I
used really sitting next to him still
like why haven't you got yet but you
know I want to be rude so I didn't move
I didn't get up and I felt like I can't
rip this one out right he believes I had
that vibe least I had that
fill it so 15 minutes passed before I
got my problem fixed with my computer
and he remembers that he has to help me
escape so he's like get on the side of
me he's a heavier set guy so he's trying
to hide you on the other side of him but
he's like grabs my computer and my tries
to act like he's talking to me about my
serial number on my computer and stuff
like that just so if he the crazy guy
got up and by courts start looking at me
or whatever he would still know that I
was actually still interacting and
having a conversation he couldn't
interrupt me or he couldn't say anything
so it got closer to the front of the
store this is like the longest moment of
my life when I was walking out of this
store and he's like look and see if he's
looking cuz we're almost at the front of
the store so the mo visor is like look
and see if he's looking and I'm like are
you sure should I do this and then like
I lean back from him so I'm like this
I'm on the side of him and he's right
here and I'm like
and that was like he is staring I didn't
even say that on my face it was
literally just like that like when I
look back a piece I said close it grab
my computer I'll adapt advising hands
and booked it down that mall when I say
I ran so fast I didn't care what was
going boys
I didn't know why I even ran I don't
know what made me run but that good do
it with my bitch go so I went I shut up
a storm made that right fucking ran down
the hall everybody in the mall is
looking at me they probably thought I
stole a freaking Apple book are they
probably thought I stole the computer or
something hi my purse in one hand my
phone my computer and my keys song I
have to make another right to get to the
Macy's and I'm like speed walking at
this point because I finished running
down the straight path that I was
actually at when I came out the Apple
Store so it doesn't kiss if he I ran
because if he decided that he wanted to
come out like I'm hoping that he didn't
know where I went because I ran right
and he couldn't find me so when I make
the right to get to Macy's I start power
walking like I'm speed walking but
people already know I mean if people
know me they already know that I walk
into stringing fast so that's like that
was my name even in high school like the
pretty girl that walk fast but saw speed
walking to me is still running literally
like really I might as well just kept
running so so when I got like close to
Macy's I hear somebody scream Tatiana
Tatiana and I start running again up and
running out of a seat I got my phones
are you in my hands I'm like literally
like speed out of my mom and I'm like
mom this is my sat down on the phone and
I'm going to try to explain to him but
I'm wondering booking it I'm running and
down I'm running and Macy's and
everything trying to get to my car I
parked far and everything and I'm
running on the mall
why is he still chasing me he is chasing
me out of the monarch
he's like fancy Anna I just want to see
my your I just want you to see my videos
I just want you to see my video no Mike
Oh care about videos like leave me alone
you psychopath
so I'm get to my car finally and I'm
like not fiddling with the kids because
my kids are already in my hand
I already got to keep ready while I'm
gonna not playing games cuz my biggest
fear and you guys don't know it's
getting raped kidnapped getting nipped
at in somebody's back closet or attic or
basement I just don't
I'm just not winning I watch too much
movies I'm just prepared for anything
okay so when I get my car like he's
literally walking to my car I my cars
party girl don't worry is one okay it's
boy oh but it's all pretty for the guys
like oh not I got my little figure out
that him everything I was not planned my
mom was like go to the nearest gas
station luckily I was in the area where
the closest gas station has so many
police officers my head what I was
thinking was this guy is planning on his
next victim because it's around 8:30
when he walked into that Apple store why
are you coming to the mall around 8:30
and then you got a backpack one you just
not even supposed to be in the office or
you don't even know why you forgetting
why you were here you've been weird you
have your mannerisms this weird laughing
too much and you've been just weird in
general so clearly you're trying to
lawyer that victim in you're trying to
walk me to my car if you're trying to
kidnap me you're trying to get my my
card
um tag numbers like that doesn't mean
that's just how I think and I had that
gut feeling for a reason cuz I don't
think any normal person would chase you
down like you're Beyonce
give two because they want you to watch
a video that they have of themselves
singing no no no one does that if I can
reenact this I would but I'm not gonna
do it okay but all I'm telling you is
the moral of the story is ladies it's
you fill something deep in your soul
that something is wrong go with that
feeling you're not having that filler
for no reason just do it just go just
leave dislike leave if he even decided
if I even seen a pink but enough with
anybody here curly with some slick out
baby oil pieces of hair coming anywhere
in in that gas station I would have
hopped out of my car so quick be like
that would be that would have been me
I'm not playing I would have been so
amped and ready to get his ass locked up
and I'm sure he that's all I gotta say
cuz I don't know him I just know that
you're crazy you're crazy dude because
you chased me out of whom ah okay you're
crazy but anyway that's that story time
I'm not home safe clearly you didn't
follow me clearly I'm making this video
for you clearly so I am safe okay but I
don't know if I'll ever want to go out
by myself ever again
honestly like every time I had to do
something it would be something that's
close to either my home or I would ask
my cousin to come with me or I have my
friends come with me or something like
that
my boyfriend is usually always at work
so yeah just be safe make sure you have
a a gun a Taser a shank something have
something mace something I am NOT
playing and that happened to me I went
to the gun range right after that I was
not playing I had to pop a couple of
shots off
just to give my life the life filling
back in me cuz he really had me on edge
like my mom even said it she was like I
never heard you this scared ever before
like and I'm like because you know how I
am about being kidnapped
like I'm not playing like this could be
this could have been the man that would
have took your daughter and you wouldn't
have known if I was in Canada Mexico I'm
blessed and I'm still here and I had my
angels that protect me and watch over me
all the time so be prepared for anything
always say ttg you don't ever be out
here lackin make sure you know what your
surroundings are and do not play okay
because people will try to play with you
seriously thank you so much for watching
ladies I hope you guys enjoyed this
third time and I'll see you guys in my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
