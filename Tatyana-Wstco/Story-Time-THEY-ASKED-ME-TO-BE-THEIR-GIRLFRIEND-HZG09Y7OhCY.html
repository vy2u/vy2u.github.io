about the time where I was asked to be
their girlfriend so I just can't I was
working at Victoria's Secret at the time
right I won't tell you guys what
Victoria's Secret but just know that
this Victoria's Secret only had about a
handful of normal customers every time
the day started but the rest were
 cuckoo for cocoa puffs I don't
try to judge until I realized that
cuckoo for cocoa puffs so this guy just
walks in and he's accent for my
assistant so of course it's my job to
help him so that's what I do
so I asked him what he's interested in
or what type of film he's trying to get
his significant other or whatever or
himself he starts being very flirtatious
saying little remarks that's like and
clearly like okay you think I'm good so
telling me how attractive I am and how
beautiful I am and how attractive he is
to me and that he needs me to be their
girlfriend
and I'm like they're you what are you
talking about so I'm thinking we're here
for fragrances garments bras panties
robes not a shorty you get worst and
like not me no I wouldn't give you his
description he's like 5:30 ball-headed
like skin and definitely not my type he
had loud clothes on very loud clothes on
like rhinestones all over his clothes
and like God he asked pants that
had like tons of designs but anyway and
all of a sudden like three girls appear
out of nowhere like hops to push it just
float it I'm nowhere and then just
appeared and I'm like I turn around and
I see them and I'm like oh so it's
a asian girl a white girl in a black
mummy and they're all freaking beautiful
seriously and and I was so like where
the hell do you guys come from they went
through another entrance so they
probably like starting from the back of
the store and came up who knows but I'm
thinking like it's three of them so one
of them has to be his girlfriend so I'm
not trying to be
I greet them I say hello ask them if
they had help if they need any help or
if they've been helped already and they
let me know actually it for you we want
you to be a girlfriend I can track that
egg yeah somebody do this to you right
so I'm sorry turn them down I'm not
interested I'm not into that but you
know to each his own I don't judge but
am I going to be affiliated and like a
star relationship you can really see him
like I'm not any of these points but up
back it up and be backing a little
square in your little box because I'm
not a part of it this guy is like trying
to bribe me in his little girls are
trying to bribe me they all look like
the girls look like they're popping in
their 20s and they're like we must have
fun we get outside hands and toes up all
the time so we would love for you to
join us your beautiful little sis or
whatever away from me who are you and
why are you guys so ray I don't
know you you don't even know if I have a
significant other like why are you not
asking any questions so it's just making
me think like this is just like a whole
trafficking situation and they're trying
to rule in their next victim no I'm like
ready to like call security at this
point I should be used to this because
crazier has happened right actually
this has to be like the craziest one
though I actually worked at this betray
secret for only a couple of months like
I dealt with something every day that
was a random like this and my boyfriend
was just like yo you come home with the
most craziest story have you doing the
craziest hours so you're wrong the
craziest people and it was just
ridiculous so the guys snaps his finger
and he gets them so basically vanished
so I'm like yo teach me your ways if I
could just snap my finger and bitches
just know to get the
I need you to teach me how to do that
he's still trying to bribe me he's still
trying to row me in he's just like
listen if you change your mind give me a
call he takes my pin and my piece of
paper that within my pouch out of my
pouch and writes his number down on the
piece of paper and stuff said back into
my little pouch that I had like this
little fanny pack that you have to carry
around when you're on the floor in
Victoria's Secret and I'm just like were
you guys plotting on me have you guys
seen me before like who knows if they've
been in this Victoria's Secret and
they've seen me and they're just
plotting or maybe just go into stores
and try to find cute girls to like hit
on that's probably how he found all of
them but you definitely have to be very
cautious out here like it's just not the
average like state that you can just
meet new people and you just think that
they're actually like genuine good
people and just want good conversation
and ever safe
so I got on my headset after him and I
was like listen y'all I need you guys to
remove me from the store if another
customer comes in here and tries to get
me to go home with them I'm literally
gonna scream and i really scream
and i'm going to call security and I'm
going to call corporate they're
all laughing at me I'm so dramatic and
they always used to ask me how was my
dance in the day because they knew it
was a story that went with it but I just
couldn't so that's that story a lot of
other crazy stories happen in Victoria's
Secret so if you want to hear more some
thumbs up this video and comment that
that's what you want to hear or if you
want to know why I quit Victoria's
Secret leave that in the comment section
and thumbs up this video but thank you
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next one
time for a change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
