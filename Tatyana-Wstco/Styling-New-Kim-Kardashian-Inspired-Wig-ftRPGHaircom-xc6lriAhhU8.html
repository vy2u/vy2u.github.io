video and today I decided that I wanted
to get on camera and show you guys my
new wig from RPG hair and I am excited
because this unit is sulfur can pop it
this is the first day that I ever put
this wave on my head so I was like why
not show you guys on camera but let's
get into this information about this
crazy wig in this box I have two bits
from a scare company but this is the
first one that I wanted to explain
really quick because it is a short unit
but I have been really in love with
shorter lips lately because you know
sometimes along here is just too much so
the style number is LS w23 it's a
natural color it's 12 inches and it's
150% density and it's a lace front
you're able to part this wig anywhere
that you want in the front and it looks
really natural not fully lace it's not
fully laced once again so what you can
do is to make the unit's look a little
more natural to just use some of my
foundation powder and some of my
concealer just to buff underneath the
lace so when I'm laying down it can look
really natural looking and it looks like
you know your your natural scalp if you
would say and then I just place a wig
cap underneath it actually came with
these and these are the ones that I like
using because it's my skin complexion
and you know I don't want a super white
one or nor do i want a black ones all
their information will be listed in
description box below this wig is
constructed really freaking good like
I'm actually so like shocked about it
because I don't believe my last unit
that I received from our PG hair was
this double me but this one is freaking
perfect it has four poems it has one on
each side one in the back and one like
at the top somewhere and then it has the
drawstrings of course so I just pull the
drawstrings up under I just pull the
drawstring to each side so can fit
really double me and I'll place the comb
underneath the dome cap my hair
underneath this is not rated it actually
just in a ponytail and because you know
when you pull the drawstring to each
side and may cause like a little bump
underneath it but the placement of the
call Messer
right in the back you can just cut that
little extra you know fabric or tuck it
right underneath your way cap I even try
to put this unit up in a ponytail when I
first put it on and it looks really
freaking good like I'm not going to do
it now but just know it looks really
really good
my cat's eyes I've know for a fact that
it's a cat five small because I don't
think there will be any other side that
could fit my little head so this style
is called the Kim Kardashian bob
hairstyle Indian rimming hair glue this
links front away once again all their
information will be listed in the
description box below but I just want to
let you guys know that I am actually
really really really filling this wig
and I think you guys were enjoy as well
they have a ton they have tons of other
units on their website so make sure you
check it out another way from them so
make sure you subscribe and turn
notifications on for the kid because you
need to be notified when I post videos I
love you I'll see you guys in the next
one but the process of getting dressed
and I wanted to do I make them look at
least on camera but then I thought about
it I was like well I'm wearing a new way
that I haven't told you guys about so
why not get on here and show you that
how I'm going to be styling this wig
today so this way is from RPG hair wig
it's the style number is LSW 230 natural
12 inches 150 percent density and this
is a lace front wig so the part is the
per actually comes on this side but I
don't want to wear I don't think I want
to wear the part one this side today I
think I want to do it more so like this
this way feels like a Soviet like that's
how tight it is I have it on the last
loop and I'll have all the combs
tough underneath the dome cap not dome
cap but the wig cap and I'm pulling it
up and as you can see it's not lifting
it's not moving around it's really
really nice
what about the way what about the way
what about the way the way
the way you love me what about the way
you love me what about the ways we
away
what about the way right here oh but I'm
have to take four chairs Oh Sophia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
