another video and I'm so excited to
share this unit with you guys because
I've been in love with it so of course
this is from best lace wigs one of my
favorite wig companies and it's because
they have such a variety on their
website I've tried so many wigs from
them so you can check out my other
videos that I have with best place ways
in the title so you guys can see how
amazing their wigs are they actually
have a curly wig that I was so in love
with I still actually have it it's
holding up really good and I kind of
want to go with a curly look soon so I
might bring that back out and they have
this one so let me get into it this is a
heavy density big wave Indian romaine
360 pre pluck unit from this site this
is a 18 inch natural color 150% medium
pre plus unit already looking natural
for you in the front the most I would
say you may need to go and tweak is the
sides but the front as long as your
friends look at the girl and your
party's looking on fleek you are fine
first it doesn't look like the picture
anymore because like I said I've been
wearing it for two months I wanted to
give it a chance because it does say
it's indian remy hair and indian remy
hair does get kind of matted and dry so
I wanted to make sure that the quality
on this unit was amazing before I even
gave it a chance
and shared it with you guys so that's
why I'm here today because it's amazing
I honestly feel like I have ate a
Brazilian like highest of the highest
quality in my hair right now so the fact
that is indian remy hair and it's not
giving you knotted matted mess and i
applied so much heat on this hair in
this video as well as well as all camera
when i was rockin in love throwing this
wig on it really fits really snug for it
to be a medium i wish i got a small they
have a nice cellphone or like i
mentioned so some discount codes will be
