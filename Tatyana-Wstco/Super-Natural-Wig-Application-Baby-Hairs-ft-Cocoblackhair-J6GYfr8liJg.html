with another video I'm so excited that
you guys have been loving my videos you
guys are making me so happy so every day
is just like I must record and stay
consistent with you guys so we can build
our family right okay so if you haven't
seen the previous video I will link it
in the description box below and I'll
probably start doing that for all my
videos so you guys to know what was my
previous video so you don't feel like
you have to watch something odd and SP
from me today it will has to be a wig
review and I'm going to show you how to
slay a wig
so this hair company is from let me give
this information how don't I have the
information to organic I'm so today's
Vegas from Coco black hair dot-com
I will descent information in the
description box below it's a Brazilian
version straight 360 waist front away
from this company it is 22 inches
natural color medium brown lace 360 from
a wig with straps combs and all that
good stuff so once again 22 inches of
monk myths and beautifulness so I'm
going to show you guys how the hair with
package it came in this box and it also
had a little baggie with it so I bought
the bag over here definitely like sorry
so this bag also came in the box of
course look the wig so I'm going to show
you guys the wig and it may look a
little crazy right now and don't judge
it it's been through a couple of things
because I ended up going in and
bleaching the knot so the nos didn't
come like this it was more so on like
you know if you part of it it kind of
looks like it wasn't a color but now
actually kind of looks like my skin
color and that's kind of a sale that I
wanted to go with with this way and I
think I'm going to start doing this with
all of my wigs so if you guys want to
see how I think I want to see how
bleech the nuts on your wigs let me know
so what bleaching them not does is
basically gives a natural appearance to
your wigs and it's not going to look
like it it's not going to look Wiggy
that's basically what you don't want
when you're wearing away so once again
this is a 360 unit it does have four
cones one at the top like back here but
not in the middle of the lanes that is
so important because one way company
actually put the damn comb right in the
middle of the lace which didn't even
make any sense well we're not going to
take it there and then there's two combs
only size and still placement is good
it's not um hold on toes the placement
okay okay okay so these combs are
actually on the lace to where we should
be able to party that so I just don't
understand what companies do that but
I'm guessing to make it know fit the
proper way when you're rocking it but I
just don't understand like if we wanted
to part this it's not bad even if we
part of it is not bad it's not like
really bulky but at the same time it's
just like a lot of you do that and then
there's a comb in the back and then
there's a strength the drawstring so or
the stress so they say so what I do
automatically before I apply my weight
is put the straps all the way on each
last little loop that it can possibly go
on um the capsize I said small so I hope
it's a small so it should be spinning
release them I did not go wash the hair
completely so that was all my part it's
not looking like really luscious well
we're going to slay it don't worry don't
worry that's why we're doing this video
so I'm going to put it away cap one and
then I'm going to come back and show you
guys how this looks to whisk the lace on
but actually before I do that I want to
just go ahead and cut the lace um I'm
just going to go ahead and cut the lace
because I just don't have time alright
so this is what we're going to do I'm
going to start cutting but then I'm
going to show you how much I'm leaving
orange so you don't want to cut really
close because just in case you make a
mistake you know the laser is going to
be where you want to place the got to be
glue the hairspray whatever you use to
lay your puzzle down I'm going to show
you how I made my phone goes down this
side I kind of cut off too much but it's
okay click one now but this is how much
lace I kind of kept on the wig so you
can see that not so much but not really
really small so I'm part of really small
but you get the point right at the point
so what I'm going to be using in this
video that you may want to purchase
because this is what has been laying my
friends'll down super super awesome and
this is the freezing spray from salon
graphics the Tim max hold you can
purchase it from Walmart and I think
this is probably like three books so
worth the purchase definitely better in
my personal opinion it's better than
gossipy glue because I just don't like
got to be glue because it's really
sticky and I feel like in thanks forever
to dry and my patience is not there
that's a lot of little kids but um yeah
so this is also some sprints
now this it's pretty girl so I went
hunting for some sprints and I didn't
want to do the pump it up you all know
the pump it up where girls be like yeah
through here and had to pump it up in a
comb and some vans ray and be like yeah
I know what I'm doing and some buster a
splatters but yeah so this I was like
well I never heard about this one before
and I guess this is by the name of
Fantasia liquid moves mega hold spritz
50% to the 50% 50% more holding power
instantly freezes hair in place shape
scopes lift spikes loosen and shine only
use this just like I use this but I use
both of these now and it's a
lightsaber so let's get it started okay
so as you can see when you put the unit
one I have my wig cap one okay and when
you wearing a wig cap you can do
whatever you want with your hair
underneath it my hair is just straight
back into braids and that
pretty much all that I do with my hair
when I put it under wigs because I don't
got time to be Brandon and unbraided and
reburied in my hair all the damn time so
garages put my hair into little pony
tails or no to braids and call it a day
so you can see you see the lace so the
lace is medium brown and you can get the
lace color that you would like for
yourself but man Brown wants to me it
can be dark brown but you know maybe I
will try dark brown next time just to
see and I think I would like that a lot
better because as you can see I still
need to you know do a little work so
with your dome cap or not don't careful
with your wig cap whatever floats your
boat like with because me I'm rocking so
I need to make sure my cap and brown and
I want to make sure all of my baby hairs
are underneath because girl I don't give
a about if you have a frontal and
you feel like it and just can't be
snatched away it can with this wig happy
wants to make sure all of your edges are
covered because when we start finding
hairspray and stuff like that you can't
cross tension and you don't want to lose
all your precious baby hairs and stuff
like that it's not like super dramatic
but at the same time you still don't
want to lose your baby hairs like who
wants to be out there with no baby it
okay so that's why you can see the wig
is over my baby hair and that's where
you want your way to be placed
what about something right now is cut
off anything that's extra up in here now
I did pretty good with this side but I'm
guessing that's not me and I'm doing
that maybe that's just probably came and
you can see my ear not tucked in but on
this side girl what is going on my kid
my ear is hitting when we put this up in
a ponytail and then we gonna start
guiding each other okay I hope y'all got
y'all baby-boy
while I'm doing this or I hope y'all
come back to this video wit away okay
oh don't be watching me try to devil
don't be watching need to see bitch are
you want to play are you going to be
looking dusty fill out where your ear is
and you want to make sure you keep this
area because my little sideburns are
pretty long okay I'm a hairy little girl
so I need to make sure this is all the
way down here so I'm going to not cut
anywhere in this area but I am going to
start cutting like right here and this
is where my ear is can you guys see what
I'm doing like you so area okay so I
like not really cutting I like using my
scissors to rip this pretty much
and then I could when I was my ears
going to pop out my ear you see my ear
and we still want to make sure we're not
taking anything off that's extra
so this is what I took off my sideburns
are not that long but my sideburns are
up here so now what I'm going to do is
can you go to see go in and cut this off
so this is this getting cut off now
right okay now we should be Gucci
Montero pull my wig down and we're going
to cut some more lift weights off
this doesn't mean a beer you don't need
to be any of the language what is that
on the side of your face like spray
spray spray and then go in spritz one to
make sure is where you want it to be up
right and do not use your fingers
because millions of times I've touched
my lace
wow this hairspray is on here and my
 be looking white you don't want
that you guys don't know what that ain't
your mama don't want it
your baby
part how much baby hair you want out and
push the rest back in why was that so
hard for me to say I 24 speech classes
of this just ridiculous
now whatever hairs are extremely long
you can just cut but you should just
push them back because that means that
they don't belong and the baby hair will
pick these areas in between want to go
in the lace that I didn't touch and it's
going to make sure this area should
secure up here
as quote like one of those white hair
rap sheets and then that you tie around
when you getting your hair wrap going
with one of those and tie around here
that's what I usually use about have any
more mud and it we got supposed to pick
some up at my local beauty supply store
so you can use a scarf or a bandana and
honestly that's what you can do but
we're going to keep it pushing
but that's what you should do you should
rat something around sit under the dryer
use the dryer a little longer but
because I know what I'm doing I'm just
going to work I want to work a little
softer so I don't like to mess anything
up up here but it's secure I can feel it
trust me
but I'll talk about the last step so
what you're going to do right now so as
you can see when I party it looks good
like and it looks way better than the
last
frontal that I was working with because
that was like my testing my skills out
kind of crunches that I was working on
and it turned out really good but once
you start getting good at something you
start understanding that you have to
tweak certain things because it's not
all good you know I'm thinking I
continue to work at your craft so that's
what I've been doing so as you can see
when our party is not as orange and
crazy looking at the other one and I
didn't go in and tell my other one
because it's starting to look a little
grassy and you don't want that but I was
fine wearing it like that because it
still looks good to me in my personal
opinion and you guys didn't feel too you
know bad about it so what you want to do
is part wherever you want the part ash
just so you can go in with some more of
this hair spray and start parting I like
using this one for this just because the
spritz sometimes starts to get the hair
really hard like it says it's supposed
to do but with this you can kind of work
at it like soon as you spray action on
and I fanpages princess Fantasia now as
soon as you spread a fan pages rippling
your damn hair just make sure you
understand that when it says mega ho is
must mega ho and then with this one
after like it it does say neck pain but
it's um you can still work around a you
know if you give them trying to say so
I'm going to part in different areas and
do the same
hi munchkins
okay so I just took my scarf off that's
why my baby hairs are all in my face
like this so what we're going to do is
kick this side because we didn't finish
parting and putting the hairspray over
here so I'm going to make sure we still
do that on this side
I just wanna know okay so what I'm going
to do now is take some of this foam
scrapping motion like this much rub it
in your finger and Grandy's twist and
cut but I'm not going to cut what will
cut like that I'm using the scissor that
they were raises if you want to come to
your liking like use the lint that you
want that's what you want to do okay so
no don't let nobody tell you that you
can't have your baby and oh man
having a baby and if you want oh baby
all right so now what I'm going to do is
go in and lay them now with my
toothbrush like using water for this
step I hear from that I use on the baby
ears are going to be still in the hair
so that's why I want to use too much fun
so yeah you need to make sure you get
one of these two brushes at the park
completely flat this is the tube brush
that I use for my actual baby hairs so I
don't like lumps in my toothbrushes for
my baby hairs just because I said like
it just makes it really hard to get like
a swoop going or whatever kind of look
you're trying to do and I don't want a
lot of baby hairs I just want it to look
like there's kind of like Scooby edges
that I actually do with modern ears so I
just kind of like hold the hair down and
then just like swoop them it's not
really that difficult if you do this to
your own hair already I like putting the
spritz on the back of the toothbrush and
pressing it down so it's not lifting up
so just like this
if you decide to put like a hair strip
on be really careful because it can
press down too far and then it can might
get white sometimes not because of the
product I don't know and just sometimes
it looks like that or can just look
really hard and weird and I don't like
that either this is the final results
and I hope you guys enjoyed how I lay my
Brussels wigs whatever is same technique
goes for frontals of course because this
is a 360 lace frontals wig yes um every
right there and really soft really easy
to straighten it doesn't have a curl or
a wave pattern actually waves up to body
waves so I was really excited about that
because it was Brazilian straight hair
but it was actually when I just wet the
frontal part area where not least the
knot I saw that it has nice little wave
in it
so you can definitely check the
description box if you want to purchase
from Coco black hair I think this is
going to be another wing that I
frequently wear sum up customize and did
all this stuff to it when you show your
wig gloves
trust me you get love back once again
