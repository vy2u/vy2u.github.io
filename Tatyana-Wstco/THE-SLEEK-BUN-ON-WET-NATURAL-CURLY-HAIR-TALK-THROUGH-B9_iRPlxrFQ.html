video I hope you guys are excited to see
me
and today's want to be on this slick bun
tutorial I know you guys are super
excited because you guys always ask me
about this the next video is going to be
on this sleek ponytail the super long
ponytail so yeah so this one is super
simple very easy but I'm going to show
you how to install extensions with your
hair so the bun can be fuller and it can
look like it's your actual hair do you
want to mention the products I use in
this video because I don't know if I was
that informative about the products
during the process due to me trying to
tell you guys the story about my big
shot because I know you guys are
probably going to ask me that if I ever
had a perm yes I did but that's going to
be in the video soon so I'm not going to
explain that to you right now because I
don't want this video to be any longer
than it has to be so the first product
that I used was the blue magic organics
agrees it's amazing it's a really
natural product it has amazing
ingredients inside of it and it helps
you know condition your scalp and keep
moisture in your hair and all that good
stuff so you'll see me work with this
and then I totally forgot to like pick
up my damn eco styling gels when I was
in the bathroom so I totally forgot to
put this in my hair before putting it in
the point oh so I was struggling for a
very long time with my hair and you're
going to see that because I was talking
to you guys and I really wasn't thinking
like why is this taking me so long to
put my hair in a ponytail and this is a
lifesaver when it comes to that because
it's just going to keep everything pain
and it saves you a lot of time trying to
deal with your curls popping in and out
sometimes different types of this but
this is the olive oil one and this one
it's the best for natural hair because
it's free of you know alcohol and all
that terrible stuff but it's still ten
max whole so it's going to have you it's
going to have your hair looking very
sleek and chic so that's what we want
for this look now I do not put my
beeswax in my hair I usually use this
product but I haven't been using this
lately due to me not having too
um back in the day I used to have to use
it a lot because certain areas in my
hair was shorter than others and now my
hair is pretty much even because I've
did a really good job so I didn't have
to use this and I've been taking vitamin
so my hair is growing a lot it's growing
more so this is the organic beeswax you
can pick this up from your beauty supply
store
but it must leak um Tony tell Victoria
the one that's going to be super long
I'm going to show you guys how to use
this product because I'm sure I'm going
to either part my hair in the middle or
or I'm going to do the like side bang
type of thing with that look so I'll
show you guys this in the next video I
promise but the two products that I had
in my hair before working on this pony
was the can - curly cream and became to
leave-in conditioner you can get this
from Walmart and Walmart sells it for
maybe like 2 to 4 bucks I forgot but I
don't suggest you guys get this anywhere
else because there's going to definitely
rip you off so Walmart definitely has it
for the loan so yeah and then the brush
that I use is a two sided brush and this
is the soft side this is the hard side
and this is a lifesaver just because
girl when you need that water side you
need that hard side just to flick
everything up and make sure everything
is tamed and of course I used my hair to
brush so you'll see that and no I don't
use that for my piece it's called a hair
toothbrush for a reason cause we've only
used for the hair so let's jump into the
video now I hope you guys are doing well
I'll see you guys in a second so as you
can see my hair is on the shorter side
so what I like to do is actually put my
hair up in a bun and then I like adding
like weeds to my head to my ponytail so
it can look
comin home ele lately I don't do
anything spectacular to mother here I
don't usually do this with them with
this Greece but I am today because my
hair is extremely like moisturize from
any conditioning products that I used
but when my hair is like this I have to
put the grease in there because it's
just going to UM
it just won't pop right back up for me
alright it love so what I did was just
go in with some of my eco styling gel
you can get this product from your local
beauty supply store for the low low and
also hit these parts to their not smooth
my edges some more and that is why I was
struggling in the beginning because I
didn't even put this on my hair and it
just tanked my hair and it helped me to
give a feel on how I want my baby hair
to braid the rest of my hair up for
bands to make sure everything is staying
in place and then as you can see I got a
hit this area up here with the eco
styler gel when I finished just so we
can tame all of those little flyaways
because you need to be very careful when
you're putting rubber bands in your hair
just because it can't break your hair
and then and you can see under the
breath my little bun around and just
like that now I look like a little baby
sumo wrestler so now I'm just going to
pick some abednego styling gel and hit
this area right here and I have me a
deep wave
bundles separation it is right here and
it's Brazilian of course so I'm going to
do this and hang it in my bun first so
I'm just wrapping it around the pieces
that I see my bun looking like peeking
through I'm just going to place the
track in that area and independent and I
just like doing this just because when I
wasn't doing this I was just stabbing
for must out taking all day is
going to bother you even if you think
you know you can't fill it yet trust me
it's coming so just be very careful if
your hair is shorter than life or if you
feel like this step is not necessary
trust me it is to put it through your
funds hair so like in this area right
here I'm going to start wrapping if you
want to be me okay know what your tracks
would be at the top men at the bottom
you want to be neat with it you know
lift your hair if you need to but don't
go super tight guys squeezed up because
trust me there's so many times I want to
rip this off the top of my head
because it was too tight and it just
brings headaches and you can really hurt
yourself if you make your hair too tight
you know what I like Brazilian hair
because it fits my hair Oh texture a lot
so yeah and you also want to make sure
infamy in the back too don't get lazy in
back because you know anybody behind you
trying to figure out this is your hair
words it's not you know we want
everything to look so much put a piece
right here right stretch it out and wrap
it just in case the West is showing and
you don't want it to show want it to be
thick then you've got to wrap it around
a couple of times you'll see that you
won't be able to even tell that anything
going wrong and wrong
keep wrapping and keep stretching don't
get loose and tired around this part
either and then this is why they do the
bobby pin right here because I want to
do this bobby pin and I kind of have to
tuck this bobby pin down into my hair my
actual hair and not even the bun and I
just don't like too many bobby pins
because I believe I know which bobby pin
is actually hurting you throughout the
day so if I got to loosen it up I just
know that it's time to take this one out
right here girl and keep it pushing
so that is how I do my body no I'm going
to do is just add some water into the
pair just like feeling a little bit more
pain because this is not its natural
state right now because I didn't call
wash it or anything like that so to add
a little bit more tameness I'm just
going to put a little bit of this
leave-in conditioner in here the same
ones I used for my hair in the cancer
ward
all right so we're going to twist okay
but when you twist you want to make sure
all of the hair is in the twist you
don't want anything poking out twist
keep twisting if you would have
something like this teach you with the
bring it up a little bit and then hit
you with another twist and then you need
to make sure you're molding it to where
you want it to lay here's another twist
like this
and you can have some sense like this on
top of your head right and I don't want
to wear my bun like that today so I'm
going to see if so so you can do
something like that I wanted to do I
don't want it to be too perfect or you
could do something like that
loosen it up or you can just loosen up
the fun in general with you don't have
to do the twist if you don't want to you
can just loosen that up some more and
then just do something like that so
there's the topic back we'll look if I
wanted to do something like this so yeah
honeybees so what I like doing and I
like loosening it up like this and then
wrapping a rubber band around it I like
using the hair time not a rubber band
because sometimes the rubber band is
just too tight so I'm just going to grab
the vine the wallets in this loose stay
and wrap the rubber band around it
and there you go so that's how the kids
per month got always ask me about kids
and this is how simple it is
if your hair is natural like mine it may
be a little bit more difficult to get
your hair tame like you've seen it was
for me sometimes when mostly because I
forgot to put the Eco styling gel in my
hair so yes so I hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial I hope you found a ssin
that I have one is way too light for me
because I've been in the Sun I was the
pulled why so far this summer and I
think it's time to just go back to my
mac prolongwear foundation now and that
can probably work for me better than the
two combos that I was using which was
mine which was my NYX total control
foundation
Oh
your absence moment that you don't you
tell every sorry
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
