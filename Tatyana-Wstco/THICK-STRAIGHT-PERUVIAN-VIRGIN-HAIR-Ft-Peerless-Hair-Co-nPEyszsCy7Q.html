be sharing with you guys how I'm going
to be styling my peerless straight hair
and I have to let you guys know how much
I'm in love with this hair a lot of you
already have rocked this hair and you
let me know that I was going to love it
and I really really do and a lot of you
guys really wanted me to get this video
up because you're interested in
purchasing from this hair company so let
me give you a little background I had
228 - 26 and this is per revenge
straight hair from peerless hair this is
an Aliexpress hair company I'm so in
love with this because it does not shed
it doesn't nape about the back of my
neck and this hair is so free too full
for some straight hair I got four
bundles and a closure and I honestly
think you can get away with three
bundles in the closure but it's just
what you prefer when it comes to
straight hair so I'm just so in love
with the fact that it doesn't look
Barbie like it looks really natural on
me and I didn't have to cut the ends if
I didn't want to because the ends were
really full I just decided to style it
because I wanted to show you guys how
well this hair hold the curl even though
it's straight hair it does hold the curl
a little longer than the average
straight hair that you probably rock
because of how fold it is I'm going to
talk to you guys in a second I did a
second half of this video of me sitting
down and talking to you guys I just
wanted to put a little bit more of my
input on this hair in the beginning of
this video so I'll see you soon
hey my babies I hope all is well and I
hope you enjoyed the beginning of my
video so as you can see I strand and I
cut some layers into this hair so this
is my first time doing that ever since I
actually installed this hair to not have
a ten definitely because how full this
hair is and it does nape up at the back
of my neck how long this hair is and how
straight this hair is it doesn't give
you that Barbie fill it looks really
natural it blends in really good with my
actual hair and plus the closure
um the closure is doing great everything
is doing great what you need to know
about straight hair it doesn't hold a
curl for a long time if you're looking
for something that holds a curl you need
to go with body wave or deep wave or
loose wave anything anything that
already has a wave and it will keep the
curl in the hair longer but straight
hair is just meant to be straight so
your curls definitely will fall what
else can I tell you guys if you guys are
still cutting your West you need to go
ahead and stop that now you need to
start overlapping your West because
beautiful hair like this you don't want
it to be shedding everywhere and that is
what happens when you cut your West
because when you cut your Webster you're
messing with the that is threaded
up and keeping that hair on to that web
so once you can snip it you're messing
up all of that up there and you just
causing it to Shen's whether you get
your hair done by a stylist or if it's
you doing your hair you need to know do
not cut the web's anymore if your hair
will last longer when you take the
installation oh you know what unless
you're working with you know what is
your top bundle you know what's your
bottom bundle and you don't have just
small any bitty track pieces all over
the place so trust me I used to be that
girl that used to cut my West some but I
stopped that on long last time ago
because I just started noticing like you
know this hair didn't shed when I first
got it so why is it shedding now that
it's installed into my head so yeah so
just be aware that is also I have to let
you guys know if you're dealing with any
hair that you have currently that is dry
brittle or it just is not giving you
life you need to go ahead and cut this
in there for 35 minutes girlfriend well
there's your hair or weave click this
conditioner in there this is Hoagland's
guardian hope Liz repairing conditioner
this will leave your hair super freakin
soft this is my Holy Grail I live for
this stuff amazing if you have like
weave that's like dead at the ends or
whatever that would definitely help that
out and then if you need to go ahead and
revamp a weave or whatever you need to
put that in there for 35 minutes like I
said also trim your ends trimming your
ends is just like if you need to trim
your own ends you trim your ends because
your hair start a little brittle dead
and whatever so sometimes you need to do
that to your weaves and also whatever
you don't do to your hair don't do to
your weaves if you don't put heat in
your hair every day
don't put heat in your weaves every day
you're spending close to almost $400 on
weaves I'm sure so you need to make sure
you're getting longevity out of this
situation right out of your weaves and
you don't need to continue buying if you
do right by your weaves literally your
weasel lasts up to a year and what else
can I tell you guys brush your hair
brush your hair wrap your hair at night
store your hair in a good place amazing
girl this book love W pyramid anyway
