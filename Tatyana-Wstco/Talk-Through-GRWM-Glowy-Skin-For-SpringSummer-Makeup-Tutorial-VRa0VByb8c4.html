another video like I promised and today
is going to be a spring makeup look so I
don't really know what direction I want
to go with this video but it's going to
be in the dewy kind of love is
effortless natural glowy kind of skin
look so if you guys are looking forward
to getting a look like that during
springtime or summer whatever just
continue to watch this video is going to
be a softer so maybe you can get it like
a chitchat going on in this video I've
already applied my foundation towards
the day and it's going to be the Marc
Jacobs genius gel foundation today you
can use I don't really know what you for
that in the drugstore
it's given you like dewy skin but still
kind of a little bit more matte I just
applied the foundation using my morphe
439 brush and I just pretty much Dippold
that into my skin you can use Mac strobe
cream it has good ingredients in that so
you can pick that up if you're
interested into getting like that
strobing effect apply this underneath
your foundation mix it with your
foundation
whatever you pretty much want to do with
this I did not put this one but what I
am going to use today is a Sephora
luminizing drops and you can pick that
up once again from Sephora and as you
can see I'm just going to apply it using
the applicator that comes with it and
bring it down my nose on the side of my
cheek and that's pretty much it and
whatever product is left and right after
blending it out I'm going to put it
above is I'm going to put on a buffer in
it my Tarte beauty blender and blend
that out using the tip and of course you
want to always use your Beauty Blender
damp never dry Jamie you just look a lot
more flawless with the beauty blenders
while working with a Beauty Blender I'm
going to grab my concealer now this is
la girl Pro concealer and B shade 12 and
put that underneath the eyes I do suffer
from really like what you want to call
it like hyperpigmentation and leave the
eyes
that when people called dark eye circles
others call the dark eye circles girl
and mine are inherited so I like putting
a deeper concealer underneath my eyes
first
you've met NW shifty concealer from mac
and then going in with the thought you
don't have my color correcting concealer
from la girl right now I don't know
where that is but you can pick that up
from your local beauty supply store and
they have all the different comments
that I was just telling you guys about I
think they have like green and yellow
orange nothing purple so I'm applying
that underneath my eyes like using my
finger a little bit more now because I
feel like it warms up the product you
know my concealer I use it to conceal
and I also use it to highlight so that's
why I drag it all the way down here you
don't have to do all of this girl but I
knew my under-eye for brightness I make
sure I am brighter than the Sun when it
comes back so I'm going to take my
Beauty Blender yep of course once again
and then you want to blend it out
stippling motions look up so you avoid
creasing yeah now in the lid
when I take my NW 50 concealer from mac
use my ring finger and pretty much fill
out the hollows of my cheeks and this is
the contour you know to make your face
look a little slimmer a little bit more
chiseled and happy within instead of
satin brown like mine if you don't feel
like getting up to the gym you want to
feel skinny for a day learn how to
contour BAE well I'm going to go in with
another contour shade and this is
expresso from the mind Bobbie Brown and
I'm just taking a little bit of that and
putting it in the same area that I apply
in w50 but what I do this for is just to
deepen it up and get the desired color
that I want because this by itself is
way too money and then the concealer
that I just used before after like it's
just too subtle and I kind of want it
right in between I don't want anything
too dramatic press the product into my
skin really not dragging it out all over
the place because I want it to be where
I pretty much placed the color at and
yeah taking whatever is left over
blending out the rest of my forehead I
don't want my forehead to be super dark
like you know this area but I do just
want that little shadow you know and
then taking it underneath my change in
the jawline and then we will go back
over with your Beauty Blender and fill
in this area out there's no partial this
is just an extra step you don't have to
do this but I am going to do this
because I want to be bright and a wicked
and happy during the summertime / spring
time and you don't have to get this
color they do have another color that
you could choose for for deeper
complexions but because I know how to
work with stuff to make it work for me
I like using my boost but they do have a
more darker shade
for our brown baby those like yeah it
helps me contour my nose because I kind
of suck at contouring my nose like
sometimes I'm like bitch what are you
doing
sometimes I have to like literally take
my whole nose contour off before like I
finished a video for you guys or even
going out because I either IOD it or
sometimes I just feel like it's not
smashed enough I am going to set my
under eyes and what I did was mix two
powders together I'm going to show you
the two powders that I use the first one
is this HD setting powder and I mixed it
with my Laura Mercier Universal
translucent powder and I don't really
care for that one just by itself on my
skin complexion so I have to mix it with
a more yellow kind of setting powder
this is a mixture in the cap and I'm
just going to take my Beauty Blender on
the pointed side of course and then take
it dump it in there and I'm going to
look up and set and I like looking up
because this is how you prove it the
concealer from creasing okay so as you
can see they're still from shine going
on and that's what we want because we
don't want to set our face with too much
powder today because this is a dewy look
so what we're going to do next is set
our contour areas you always want to set
anything that you put cream on your face
because you don't want it to get on
anybody shirt okay so now we're going to
set our contour and I'm going to use my
favorite thing to contour right now and
this is the Black Radiance medium - like
you guys are gonna love this if you
watch my videos I love this well this is
actually light to medium I've been
liking the light to medium because it
does have these two shades
they're not super bred and I hate
anything that gets off of super bread
under Sun
on my skin it looks more like a nice
pretty orange than red makeup not moving
around and stuff you don't want that
trust me is annoying take it in that
jawline area I take it our enemy violet
press this pattern into my skin now you
concealer brush to smash my nose a
little bit using this in w50d concealer
from bags and pray for me this is also
to bring color back into my nose I'm
going to go in with the NSIC of a cloak
a bubbly and sunburst and dripping go
just because I want to be dramatic and
then I'm going to place it right up in
here we're going to jump in to priming
our eyes you can go in with groundwork
or you can go in with soft ochre
everybody knows about soft ochre
it's just to brighten your shadows up
and also to prime as well and then
ground working for more subtle looks and
I'll probably go with this one today
groundwork due to the fact that I want
this to be a more broadly looking on a
wood anything to really pop so I'm going
to be taking my e 27th brush from morphe
to blend this out and a little bit goes
a long way you don't really need a lot
so groundwork as you can see is a
perfect color for deeper complexion I
always set it with a color that mimics
the Paint Pot all of my shadows that I
am going to be working with today I want
to be super easy for me to blend and
that's why I do that step as well so
that's pretty that's on there pretty
good and you always want to close up the
peg hot after this
like don't let me sit open don't lose
the pop or until everybody just sit over
a long night because it will dry out
anyway throw in your life and this is
the morphe 35o okay I'm going to take
this up right here and I'm going to set
that one be with using a brush that has
nothing to do with shadow this is
actually a concealer brush but this just
helps me pack things in and make
everything look super blended this is an
elf concealer brush by the way taking
that shade placing it pretty much all on
the lid and I don't want to drag it up
in a second how do you get to your body
again and this brush right here is the
morphe four-for-one brush but make sure
this color shows up so this is basically
your transition shade you want to place
it in the area that you want it first
and then when I all the way up in Nestle
guys like my makeup have came such a
long way I was looking so dusty and
broad cheap if you guys want to see and
video amici chatting with you guys about
why even started a YouTube channel let's
dip emo another tan shade this one right
here and I'm going to use the same brush
pressing it because you don't want a lot
of fallout going on and you may also
want to tap any excess off okay same
brush
and no little clue over here the RV I'm
thinking about you in gaja baby I'm on
solid ow
and I don't really know the color
because once again I'm gluing them down
I'm going to take my finger and pretty
much going to press this into my lids
and I'm going to go in with the m4 three
three just to help blend out the harsh
lines even oh yeah who will break your
face
Oh
to apply some mascara I really like this
I look over just going to run with a
sensational lash by Maybelline I know
this is a kind of pop lipstick in 1629 a
little bit colored like the names
because they don't have names but that's
the pretty one and I'm going to mix it
with a nude and I will put some brown on
the outer part
I don't really know fully doing okay so
I don't care for the eye I'm going to be
honest with you a little wipe this off
laughs and I win with the lid when I set
my face with the True Match super
blendable powder and it's in the shade
in seven and this is just so a computer
more clean finish and I like mixing it
with my mineralize skinfinish powder I
just feel like this one is to read but
this one fits my undertone but still I
feel like to life so I like mixing these
two that is pop go from lashes and I
bought you from Walmart they come five
in a pack thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys
nobody gets me Wow for your body good
