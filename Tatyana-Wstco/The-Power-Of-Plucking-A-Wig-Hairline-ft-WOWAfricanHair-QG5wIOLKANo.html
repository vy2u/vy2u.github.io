video today I have my bow African wig on
and I'm going to customize it today just
so we can look a little bit more
realistic you see how harsh that part is
on that unit I can't deal with that so
we're going to show you guys what I'm
going to show you guys the power of
plucking now as you can see I already
went in and I started you know doing my
thing or whatever and I just want you to
know before you start you need to take a
deep breath and you need to trust in the
process and you also need a great pair
of tweezers to do this tedious as
process because it is the most annoying
thing but once again you just have to
trust yourself and know that you know
what you're looking for when you do
Rockaway or if you're looking for to get
inspiration from a hair line go look at
your favorite like person that has like
a frontal owned or whatever the case may
be and kind of try to mimic that or even
mimic your own hair line depends on if
you are in love with your hair line or
not so anyway you just need to make sure
you understand that you don't want to
continue to pluck in the same spot
because that's how you get like patches
and you don't want that you want to move
around and you want to make sure you
comb out the hair so you can see all of
that extra nests come out of that area
so you don't feel like you're over
plucking so just make sure you are
careful because this is lace and you can
snug and pull and put a hole into your
lace and that is a no-no because as soon
as that happens you're gonna be so over
it and you're probably gonna be ready to
throw the wig across the room trust me
it happened to me so many times when I
was learning how to basically get a
frontal to look you know realistic but
yeah so as you can see I'm using
hairspray to lay my waist down and if
you guys are new to my channel you're
probably like what the hell are you
doing but you know that method that got
to be glued method well same thing well
not this got to be glue but the got to
be glue hairspray you know how people
use their hairspray so that hairspray to
lay their lace down well I'm just using
my salon graphics Tim max holding spray
to do the same thing I love doing this
and I don't like using the gossipy glue
products but this works for me so you
can find it at Walmart if you are
interests
it in doing the same method but yeah so
as you can see you know I was filling
the loose wave but I wasn't really for
loose wave during this day so I decided
that wonder straighten it and I felt
like you guys would appreciate it
because you know you'll be able to see
how well this hair strands and it's
straightened so beautifully this hair is
so soft
I have no cons with it at all I
currently have it on right now and it's
just amazing like I'm so here for this
unit I feel like the length is so
perfect it's a really low maintenance
wig you can just put water back onto the
hair just to revert it back to his loose
wave and before I straightened it I
added a little bit of water onto the
hair just to see if the loose wave will
be a little bit more defined and it was
so so pretty so just know that this hair
strands really well it reverts back to
its loose wave texture when you put
water on it and it holds a really nice
curl as well so yeah you can't go wrong
with this unit it has four combs it has
the little gel straps in the back so you
can make it fit really snug and it has a
good amount it has a good amount of lace
parting so you can do different kind of
styles with it or whatever you want to
do I like doing little updos with this
unit as well it looks really good and I
feel like the combs are placed in the
perfect spots and you're not like you
know getting stabbed in the head by any
combs that's like in awkward places so
I'm really here for it as you can see
I'm curling away from my face towards
the top of my hair and this is just so I
can get that volume that I mean at the
top of my head and yeah so I'll let you
guys enjoy the rest of the music because
I feel like everything else is stuffing
I will be talking to you guys towards
the end so I'll see you baby soon
alright babe so this is the final slow
leg I just want you guys to know how
much I'm in love with this mic this is
like the perfect length for me I love it
like cuz I'll be getting bored when it
comes to long hair and like look at this
just look at this you can do a popping
bang you have your bang like doing all
concert craziness or you can do like a
little cute up dudes like this like you
just can't go wrong with this hair
length and it's so cute and it's
definitely perfect for the summertime
because why nobody wants to have 26
inches down their back every day every
day in the summertime so this is a wig
you can take it on and off how I removed
my old units is just by using water
spray it around the perimeter and it
just lifts up because this is a hair
spray method depending on how many how
much hairspray you put on your unit this
can last up to two days I just used my
mega whole salon graphics hairspray
today this is the Tim max hold you can
get this from Walmart but it usually I'm
put these two together this is the
Fantasia liquid mousse mega hold spritz
and I'll put them on my lace as well as
my skin like around the perimeter of my
forehead and today I kind of shied away
from doing that so much because I did
have a full face on and I just didn't
feel like my I didn't want my makeup to
be melting off and having hairspray
rolled down my face so I just use this
for today but I usually use both of
these and this method lasts for at least
like two days
it's a hairspray method so anyway if it
doesn't lift up just add a little bit
more hairspray and use your blow dryer
to lay it down properly
but yeah this hair is so bomb like
really really bomb you can put it up in
a ponytail if you want to and as you can
see it straightens really well all of
their information
