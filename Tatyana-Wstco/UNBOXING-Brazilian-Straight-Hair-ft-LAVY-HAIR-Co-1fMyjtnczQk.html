some more hair to share with you ladies
and a long bundles from laughing hair
company so I have two 24s and two 22s
and an 18 inch frontal array so this is
how we season here it has laddie hair
company on the Scopes bag that's so cute
and it says 100% virgin human hair you
can store your bundles back into the bag
because it closes up and it's so
adorable
I'll just having here comes like this I
see that I have a big hat I could use
another way cap oh my fig this isn't 24
and if they have a little hard hanging
off their bundles letting you know their
email phone number website their
Instagram and to let you guys know that
this is superior great hair and we have
the blimp self 24 24 22 so freaking wash
their hands because I'm thinking about
doing pink like pesto hair type of stew
and I don't want a wave with an ear at
all and I just want something pretty
bone straight silky that's going to fly
in the wind so I decided to get some
straight bundles soft but low E no bed
ends pretty straight up I'm gonna be
doing this film is really soon on a car
in process a little bit later I've been
locked in here for my birthday which is
May 24th so yeah so okay well over the
video so this is another 22 inch it has
a little bump in it but it's just
because I'm sure having had these uh
bundles like folded up in a little small
bag which is perfectly fine I don't care
when I have straighten this hair I'm
sure it's gonna be amazing
super soft again this is another 22 inch
from them no dead ends no free pieces no
straight pieces and this is how much
you're getting on the 22 inch bundles so
if you guys are liked it's not familiar
with virgin hair and don't understand
how it works usually the longest bundles
have the smallest amount of hair just
athlete
five for them I'll leave get four
because if you're dealing with like
outlets after like 20 to 24 you need
about my 45 bucks remember you have been
famous for another time this is 24 inch
so this is how much hair is in a 24 inch
this is how big the bundle is and I'll
squeeze the 22 inch so the 22 inch
thicker then that's 24 and this is the
24 game so another 24 inch it's soft - I
can run my fingers right through it no
debt is I'm the board for you to stretch
it yes you can see this is the 24 this
is the 22 I'll show you the frontal
because I was about to totally forget so
this is the front it is a 13 by 4
frontal so you have a lot of lace to
work with and the baby hair is one in
this doesn't have a foul smell at all
can run my fingers through this
hopefully this hair turns out amazing I
hope to see you ladies in my next video
I love you guys so much thank you guys
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
