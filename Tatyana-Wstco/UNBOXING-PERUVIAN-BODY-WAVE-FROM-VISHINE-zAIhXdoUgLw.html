unboxing video and I have here from
Bichon again I've rocked their deep wave
texture before and now I'm rocking their
Peruvian body wave texture I did their
deep wave I don't know how long ago that
was but it took my color really well I
love how natural the hair looked in its
natural state have two videos for that
hair so I'll put that in the description
box below so you can check that out but
let's begin with four bundles and a
frontal so 226 at 24 and at 22 18 inch
frontal so we're going to start by
opening than 220 fixes so they have
labels they have their store name how
you press store code one here and this
hair is really soft it doesn't have a
bad smell it's enough hair on this 24 26
pinch at four bundles foam I should be
able to get a natural installation with
this the beards on this hair I see 1926
and this is 24 so it looks like the same
amount of here and these bundles so yeah
this is really soft ah so the hair is
matching perfectly together
and the lesser is the exact same I'm
really excited to work with this I'm
probably gonna do like purple with this
hair or something like that but I'm
excited so this is 22 inch and the 22
inch has way more on it than the 26 in
the 24 that's how that looks really
pretty
no bad in snow foul smell really happy
with me shop this is another 26 inch
really pretty released off I'm going to
show you guys the frontal metal so this
is how the frontal looks it has a net
but this is how the frontal looks have
to work with and the density is a really
nice off so I'm gonna do a lot of
plucking and tweezing to this thank you
