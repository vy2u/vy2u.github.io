updated how about date
I don't know what I want to call this
but let's get started so I'm starting
with my favorite product ever which is
charge water from Mac I always try to go
and purchase another product if this
runs out and I end up hating it and I
always go back to charge waters so this
is some luminizing drops from Sephora
and I don't know exactly what this one
is called but I will listen in a comment
or the description box below so you can
check that out if you want to so it's
like only twelve bucks in ain't like
breaking your pockets and nothing and it
does the SAC same thing as the other
ones this foundation is so popping this
is Mac Pro Longwear foundation in NC
5000 mg you guys know that I was using
my all day luminous foundation oh my god
you know random or even about that but
this is like the perfect undertone for
my skin it's really nice and by the time
like I put all my like contour powders
and my setting powder and my blunt blush
on that I also used to contour with it's
just like the perfect you know pop anise
that I need because it's not too red
it's not too orange and it doesn't leave
me looking like an open Loompa but yeah
I like it I love it and it's really nice
and I love the the consistency and well
is it the word consistency where am I
was talking about the coverage yeah I
love the coverage not the consistence
anyway so yeah so that's basically what
I do and I use my Beauty Blender it's
who actually get this the Lalas finish
going on it's this foundation is so nice
you guys know like you know you should
have a variety of foundation it's like
the foundations that I really love is
all day luminous I'm in the shade Macau
but I feel like I need to mix those two
together sometimes because I am getting
lighter because it's almost over time
and yeah so okay I'll explain that in a
second but anyway I'm using my la girl
Pro concealer and toffee right now
and you guys know all about this and I'm
just using this to highlight cover up
all my dark eye circles and just to you
know make some areas glow that needs to
be glowing you know anyway so back to my
foundation thing so okay so I have like
two like high-end foundations like the
Mac Pro Longwear now the my all day
luminous and I also use true match
foundation in this shade in a cappuccino
you should just have a little like a
little more foundations just because
some days you don't want to wear your
super expensive ones and other days you
want to just you know throw on something
maybe even a BB cream or whatever but I
haven't found me like a perfect BB cream
I have a really sensitive skin so I like
to stick things that don't really bring
me out I don't really like to try too
much too much but I really like like a
lightweight foundation nothing too cakey
nothing to like matte and I really like
how this foundation looks on my skin
okay so yeah enough about foundations
now this is my airspun powder you guys
know that I'm a freaking fanatic when it
comes to this like every time I try to
go and buy me a new setting set a
setting powder for my concealer it's
just too cakey and it just I just go
back to this one I will think about
purchasing the Sasha Buttercup one I'll
let you guys know if I like it or not
but I don't know I don't know I don't
know don't quote me on that are you guys
using the Sasha Buttercup one let me
know how do you feel about okay is it
too cakey do you think I'm gonna hate it
and okay so now you see me using the
black radiance medium to dark contour
palette I had this in my makeup it for a
very long time but I just never used it
and then I was just looking at the
sculpted shade one day and I was like
let me try to use this so what you see
me doing is setting it in the areas
where I'm going to be using the darker
contour shade and I also use blunt blush
still to contour but I'm going in with
both of those shades now and I really
like doing this and this shade the scope
to shade I just lay this down on those
areas that I'm going to contour and just
because I don't like trying to put the
super' darker shades on my skin
because it can look a little muddy if
you're not careful and I really do like
contour powder powders to contour versus
creams it just depends on how I'm
feeling and lately I've been feeling the
powder contour but sometimes they can
look a little chalky or muddy so I try
to lay the sculpting shade down first
and it looks really flawless after doing
that so now as you can see I'm going in
with the contour shade now and I'm doing
exactly what I'm just just explaining so
yeah I hope you guys are doing great
it's so late it's 11:17 I was almost
like dead sleep and I was just like
bitch get up and do your voiceover
because you want to put a video up
tomorrow so you need to do the voice
over there so this video will be
uploading the night and then I'll have
it up in the morning time for my babies
yeah yeah all right so as you can see
I'm continuing to contour like do I need
to speed this up oh yes but this part up
cool cool cool so yeah as you can see
I'm using a flat foundation brush to
actually contour now first and then I'm
gonna go in with a angle brush I'm gonna
blow that out so yeah I'm trying to do a
little different steps you know try two
different techniques try to use
different brushes for different reasons
you know and I like how it turned down I
like it I like it I've been doing this a
lot lately and it's been working out how
do you feel yes I look at that look at
that look at that you see that cheekbone
chisel
thank you
alright so now I'm going in with my
Mac's mineralize skin finish powder to
set my face as you know you guys know I
love this powder I feel like this is the
part where it makes my complexion
perfect because sometimes when I use
Macau and this I look super super red or
maybe he's just mean maybe he's just now
I got a new foundation I'm just trying
to find a flaw in ours all day luminous
and ain't none damn wrong with that
foundation it fits me good I'm just
certain days I feel like I'm lighter
certain days I feel like I'm darker and
it is what it is but you know both of
the foundations work perfectly and yeah
so I'm just using that mineralized
skinfinish on the powder brush to dust
away my foundation to blend everything
and make everything look seamless and
flawless and this is basically what I do
when I want to beat my face nowadays
ladies so I'm using my that glow kick to
highlight from ABH and yeah if you guys
want to see this eye look let me know
thumbs up this video and I'll see you
soon back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
