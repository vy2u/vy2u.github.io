done as you can see and when I just used
on my brows is the dip brow pomade from
ana Sofia
so that's what I have on my brows and
I'll just use the angled brush just to
fill them in and I have a little
concealer underneath my eyes and around
this area just because there's a ton of
discoloration on my face because those
breakouts look because of the breakouts
that I was going through socks didn't
have time to come on here looking
extremely crazy mix and I'm going to use
being will should I do this first yeah I
should do this first
yeah so I'm going to add the Smashbox
primer in my t-zone area I plan on doing
a favorites video after this one so I
don't want you know me to look for Uli's
I don't want myself to look oily after
filming all of this because I'm sure
it's going to get really hot in here in
a second but it's not that hot right now
I don't really like the benefit primer
but I really do love this one and of
course I love the YSL one but it's just
like to spend fifty five dollars of a
primer and she's like do you really want
to do that Korona anyway so I'm going to
go in with some color correcting
concealer just a smidge
because I can't go overboard with this
this product is from la girl Pro
concealer and this is once again the
color correcting I'm going to do orange
just because I have darker spots on my
face it's going to and that product is
just basically going to cancel that
discoloration out and make it less
visible to see when I apply on when I
apply my foundation and stuff in my face
so what I'm going to use now is the fun
concealer from other girl and I'm going
to put that right on top of that just
because I like mixing the two just
because I don't want the concealer the
origin so it should be too harsh so
that's why I like doing this I've been
doing my makeup differently lately so
well how I apply and this is just be
I don't really like going in with a full
like amount of foundation all over my
face and then apply like a ton of
concealer so you're going to see in mail
is awkward to you but it works for me
rosewater this is going to be in my
favorite I got the small version just
because I didn't know if it was going to
break my skin out and all that crazy
stuff so I just wanted to do the small
bottle first before I went and purchased
the bigger bottle and trust me I've
loved this usually what I do is go back
in with my la girl concealer and fawn
eye underneath my eyes just because I
like a really bright under-eye I'm not
going to drag it down too much but I'm
going to make sure there's a generous
amount and then I'm going to put that on
my forehead put that down the bridge of
my nose on my chin and a little bit
right here in these corners right and
then what I want to do is take my Bobbi
Brown
foundation stick and expresso and I'm
going to hit the contour areas of my
face which is you know cheekbones
just add some structure down the bridge
of my nose and then this side
underneath it a little bit underneath my
lip underneath my chest on my jawline
and I thought this little hair then was
going to keep all my sideways away but I
guess not a little bit up here
definitely right here cuz I always
forget these spots
alright so should we take a little
picture like this just so this can be a
part of read thumbnail like I love it so
much this is the hourglass foundation
stick and golden almond and it's just
amazing like if I thought I was if I
went out of this I'm definitely
purchasing is a good it's awesome great
coverage it's a concealer foundation in
one type of thing just because of how
amazing the coverages and they have
great shades for all different
complexions out there great undertone
shades and stuff like that so I just
like mixing this in around these areas
that I didn't apply any contour or
highlight because this is where we want
the coverage because I have the
breakouts down here and just slightly
you know around these areas and of
course you want a flawless finish I'll
just make sure you put it in the places
where you feel like you need a little
bit more coverage you can go back in
with this product do whatever you want
to do pretty much but I'm just showing
you how been doing my makeup lately and
it's been coming out really really
flawless so what I'm going to do now is
go in with some of my rose water again
just spray the face just so it can like
give me a really nice like base for
going in with my brushes and stuff like
that and blending all of these pipes in
together and stuff
just to you know make them moist again
if you want to say but be they're cream
products so they can't really get that
dry unless you don't close up the
product which you should always close up
your makeup products because as much as
we always be spending oh you know what I
forgot to do I forgot to put this on my
face this is amazing as well when you
want my Chloe's skin but I forgot so
yeah we're just going to skip that step
today so what I'm going to do is pretty
much tap the foundation in this area
just because when I go in to blend out
the contour I do not want any of this to
be dark so I like stippling this area
out first
okay so what I'm going to do now is
start working on the contour areas and I
like doing this just because the contour
is super bright but I go in with less
powder just to set the contour just
because of how dark this contour is so I
don't have to go in with a whole bunch
of like contour powders to make my
contour more vibrant just because I've
lost it
with blending it out and stuff like that
if that makes sense to you so I just
lightly tap this area just because I
want the contour to be you know visible
so that's how that looks and this is how
this looks when Matt's blend out we'll
blend it out and I'm just going to take
it up here and then what I'm going to do
is work on this side so stipple lightly
don't go into too heavy just because you
might have to put more product and you
don't want to have to keep applying more
product if it's not necessary so go in
with a light hand and tap over this so
whatever is left on your brush from the
foundation is going to help blend this
area out so that's why I like blending
the foundations with this contour just
makes it faster makeup application also
and then now I'm going to work on my
forehead and I have not blended my
concealer out yet
if you're wondering that I'm sure you
can tell but I have not two products and
together
I always like to keep like a little
water bowl next to me while I'm doing
videos just because your Beautyblender
can get like Dreiling you and you don't
want that you want always to be dance
I'm going to do it lightly once again
because I want the highlight to be very
prominent I want you to be able to tell
the bearing Mike on my highlight and a
little bit on my nose area where that
contour was just so I can look like I
have a swimmer and knows a more snatched
nose so I kind of try to keep the
concealer like in a triangle kind of for
I don't like trying to agree I don't
want to bring it down too much and I
don't really want to bring it out too
much either
put it on the other parts that we like
to contour which is the middle of our
forehead our chin area we can clean up
our contour on whatever is left on the
sponge and then what I like to do is
just go in with a little bit more of the
Bobbi Brown right in this area go back
with the brush and I like to keep it
really really like a little bit more
darker in this area now say for this I
kind of keep it in that area that I
placed it I don't want to drag it all
the way down here because I don't want
this area to be too dark but I still
want this to look like it's just very
sculpted and snatched if you get what
I'm trying to say extra and I just might
want to be a little extra right now I'll
go to put some of this heart-shaped a
just a dot like this and then down there
all right and I'm going to take the
sponge again and lightly tap that into
this area just to brighten us up a
little bit more you guys know like I
like us you don't know that I was like a
super I let it look and if you don't
know now you know you know
this this for a extreme chiseled
effect everything was blended out to my
liking and then I just have some of the
Maybelline shine-free powder in this top
so you can find this product at Walmart
so you might want to look up one more
time and blend it out just because no
creases like I said
oily and you don't want that not the way
this weather is set up so that's how
that looks so what I'm going to do is go
in with my L'Oreal True Match and this
is just to pretty much set the contour
that's already right here the cream
contour just because I want to go in
with a super dark color first and then
again money back in snatch this nose one
more time with the powder on the other
side with the light powder underneath
the chin or the lid and now we're going
to start working with a bigger brush so
what I'm going to do is take the True
Match again right I'm going to take a
flat foundation brush and then I'm going
to press this powder in this area same
techniques for what I did for my nose
pretty much just to set the pattern I
mean set the cream contour just because
when I start going in with the bronzer I
don't want it to get muddy in patchy and
I don't want it to move around a lot so
that's why I like setting these areas
and this is the true match blendable
super beautiful powder and my shade is
in seven and go and with an angled brush
and the bronzer again and just hit these
areas
okay so that's how pretty that is that's
why I love it so much what I'm going to
do now is press this powder is
definitely I'm going to apply some blush
yes
Poppy's applying blush just lightly
though nothing too dramatic I'm going to
smash my nose using this cosmetic sponge
a twenty seven brush that needs to be
clean all of my eye brushes need to be
clean I'll probably do that tonight so I
can do more makeup videos tomorrow place
that on the lid and blow it out as much
as you want you want to use this product
so you can make sure all of your shadows
are vibrant now this is just a very more
subtle to my skin tone kind of
complexion they have other ones that are
a little bit more shimmery or either
lighter if you want your shadows to pop
those it's also pretty much Prague's
your shadows will progr your lids and
make sure your shadows are going to stay
all day and look flawless so you can use
a lighter one you use a darker one you
can use a shimmery one you could use
whatever you like but this product is
from Mac so now I like setting
Paint Pot with a shuttle that no mimics
bet just so we go in with our other
shadows this force would be like an even
kind of blend so I'm just going to take
classic and bold from the part teeth and
with my bronzer and pretty much use this
as if this was my crease shade for my
transition shade okay and I'm going to
lay that out just a smidge
and I'm going to take Coco bear and put
that in my crease and don't forget to
take it in on the inner part of your eye
just so everything can look seamless and
we're going to pick up another color I'm
going to use buck from the Naked palette
see what this color looks like just put
that on my lid cuz why not
this book though and with a little bit
of sable or a smaller blending brush try
to focus it on the outer V don't want
this to be really really intense all
over the eye and just because it has
this really pretty like burnt orange
color right here this is whimsy color
I'm going to take that on the same brush
and pretty much place they're like
harmless cool so I have fix that so what
I'm doing is just placing would be right
underneath that color that we just place
um and like that outer V the chocolate
brown color and this is just going to
add some other some more color some more
dimension to our look now I just go up
with this blending brush and then blend
this brown color into this pan that we
put in the transition this is champagne
from lorac palette
oh absolutely
Rihanna I love this color on my brow
bone it's this palette it's that 2x
deluxe a long time ago a long time ago
girl so I don't even know if that do the
same things I did underneath me on top
of my eye underneath my eye
going in with Coco bear Takes able go
and with this nude pencil this is from
where well I have to get a more high in
one because we never saved in my water
our but this is the only thing that I
have right now so I'm going to use this
or maybe I should try to use this this
Nick see
haha that work pretty nice that was NYX
eyeshadow primer or eyeshadow base and
white I like how that works so we're
going to exact ourselves or press our
novoed go into my back wheel kick and
just glow up my nose a bit for a micro
smooth powder do is spray must fix plus
in my rose water or my face we're going
to kill me because I didn't do the lip
