hope you guys are happy to see me cuz I
am happy that you are here watching me
today on this new method that I got
going on for my wig so we can look a
little bit more realistic I've been
doing this lately now this is definitely
if I have extra 15 to 20 minutes and PS
before we get into this tutorial I have
been drinking a little wine alright so
if I'd be stumbling over my words that
is why but okay so what's going on right
now guys is I actually am going to be
showing you guys this method and all you
need is a flesh tone wig cap and I need
you guys to also pick up some got to be
glue gel I'm using the yellow bottle not
the black the black bottle is the bottle
that I told you guys I hate like I felt
like I can never get any product to lay
down properly to stay with that black
bottle and I feel like it's a little bit
more liquidy than the yellow bottle so I
was really excited that I decided to
just go ahead and try the yellow bottle
and it actually did what I needed it to
do and you're going to see that for your
own two eyes so what I did is pretty
much place that around the perimeter of
my head and what I'm going to do is just
let it air dry as well as taking a
blow-dryer to it so it will be really
secure on my head when I go in to cut it
off so I need to cut all of that excess
wig cap off right there that you see me
doing right now and this is just because
you know we don't need that and we don't
need our wig to be all the way down at
our eyebrows okay now kept that that's
what's gonna happen
anyway umm so I'm just taking that off
and I'm gonna pull my ear out I'm not
gonna cut around my earring just because
this wig cap is really really thin and I
felt like if I do that then it will
start you know rolling up on me and I
don't have time if that happens to you
you will have to just go ahead and toss
the whole wig cap in the trash and start
over
okay so anyway what you need to do is
just take a little bit of foundation
powder if you are my skin tone or
complexion or whatever you want to say
because this flesh-hungry cap was way
way way too light but I felt like the
brown and the dark brown was a little
bit too dark for my scalp color so I
just pretty much use my foundation
powder so pretty much get what I needed
to get you know if that makes sense
wanna go ahead and pop this wig on now
about this hair this hair is actually
from a Lee Belle hair
it is an Aliexpress hair company this is
their water wave and I have three
bundles of 20 inches and a frontal end
and I actually made this into a wig
obviously so that's what you see on top
of my head I did braid the frontal
because I needed to get out of my way
when I was doing this process so it can
be a little bit more easier for me I
wouldn't already tweaked the frontal so
it can look a little bit more realistic
all right so now I'm just taking a
little bit of this holding spray if you
guys are oh gee subscribers you know or
lawyer you know you guys know about this
product this is Tim Max holding spray
from salon graphics and I like using
this to make sure my lace is laying down
how I need it so be laying down this is
what I like using to secure my lace some
to make it sure to make a sure to make
sure it is laying how I needed to lay I
feel like any product doesn't do the
trick for me so I like using this I
don't know why you guys tell me it
doesn't work for you I don't know what
you guys are doing wrong please use a
blow dryer to help you up you know lay
this down properly I like using my blow
dryer and cool to do that trick for me
so yeah try it out let me know how it
works but anyway and make sure you are
using the one that actually has the 10
max holding light up it has the red you
know at the bottom or whatever but
anyway um yeah so this is Ali Bell hair
I actually caught washed his hair and
let it air dry and that was how it was
when you first seen it I thought it was
all like over the place a little bit
just because I had um you know had it in
like a bag or whatever but anyway yes so
I'm just gonna brush this hair out just
so you guys can see if you guys do want
to have it brushed out this is how big
it can possibly get for you
also if you just add a little bit of
water you can make it look a little bit
more tamed
whatever you want to do you can do to
manipulate this hair this hair is really
soft it's really easy to maintain all
you need is water to make it look funky
again and once again really soft no
shedding no foul smell I don't receive
that actually bleats the loss on this
unit also so it can look a little bit
more realistic as well so I love you
guys so much thank you so much for
watching and I believe all their
information in the description box below
I really really like this hair once
again this is 20 inches I love you look
