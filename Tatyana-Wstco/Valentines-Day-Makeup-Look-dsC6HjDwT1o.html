festive Valentine's Day looks off hope
you guys enjoy today we're gonna start
off by priming our lids with Mac soft
ochre and I'm using my e19 morphe brush
to blend that out on my lids and go in
with this amazing palette the tardies
Pro palette this palette is so freaking
awesome like I love it it smells so good
the eyeshadows are super creamy the
names I will put them in the description
box in the exact order that I use them
in I don't remember the names so yeah
just make sure you check the description
box but the star of the show
is this hot pink shade right here and
it's just amazing like who doesn't want
to wear pink on Valentine's Day so I had
to put it on my eyes so anyway I'm going
to basically blend that out as much as
possible and pack that in and do a
little bit more blending and I'm using a
more dense brush to get a little bit
more color payoff in the crease and
above the crease and just you know
packing and blending packing and
blending that's what a nice eye look is
all about so I'm gonna go in with tan
from Mac it's a pigment and I'm gonna
place that on my brow bone and it just
gives this look so much life and I'm
gonna go in with my NYX glitter glue and
this glitter from Jay Katz rockin the
night in the shade champagne kisses and
then I'm gonna take 10 in the inner tear
ducts just to bring this look all
together and for my face this is la girl
Pro concealer in the shade coffee or
fawn then I realized I didn't prime my
face and I was just like well it
I'm in the middle of it anyway so let me
just finish and I'm gonna be using my
benefit pour whatever this is I'm
gonna be using that today so I'm gonna
just blend that concealer out with my
damn Beauty Blender and make sure
everything is seamless and cut you know
clean that eyes shadow look up and I'm
gonna go in with my NC 50 Pro Longwear
foundation from Mac and you guys know
that I love this found a
and excuse that hickey on my neck you
know I didn't even realize it was there
and I still didn't realize until I
completed this whole video and I was
just like oh they're gonna have to deal
with that you know 2017 don't judge me
don't judge me but yeah so now I'm gonna
go in and set that concealer because we
don't want it to crease on us and I'm
using some of my Laura Mercier mixed
with this HD powder that I got from my
beauty supply store just to give the
perfect setting powder color for myself
so yeah I really do like it and I'm
gonna go in with my black radiance
sculpting shade and I'm going to bronze
my face up and I'm gonna do the same
thing on my nose just to make my nose
look a little slimmer and just to bring
some color back in it and then I'm just
gonna clean those lines up with that
setting powder and then I'm going to
pack that into my skin not dusting it
away because I don't want that look that
dusting translucent powder away gives
and I'm going to take this fling
eyeshadow from the Smashbox bold palette
and I'm going to basically pack that
underneath my eye as well as dragging it
out as if it was a wing and it's just
gonna tie the look together I like it a
lot and I was in the middle of watching
Bates Motel like that's why I was so
into my computer but thumbs up for this
video if you watch Bates Motel or
Netflix it's so amazing I love that show
I finished the fourth season and Norman
is just crazy
I just can't stand him but yeah right
now you see me using half-baked from the
Naked palette you can either use it from
the naked one or the Naked 2 palette and
I'm just using that to highlight my nose
and as well as my Cupid's bow and I'm
taking this nude pencil in the waterline
just to give the parents that my eyes a
little bit bigger with this look rather
than using a black one that will make my
eyes a little more slimmer and tighter
and yeah I don't want that right now
and then I'm gonna outline my lips with
a brown lip liner this is cappuccino
from clean color and then I'm gonna use
a colour-pop lippie and I'm not I'm not
sure the color but I'll list it in the
description box below but this is the
lip combination that I did for this look
I'm gonna be out line my lips and this
the completed look I'm gonna talk to you
guys now and I love you thank you so
much for watching
alright guys so this is basically my
Valentine's Day inspired look that you
can recreate for your Valentine's Day
very easy simple only used about three
eyeshadows maybe four because I did put
one underneath my eyes which was that
vibrant purple color from the Smashbox
palettes so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I'm going to do my hair
really quick and do some slo-moes for
you guys I'm just gonna straighten it
and this is the same unit that I have
reviewed it was the long bob that I
created so you guys can check that out
in my previous video but I love you baby
