for this voice over so if I don't get it
this time you guys are gonna get some
freaking music okay so today is
definitely a freestyle type of video
when it comes to this hairstyle that I'm
creating today this is V Sean's hair and
I'm in love with v Sean I did so many
well I've done so many reviews for you
ladies for Vachon hair and their hair
super silky soft super silky it's very
easy to maintain it takes color well the
bleach process it takes amazing it's no
like dead ends or the hair doesn't get
messed up or anything so that's what you
should know about V Sean if you're
interested in purchasing from this hair
company I'll list all their information
in the description box below if you guys
want to check this out
if you guys want to check them out now
what I'm gonna be doing is doing some
side bangs with this hair that's what I
thought I was going to be doing but then
I realized my girl you know yourself and
you're not about to want all this hair
up in your face so then I just made the
side bang a little longer than the
average side bang so when I do want to
put the hair in the middle part the hair
in the middle I'm able to do so because
the bangs aren't too short so if you're
like me just make sure you do that same
technique because you don't want to have
to be stuck with wearing your hair in
just one type of style because you
created the bangs way too short on the
sides now what I'm going to be doing
because this is loose wave hair I have
to go in and straighten it with a flat
iron just so I can get some of the loose
wave texture out of the hair so when I
go in and curl it with my Wonder half
inch barrel from Revlon the wave pattern
won't be in the way you know what I'm
saying so while I'm curling the hair you
can see that I don't really want to type
type of curl like a really tight curl
because I've been doing a really like
I've been doing tight curl looks for a
very long time now
even when I'm off a camera when I'm
going out I'm always curling my hair
super tight
I just didn't want that look this time I
wanted a more effortless look and then
because I knew that I didn't want that
side bang I knew that I was going to end
up having to layer the hair in a nice
way so the bangs can fall really good
and so I can show you guys how well the
middle part is going to look if you guys
want to do this style okay so right here
you see me alternating the curls I'm
going to be curling the hair away from
my face and then some towards my face
and then I'm going to be layering the
hair a lot in this video I did speed it
up because it took me literally like ten
minutes to cut these layers in but what
I will tell you guys I'm just pulling
the hair out and cutting the hair in a
diagonal I felt like you guys really
couldn't even see what I was doing so
that was part of the reason why I was
come speeding this video up but let me
know if you guys want to in-depth
tutorial on how I cut my layers like
this because I do have a layered
tutorial but it's definitely not like
this one that one is more of a blunt
straight across layer top that type of
layered look looks really good with
curled like really curled hair really
tight curled hair lord have mercy I need
to get off this video ladies because
it's been a long day as you can hear in
this voice over I cannot get my words
together but this is pretty much all I'm
gonna be doing I'm gonna flip the hair
over just to see if I miss any pieces
and of course I did so I got to go in
and chop some more and yeah mess up the
top make sure the middle is looking cute
and this is pretty much all that I'm
gonna be doing with my bichon hair for
now I'm going to style the hair a little
bit more of course you know when I'm not
on camera and look at how awkward I am I
just curled that side but didn't curl
that other side let go girl anyway I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much for watching ladies and I'll
see you ladies in my next one all their
information will be listed in the
description box below some merchants
