okay so today is going to be one of my
hair I know I have a lot of questions
about my hair color and one here I'm
rocking so let's jump right into it so
this hair is from white label hair is
their stand resilient body wave range
and this hair holding up so well I've
had this hair in for maybe a month isn't
change now and I just love how it took
my color
I have minimum two no shedding when it
when I did this process this dyeing and
bleaching process but I did have one
problem with one of the bundles
I actually bleached one of the bundles a
little bit lighter than the rest of them
because I wanted to highlight intersect
with my hair because I don't want to
damage their completely I probably
wouldn't go any lighter because I have
problems with just dyeing it to make
like an orange brassy kind of color and
I just don't want to deal with shedding
or messing up the hair period because
his hair is so flowy bouncy and I just
love it
I've done platinum with hair before and
I really didn't have any problem with
the bundles like how I fix that problem
I just did deep conditioning the hair I
don't know if you conditioning would
help if I try to dye his hair Tour
platinum at all so that's why I braided
this hair at eight out of the ten
because I had that problem with one of
the bundles but minimum two notes
shedding the bundle that I had actually
did the highlights and a little bit of
that bundle in my and I'm not receiving
any shedding at all the hair sways in
the wind it blows in the wind and moves
around it's bouncy as flowy I love this
hair after the bleaching process I'm not
receiving a body wave anymore with his
hair so I don't wear in his natural
state that's another reason why I wanted
to give it a out of the ten but overall
this hair is a really great virgin hair
it doesn't have a mass smell it was true
to its length the 28 inches were super
long I got the length to 28 and 26 of 22
enough frontal I'll put all the exact
inches and information in the
description box which are all flats
really long and
hair I love this hair curl but right now
it's just straightened but how I got
this color because I know that's really
what you guys want to know I use our
Dell dyes I use two shades I use
mahogany and crimson red and then I mix
those two dots together I bleach the
hair up to me it was like one or two
shades lighter than a one P if you want
if you don't know what everyone B is
it's like a natural brown color so it's
still kind of chocolatey Brown type of
film mahogany made it deep and rich in
color because I didn't want crimson red
to pop too much but I did want it to
have a nice red tint to little when the
Sun hits it when light hits it it's
really a beautiful warm blood-red kind
of color conditioning shampoo that I use
on this hair is the Tresemme deep
moisture shampoo conditioner any serums
on this hair or hair sprays or anything
like that I saw the hair last really boy
when you don't clip all that gunk and
junk in it to always keep it maintained
virgin hair just continue to co wash it
frequently do trans here and there wrap
it up at night it is a wig store in a
nice place so all the information will
be in the description box I hope you
guys enjoyed this video thank you so
much for watching thank you for all your
support I appreciate you all so much and
I'll see you guys in my next video
please leave in the description box of
whatever else you want to see I have
some other hand that I'm excited to show
you guys so I hope you guys are ready to
see that it does have some weight to it
and deep voice I hope you got excited
