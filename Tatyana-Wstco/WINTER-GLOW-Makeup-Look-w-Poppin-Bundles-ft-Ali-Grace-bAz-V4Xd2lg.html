video today I'm gonna be showing you
guys hair and makeup today I was just
doing my makeup because I was bored and
I decided that I wanted to pop this
wiggling that I created with my Allie
grace hair so I will talk to you guys
about that in a second but let's just
jump into this makeup look so what I'm
gonna be doing is applying this Coco
bear shade from makeup geek or either
Coastal Scents first in my transition
area and then I'm gonna go in with Lana
it's a brighter like orange tan kind of
shade and this is just so we can just
hiked up the pigmentation and make sure
it's visible on my skin tone so yeah so
you want to just blend that out with a
nice fluffy blending brush and we're
gonna work on concealer because I really
didn't know what direction I was going
for it today but uhm yeah so let's work
on this face I'm using my Tarte
concealer and then I'm gonna go in with
my the Tarte concealer is in the shade
tan sand and I'm gonna go in with my Mac
strobe cream to place that on my face so
I can get this glowy skin that I mean
honey I love this product I love it this
is in the shade gold light also and it's
by Mac if you guys didn't know that yeah
so all the products will be listed in
the description box below now this is
the NARS concealer the NARS creamy
concealer and this is in the shade
caramel so I'm gonna do the typical
highlight and conceal that I do which is
underneath the eyes on the bridge of my
nose on my chin and all that good stuff
and then I'm going to go ahead and
contour I use my NW 50 cup my NW 50
concealer from mac to contour today but
then I realized I want to actually go in
with my a BH foundation stick to contour
as well so you're gonna see me do that
in a second and I'm using the color
walnut to do that
I was jamming to either nosey or drink
so if you see me acting crazy and that's
why so what I'm gonna do is just blend
all of that in but I'm gonna go in with
my Lancome foundation on the back of my
hand and this is just to warm up the
product before I place it on my skin I'm
gonna blend in my concealer in my
contour just so you know it doesn't dry
out on me or anything like that and then
what I'm gonna do next is just on
applying the foundation to my face using
the butt of my Beauty Blender of course
it wouldn't be a Tatiana westcote
tutorial if I didn't had any more
concealer so I'm gonna go back in with
my Tarte concealer and just make sure
I'm really bright underneath that eye
you guys know I love my highlight to be
pop it you know you guys know I like a
super super bright highlight so I feel
like they need another concealer in
between tans an and the next color up if
that makes sense
so I'm just gonna blame my foundation in
and you know make sure everything looks
good and I'm gonna add a little bit more
contour same product the foundation
stick from a BH and the shade walnut and
I'm just gonna blend that out using a
real techniques buffing brush I love
this brush guys so nice
make sure when you blend stuff out you
just want to go back using your beauty
blender just to make sure everything is
seamless and nothing is giving harsh
line to you if you do not want that when
you are applying your makeup now I'm
going to set my under not under 9 I'm
gonna set my under eyes using my Laura
Mercier powder I love this powder you
guys know I am thinking about getting
the Sasha Buttercup because I'm just
like why not I have to order off the
Amazon though so that's what's taking so
long to do so I just want to try out
that powder I've never tried it out
before a day in my life so I'm gonna go
in with my True Match setting powder and
in 8 and also using my Sephora micro
smooth powder and this is just to set my
face I am combination skin so I do have
to set so my makeup doesn't move around
yeah so that's why I do that and it also
helps make sure that there's no flash
back with the Laura Mercier powder any
if that is gonna be a problem you know
so I'm just gonna use my stay map and a
flat powder just to chisel out my face a
little bit more add color back to my
skin and add some dimension and
definition all that jazz so I'm gonna go
back to the eyes because I was like I
know what kind of look I want to do so I
decided that I wanted to just clean up
the center kind of make me a bigger lid
space to work with and I'm gonna be
using this jacket held power to take
this really pretty maroon shade to pop
that right in the center you see that
those coming like Marone shades in that
little Becca palette yeah I'm using one
of those
so I'm just pressing this right into my
leg that's how you get the most
intensity when you're trying to work
with a color like this and also that
concealer helps it pop a lot more and
the consider that I used to cut out like
the center of my lid is the tart shape
tape so I'm just going to make sure I go
back and forth with my blending brushes
to actually like make sure there's no
harsh lines or anything like that I'm
gonna use the shade not just to blow
that up blow that out a little bit more
it's a tedious process just going back
and forth making sure there's no harsh
lines making sure the tensity the color
intensity is there I'm gonna be packing
blending packing blending so it's a real
tedious process when it comes to makeup
but trust me it's going to make sure
that you're looking Slade and you know
what you're doing you know what I'm
saying so I'm gonna let you enjoy the
music because it's just the back and
forth process like I just told you I'm
gonna blow out my bottom um underneath
my waterline I'm gonna blow that out
with the same colors so I just enjoyed
this part and I'll come back on if I'm
doing something so I kind of realized
that during this part I can actually be
talking to you guys about my hair cuz I
know you guys probably have a lot of
questions about what's going on with
this front so okay well let me tell you
so frontal looks crazy because it's me
but I didn't add a stocking cap
underneath it and I feel like that
played a major part and I also plugged
it a little bit too much in the front
I've been doing this different technique
with my frontal so this is like a trial
and error but okay - the frontal the
hair quality is amazing
so this hair is actually from ally grace
hair I'm in love with this hair
companies hair this is definitely one of
the top fives if you guys ask me what's
my favorite hair companies or Aliexpress
or you know just a favorite hair company
in general that was once only expressed
and their quality is really really nice
it would definitely be ally grace in one
of these top five numbers so I don't
even think I have a top five but I know
it was peerless is one of them and Ally
grace has to be the second favorite so
that says a lot in itself right there I
would definitely recommend you guys do
your research
you know that jazz but the hair quality
is really really nice
I forgot what texture I have in I will
link it in the description box below I
have three bundles and a frontal and
from this hair company so yeah it's
really really nice and soft I'm gonna
add some clips of me curling the hair
also but I just wanted to let you guys
know that Ellie grace hair is definitely
poppin and I have three other textures
from this hair company I will be having
those videos up really soon so make sure
you follow subscribe and turn your
notifications on so you are notified
once that video is live but yeah their
information will be linked in the
description box below if you are
interested to know anything else about
I'll be grace
alright babe so I'm gonna go back in
with my same app and not flat powder to
bronze on my skin bring some color back
and add some more definition and just
make sure I'm looking real snatch okay
so I'm gonna go in with my Becca palette
to highlight I love this palette it's
perfect for traveling it's like all of
your mini favorite highlighters in one
little palette and it's perfect I'm
gonna fill in my brows with my micro I
think this is like the NYX micro brow
pencil I don't know I will list it in
the description box I love love this
brow pencil pencil this is in the shade
pressed oh by the way it's like the
inexpensive
version of the APH brow pencil after
like I will never pick up and it an
expensive brow product because of this
item right here I feel like it does
exactly what those high-end products do
and I feel like they do it this one
actually does better you know but that's
just my personal opinion so you know
yeah yeah so just make sure you know
snatching the brows I'm gonna card the
brows out of course and all that jazz
and I'm gonna go back in dusting off
that setting powder underneath and
making sure I'm not looking crazy so
there's no flashback and all of that
all right so I'm gonna spray my face
with mac's fix+ and this is just to get
this powdery look off of my face because
I hate it because I have to use a lot of
powders because I am combination skin so
I don't like sleeping through throughout
the day so this just to make sure all
that powdery look is toned down so you
make sure you purchase some mac fix+ if
you don't purchase anything else from
mac you definitely should get that fixed
plus because it's gonna set your makeup
and make it stay for make it look really
fresh and also it's gonna also make your
makeup last longer I'm gonna use a white
eyeliner in my waterline and you guys
know this is my thing now I just feel
like it's has every look together for me
personally and it also makes my eyes
look bigger so I like it a lot yeah and
I'm going to just blend everything out
make sure everything looks really
seamless and effortless so yeah just
make sure you hit the finish touches the
finishing touches I also highlighted my
brow bone as you
and it's time for this lip combination
so I'm using naturally transform and a
lip product from clean color
I forgot this color I'll list it in the
description box below just to put some
color onto my lips and then I'm also
gonna use NYX butter gloss and cookie
butter and I'm also gonna take my lip
liner in downtown view em downtown
beauty this is NYX lip liner in downtown
beauty and I'm just gonna use that to
outline my lips and I'm also going to go
and with the next product like I said
and use my Victoria's Secret I want to
say is sugar baby lip gloss to top
everything off
as some mascara and pop my falsies on
because that's important okay you need
your falsies and baby I'm gonna fix up
my hair and all that good stuff
and Ally Gray's hair information will be
linked in the description box below I
love this hair company's hair like you
don't even understand and so flawless

other textures but I love you Ali great

thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you baby soon by the way I want to
mention that if I would have had
actually dusted off all the makeup that
was on my frontal and laid the baby
hairs down it wouldn't have looked at
screwsie as it does right now but the
next frontal that I put up is going to
slay okay I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
