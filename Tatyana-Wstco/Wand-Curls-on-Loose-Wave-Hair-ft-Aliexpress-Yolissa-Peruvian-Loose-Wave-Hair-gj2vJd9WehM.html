today to talk to you guys I am in love
with this hair from Ulises hair company
it is an Aliexpress hair company and
guess what I actually tried a I actually
tried their straight hair and it was
really nice and it was short lengths it
was a 360 frontal and I really didn't
like it I actually bleached that hair to
like a purple type of blonde type of
like it was like a highlighted situation

listed on post or put a picture of it
right there look at that slay yes big

some more hair from this hair company

have in 224 222 s
of their Peruvian body wave I believe
all the exact links will be listed in
the description box below and the exact
links will be below if I am butchering
them and yeah but other than that
flawless hair easy to maintain all I do
with this hair is I just go wash it
honestly and this is this natural state
so I'm really happy with this hair it's
very easy to maintain there's nothing
too crazy but today I want to go and put
some curls in this hair like not curls
but like wand curls so I guess yeah
curls um and right now what I'm doing is
putting some serum in the hair now in
real life like it doesn't look dry or
anything and it's really pretty but for
some reason when I just went and looked
at my camera it looked hella like dry
like not have a dry but it just looked
like it needed some type of like serum
in it or whatever so I'm just using my
organic coconut serum and I love this
stuff
because it smells like heaven my
favorite scent is coconut coconut
anything is my thang thumbs up this
video if you guys love coconut and if
you don't anyway I just want to show you
guys how well this hair looks in its
natural state which is how it looks
right now and then now I'm just going to
wander oh these little pieces really
quick so you guys can see how well this
hair holds crow
