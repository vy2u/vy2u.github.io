going to be showing you guys how I
customize my best lace wigs unit to look
like this just because it was cool and
all how it was but I couldn't wear it
like that every day just because I
didn't really care for the parting space
on this unit it really wasn't you know
to my liking and it'll already kind of
came with a part and then it was really
hard for me to finesse the part and get
it how I wanted even though if you're
trying to customize your own part all
you have to do is wash the unit and then
lay it part your hair where you want it
lay it down with some water and some
moves and call it a day and probably a
little bit of hair spring but I don't
really like putting hairspray on my hair
or my wigs or my ways whatever the case
is so yeah so this is their great hair
bob lace front wigs summer hair
b.o.b 0:04 is the style number 150
percent density silk straight Brazilian
virgin hair gray Bob lace front wig um
this is the person that actually had it
on in this picture so you guys can check
out their website to see if that's
something that you would like this is
how the unit came like I said it was
parted over there and you know how as
girls we have a specific side that we
like part of our heroine you know like
one side is just like a big no-no and
then the other side is just like yeah
this is the side that I'm part of my
hair one that was the case with this
unit I didn't like the side that they
had this hair parted on so I could not
rock it you know oh I just couldn't get
with the program so I try to finesse it
for you guys and show you a way that you
can customize a way that you may not
really like you know when you receive it
and it's just my damn bitch I spent my
coin but the hair quality is good it's
really thick you know the UH the wig
fits really snug
it has comes it has drawstrings it has
band or like this stuff you know to keep
always thinner like it's on your head
right so this is what you can
you can tie it to a bank or you can just
Vanessa watch it and then flip it over
to the other side it was really really
dramatic when I first received this wing
just because like I recorded it I
recorded me taking it out of the box and
they're not trying to style it for you
guys it just really wasn't turning out
how I wanted it to go so I just snatched
that off threw it to the side and
then I brought it back out today and
this is how I'm going to wear it and I
love it just imagine you put in my
little scarfs like I'm like one of those
cars that has like this big knot on the
front like that with this Bank girl will
be looking so but I love you I hope you
guys take something from this video best
lace wigs information will be listed in
the description box below I'm going to
be doing these slo-moes real quick so
enjoy the video and I will see you in my
next one bye so I'm just gonna pop this
on just like that and that's how easy it
is to put it on the way home girl like
don't think too hard about it work it so
I can fit you you may not have to make
the elastic bands really as tight as I
have to my head is just a little tiny so
I kind of like making it really snug on
me I actually put some layers on this
hair so if it looks really choppy to you
yes that was because of me
make bangles out of it it's kind of
gonna be messy bangs I don't want
anything perfect small triangle I'm
gonna make sure this is centered
freighting this is pretty much how much
hair I'm gonna have in my thing I don't
want it to bangy look in if that makes
sense
I don't want it thick like I don't want
Nicki Minaj bangs is basically what I'm
trying to say so I'm gonna cut it long
because you never know what could happen
this is how much I'll cut it off so far
we're just gonna put that down there I'm
gonna spread the bangs out to see what
is given
and that should be good enough for me
okay okay and I'm going to put some
water on it just so I can like look like
it's presentable about filling Tina
Turner right now has faced a life of
poverty controversy jail time and
trailblazing success in the music world
I think this is share enough for me you
know just because when you make bangs
this part can be really really thick
sometimes so you have to go in with your
shares and finesse it a little bit okay
so you don't have to keep putting heat
on it to make it lay flat if you feel
like it's not getting flat enough by
your flat irons nine times out of ten is
because you need to go in with some
sheers and you know then some of that
hero because it was looking like Nicky
my baby laughs I had to take a break and
talk to you guys on Instagram live so if
you guys see me why is the Grimlock show
