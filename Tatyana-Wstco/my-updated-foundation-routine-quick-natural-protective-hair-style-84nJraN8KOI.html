you guys so much and I feel the vibes
okay today we're going to be showing you
guys weird I always say we like you're
all here with me doing my makeup with me
but today I'm gonna be showing you guys
this hair look hopefully I combine it in
this video because I got a tan I am NOT
as yellow anymore
my undertone is not as yellow anymore so
I'm gonna be showing you guys a new fave
foundation not being using because
during the time that I purchased that
foundation I couldn't wear it because
the undertone was just way too right but
now that fits me perfectly so we'll be
doing a giveaway really really soon so
make sure you guys subscribe if you guys
do love what you see or you follow me on
instagram because I'm always posting on
there I love you guys and if you're
interested to see this look please
continue to watch alright so let's get
it poppin so we got the hair in the
ponytail already as well this is my
natural hair I'm just gonna use some
braiding hair to get this look for the
hairstyle and you can get some kinkle on
braiding hair from your local beauty
supply store for only 99 cents I
actually have a video on my channel
showing you guys how to do this but I
just wanted to give you guys kind of
like an updated version of it cuz I feel
like I've been doing it better lately so
I'm just using the rubberband that it
already comes with to wrap around my
head so it's not you know difficult or
anything like that you could take a
piece of the hair and wrap it around
your actual hair and use a rubber bands
to secure it so you can hide your actual
bun and then you just start braiding so
that's how simple that is
I feel like this is like
self-explanatory
just use the rubberband that comes on
the braiding hair wrap that rubber band
around your little baby bun or your bun
and
braid it down and that's pretty much it
and secure it with elastic band and I'll
be back when it's time to do my makeup
look cuz that's how simple vizier
sellers today literally the look that I
was doing everyday in Miami because I
didn't have time to be doing all kinds
of drama with my eyes or anything like
that and I just wanted to look like a
sunkissed bronze kind of goddess type of
vibe during that trip so yeah so I
always primed and I made sure I had my
SPF underneath my foundation I have
combination skin so this is a pore
filling primer it also is oil-free and
it just blurs off it blurs out any
imperfections that you may have on your
face I'm annoyed because this primer was
sitting on some glitter and now I have
glitter on my face like I'm gonna go in
with my la girl Pro concealer I was
using this I'll be using the Tarte and I
was using large throughout the trip
every concealer that I use or I have in
my makeup collection I use I don't
babysit concealers because if I don't
like them I just get rid of them but if
you are my complexion right now you can
always go in with the next total control
foundation for some reason this wasn't
meshing well with my Laura Mercier
powder I don't know maybe it was how I
applied it so I'm not
I'm gonna play that game today I'm gonna
go in with this foundation right here
and this is the NARS natural radiant
long wear foundation reason why I really
wasn't gravitating towards this one when
I first bought it was because the
undertone was way too red for me but now
that I got my tan my yellow is kind of
cancelled in my neck area and on my
chest so now I can just you know this
one will actually work for me now so I
don't like blending this consider out
immediately after applying it only
because I feel like this coverage is
like light to medium coverage so if you
blend it out too quick you are going to
get a share applications and you have to
gonna then you're gonna have to go back
in and keep building in and adding more
and more but if you let it sit for a
little bit you can get the coverage that
you're looking for yeah so that's that
but then I'm also gonna go in with my
NARS creamy concealer just because I
like the coverage of that concealer as
well so I'm gonna use my morphe
two-two-four brush to apply my
foundation in the areas that I need to
apply in mainly because I don't feel
like I need foundation all over my face
another thing about that Mac Studio Fix
fluid during the trip girl it was
breaking me out like right here I'm
still not getting over it well I'm just
now getting over the breakouts but I
knew it was from the studio fix fluid
because studio fix fluid broke me out
when I used to use it a long time ago
and I left it alone for that reason but
I just thought to try it again to see if
it would do the same thing and it did
and I don't got time for any of that so
if the foundation gives you like random
fat bumps that's just like always there
in the same area trust me it's because
you're having a reaction to that
foundation and you just need to go ahead
and leave it alone cuz only because like
I said I feel like I don't need
foundation all over my face and this
just gives me a more natural looking
application and that's what I look
forward to when I am applying my makeup
and you just want to be careful when you
hit this area where you applied your
foundation stick in expresso if you are
my skin complexion and this is the NYX
foundation stick and expresso you don't
want to drag it down you want to keep it
like right in this area
going upwards because if you drag it
down as you can see this color is not
matching my actual skin color so if I
drag it down my neck it's going to look
like my foundation isn't matching my
skin so you don't want that at all
because we want everything to look
snatched but this is a really really
good foundation if you can find your
right undertone you're gonna love it and
I'm in the shade Macau by the way so
same thing with this area your how those
of your cheeks you don't want to blend
downwards you want to keep it kind of in
the area that you already placed it in
and that's why I love this brush because
it blends everything out really really
quick I don't really use my Beauty
Blender to blend out foundation anymore
I use it to blend out my concealer and
sometimes you might have to go down your
neck but make sure you go down your neck
with the foundation shade not with the
contour shade so if you have to pump a
little bit more on the back of your neck
and apply it do so because you know it's
really hard to get your perfect match
when it comes to the foundation but
trust me dragging a little bit down your
neck will solve a lot of problems that
you may have
and do flash photography like if you're
a beginning one if you're a beginner
when it comes to makeup and you're
trying to figure out go to Sephora get
samples try the foundation on in like a
natural lighting take a picture with the
flash on and that won't lie to you at
all it will tell you whether you need to
get you a darker concealer get you a
darker foundation a lot of foundation
just the flash never lies trust me and
then I'm gonna put this down the bridge
of my nose I forgot to do one of the
main steps that I did when I was on the
trip which was adding my lumi drops from
revolution or you can always go in with
mac strobe cream found that now I've
been just keeping my concealer when I
put it on my forehead just right above
my brow like this area right here I used
to like to take it all the way up here
but right here works perfectly anyway
you're gonna go back in and my blend it
out so everything won't look harsh so
it's unnecessary to kind of put your
concealer smack-dab in the middle of
your forehead just above the brows so
everything is balanced and even so I'm
just gonna go ahead and blend this out
now and when I put in a second layer of
concealer on usually I try to keep it
like I try to focus it like right up
under here if you've been watching me
for a long time you know how we used to
OD and bring the concealer like pull all
the way right here make a little sharp
line and everything just wasn't blended
out seamlessly like I do now but you
know that's the part of growth and not
giving up on what you love because I
know I was looking crazy once upon a
time
that's my undereye using a mixture of my
Sasha Buttercup and my Laura Mercier
powder I did this book on Instagram live
also so if you seen this on my Instagram
live let me know in the comments section
below in the area where I where you
would consider smile lines to be and
that's only because I am combination
skin so in these areas I tend to get
more oily so I am going to go in with a
setting powder and actual setting powder
that I've been loving a lot lately to
just get my color back into my face and
also make sure the rest of the areas are
set properly so I'm going to go in with
my Laura Mercier powder this is the
candle glow sheer perfecting powder in
the shade in the shade 5 and I'm just
going to press this in with a real
techniques buffing brush also going over
the area where I contour it just because
if I go in with a bronzer without doing
this step I feel like it leaves my
contour area patchy and muddy and I
don't want that at all when it comes to
makeup I like pattie the rest of the
setting powder that I have underneath my
eyes into my skin because the under tone
in the powder is yellow enough that it
just melts into my skin and everything
looks seamless or heavy-handed like me
sometimes when you start swiping away
she starts looking patchy and ridiculous
and you don't want that especially for
your under eye area take my morphe 330
brush and then I'm going to use this
True Match powder in the shade cocoa
this is their super blendable powder and
this is a great transition shade I
usually use this to bronze when I
stopped using it just because I felt
like it was a little too messy for me
and if I'm not like if I'm rushing and I
accidentally put too much like and I
just press my brush in so this extra
Ness comes up on it and if I just
accidentally apply it right here
always game
I've done that before and I was pissed
off like my face and I don't like that
so I stopped using it all right babe so
this is the final look and if you guys
use any techniques let me know in the
comment section below if you have any
suggestions let me know in the comment
section below I am doing another haul
really soon actually I'm about to do it
right now so make sure you subscribe and
welcome to the West comom I love you and
I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
