of the new year and I'm super excited
because I have a bunch of new videos
planned a bunch of new series ideas I'm
just really excited to get started so I
hope you guys are too so for today's
video I thought I would start off with
one that I've been meaning to do for a
while and that's beauty hacks that I
actually use you always see those
articles and videos and stuff that
you're like watching them and you're
like I wonder if I'll actually ever have
to use that beauty hack and so I thought
I would make a video of ten hacks that I
actually do on a day today or even
weekly basis that I think are super
helpful they make your life easier and I
actually use them so they work for me so
hopefully they will work for you so
that's what you guys will be watching
today but before we get into the video I
want you guys to let me know in the
comments below what videos you guys want
to see for this new year besides vlogs
I'm really getting into blogging um so I
will have my blog channel linked below
but for this channel in specific what
videos you guys want to see from me and
I will definitely get around to doing
them because it's like a whole new year
and I feel so good and it's like a fresh
start and I'm really excited so let's go
ahead and get into the video okay so the
first hack which is also probably my
favorite hack and that's to use coconut
oil as I makeup remover coconut oil has
become one of my favorite things I use
it for a moisturizer at the beginning of
the day and at the end of the day and I
also use it to take off my eye makeup
it's just amazing it's super gentle and
super natural plus it lasts for a really
long time so you buy a jar of the stuff
and it's awesome Plus as an eye makeup
remover it's super super gentle on your
eyelashes gets all of your makeup off
and I've noticed it's actually really
helped with the growth and health of my
eyelashes
this next hack is for those of you who
blow-dry your hair or want a little
extra volume in your hair so as you can
see my hair is wet and I don't blow dry
my hair on a day-to-day basis only when
I want it to look super full and
volumize or when I'm running out of time
and I can't let air dry so I used to
blow-dry my hair just straight down to
make it look super straight but it ended
up being super flat to my head so I
tried blow drying my hair upside down
and this works tremendously awesome to
create volume in your hair and make it
appear more full and thick it's kind of
like gravity when you blow dry your hair
down it just appears fuller and thicker
instead of blow-drying it straight flat
to your head so when you flip it up you
get this super poofy volume eyes hair
which I absolutely love and then you can
go ahead and style it
this next hack is for those of you who
love to wear lipstick my favorite are
berry and reds especially in the winter
but they can be a mess to kind of take
care of so a trick for you is to take a
piece of tissue or toilet paper
take a brush with some translucent
powder and place that over your lipstick
and basically just brush that on it
looks really silly but I promise you
this works I've tried this so much this
season and I love it it basically
prevents it from getting on your teeth
or smudging throughout the day so I
really like it and it kind of mattifies
it too
next is the bobby pin trick which I'm
sure you guys all have heard of but I
never knew this and I use bobby pins for
so long but obviously spraying your
bobby pins with hairspray helps it stick
longer but actually flip your value pins
upside down so the ridges go against
your head I never knew this when I was
in dance and it works so well I'm not
even kidding you it's one of my favorite
things to do when I'm putting my hair up
it just makes such a difference and they
really do stay in I'm promising you guys
this next hack might just save your skin
and your wallet because it's using baby
shampoo to clean your makeup brushes
I've been doing this for years now and
it's one of my favorite things to do
because I've saved so much money instead
of buying all those crazy brush
cleansers that are super expensive
I just bought baby shampoo I run some
water on my brush put some baby shampoo
in the palm of my hand and then I
basically run my brush through it it
cleans it so well the baby shampoo is
really gentle on your expensive brushes
and it's super gentle on your skin so
it's not going to cause you to break out
it's just a lot cheaper super efficient
and I've been doing this like I said for
years and I really wanted to share with
you guys in case you didn't know it
because it's one of my favorites this
next hack is the triangle concealer hack
if you're still doing your concealer
like this stuff shown here you're doing
it wrong I start out with my 8 cosmetics
bye-bye under-eye concealer which I'm
obsessed with and then I go in with just
like a creamy concealer so like I like
using the NARS or the Maybelline fit me
concealer and I go in and make a
triangle I've been doing this for so
long it's one of those tacks that
everybody tells you but it really does
make a difference it's one you should
actually use because they look so good
on your face so after I apply my
concealer then I just go in with a
Beauty Blender another just
self-explanatory hack Beauty blenders
are amazing things to use so like that
and it makes your foundation look super
airbrushed and awesome this hack is for
those pesky eyeshadow colors that don't
show up as well on your eyelids so a
trick for you is to use your finger I'm
sure a lot of you guys have heard about
this especially when you were like in
middle school because I used to use this
before I knew what makeup brushes were
so as you can see it just picks up the
pigment a lot better it's more creamy
looking and it's also super easy to just
kind of like throw on so it's kind of
like a beauty hack to save time too
because all you have to do is take your
finger apply your eyeshadow and then
what I like to do is take a clean fluffy
brush and just go in and blend that
crease because sometimes your finger can
leave a harsh line so just blending that
out looks super nice really easy like I
said save time saves time and the
pigment just shows up a lot better on
your eyes
another one of my favorite hacks is a
DIY exfoliator and it only involves two
ingredients and that's coffee grounds
and coconut oil now you know I love me
some coconut oils so I didn't have a
problem rubbing this on my skin but I
also love coffee so what's awesome about
this isn't it's an exfoliator obviously
but it's anti-inflammatory it helps with
redness puffiness it also just helps
rejuvenate and smooth out your skin plus
it helps with stress stretch marks and
cellulite if you have that so you can
rub this all over your body it's all
natural you can find it in your kitchen
and it's a lot more affordable than all
of those other scrubs that kind of look
like this because you can just make it
right from your home this next hack is a
way to make your eyelashes appear fuller
and longer so all I'm doing is after
curling my lashes I comb downwards on my
lashes first and then I comb up words
this might seem a little bit strange but
it works awesome so a tip for you is to
get a mascara that has a curved wand so
the one I like is the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara I found that it
works really well to do this kind of
technique so like I said I could herb
downwards and then I curved upwards I
tried this for a while now and I really
found that I just have been doing it all
the time and I think it looks really
good and it works really well um so
after I'm done doing that another thing
I like to do is layer my mascaras so now
I take a wand that's a little bit more
condensed and I go over that mascara
after its dried a little bit it kind of
just adds a little bit more of the
product on my lashes so it appears
fuller but I just love what it does and
then instead of using the whole credit
card technique because that never worked
for me ever um I am going in with a
q-tip what I like about a q-tip is it
doesn't really take off your eyeshadow
too much but it gets rid of the mascara
really easily and you can get in in
between your lashes effectively and I
just have been doing this for a long
time and this last beauty hack is just a
simple curling technique that some of
you guys might know but if not then
you'll learn something so what I like to
do is take my curling wand and hold it
vertically and then I also catch the
curl in my hand for a couple seconds
once it comes out this makes such a
difference I used to kind of just curl
my hair as it went but I found that my
curls fall out a lot quicker so by
holding the curl vertically it just kind
of shapes the curl butter and then bike
touching it and letting it cool off for
a few seconds just kind of locks that
curl in and will help it last longer so
on the other side of my head I curled it
horizontally and then I just kind of let
it fall and as you can see it kind of I
mean it still waves but it kind of just
lays there dead and flat and then it
also kind of fall out throughout the day
especially if you have hard to curl hair
the way that I showed you before is the
best way to do it as you can see this
side is just a little bit more full and
bouncy and this side is just a little
bit more dead and flat and will probably
fall out throughout the day so this was
just kind of like a simple curling
technique that I always do because you
guys always ask move on my hair but it
just depends on how you want it some
days I want it a little bit straighter
and some days I want it fuller so it
just depends but that's my video for
today I really hope you guys enjoyed it
