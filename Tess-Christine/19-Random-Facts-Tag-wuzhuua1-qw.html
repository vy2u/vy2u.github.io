be the 19 random fact tag and I was
tagged by Haley H ayy 0 to 3 I'll have
her username linked in the description
box below and I was also tagged by Liz I
heard make up 92 who actually started
this tag so I was tagged by both of them
so I'm just going to get right into this
video and talk about 19 random things
about me number one is I can do the
Michael Jackson Thriller dance which is
super random but I actually taught
myself how to do it like a while ago I
don't even know a couple years ago I
taught myself how to do it which leads
me into number two is I'm a die-hard
Michael Jackson fan he is probably one
of my favorite singers and I've loved
him for a long time I just admire him as
a singer and a dancer as you guys know I
was a dancer and I just think he's a
great person I'll know all of his songs
by heart number three is I can never
finish the last part of my meal which
sounds really weird but if I'm eating a
sandwich or a burger I always have like
the littlest tiny bite left and I can
never finish say like all of my french
fries are all of anything on my plate I
always have to have like one thing left
on my plate and it doesn't necessarily
mean I'm full or I don't like it or
anything it's just that for some reason
just to have it is that I have to have
at least one thing left on my plate I
don't know why it's just weird
number four is I love airports but I
hate flying I don't know what it is
about airports but I just really like
them I think that it's probably because
when I was growing up me and my dad
always used to watch the plane's take
off and I just think that's really fun I
guess they don't really like the
atmosphere of airports and like security
going through all that kind of stuff but
I really do enjoy just being in airports
and watching the planes and I don't know
watching outside the window I love that
but I absolutely hate flying flying
scares me so much
number five is I would love to be on a
Disney Channel show I don't know what it
is about Disney Channel I just really
like it I just think it's a really fun
thing to watch I've always loved the
Disney Channel growing up and I still
watch it now be almost 21 years old I
mean
I don't watch it as much as I did when I
was little but I still watch it and I
would love to be on a Disney Channel
show I just think it would be a really
fun to do that one day
number six is I am a city girl at heart
it's kind of funny because I grew up in
the Midwest living in a smaller town but
I would love to live in New York City or
LA I just don't know what it is about
big cities I absolutely love them when I
went to London I fell in love with
London I absolutely love everything
about big cities I don't know why that
happened I don't know why that is number
seven is I have a creepy obsession with
boy bands now if you follow me on
Twitter or watch any of my Q&amp;amp;A videos or
anything like that you will know that
throughout my whole life I've always had
some sort of a boy band crush now when I
was really young I loved NSYNC
Backstreet Boys Hansen like loved those
guys like crazy I absolutely loved them
then in high school me and my some of my
friends had a crazy obsession with the
Jonas Brothers it got so bad that I
think one year was it we went to three
of their concerts in the span of less
than one year so it was quite bad and
then now recently after traveling to
London I have fallen in love with one
direction they are quite younger it well
not all of them are quite younger than
me so I mean I guess that's okay I just
I don't know I love the idea of boy
bands I just think they're really fun
their concerts are fun maybe I'm just a
kid at heart my Disney Channel and boy
about band obsessions can proof that but
I just love them I just don't know what
it is but I have a creepy obsession with
them number eight is I had never eaten
beef until my freshman year of college
so two years ago I had never eaten beef
I never used to like beef I guess I
never tried it to know if I liked it but
I just never liked the look of it like
hamburgers cheeseburgers
tacos all that stuff grossed me out
until about freshman year when I
randomly ate a Crunchwrap supreme at
Taco Bell and I didn't know there was
beef in it I don't know what I was
thinking maybe I thought there was
chicken in it or something I ate it all
of it and I loved it and there was beef
in there and so then ever since then
I've loved beef I love tacos I love
hamburgers I love cheeseburgers so it's
just kind of funny I guess how that
works out but yeah I had never eaten
beef until two years ago number nine is
I
a night owl I am crazy when it comes to
going to bed I don't sleep I don't know
what it is I will stay up all night
number ten is I have a huge obsession
with peanut butter I'd loved peanut
butter so much my whole life I think in
elementary school when I used to bring
packed lunches I had a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich in there every single day
and since then I eat peanut butter with
almost anything number eleven is I'm
terrified of clowns I hate clowns I
didn't always used to hate clowns it
wasn't until about sixth grade when I
saw the movie it now if you've ever seen
the movie it when you were young that it
would probably scared you like crazy now
after watching it again it kind of is a
little corny and a little cheesy but
when I was young I freaked out over it I
hated it so much and in that movie if
you've never seen it there's a killer
clown and he scares the crap out of me
and then ever since then I've never ever
liked clowns number twelve is I'm going
to college for public relations and I
explain this a little bit better in my
Q&amp;amp;A video on what exactly public
relations is but basically I'm just
studying for that number thirteen one of
my biggest pet peeves is I hate when
people chomp their food when they eat I
absolutely hate it it irks me it's kind
of like nails on a chalkboard for me
it's just like when people are chomping
their food it makes my food unenjoyable
and I literally just stare at them like
oh my gosh
I just can't even stand it 14 is ever
since I went to England I've been
obsessed and addicted with coffee and
tea which is kind of ironic in cliche
but I never used to drink coffee or tea
really until I went to England it was
always there when we were in England
when we like I said I studied abroad
there so like through our school meals
and stuff they always had tea and coffee
sitting out so I'd always like sometimes
every once in a while would drink it and
then it became to this everyday thing
and now I'm like addicted to coffee and
tea number 15 is when I was younger I
used to play the flute and piano piano I
played the longest I played piano when I
pretty much my whole childhood and - up
until like high school I stopped and
then flute I just played in middle
school
they're both instruments I played I
really enjoyed them I think the last
piano song that I remember playing I
think it was my last recital that I ever
and I played the peanuts theme song that
Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada Dada did
it did it did it I did it that one
number 16 when I was younger I used to
horseback ride almost every day besides
dance I danced a lot too but in the
summers I used to horseback ride almost
every day there is this horseback riding
stable near our house that I used to go
to all the time and we got our own
horses I never owned a horse but through
the program you get your own horse that
you go to everyday and you tend that
horse you clean it you brush it you take
care of it you feed it all this stuff
and then you were able to ride it all
day and I absolutely loved it I learned
all these different kinds of riding
techniques and we went through trails
and I just absolutely loved I like lived
at the stable I was like a little
country girl for a good portion of my
life
number 17 one of my top comments on
YouTube is that I look like Nicki Reed
Jenna Dewan doing I think that's how you
say her name and Melissa from Pretty
Little Liars those are my top comments I
get them almost on every single video it
is an absolute compliment so I thank you
guys all so much who are constantly
complimenting me by saying that because
I think they're all beautiful girls and
they're married to really attractive
guys Channing Tatum and Paul Wesley
hello I'm just saying so thank you
that's a definite compliment number 18 I
have a terrible fear of heights
I'm absolutely afraid of heights I
refuse to go on anything high I just I
can't it freaks me out looking down or
kills me I don't know what it is I don't
know what sparked it but I am so afraid
of heights I'm afraid I think it's just
the fear of falling maybe but Heights
just freak me out number 19 is I started
my youtube channel because of a contest
entry I had no intention of starting
videos I'd always kind of thought about
it because I've watched them for years
but I had no intention of starting to
make youtube videos and till I posted a
video response to an Allen Blair contest
entry and I posted this video of my
contest entry and I got a lot of good
feedback saying that I should make more
videos so one thing led to another and
then I
ended up making more videos and here we
are today that is it for my 19 random
facts I really hope you guys liked this
video I hope you learned a little bit
more about me and yea if you have any
questions about anything that I said or
anything any further things to ask me I
will be more than happy to answer them

having a wonderful day and I will see
you guys next time
