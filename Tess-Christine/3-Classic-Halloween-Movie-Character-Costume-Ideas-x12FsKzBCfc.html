be my last Halloween video and this
actually really sucks because I had a
few more Halloween videos I wanted to do
this year and like always time just gets
away from me and I always over plan and
think I can do like 10 Halloween videos
and that never works out but I decided
to end with a bang and do some classic
Halloween character costumes if you're
kind of confused as to what I'm saying
think of your favorite Halloween movies
that you like to watch every year
because mine are hocus-pocus a Nightmare
Before Christmas and The Addams Family
and BAM my video I think now this is my
favorite I said that in the last one but
I love this one
um so let me know in the comments below
which one was your favorite and Tony
since is my last Halloween video what
you're dressing up as if anything and
yeah I think that's it so let's get into
the video
to fire up a baby up and knocking
okay so for the hocus pocus Sanderson
sisters costume this is actually a lot
easier than you might think and some of
the pieces you can even find in your own
closet and it's pretty epic if I do say
so myself actually wanting to recreate
this costume for so long so I'm so happy
I finally did so for my costume
I was Winifred and you're only going to
need a few things to get the look so the
base of it being blue you're going to
want something a royal blue color I had
this long blue a royal dress and that's
from Lulu's but anything will work you
could do a maxi skirt as long as it's
blue it'll work next you're going to
need a corset I found mine from Party
City and it's actually called a witch
corset so it matched really awesomely
and then you're also going to need a
cake in the movie Winifred has a
super-detailed intense cape but you can
totally get the look with just a plain
green one mine I found at Party City
next you're going to need a red wig or
unless you have red hair and I kind of
pinned it up to make it look like her
kind of crazy hairstyle and then of
course you're gonna need a book to carry
around next we have Mary and Kerry did
such a good job playing her she just
killed it I think she's so funny um but
you're only gonna need a few things and
Kerry had a lot of the stuff actually in
her own closet so starting out for shoes
you can wear black brown booties
whatever you have Kerry had some maroon
ones so she wore those then for the base
of it she wore a floral dress that has
kind of like a vintage e pattern to it
but it's definitely the key piece of
this is that the colors are darker Mary
wears like plaid she wears dark Maroons
so make sure you do that if you're gonna
be her over it Kerry wore an orange
style peasant top and belted that and
then she bought a red cape from Party
City so the only thing she really bought
was the Cape which was awesome and then
of course Mary you got to have her hair
so we put we cut a water bottle in half
a plastic water bottle and put it on top
of her head and tied ponytails on it and
it created her hair style and I think it
looks so funny and awesome and lastly we
have Sarah and for Sarah's costume the
main things you're gonna need are colors
that are like pink red or purple she's
very girly very playful so look for that
in your closet so to start out Julia
just wore some black booties and then
for the skirt I actually had this one
from ASOS it's just a mauve pink color
so any type of maxi skirt like that will
work and then we took a purple
I escaped and we tucked it in the size
of her skirt and then shredded it to
give it that kind of like bold look that
they have in the movie and then for the
top we had this mesh dress which is like
it's a red maroon color but the key
thing for Sarah's look is to have mesh
sleeves because that's kind of what she
wears and then of course a blonde wig
and after that your hocus pocus
Sanderson sister costume is done perfect
for a group of friends I definitely
think this one's my favorite Jew legacy
something strange
okay so for the Sally and Jack
couple-costume this one is super cute
but it does take a little bit more work
on Sally's end because I di wide the
dress so I'm going to show you guys how
I did that now the first thing you're
going to need is a dress so I found this
one for a super affordable price at H&amp;amp;M
the main thing I was looking for it was
a yellow or mustard color because that's
going to make your life easier just as a
template so I already glued some felt
pieces on the top of this because I had
to do this wallet was on because your
boob stretch it out so you want to make
sure that whatever you put on the top
half of that you do it while it's on you
so you're going to need fabric glue some
felt and you're just going to basically
cut out shapes or patches since Sally's
dress is kind of like a patchwork dress
so this is totally up to you you can
follow my design you can do whatever you
want I just cut out pieces and kind of
like laid them out and made sure I liked
how it looked I went off of some
costumes I found online it's just kind
of like a guide for me um but whatever
you kind of feel you guys can go totally
all out or just do like a few patches
like I did I didn't do the back of it
but you totally can just it depends on
how much time you have but it's super
affordable because all you really need
is the dress and then these little like
I think they were like 30 cent pieces of
felt from the fabric store and then
fabric glue and you just basically glue
them on like so for the design and the
stitches all I did was purchase a
sharpie paint marker a sharpie or a
fabric marker would work great too I
bought it in black and basically all
you're going to do is copy the designs
on her dress so she had like some
spirals and triangles on the pink parts
of her fabric and then of course
everything was connected by like little
stitches so all I did was create lines
and X's until all of the edges were
complete so like I said you can follow
my design if you want to so then to make
it look more distressed like hers I cut
up the bottom of it into like little
tiny strips and then instead of leaving
it like that I decided to cut them into
like triangles so basically all I did
was cut one side of the end off at an
angle umm so it created this kind of
like jagged edge like her dress
for the sleeves I cut one halfway down
so we kind of go off the shoulder and
then did the same jagged triangle edges
at that side and I'm going to show you
guys how I did on this side I wanted to
do kind of like a mismatch thing so I
didn't cut the shoulder off of this one
I just left it and I just cut the little
ends into strips now for her little arm
pieces if that makes that I don't know
what these are but a lot of the costumes
come with it all you're going to need is
some white felt and you're going to glue
it with some fabric glue kind of into
like this hot dog shape if that makes
sense so basically your arm can fit into
it so just measure it beforehand to make
sure it fits and then once you let that
dry you don't want to stick your arm in
it yet let the glue dry and then after
that you're going to find where your
thumb is and you're going to cut a
little thumb hole with the scissors of
course and try it on like so then you're
just going to take your fabric marker or
sharpie marker and you're just going to
create the stitch design that she has on
her arms like so and after that you're
sally costume is done you've got a
really awesome dress that you did
yourself it's not gonna look like
anybody else's if you happen to see
another Sally
um and it's super easy so I just wore it
with some black booties and then for the
rest of my outfit I wore a red wig I can
only find this short one so I tied it
into a ponytail but if you can find a
long red one that would work perfect put
stitches all over my face and some white
eyeshadow but you can totally follow a
more in-depth tutorial if you want to
then moving on to Jack's costume
aka Patrick's you're only going to need
a few things we kept it super simple we
found this black and white striped shirt
from ASOS bought an oversized black bow
tie from Party City he wore some black
pants and some black shoes and then
colored in his eyes with black eyeshadow
and put stitches on his mouth
they're all together deeply out shy a
movie
I'm lastly for the Wednesday Addams
costume this one is so super easy it's
perfect for last-minute
I absolutely love it so the only thing
you're really gonna need is a dress I
found mine from forever 21 it's black
and white stripes but the main things
you're going to want to look for is a
peter pan collar and long sleeves
because that's always what she wears I
wore mine with some black booties and of
course I wore a black wig and I braided
it into two long braids carried around a
skull and my Wednesday Addams look was
complete super simple and I think it
looks really cute but that's my video
for today I really hope you guys enjoyed
it be sure to give it a thumbs up if you
liked my Halloween videos this year stay
tuned because I have a fall lookbook
coming up next I think it's one of my
favorite lip books I've ever done so I'm
really excited for you guys to see it
