three different updos now since it's
summer and I'm constantly putting my
hair up I decided to show you guys three
different ways to put your hair up
that's kind of a little fun and
different and it also involves no heat
so if you're interested just keep on
watching
now the best part of these tutorials is
that you can use your natural hair or
second day hair so that's what I'm going
to be doing I'm going to be using my
second day showered from before hair and
I'm just going to begin brushing it out
because we are going to be braiding for
all three of these hairstyles so make
sure your hair is brushed out before
working with it now for this first look
it's pretty important that you tease
your hair but again this will all
determine on your hair type or thickness
even so if you have really thick curly
hair you may need to just skip this step
and you don't even have to tease but I'm
going to be teasing for this look if you
want a more in-depth way on how I tease
my hair I have a whole video on it so be
sure to check out my channel now all you
want to do is make sure that your hair
is parted on whichever side you want to
just as long as it's not in the middle
so now whichever side has more hair on
it you're just going to begin gathering
that into what I'm doing is about three
sections and you're going to be taking
bobby pins and pinning it down where you
want your braided headband to lay this
is just going to create kind of a base
for your braided headband and give your
hair some volume in the front still
without teasing or anything crazy like
that so this will just give it a nice
base and having the bobby pins there
we'll be able to attach on to the braid
a little bit better and have the braids
stay there and stick instead of sliding
around on your head throughout the day
there's really no precise way that I'm
doing this either I'm kind of just
randomly placing and just kind of making
sure it goes in a line and kind of forms
my head really well so again that will
all determine on your head shape even so
but you don't have to be too precise
with this at all so now on the other
side of your head where your bobby pin
starts or where that part there should
be like a direct line around your head
so gather the hair on the other side
that matches up with that now with the
hair you just grabbed you're going to
loosely secure that with a plastic
elastic these are fairly inexpensive and
I purchase mine at Target but you can
get these at pretty much any drugstore
this is going to come off later so don't
be too precise with this or anything
it's just going to help you fishtail
that section of hair now to achieve the
fishtail braid you're just going to
split your hair into two sections and
basically all you're going to do is
gather the outside section of one
section and gather it with the next now
I have a whole video explaining exactly
how to fishtail so I'll have that linked
in the description box below in case
you're a little unsure once you have
finished braiding you're just going to
secure that with another plastic elastic
now being very careful at this part
you're going to cut off the top elastic
and to give the braid a more fuller
effect you're just going to pull at the
braid to make it kind of bigger and
looser now with the braid you created
you're going to take that up and over
your hair until that you could reach the
opposite side of your head and then
secure it with a bobby pin and it's
going to create that braided headband
look with the fishtail now with the rest
of your hair you're going to gather that
till you like it on the bottom or nape
of your neck and you're going to gather
that into like a ponytail now how I get
a messy bun is I basically take all the
hair and I shove it into a fist that I
made with the other hand and I just kind
of placed the rubber band around it and
then pull out until I like it and as you
can see the bottom kind of falls out a
little bit but then I tuck it back into
the ponytail this is just how I like
creating my messy buns it's just the
easiest for me and the quickest so again
you can kind of play with this till you
like no messy bun that I do is ever the
same but that's basically how I create
it now once you've completed that the
look is complete I just think this is a
really fun and classic way to add a
little twist to a typical messy bun so
now let's move on to hairstyle number
two this next look is essentially very
easy because all you're really doing is
French braiding so now again have your
hair parted on the side and whichever
hair side has more hair on it that's
where you're going to begin braiding so
basically all you're going to be doing
is French braiding around your head now
how to French braid is pretty simple
once you get the hang of it all you're
going to do is start it out like a
regular braid you're going to split your
hair into three different sections and
begin to braid now in the second round
you're going to pick up more hair on
each side and you're going to continue
that down to however far you want to
French braid so it's pretty pretty easy
once you get the hang of it but again
practice and it will help you
now this is the part where it gets a
little bit tricky if you did notice I
did switch my hands kind of opposite way
I have them on top now instead of on the
bottom and what I'm doing is basically
taking the hair pieces underneath so
it's kind of creating a different style
of braid but I'm still picking up
sections each time on the outside so
this is going to take a little bit of
practice believe me I did not get this
right at first but after you get it you
nail it and you can do it again now I'm
pretty quick at it but like I said it
does take a little bit of practice but
you're going to continue doing this
braid until you reach about the middle
of your head and you won't pick up all
the hair just till right about now I
stopped and then I gather the rest of my
hair to create the messy bun
for this next part I just gathered the
rest of my hair and now I'm going to
secure that in a ponytail just for the
meantime I am going to take that out but
just for the meantime I'm insecure it
into a ponytail so I can loosen up the
rest of the braids the reason why I'm
kind of pulling at the braid is just to
kind of make it fuller and messier
because I don't want this to look too
uniformed or anything because this is
what I wear for like everyday or
something so I want it to be kind of
bigger and fuller and kind of Messier
looking so now with that ponytail take
that out and exactly how I created the
messy bun in the first look basically
shoving it into a fist and then placing
the rubber band over it that's what I'm
going to do is just going to be more
towards on the side now after that the
look is complete now let's move on to
hairstyle number three now for this last
look all you're going to do is basically
grab your hair and secure it into one
big ponytail at the top or mid upper
back of your head next taking this
little hair donut that I purchased at
Sally's for like three dollars it was
super inexpensive I'm going to place
that over my ponytail and around the
elastic now flipping my head over I'm
just going to basically cover the little
donut bun with all of my hair and make
sure all the sections are covered and
it's like evenly distributed around the
donut bun now to create the little
braids that I have in the bun I'm just
going to take a little front section on
my hair about a 1 1 and 1/2 inch section
of hair and I'm going to braid that all
the way down next you're going to take a
section of hair on the side leaving some
hair in between the first braid and that
braid and you're going to braid that all
the way down now all you're going to do
is basically continue this for two other
braids now I have kind of thinner hair
so I can only do four braids to where it
looks good but if you have thicker hair
you can definitely do more and smaller
braids too that would look really cool
so all you're going to do is basically
braid that all the way down and there's
my roommate Alex video bombing me again
and then the back side um all the weight
braid that all the way down just make
sure there's enough hair in between the
braids to where I can cover the donut
bun that you have so now I'm just going
to take the braid and I'm going to kind
of shape it around the donut bun and pin
it in place and I'm going to do that for
each braid
and it's just going to kind of make sure
that the braids stay where you want them
to and kind of give them a base to go
off of
once you're finished pinning down the
braids you're going to take an elastic
and place it over your loose hair to
secure it in place while you do this
make sure that the hair on the bun
covers the little donut guide that you
use some not a bit sticking out now with
that extra hair that you had you all
you're going to do is basically just
wrap it around the base of the bun and
pin it in place this is going to give a
cool effect to the bun too so it's like
an added bonus and kind of figuring out
where to put that extra hair now I like
my buns or like my little top knots to
be loose so I like pulling off the top
sections of my hair and kind of
loosening pieces on the side to make it
look a little bit more relaxed but once
you're done with that the look is
complete I really hope you guys like
these three no heat summer hairstyles I
just think they're really fun and
different from the normal ways to put
your hair up so if you like this please
let me know and thank you guys all so
much for watching see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
