prom video as you can tell by the title
but wait before you say anything I know
I missed a lot of your proms and I'm so
sorry I don't know what I was doing I
completely spaced I haven't been to prom
in like five years and I didn't even
know they had them in April because like
where I'm from they were all in May but
I think that's because I live in the
freezing Tundra and they have to wait
till it gets warm for you to wear
dresses
I don't really know I'm sorry if I
missed your prom but the great thing
about this video is that I didn't I did
three different styles you can totally
wear these three different hair and
makeup looks anytime you see fitting so
anytime you have to dress really nicely
for any other school dance for a banquet
obviously for prom for a nice dinner for
an event you really can wear these
anytime you want also stay tuned to the
end of this video for a special giveaway
I did put it in the title because I
didn't want people to click on it just
for the giveaway so secret secrets I'm
gonna start doing that now it's gonna be
really fun so anyways let's just get
into the video before I blabber anymore
okay so this first look is definitely
more on the girlier side and for the
makeup I just kept it very short and
very simple then all I'm doing is adding
a shimmery beige color onto my lids and
I'm just kind of starting that in the
corner and blending it outwards then
with a matte Brown shadow I'm just going
to bring that into the crease for some
dimension and a little bit more depth to
the look then of course I'm just going
to drag that Brown color onto both of my
lower lash lines to kind of balance up
the look a little bit more for the
eyeliner I'm keeping it very minimal and
I'm just going to use a gel eyeliner to
create a slight winged eyeliner look
it's just gonna make your eyes look
really pretty and really like dough-like
which i think is always really fun
especially if you're going for more of a
girly look but then I am going to take a
black shadow and drag that onto my lower
lash line to kind of balance out your
eyes a little bit more and then of
course curling my lashes and applying
mascara now I am going to add some false
eyelashes that's definitely optional but
I like to add them especially when I'm
going to somewhere a little bit more
fancy because it definitely makes them
more full and fluttery and then moving
on to blush I'm just going to take my
favorite light pink color and place that
onto the apples of my cheeks
moving on to the lips I'm just going to
add a peachy nude gloss to match my
dress and then that completes the makeup
look I love it I think it's just so
pretty and natural and fresh and perfect
for your prom so now let's move on to
the hair so for the hair I'm just taking
a one-inch curling iron like this with a
clamp and I'm just going to basically
curl up my hair from the bottom roll it
up and release after a couple of seconds
and you're going to get these bouncy
curls so you're going to do that
throughout your whole head and there's
really a non-price precise way of doing
it so that's kind of why I skipped to it
and now all I'm doing is gathering all
the hair to one side of my head and
putting it into a ponytail leaving some
strands out in the front okay so now all
you're going to do is grab some bobby
pins and you're going to begin pinning
your hair now how I'm doing this is I'm
just taking my hair giving it a little
bit of slack and pinning it up to my
head so I'm kind of looping it and
pinning it looping it and pinning it and
since my hair is a little bit longer I
kind of have to do it twice so I will
loop up one section pin it and then the
end section that's still sitting out I
will pin it again this sounds kind of
confusing and looks really hard but I
promise you guys it isn't the reason how
I even figure out how to do this was
because I came home from the hair salon
and I absolutely hated my hair so I
redid it and this is just kind of how I
did it and it worked out ever since so
there's really no precise way that I'm
doing it I'm just literally looping and
pinning and filling empty spaces until
it looks good I also like to use a
mirror to look at the mirror behind me
to make sure I'm filling in all the gaps
but like you can see here I just looped
about one section and now I'm pinning it
and then I'm going to take that other
section that's kind of sticking out and
pin that in as well so it's just going
to take some practice but you'll
definitely master it with you and your
friends if you try it at home so lastly
I'm just going to take that front
section that I left out in the beginning
and I'm just going to pin it up slightly
loosening it a little bit so it frames
my face really nicely and then I'm going
to curl those other sections that I left
out on the other side to just make it a
little bit more fancy and pretty and
voila it's done so cute I love it so
much but now let's get to the dress this
first dress that I'm wearing I'm
absolutely in love with it's just so
pretty I love the peach color and the
rhinestones on the front and the back
the detailing is just so amazing I love
how the rhinestones hit the light it's
just so pretty and flowy I love it
dance all night in this thing it's from
Windsor in case you are wondering
obviously I don't have prom dresses
lying around so I asked if I could
feature a few of their dresses since you
guys know I buy their clothes all the
time
they have amazing dresses that I wanted
to show you moving on to look number two
I thought this was very red carpet glam
with the dress and the hair and
everything I loved it so much so all I
did was I just use the makeup from the
girly look and I just decided to smoke
it out a little bit
um because I don't want something at too
intense but I definitely wanted to
change it up for those of you who wanted
something a little bit edgier and a
little bit more sultry so all I did was
pick up a matte black shadow and I
focused it on the outer corner of my
eyes with a small eyeshadow brush and
then took a fluffy brush to blend
everything out I used my gel eyeliner as
kind of a guide for the outer V focusing
of course on the outer half and building
in to create kind of like a gradient
effect next I just put the leftover
black onto my lower lash line to balance
out the look for the lips I just chose
this lipstick which is just a light pink
color with some purpley undertones just
to make things a little bit more bright
fun and a little bit more spring ish for
my hair I just brushed out my previous
curls and now I'm going to begin
gathering my hair back and I'm going to
do kind of like a half-up half-down updo
so all I'm going to do is take a small
section from underneath my hair beside
one of my ears and I'm just going to
begin twisting that up creating kind of
like a headband so I'm going to just
drag it up and place it over the hair
pushing the hair back as I go and
meeting it with my other ear and then
I'm going to secure it with a bobby pin
bloody have found that this did not stay
very well so how I'm going to make it
stay is I'm going to pick up the section
right behind it and twist that side up
and then lay that over the hair that I
just placed it's really going to help
secure everything down and just make it
feel a little bit more tight to your
head as well so with that side I'm just
going to secure that with a bobby pin as
well you might need a couple to make
sure it's sturdy and then of course use
a lot of hairspray now I'm just going to
take the top half section of my hair and
I'm just going to pinch it at the top of
my head and secure it with bobby pins
for a half up half down look if you have
shorter hair and you can't achieve the
twist you can buy a rhinestone headband
or a plain headband and get the same
look but you can also straighten your
hair curl it a lot however you see
fitting for this hairstyle but this look
is so awesome for showing off your
earrings this dress that I'm wearing is
from Windsor I absolutely love it I
could have never imagined wearing a
white dress but I actually love this
it's definitely something you'd see on
the red carpet with the rhinestone
jeweled bodice and then the slit down
the front I just think it's so glam and
fabulous I just love it so much the
third look is very old Hollywood in my
opinion very simple but yet very very
glamorous I think this one is definitely
my favorite all I did was I just took a
beige color and place that onto my lids
and then of course put a matte brown
color into the crease for su some
dimension in the eyes but if you guys
know anything in Old Hollywood you know
that it's all about the liner so I just
used a L'Oreal gel eyeliner to create a
very dramatic wing starting out small
and building as I go because you can
always add more but it's not very easy
to take away if you guys want a winged
eyeliner tutorial let me know in the
comments below next I'm applying mascara
focusing on the outer half of my
eyelashes flicking it out with the tip
of the brush and then I decided to cut
my false eyelashes in half and place
them on the outer corner for a more
dramatic kind of almond shaped I look
for the blush I just chose a coral blush
to make sure that I wasn't overpowering
the red lipstick for my lips I decided
to use a Revlon lip stain because I
thought a lip stain would be perfect
instead of a lipstick because it's not
going to move anywhere and it's going to
really stay put on your lips and make
sure it doesn't smudge throughout the
night moving on to the hair this is
moving quite fast I'm just using a clamp
Liz curling iron from nume and it's kind
of a small barrel and I'm just gonna
begin wrapping sections of hair around
it until you get these really really
tight curls now my hair kind of looks
what I just have a treatment in it
because my hair is dying from all these
tutorials so don't mind that but you
don't want those tight curls so I'm just
gonna take a brush and lightly brush
that out and you're just gonna get these
kind of like big waves almost like
finger waves just not as challenging um
but now for the actual look I'm just
going to take this side with less hair
and I'm going to begin twisting that
around till all the hair is gathered to
one side and then pinning it with a
bobby pin of course so that's pretty
much the look it's so easy and just so
pretty and classic in my opinion but for
the dress this was so pretty I obviously
again
from Windsor I just love it I just think
it's very classic and sleek and perfect
for all you simple ladies out there who
don't want anything too bedazzled or
crazy so this is perfect with the small
rhinestones that it does have okay so
now onto the giveaway part I'm super
excited about this I kind of randomly
just thought like you know what I'm
gonna give you guys some stuff that I
used in the video and some things that I
think are promised enchi lure dance
