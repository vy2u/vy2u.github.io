like just shy
woman is my destiny she said
hi guys today's video is going to be a
prom video and I wasn't going to do a
prom video this year because I'm just so
far out of prom that I didn't think
about it and then I was like wait a
second
if you follow me on social media you
know that like a major thing that
happened to me this year which was so
awesome was I was in Seventeen magazine
there prom edition I was um wearing some
Windsor dresses and I was like so stoked
on that that's like the coolest thing
that's ever happened as far as like
being in a magazine what I was like I
can't not do a prom video that'd be
crazy I remember going to my school
dances we'd all like my friends and I
would go get our hair done and I'd come
back and I just hate it I'd be like this
looks nothing like me I don't like this
hairstyle like I don't know what was
going on and so I'd always redo it and
like tweak it myself so then I just
ended up eventually just doing my own
hair for school dances and my friends
hair so I thought I would show you guys
some of my favorite hairstyles I like to
keep it pretty chill like you can dress
these totally down like how I have it
now with like a sweatshirt sweater and a
t-shirt or you can wear your prom dress
and dress it up with like jewelry and
stuff and it'll look really awesome so I
really hope you guys find this video
helpful I also show you a few dresses
that I really like um along with some
clips from the photo shoot which is
awesome so anyways if you are interested
in this video then just keep on watching
starting off with hairstyle number one
it's basically just a braided updo that
I think is super pretty and it's very
easy so all you're going to need is a
teasing brush some bobby pins and a hair
tie so the first thing I'm doing is I am
teasing the back section on my hair and
a little bit on the sides for extra
volume then I'm going to be taking this
front section of my hair leaving some
hair Oh in the front and back sections
of my hair and I'm going to begin French
braiding it now when you're French
braiding it you don't want to go all the
way down to your ear you're going to go
about half way and then finish the braid
on its own without picking up extra
pieces because otherwise it's going to
look silly when you pull it back so if
you just do it like how I did it
you shouldn't have any troubles so once
that side is done you're going to leave
it like that and then you're going to
repeat the same process on the other
side of your head
once you have both sides of your hair
braided you're going to basically gather
the rest of that hair back into a loose
ponytail and then I'm kind of pulling up
the sides because I like it to look kind
of like a messy updo and not super tight
to my head so then once you have that in
a ponytail I'm just lightly pulling at
the braid to give it a little bit of a
fuller appearance and then I'm basically
going to pull it back and wrap it around
the ponytail and then secure it with a
bobby pin another thing that I did is
since I didn't have cut bangs I loosely
gathered that front section of my hair
back and then secured it with a bobby
pin underneath the braid and then had
strands kind of pull out at the front
just because I didn't have bangs so it
looked a little silly with like really
long strands hanging and then I just
repeated the exact same process on the
other side with the other braids now you
could totally leave this as a pony tail
and curl that how you want to but I'm
going to show you guys how to put it up
so all you need to do is take little
sections of your hair like this and
you're basically going to loop it and
then pin it with a bobby pin
this seems really really hard but I
promise you guys it's so easy so all
you're going to do is until all of your
hair is pinned up you're basically just
going to loop and pin loop and pin using
a mirror to look behind you at the other
mirror really helps to make sure you're
putting the hair in the right places and
this is an awesome opportunity to do
this with your friends and your friends
can help you as well um but overall like
I said it looks a lot harder than it
actually is but all it really is is
looping and pinning looping and pinning
if you are still having trouble with
this part a tip for you is to basically
have your hair super curly before you
start pinning it's just going to make
your life a lot easier to loop and pin
it as you can see mine was kind of wavy
when I started so I kind of had to
create those barrel light curls myself
it's quicker to do it the way I did it
because you're not curling your hair but
if it saves you some frustration then go
ahead and curl your hair beforehand now
what I did with the pieces of hair that
are hanging by my face is I just took a
barrel curler and I curled it away from
my face and she kind of these loose
wave-like curls I think it's really
really pretty it makes it look polished
and put together and it also frames your
face really nicely but overall that's
the completed hair look it took me about
ten minutes I think it is so pretty so
simple to do when you get the hang of it
and I think it would look good with any
dress
moving on to hairstyle number two this
is a faux bob which i think is really
fun especially if you have a really
crazy beaded dress because it reminds me
of something out of the Gatsby so all
I'm gonna do now is tease my hair and
now this is really important for this
look because you really want your heart
to people luminous at the top since
you're not going to have hair at the
bottom so now all you're gonna do is
basically gather her into a low low
ponytail you're knotting me to put the
ponytail at the nape of your neck you're
gonna basically put it lower than that
it's kind of self-explanatory by just
watching me do it so I'm kind of
gathering it like so and then I'm going
to basically put a ponytail around that
kind of lower than usual next step is to
gather your hair that is in the ponytail
twist it around itself into this little
bun type of thing you're basically going
to shove it underneath the hair that is
left I wish I would have filmed a back
angle of this but unfortunately I didn't
it's really easy all you have to do is
basically put your hair underneath
itself and then you're just going to
take a bunch of bobby pins and crazy pin
it underneath there depending on how
thin or thick your hair will is depends
on how many bobby pins you will need I
only needed a few but actually does stay
pretty well so now I'm basically just
roughing up the top sections of my hair
you want those front layers to kind of
come out a little bit and then on the
side that my part is a little bit less
of if that makes sense I have less hair
on this side I'm pinning that back I
could put it behind my ear I think would
look great too but I'm kind of pinning
it back just because I liked how that
looked and then again I'm just taking
out the layers of the top layers of my
hair very gently and with a curling iron
and basically going to curl those in
these loose curls I really like this
hairstyle because it's definitely has a
messy look to it but it's definitely
more put together the more you curl your
sections of hair but I think this would
look really awesome with a beaded dress
or something even simple it could go
either way
for hairstyle number three I decided to
work with straight hair because I didn't
want to leave those of you out that have
just naturally straight hair or like the
hair straight or have hard to curl hair
because I still think you can look fancy
and put together with straight hair plus
sometimes dresses just look better with
it so you could go the Selena Gomez VMA
route and just leave it down and
right and it'll look awesome or I'm
going to show you guys how to do this
braid which I think definitely jazz it
up a little bit so all you're going to
do is take a section of hair is starting
with a small section of course and
you're going to begin French braiding it
now if you wonder where how to French
braid it's really really easy you're
just going to basically regular braid
but you're going to be picking up extra
sections of hair each time you come on
the outside pieces so obviously as you
can see I'm picking up some here and
then I'm going to braid it and then with
this side I'm going to be picking up
more another thing with this hairstyle
is you're basically going to braid it
all the way back to the back of your
part um because you want it to lay flat
on your head although it is going to
come up a little bit but I'm gonna show
you how to fix that in one second but
basically you're going to keep braiding
all the way back picking up sections so
you get to the back of your head like so
and then you're basically just going to
continue braiding down and you're going
to stop picking up pieces at this point
because you don't want your whole head
braid in just this one section so as you
can see it's kind of sticking out a
little bit so a trick for you is just to
take a bobby pin and where it's sticking
out go into the braid and you're
basically going to push the bobby pin
down into the braid so the bobby pin is
concealed for the most part and you
won't even be able to tell then with my
fingers I'm basically just going to pull
apart at the braid just kind of
flattening a little bit and making a
little bit fuller it's just going to
blend into my straight hair a little bit
easier and that's it but you're probably
thinking okay that looks super casual
not good enough for prom but if you
think about it adding things like some
rhinestone earrings or a big statement
necklace will really change up the look
of your hairstyle and of course once you
put your dress on I think it will look
awesome
moving on to some prom dress inspiration
obviously I'm too old for prom so I
don't have prom dresses lying around so
I asked Windsor if I could share with
you guys some of my favorites from the
17 shoot my absolute favorite this year
are the two-piece dresses I just think
they are so gorgeous and they are
actually pretty affordable I wish I knew
about them when I was going to prom
because I totally would have rocked this
blue one I'm obsessed with it and also
you guys know I love my look for less
videos and tell me this does not look
exactly like Sarah Hyland's dress I just
think it's so gorgeous I'm in love with
it and then also I thought I would
include some footage from the 17 prom
shoot you guys are gonna recognize some
familiar faces some youtubers and I were
in the shoot together and it was just a
really cool experience and I'm so
grateful that I got to do it Windsor and
I are giving away two $100 gift cards
towards your prom dress this year so if
you want to find out how you can win
those the details will be in the
description box below but that's my
video for today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it be sure to give me a thumbs
up if you did and I will see you guys in
my next video
