hair tutorial not just one hair tutorial
three hair tutorials and I'm really
excited to share this with you guys
because it is my three favorite spring
hair looks I guess that I like to wear
in the spring when I wear my hair up and
I wanted to share with you guys because
these looks are so easy and they take no
more than five minutes if that
especially when you get the hang of them
they're so easy so I really wanted to
share with you guys and I thought you
guys would enjoy it the first hair look
is going to be this hair look actually
it's just a side pony that you guys
could put anyone could probably do
without even me telling you and then
adding a little flower I got this flower
at Ulta and but any flower any favorite
flower that you have you can wear in
your hair
alright the second look is going to be a
side braid and this isn't just a typical
side braid the side braid has a little
twist to it so I'm really excited to
show you guys that and then the third
look is my take on the ever so famous
top knot and actually I mean the top
knot bun or something like that but it's
my take on it and it's how I wear it so
I thought I would share it with you and
yeah I guess that is it so I really hope
you guys enjoy these tutorials and can
try it yourselves so I guess that's it
let's get into this tutorial okay so
first I'm gonna take my hair and simply
put it up like any regular ponytail but
make sure when you're doing it you keep
it towards the low nape of your neck and
then tie it a little towards the side to
fall over whichever shoulder your bangs
are on and you can do this with either
straight curly or really curly hair and
then I'm gonna take a flower and just
simply put it over the ponytail and you
have that look it's super cute super fun
and really pretty for spring
all right so for this I'm going to start
by sectioning off the part of my hair
that is the opposite side of my bank so
I can braid have the braid going towards
my bangs now I'm just going to section
off in three pieces and start by
braiding it picking it up picking up a
section of another section of hair every
other piece just like how you would any
other French braid it helps if you tilt
your head to one side
this way all your hair falls on one side
it's easier to pick up parts of hair
and I'm gonna continue this until I get
to my left ear
all right so once I picked up all the
hair I'm just gonna start braiding it
down
my the rest of my hair and then tie it
off with the ponytail and I like to pin
back my bangs this is optional but I
like to do this so you can see the braid
and that is it it's very pretty very
very easy surprisingly easy to do
alright and for this last look I'm just
gonna put my hair in a ponytail sort of
on the top of my head very high and then
I'm gonna take the hair that's in the
ponytail and start to twist it and all
you're gonna do is twist it around the
ponytail that you made once it's on your
head you can kind of play with it and
make it bigger or smaller depending on
how you like it and now I'm just gonna
take bobby pins and pin the bun in place
and any flyaway hairs next I'm gonna
take my fingers and kind of pull strands
out loosen it a little bit and the look
is complete I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video and thank you so so
so much for watching see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
