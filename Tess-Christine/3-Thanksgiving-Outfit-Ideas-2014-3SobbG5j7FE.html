thanksgiving outfits idea video and I
wasn't sure if I was gonna do it but I
tweeted out of course and asked you guys
if you guys would want to Thanksgiving
outfit ideas video and all of you guys
said yes or pretty much all of you guys
um so I thought I would do that I only
asked because not everybody celebrates
Thanksgiving and that's kind of why it
skipped over a lot but I love
Thanksgiving just because of its simple
message of just giving thanks and being
thankful for things in your life I love
it and in case you guys are stuck on
what to wear for Thanksgiving dinner
I show you guys three outfit ideas that
are super easy super casual and you can
recreate them with pretty much anything
I love them all and I can't decide which
one I'm going to wear so you guys have
to let me know in the comments below
which one I should wear for Thanksgiving
even if you guys don't celebrate all
these outfits are really easy to
recreate really simple they're very like
fall wintery outfits so I'm sure you
guys can find some fashion inspiration
on your own for whatever occasion you
find fitting and yeah that's it so let's
get started starting off with this a
first outfit you can never go wrong with
a sweater dress because they're super
comfortable breathable for when you're
eating all your Thanksgiving food and
they can be dressed up which is awesome
so I love this one I got it at Target I
love the neck of it because it kind of
acts like a circle scarf so it's super
comfy and warm and then for my shoes I
just wore some black booties from Target
as well and then some sweater socks from
forever 21 and then underneath it I wore
a dress this is a huge tip for you guys
because if your sweater dress is a
little too short wear a dress underneath
it and add some extra color a little bit
extra flare and of course link to your
dress now you're probably thinking a
test you must be freezing in that outfit
and yes it is a bit cold outside so I
did add a jacket for when I was outside
but obviously I wanted to show you the
main part of the outfit which is when
you're going to be inside at
Thanksgiving dinner but this one I'm
wearing is from denim and supply is just
a terrible jacket you can find these
anywhere because they're a huge hit this
season
moving onto outfit number two which I
love because of all the fall and winter
colors in it starting off with my maroon
booties those are from H&amp;amp;M and I love
them my green pants slash leggings of
those are from Target as well as my gray
mitten gloves and then also my plaid
scarf is from Target as well I love it
so much I just recently got it I swear
I'm like a walking target ad because
everyone in my outfits has targeted it's
just so affordable and cute I can't help
it and then my really awesome cake coat
that is from H&amp;amp;M I love Kate coats
because they really add a unique style
to your outfit and make you kind of
stand out but then underneath it since
that's the main part of this video I
just want a basic black sweater from
forever 21
moving on to the last outfit which is
super bright and fluffy starting off
with my boots of those are from Target
as well I love these are just combat
boots that fold over my and maroon
high-waisted pants are from Macy's and
then underneath it I wore this button-up
kind of crop top shirt from Nasty Gal
and then underneath that which I didn't
show is just a black sweater for when I
take my jacket off inside super cute
casual outfit with all kind of
Thanksgiving colors and then my really
fluffy warm jacket is from Topshop super
super comfortable and it's like a
blanket I love it but that's my video
for today I really hope you guys liked
it and found some outfit inspiration I
hope you all have a wonderful
Thanksgiving and I will see you guys in
my next video
bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
