going to be all about updo hairstyles
and I thought this would be kind of a
fun video to do because they're not
super fancy updo so you can wear these
everyday you know after you know second
day hair or something like that when
it's not going quite your way in the
morning and you want to just throw it up
and these are really cute ways to throw
it up without you know looking like a
mess so I wanted to show you those and
they're all inspired by different
celebrities that I found on the internet
and pictures of them and so I'll put
those before each look so you guys can
see kind of how I was inspired to do
them and yeah they're awesome looks and
you can dress them down to dress them up
they're very versatile and they're all
super easy and very fun to do so I
really hope you guys like this video and
can recreate the looks yourselves and
yeah let's get into the video
all right to achieve this first look all
you're going to do is start with your
hair curled and I'm not going to really
show you guys how to curl because I've
done that in a lot of my video so if you
want to see you know how I got these
kind of looser curls
check out my Victoria Secret inspired
hair tutorial or my Selena Gomez hair
tutorial or my how to wavy hair you can
use any of those curling techniques to
achieve this look so with your hair
parted down the middle you're gonna kind
of leave you know like a small strand
out kind of like that um but you don't
want it to look like 2pc so you're just
gonna kind of take other ones and kind
of whatever pull them out a little bit
and then um all you're going to do is
kind of take a hair this just gather
like a little chunk of hair and kind of
lightly very lightly twist it and then
all you're going to do is take a bobby
pin and secure that and kind of push the
bobby pin down so it doesn't show so you
don't have all these little bobby pins
sticking everywhere so then for the next
part we're gonna take the lower half and
kind of twist that up but keep it very
loose at the same time so kind of twist
it make sure to keep it loose and just
like take pieces out by the sides
because hers is you know looks very
messy and that sort of thing which is
obviously what we're going for so now
we're just going to do the same thing
for the other side
and connect
also before you start pinning and
placing make sure that you moved your
hair that way you won't have to poof it
later once you have all these pieces put
in
all right now for the back of your hair
all you're going to do is take the hair
that's left and in a loose pony section
it back and tie it off with a pony tail
all right and now for the hard part that
well more tricky part
you I mean if you want to leave it as an
updo dressed like this I think it looks
just as pretty and you know still looks
like you actually did something with
your hair so um you can do that or if
you want you know get them morn's look a
little bit more you can start pinning up
the curls so with bobby pins all you're
going to do is take a curl so let me see
I'm going to pick this one and all
you're going to do is kind of make a
loop like so if you take it like this
and then loop it and then pin it and
you're just going to do that to your
whole head but remember this look is
very loose so keep it very loose and
don't put them too tight because you
don't want to look you know if this is
an everyday hairstyle you don't want to
look like you're going to prom or
something so keep it very loose to your
head and yeah I guess I'll see you when
it's all pinned up
all right and now for this next look
vanessa has you know a very large poof
and then our hair is pinned up and curly
in the back and I absolutely love this
look I think it looks you know can look
elegant and beautiful you know if you
wear it with the right things in the
right jewelry but also can look you know
very casual but still you know really
pretty for an everyday look so I'm going
to show you guys how I do it the first
thing you're gonna want to do is with
curled hair or not if you have naturally
curly hair just leave it as that
actually that would be preferred but um
if you don't just curl your hair you
know any of the ways that I have showed
you in my other videos and all you're
going to do is we're gonna poof
this top part of our head and usually
you know I just show you how to poof the
crown of your head but now we're going
to prove all of this so you're going to
start by gathering your hair just from
like your eyebrows up gather here now
you're going to start will just get this
hair out of the way and so you're going
to start from the back to the front so I
mean I already proof the crown on my
head so I mean I can leave it at that
but I'm gonna start here
all right so now once you have this
giant massive thing on your head you're
just going to kind of make sure the top
is smooth because you want that to be
smoothed out
and you don't want a huge you know poof
where it's gonna be like a big horn on
top of your head so you're just going to
kind of gather it right here and poof it
up like push your fingers up and then
with bobby pins you're just gonna secure
that down with the ponytail you're going
to gather the rest of your hair and
you're going to put it in a high
ponytail keep the sides very loose
though you don't wanna you know secure
it to your head so if I get it up there
and give it how I like it I'm going to
secure my ponytail like that and now
you're just going to kind of pull out
strands you know you want it to be messy
she has strands coming up the bottom so
you know pull some out easier way you
could do this is just put it in a big
messy bun on the top you would get the
same look but I'm gonna try doing it
which I think how her hairstylist did it
was you know actually pin up the curls
so with bobby pins all I'm going to do
is the same thing as before I'm just
going to take a curl and kind of pin it
and again you don't want this to look
very uniform because Vanessa's curls you
know are natural curls I'm almost
positive they're natural curls so you
know hers are going to be kind of messy
and frizzy which um is what you want if
you're like going for this look so I'm
just gonna pin the rest of my hair and I
will see you when it's done
all right now I'm finished pinning
everything up so now obviously I don't
want it to look so uniform that it's
like an actual updo so I'm kind of gonna
like release you know pull down and take
hairspray and spray let you just pin and
then just kind of like you know scrunch
it and mess it up a little bit and again
this look is you know really fun you
could dress it up dress it down by
adding jewelry whatever you wear that
sort of thing so I really really like
this look and now on to the next one
all right and then for this next look
all you're going to do is start with
which would be ideal would be straight
hair obviously I've been doing these
hairstyles so my hair is somewhat
Crowley but um you're just gonna have
straight hair and all you're going to do
is from the last video or the last
hairstyle that I just showed you is
you're just going to do that same poof
again just not as big and that is messy
because nina dobrev look in this is very
you know sleek and sorry I was looking
down at the picture but it's very sleek
and elegant so that's what we're gonna
do for this so you're not going to do it
as messy as you would from the previous
hairstyle and since obviously my hair is
already proved up here I'm not going to
proof it again but if you are obviously
I mean you're not going to be doing all
these hairstyles so you can just you
know poof it how I showed you before so
I'm going to do is take you know she has
kind of a wider pouf when I says I did
kind of a shorter pouf
so you're gonna grab more hair so grab
like from your eyebrows and poof it from
the back or poof yeah so like I taught
you before gather the hair and then with
the with your two fingers pinch it and
then so if it's like here pinch it poof
it and so you're going to do that and
then take bobby pins and secure it
alright and then for the ponytail
obviously in the picture hers is not
high on top of her head so you're going
to go to kind of like that I don't know
what that's even called just like the
back of your head not low and not high
but like the middle so like right here
you're going to put it so just gather
your hair back
and then secure it with the ponytail all
right and then here is the look I love
this look I think it's you know very can
be very casual but still looks like you
know you took some time and just throw
your hair up in a ponytail it actually
looks like you know you took some time
to make it a pretty phony jail I guess
and this look can be dressed up or
dressed down by adding earrings or you
know just with what you wear but yep I
really like this look this one is
probably the easiest to do and yeah on
to the next look
this last look you're going to want to
start out with your hair parted on
whichever side you parted to but make
sure it's part of to the side and you're
just going to have it somewhat straight
you know this this can always just be
day after hair or wavy hair or whatever
you want um but I think it's going to
work best with you know straight hair
Vanessa in the picture has you know
distinctively cut bangs to make her hair
go like this but obviously I have fairly
long bangs I don't really have bangs
that are cut you know to go like this so
I'm going to kind of show you a trick to
make it look like still you have side
swept bangs without cutting them first
you're going to want to start out by
getting a headband any headband hers is
a gold headband I do not have that
headband obviously so I'm just using a
gold braided um headband stretchy at the
back I believe I got this at Target
and I mean I wouldn't recommend this
headband it's kind of cheap it's like
falling apart but um it works for this
look and if you just find any too or you
can use two separate headbands or you
can just get two I got two tied one or
whatever so you're going to start by
taking that and putting that over your
head and hers cuts her bangs like I mean
presses her bangs down to her head so
what you're going to do is you're going
to take it up over your bangs and place
it sort of on your bangs and she does
have hair sorry you can't see my things
she does have hair coming out here so
while you're putting it on your head
take some hair out and then put it
behind your ear and just make sure all
the hair underneath is out and then for
this side you're just gonna wanna again
take hair out and make sure it's behind
your ear alright so obviously hers is
seperated so that's what I'm going to do
I'm going to kind of take one and go
down and then pull one back at the same
time and then with the bangs since hers
you know our side swept I mean if you
put it over enough it's going to get
you the side so up to look but um you
can kind of take the bangs and bring
them back and then secure them
underneath the headband so lift that
headband up and put your bangs
underneath it now on to the braid you
would think that I would actually say to
you know poof the crown of your head but
hers is actually not so you're just
going to kind of leave it the way it is
and that's basically it for the top so
now we go into the braid and the braid
is just a simple braid that I'm sure you
all know how to do now you're going to
gather the hair to the opposite side of
your bangs I'm going to start braiding
it around half way not half way but a
little bit by your chin because hers is
you know like loose up here it's not
tightly to her head
and then obviously my hair is layered so
this is going to happen so all you're
gonna do is if you have that problem
like me just take it and take a bobby
pin and just secure it and then the look
is done and that is it these looks are
very very easy and again this one can be
dressed up with whatever headband you
use or you know with earrings even the
way you dress and that sort of thing so
obviously you can dress any of these
looks up and I really really hope you
enjoyed this one and all the others and
yep until my next video see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
