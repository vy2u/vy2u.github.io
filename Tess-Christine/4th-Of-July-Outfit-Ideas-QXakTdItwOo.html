be a 4th of July outfit video it's
pretty self-explanatory so I really hope
you guys enjoy it
stretch drag wrapped around my head blue
my little bit of red live free like we
always say no this first outfit is super
fun and girly with all the frilliness of
the shirt but it's nothing too
over-the-top and there's no crazy prints
or anything so it's perfect for all you
simple ladies the shirt that I'm wearing
is from forever 21 it's just a really
pretty blue color my shoes are from
Target and my shorts are from nasty Elle
this next outfit is super comfy and
definitely one of my favorites
basically I'm wearing is this red crop
top from Target some blue vans and a
white sport from Topshop moving on to
the third outfit this is the outfit that
I'm most likely will be wearing at this
fourth of July I love it because it's
super comfortable and it totally is
screams fourth of July with the American
flag printed top that I purchased at
Macy's and the brand is denim in supply
by Ralph Lauren and then my shorts are
just basic shorts from Target
this last outfit is for those of you who
are planning on spending your fourth of
July by the water my swimsuit is from
Target my shorts are from Zara and my
sweater is from spell and the gypsy
collective I really hope you guys like
this and found some inspiration thank
you guys so much for watching and have a
wonderful 4th of July
we're happy boys
stick them in your hair
that's that's a Christian a goner yeah
