styling video and for today's video I
thought I would style denim shorts these
type of videos are probably my favorite
to watch on YouTube and I don't really
do them that often so I thought I would
make just a complete styling video
around denim shorts because for the
spring and summer they are a staple for
my wardrobe as I'm sure they are for a
lot of people basically what I did is I
just took simple denim shorts and I
styled it with three main pieces one
being a utility jacket one a flannel and
one a denim shirt which are things that
I feel like a lot of people have or
would want in their wardrobe this video
is in collaboration with denim and
supply Ralph Lauren and if you guys been
watching me for a while you know that
I've been working on their campaign
called Project warehouse for a while now
and I really like this campaign because
it basically just features artists and
their work inspired by the brand so be
sure to check the link in the
description box to learn more about
Janaka Hadj who is the current artist
that's being featured but that's it for
my intro now let's go ahead and get into
the video starting off with outfit
number one I took some basic denim and
supply denim shorts and I belted it with
a simple brown belt and then for the
outfit I decided to go for our denim on
denim trend I think it's really awesome
it's definitely new word for me but I
think it's really fun to accessorize so
I just took this textured denim shirt
which is also from denim and supply and
accessorized it with a head scarf which
has kind of a bulky me and hippie look
to it and I think it's really fun
definitely my style for my booties I
just wore some tan fringe suede booties
and then a really fun beaded necklace
which I think ties in the whole bohemian
look that I have going on
for outfit number two and for the rest
of the outfits I'm using the same denim
shorts that I had from outfit number one
along with the belt and the main piece
that I've decided to style for this
outfit was a flannel I think flannels
are super comfortable a lot of people
have them
this one I'm wearing is from denim in
supply I love the earth stone colors of
it because you can really style it
multiple different ways I chose to just
pair it with a grey beanie which is one
of my favorite accessories a white tank
top and then for my shoes I just wear
the same tan suede fringe booties which
are super comfortable outfit number
three is for those chilly or spring days
because it involves a cargo jacket which
I think are really necessary to have in
your closet any type of jacket like this
is super fun I really like this one from
denim and supply because of the back
detailing it makes it super fun and it
definitely stands out so how I styled it
is I just wore some Brown booties and
then underneath I just wore a maroon
colored tank top to kind of add some
color into it and then added a bunch of
layered necklaces just for some added
accessories for outfit number four I did
the same denim on denim trend I just
styled it a little bit differently so
this time I left the denim shirt open
and underneath I wore a white tank top
with some fun layered necklaces that
were pretty subtle to kind of go with
the whole simple theme and then just
some basic Brown booties
for outfit number five I used the same
flannel as before and I would wear it
two different ways starting out though I
would obviously pair it with the denim
shorts a gray simple to use some black
booties and one of my favorite black
floppy hats and this way it just depends
on the weather so I'll leave either
leave it open tie it up or I'll tie it
around my waist for the last outfit I
used the same jacket that I did before
which I absolutely love and I just pull
the pieces from the other outfits to
make this one so I started out by of
course just wearing some denim shorts
and then I paired it with a simple white
tank top underneath and then the scarf
that was on my head in the first outfit
I just wore as an actual scarf to tie in
some more color and then of course some
maroon booties for just a pop of color
now that you've seen all six outfits let
me know in the comments below which
outfit you would most likely wear or
which one's your favorite but that's my
video for today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
