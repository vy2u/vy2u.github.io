what's up guys today's video is going to
be a fall room decor video and I'm super
excited about this because this is my
first official fall video and I have a
ton of plans this year and I'm really
excited between fall and Halloween it's
like one of my favorite things what
today's video is going to be a DIY or
not DIY room decor video I want to do
some DIY elements but then I also
include it if you're not a DIY person
and you just are like I'm gonna up time
for that I just want to make it look
cute and easy I got you covered now I
did kind of both I did a room bedroom
and I also did living room same stuff
just different placement because I know
like when I was in college my roommates
and I always like to decorate our living
room and not so much our rooms whereas
if you still live with your parents
maybe you want to decorate your room and
have a little bit more freedom so I kind
of show you guys how I took all of the
stuff that I show you guys and put it in
both rooms that makes sense you guys
will see but anyways I really hope you
guys find this video helpful and let's
get started okay so the first thing I'm
going to show you guys how to make are
these really awesome DIY pillow cases
for either your bedroom pillows or your
couch pillows they're super comfortable
and easy to store so the first thing
you're gonna need is some type of fall
fabric I picked this kind of neutral
plaid color because as you guys know I
live with Patrick so I couldn't go too
girly of course you're gonna need fabric
scissors you're also gonna need some
velcro mine has a sticky side on the
back which is super helpful so try to
look for that and you're also gonna need
some fabric glue so take your pillowcase
from either your bedroom pillow or your
couch pillow and take the pillow out of
it so you just have the pillowcase then
with the fabric you're gonna unfold it
but keep one side or half of it folded
together so you have one side already
done for you this way you don't have to
glue this side and it just makes your
life easier so you're gonna put the
pillowcase on top of the fabric and
you're gonna start cutting but be sure
to leave some room for the actual pillow
to fit inside of it so you're not gonna
match up the cut directly next to the
pillowcase give yourself some good
amount of room so your pillow can fit
into it nicely so
just make sure that the fabric you want
as the final result is on the underside
of both of the folds so then you're just
going to basically glue the sides
together so the side that you want with
the pillow to be in is facing upwards
does that make sense I hope it does so
you're basically just going to glue at
the two sides together this is also
where a sewing machine would come in
handy if you want it to last a little
bit longer fabric glue works great but
obviously of course stitches would hold
better
so then after both of those sides are
glue on the bottom side of the
pillowcase you're going to take your
velcro and where you would normally put
the glue you're gonna put that fluffy
side of the velcro and you're basically
just gonna stretch this out this is
where the sticky side of the velcro
really comes in handy but of course you
can dilute use glue or a sewing machine
to be extra safe then instead of placing
the other side of the velcro on the
underside of the fabric you're just
gonna basically lay the fabric down flat
and place it on top kind of making a
sandwich in between the two velcro
pieces and the fabric this way when you
flip it under you're gonna lose the seam
and it's not gonna look messy so then
you're gonna let the glue of your
pillowcase sit and dry for a while to
make sure that your pillow doesn't like
stretch it open you want to make sure
it's nice and dry before you do that and
then you're gonna flip it right side up
and because you blew the corners it's
gonna give these nice rounded edge
corners that are gonna look really good
and then of course the velcro is all
secure at the bottom so what's awesome
about this is that you can fold it up
and store it for next year you don't
have to store a big pillow I think it's
really handy you can make this for a
bunch of different holidays and I think
it's really awesome so then you're gonna
show up your pillow into the pillowcase
I forgot to mention that this would also
work great if your pillow is just like a
decorative pillow and you don't have
like a pillow case you can just shove
the pillow itself in there and it works
the same so as you can see the velcro
gives a really clean seam at the bottom
making it super easy to take on and off
so you can put these either on your bed
or you can put it on your couch where
ever you see fitting but the best part
about these is you can make a bunch of
them and since they're pillowcases
they're really easy to store since
they're not like huge pillows you can
just fold them up and save them for next
year you can make them for a bunch of
different holidays they're way more
affordable than buying a bunch of
different decorative pillows and they're
super easy to make
however if DIY isn't your thing and you
want something super easy and quick all
you have to do is buy either a pillow at
Target or Walmart wherever or buy a
blanket like I did the Sprint orange one
is from Target they have plaid ones it's
a really easy way to just throw
on the edge of your bed on your couch or
your armchair to add a little full
festive
next up I'm gonna show you guys how to
make these super cute and easy little
mason jar candle lanterns first thing
you're gonna need is of course a mason
jar any size will work you're also gonna
need a candle top holder and a fake
candle mine is our fake I mean
battery-powered
mines wax coated so it looks a little
bit more realistic all the stuff you can
get at a craft store by the way super
inexpensive then you're gonna need some
burlap ribbon I think that's what it's
called and then some raffia ribbon and
then you're also going to need some pine
cones or acorns to fill the mason jar so
the first thing you're gonna do is cut
that burlap ribbon down to the size that
you want to fit your mason jar and
you're basically just going to hot glue
that down to the center of your mason
jar super easy super straightforward how
glue works best I found and then you're
going to take your raffia ribbon
I picked raffia ribbon because I liked
the texture of it I think it matches
that burlap fabric a little bit better
and it kind of matches the whole like
lantern feel and you're going to tie
that into a bow and make it all pretty
and you can form this ribbon too which
is awesome then you're going to cut it
down with the scissors and that's what
it looks like on its own but I'm going
to fill it with some pinecones
I would have picked acorns just cuz it
would have held the candle inside of it
a little bit better but this is all I
could find then you're gonna place your
candle on top of it screw on the top and
that's it
so easy right
so what's awesome about these is you can
really put them anywhere I put them on
the corner of my window sills because I
had little Christmas lights there and I
think when you turn the candle on and it
flickers it looks really good they kind
of look like little spooky lanterns but
not spooky at all you could put them on
your dresser your TV mantel and we're
really but if that's not your thing and
you still want some fall vines into your
apartment and just want to add a few
little things the first thing you could
do is take a glass jar like this and you
can get that at a craft store and fill
it with the same pinecones you can find
either outside or they have some really
affordable potpourri pinecones at
Michaels
you can add little pumpkins for like two
or three dollars from Target and of
course candles I always fill my place
with a bunch of fall themed candles just
because by having something as simple as
that just the scent of it alone makes it
feel fall in your apartment and you
don't really have to do that much to it
for another DIY I'm going to show you
guys how to make some super easy wall
art which I definitely think adds fall
Flair to your place and it's super easy
and you can modify it a bunch of
different ways for this you're going to
need a critic paint I picked red gold
and bronze for some fall colors some
sponge brushes some stencils white blank
paper and some frames I purchased mine
at Target for like five bucks so all
you're gonna do is take your first sheet
of paper and you're gonna start
stenciling on your design and with
whatever colors you want
I picked obviously mine but you can go
ahead and be creative at this point the
stencils that I got are from Target
super inexpensive but you can go ahead
and print these out too if that's easier
for you so for my design I wasn't really
sure what I wanted to do but I thought
leaves would look really cool so I went
for this kind of like falling leaf
design so I started with a few on the
first page because I wanted to hang them
vertically so as you can see I have a
few on this first one a few more and
then on the last one I have them all
gathered at the bottom like the leaves
are kind of falling down with how I hung
them
lastly I have a few miscellaneous items
you could add to your place to make it
look extra tumbler so the first thing is
a leaf garland which you can get at a
craft store a lot of people do this they
string it with some Christmas lights and
it looks really good you can put it on
your dresser your headboard another
thing is to add some fun pumpkins I got
this one at Target and you just place it
for me in the middle of your windowsill
on your nightstand wherever you want it
looks super good another idea is to get
some fake apples the ones I got are from
Target and a small basket from the
dollar store and just fill your basket
with the apples it's Apple season I
think by setting this on a side table a
bookshelf kitchen table wherever you
really see fitting makes it look really
fun and festive I love Halloween so I
found this $2 skeleton heads that I put
on Patrick's side of his nightstand and
I just love it I think it looks really
fun I also found this wooden owl from
Target which I put on my dresser and
that's it well that's it for my video
