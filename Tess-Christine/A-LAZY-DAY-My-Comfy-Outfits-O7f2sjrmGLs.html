going to be a lazy day routine you guys
seem to really like routine videos so I
thought I would do a lazy day one so the
first thing I do like most people is I
go on my phone but the best part about a
lazy day is I literally stay in bed for
so long it's the best part like am i
right
so after that I go and make myself some
coffee and normally this is the time
where I would do my makeup and hair but
I leave that shiz as is I don't even do
anything to my face I literally just no
makeup that's the point right of a lazy
day so then I go on and turn on some
music my favorite right now is Miguel
SIA and Jack Johnson that's kind of what
I like to listen to and I'm just having
a chill lazy day I just jam out again
I'll be on my phone or I'll just be like
chilling with Pat but since he's filming
this you know you guys get the gist of
it
so then another thing I like to do is
you're probably I think this is crazy
but I actually like to work
quote-unquote I like to look for like
get the look videos or celeb spiration
stuff I genuinely enjoy this for me it's
like playing adult dress-up like these
fun glasses I just bought for a video
but basically I just go online and I
just search for different outfits that
you guys request and I either put
together videos or put together celeb
spiration post I go on ASOS forever 21
those are kind of like my favorite sites
but I genuinely enjoy this to me it's a
lazy day I just get to sit on the
computer and scour the web another thing
is kind of like a pamper routine because
it's like your perfect excuse to like
paint your nails do face masks do hair
masks because you can do all those
things while reading magazines reading a
book watching a movie it's kind of like
a lazy day excuse to get all those
things done even though I find find it
kind of fun but you know what I'm saying
and it would not be complete without a
bath and I promise I know this is so
basic but like baths are like the best
thing I didn't just do this for the
video I really do love baths in specific
lush baths are just fun because like
colors
but it's also just really moisturizing
and it's super relaxing and chillin here
for hours it's awesome
another thing I love is my robe you too
bro shoutout YouTube for giving that to
me but I will seriously stay in my robe
all day if I can
I mean it's so comfortable why not right
now sometimes I leave my apartment on
lazy days and sometimes I don't but if I
do because it's like you get cooped up
in your apartment especially in New York
apartments because small but I like to
go to a coffee shop or just walk around
and just kind of get out get fresh air
it's kind of fun to just go to a park
and chill to me that's relaxing in
itself especially when it's nice out and
lastly if I didn't do this all day
already what I love to do on a lazy day
is just chill with Pat we like to watch
Netflix we eat a bunch of food the
typical lazy day stuff lately we've been
really into Friday Night Lights actually
spoiler alert we just finished it so if
you guys have any new Netflix
recommendations leave them in the
comments below
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys liked it let me
know in the comments below what you do
on your lazy day and be sure to give
this video a thumbs up if you want more
routine style videos and I'll definitely
do that and yeah I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
