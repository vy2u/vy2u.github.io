be another hair tutorial I know I'm
doing so many hair tutorials or at least
I feel like I am I'm not really sure but
I'm just doing a lot of hair tutorials I
like doing hair a lot more than makeup
sometimes like filming hair tutorials I
just feel like it can be a little bit
more creative with my hair kind of not
really because I curl it almost all the
time um obviously this is the hair that
I'm showing you guys today I tweeted a
picture of this the other day the other
night and a lot of you guys were like
hey do a hair tutorial for that and it's
really really easy and you guys have
seen me curl my hair so many times that
I was kind of like do what should I even
do this like I don't even know but I
figured you guys never get bored of hair
tutorials and I guess I kind of curled
it a little bit different I put it up
different and I never part my hair in
the middle so I guess this is kind of a
changeup I really like doing my hair
like this it's probably my favorite way
to do my hair if I'm parting it down the
middle because I like when I pin it up
in the back it just gives me like added
volume and I know the volume is gonna
stay there cuz it's like clipped in the
back so this is why I like wearing my
hair or when I have it in a middle part
it's like my favorite way to wear it so
I thought I would show all of you guys
it's very very simple but um so it'll be
a really quick tutorial but I know a lot
of you guys are asking me to and of
course I'm always down to do another
hair tutorial because I love them so if
you are interested in seeing how I did
my hair like this please keep on
watching and yeah I will see you guys in
my next video bye everyone
to begin I'm starting out with freshly
showered and blow-dried hair but this
look would actually be really good for a
second day hair so it's totally up to
you what you want to do and obviously
have it parted down the middle so now
once I'm done with that I'm just going
to section my hair into two sections
splitting it down from the back now
starting from the back to the front I'm
going to take a Conair one-inch curling
iron and begin curling my hair now this
is the part where it gets a little
confusing because I'm totally random
when I'm curling my hair so sometimes
I'll use the clamp and use it away from
my face and then sometimes I'll wrap it
around the barrel the reason why I'm
doing this is because none of the curls
are going to match and it's going to
look very messy and not very put
together in uniform which is what I want
for this look and so as you can see the
first one I use the clamp and did it
away from my face and now I'm keeping
the rotation away from my face but I'm
wrapping it around the barrel so this is
totally up to you how you want to do it
just make sure it's complete
random you can do some away from your
face some towards your face it's totally
up to you how you want to do it just
make sure it's really random because on
none of the curls will stick together
and you know give you that uniform look
that you don't really want for this look
so just a reminder reminder this clip is
in real time you can kind of see how
long I'm keeping my hair on the barrel
to get the exact curl you want but this
would obviously vary with your hair type
also as you can see I am taking the
clamp and smoothing down my hair first
before I curl now this is totally
optional it all depends on your hair
type so my hair type is very easy to
curl hair so that's why I like to smooth
it down first it just gives it kind of a
nice softer look to it and keeps my hair
a little bit more tamed but if you are
someone who has kind of straight hair
naturally or naturally softer hair I
would recommend not doing this and just
curling it right away but if you have
easy to curl hair or just kind of very
curly hair and want to smooth it smooth
it down first I'd recommend doing what
I'm doing but again if you have thinner
hair I would recommend just curling it
first because the curls will hold a
little bit better
now when you get to the front sections
of your hair make sure these are going
away from your face just so it frames
your face a little bit better if the
curls are going in towards your face it
might not look as nice so just keep that
in mind when you get to the front
sections of your hair like by your face
I would recommend curling it away so now
once you're done curling that section of
your hair just lightly spray it with
hairspray don't run your fingers through
at all because you don't want to mess up
the curls and you're just going to move
on to the other side now with the other
side of your hair you're going to do the
exact same thing with the random curling
process again it's totally up to you how
random you want to make it just make
sure that they go all different ways
when they're next to each other so
that's all I'm going to do is I'm just
going to finish curling this side of my
head
so now once I'm finished curling that
side I'm just going to lightly go over
that with hairspray again the hairspray
on using is a flexible hold hairspray so
it's not going to leave my hair very
crusty or anything which is why I like
it so I'm going to be using it a lot so
now I'm going to tease the crown of my
head now this is definitely a necessity
if you want to get this exact look I
know some people don't like teasing the
hair but in order to get this look
unless you have naturally belongs to us
hair back there I would recommend
teasing so I'm just going to tease it
into three sections and then lightly go
over it with a teasing brush just to
kind of smooth down the surface a little
bit more
now with one of these little clips that
you can get at Target I'm sure they sell
them anywhere they sell hair stuff I'm
just going to take my fingers and kind
of wear your pouf I guess begins like or
where your part ends you're just going
to gather that section of hair back and
use your two fingers to pinch it back
and then all you're going to do is take
the clip and you're just going to secure
it down
now if you want to get a little bit more
volume with the two fingers in the back
you're just going to push up a little
bit and your hair will just kind of poof
naturally and that's all you're going to
do to get that section back there it's
super super easy and then I'm just going
to finish with hairspray and this look
is complete I really hope you guys liked
this hair tutorial it's one of my
favorites so I hope it works for you
