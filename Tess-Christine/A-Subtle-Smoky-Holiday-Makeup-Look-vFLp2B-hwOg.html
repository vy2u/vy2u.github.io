you how to achieve one of my favorite
subtle smoky eye looks for this holiday
season to achieve this look I'm going to
be taking my BH Cosmetics day-and-night
palette with the 30 different colors for
day and 30 for night it's perfect for
this look and for the fall and winter
months I absolutely love it so I wanted
to show it to you guys so if you're
interested just keep on watching now as
always I'm beginning by priming my eyes
using Mac's painterly paint-pot now I'm
taking this light gold shimmery color
and placing that onto my lids now these
colors are very very buildable so that's
what I love about them so I'm just going
to apply this gold shadow until I'm
satisfied with the color that I have now
since I'm a rune or burgundy color is
like my favorite to wear during the fall
and winter months I thought I would
incorporate it into this look by placing
it into my crease now these colors are
very blendable so this is kind of a
subtle pink look which i think is
perfect and kind of different from just
a normal Brown that I would use now
these three colors are my favorite in
the palette so I definitely wanted to
include one of them so the one that I'm
taking is the dark burgundy color and
I'm placing that into my crease using a
pencil brush now the reason why I'm
using a pencil brush is because I feel
like it gives me a little bit more
control because sometimes when creating
a smoky eye it can get a little bit
messy and it's a little bit harder to
control so this way it's a little bit
easier and you can gradually build it up
and make it smokier and smokier to
however much you like so that's why I
like using a pencil brush instead of a
big crease brush so not to blend it all
out again I'm just taking that crease
brush that we used before and kind of
blending the two colors together I'm
also taking that same dark color and
dragging that onto my lower lash line
now to highlight my brow bone I'm just
gonna take one of the white shimmery
colors and lightly dust that onto my
brow bone moving on to liner I'm just
going to take this L'Oreal gel liner and
lightly line my top eyelash line I'm
gonna keep the line very very thin and
I'm gonna wing it out slightly
to line my waterlines I'm just taking a
basic black eyeliner pencil by l'oréal
and then I'm going to curl my eyelashes
in preparation for mascara the two
mascaras that I'm using are Maybelline
falsies black drama mascara and then the
Clinique lash doubling mascara I like
doubling up on mascara just because I
feel like it gives a more intense look
to your eye makeup moving on to lips you
can choose to leave your lips nude but I
chose to add this Revlon kissable balm
stain in the color crush I love this
color especially for the fall and winter
months and with that that completes the
look I really hope you guys enjoyed this
makeup tutorial please let me know what
you think in the comments below thank
you all so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
