series on my channel that I'm really
excited about and as you guys can tell
it is a week in my life and I know a lot
of people have been doing these types of
videos or have done them in the past
they're basically like vlogs ah so
here's a little backstory I have a vlog
channel some of you guys know that some
of you probably don't I am pretty much
awful at uploading it and I can't even
tell you how many times I get requested
to either upload on my vlog channel or
blog or be a little bit more candid with
like my travel vlogs and things like
that
so I thought it would be a great idea to
start a new series on my channel it's
going to basically force me to vlog
because I put so much time and energy
into my main channel that when I'm not
filming for my main channel I kind of
just like live my life and I don't think
about vlogging hence why I hardly I have
a really hard time remembering to vlog
and uploading so I thought I would make
it a new series because every year I try
to do a new series on my channel last
year I started the travel vlogs and my
New York City guys which is basically me
dabbling into the lifestyle portion of
my channel if you were to look up what
my channel is categorized as on YouTube
its beauty fashion and lifestyle and the
only lifestyle stuff that I do are New
York City guys and travel vlogs there's
a lot more to my life than that so I
thought this would be a really great
opportunity for me to show you guys a
little bit more about my life about me
my friends my family and really kind of
forced me to do something new on my
channel so I want to keep changing it up
I want to do more stuff for you guys and
on top of that I want you guys to get to
know me more Plus this way this is a
really cool series for us to talk about
things other than fashion because there
is a lot more to the world than that so
basically I could give you a rundown of
the week but that's boring let's just
start the weekly vlog
so today at the gym we just did cardio
and abs and tomorrow is leg day how do
you feel and we're working so hard these
past couple weeks without Brian who
actually we lost one in the process you
have to run some errands but I'll
introduce you to him
subways are so full the doors aren't
closed
charge the paddles for lunch as you guys
building about your content
oh my god we're in such a park and this
is my friend er want to say anything
she's in South Africa this wasn't made
Marilla and we're showing her around her
older brother used to live in our old
building
so we met her through him obviously and
she's just good thing but after last
week so she wanted to Central Park now
you said what do you think
I love the bubble and the fellow man
yeah she's just staring at us like this
so cities it's really warm in New York
today which is awesome like what 86
degrees five million so we're just kind
of outside enjoying the day because it
was cold last week and this week is a
heat wave and has birthday this weekend
so really sorry on yeah celebration oh
here I suspect he's celebrating it two
months later because his birthdays in
March and we're always traveling so
we're celebrating this weekend but
you'll see a sense
what you getting
hi update I'm a Kailyn hi I'm yes anyway
look okay Jo got a break in because
she's leaving for part of each Berto
Rico Puerto Rico tomorrow so jealous but
anyways we're in a plant store and it's
really exciting because we're buying a
house plant looks like that
Brian's holding it higher okay wayward
we got an intro Ryan Ryan who are you my
name is Ryan and I'm also from Minnesota
just like fatback and me kind of but
he's our temporary roommate until he
finds a an apartment right moving to
Queens at the end of the month well but
anyways we're hanging so you'll see a
lot of him this week city center plant
what'd you name her Gertrude yes
Gertie for sure yep that's pretty much
it great learning dirty learning journey
so close my girl we go way back bye have
fun in Puerto Rico you look so tan
already I'm so jealous of
we have got flirty gertie
sorry I'm gross and sweaty I'm not
really that yeah you're disgusting I'm
an incredibly short tone because I have
a very large frenum on the bottom as as
far as I can stick my tongue out
shut up joke no look wait
you can't stick your tongue out farther
than that that's why none of my
relationships of last oh so we're home
now I'll show you where we put the plant
there she is looking great cut out of
focus obviously you guys know on this
channel that we moved and we move too as
you can see a quite larger space than we
had before different neighborhood in
Brooklyn and we also lost a few
amenities that we have which is why this
place is cheaper and bigger we don't
have air conditioning which we did in
the last place and we don't have a
washer and dryer we aren't in the same
like super picturesque location which is
fine we wanted a bigger space and it's
way more Brooklyn and what we were
looking for but it's really hot today as
you can probably see my face is sweating
and the summers in New York are super
humid and hot so we need an air
conditioner so we just ran to Target
really quick and we got a window AC unit
we got one I think we're probably going
to get to one for like out in here and
then one for our bedroom because if
you're anything like me you let sleep
and something that's super cold if you
can bundle in your covers and it's like
good to go we have to do it sooner
because it got WAY warm that's Ryan fun
fact this is how we uh you know hello
whoo so pass in our room with me ACH yep
okay I have to view duties now instead
of walk so I'm going to help him and
then I will tune in with you guys if we
have any issues or out when we do the AC
setup okay bye

just editing it all together now and
that's pretty much what my Sunday is
consists of you're going to see is such
a wide range of stuff on this type of
series because for instance like there
were so many friends here this week this
past week that we did a lot of like
walking around the city partying but we
definitely have our fair share of nights
where we just sit in and watch movies or
do nothing or do a ton of work and
boring adult stuff so you guys will see
a wide range of things with this series
and I'm really excited and I hope you
are too so be sure to give it a thumbs
up and let me know in the comments below

improvements for editing for this style
of video whatever you feel like you want
