were you like to fly under here she's
like no and then she like crap but it
awesome stop please cue the Miley Cyrus
fireball
so what have I been doing on this rainy
day which now turned into a really nice
day which is me excited about but I
thought I would show you guys a little
behind the scenes action I want to do
another get the look video soon on my
channel so I've been doing pretty much
all day it's like my favorite part and
my least favorite part about get the lip
videos and that's searching for altitude
meaning I find a celebrity I pick out
the outfit and then I have to find the
cheaper versions of them so basically
this is what my computer screen looks
like so right now I'm looking on boohoo
forever 21 and ASOS are kind of like my
favorites I'm going to tell you who I'm
gonna do don't get the look video for
because why not I really want to do a
new one for Selena Gomez and I am
focused she's kind of changing her style
and that's like my red-flagged
do you like gets a lot gets a look
because every time a celebrity like that
or that I know you guys really enjoy I
try to be the first to do it so she just
kind of released her new single I think
or cover art literally today and I
obsessed with it she kind of has this
like whole retro 75 going on and I'm
living for it although it makes it
really hard to shop for I just ordered a
swimsuit which I'm really excited for
because I really wanted to recreate her
Vogue cover ever since that came out and
oh my gosh you guys I wish I could tell
you how I mean I guess I can tell you
but how long I frickin looked for dupes
or like things that looked similar that
was more wearable to recreate like that
whole vogue shoot at the beginning of
summer and it was nearly impossible well
this might be boring for you but I don't
want you guys to think all I do is party
and go to really crazy cool things all
the time I do have days where I'm
literally just here and I want you guys
to know that so if it's boring I'm sorry
I'll try to cut it down as much as
possible but forget the list videos I
guess little tips if you ever want to do
this at home by yourself about seeing my
video first or whatever is that when
looking for us it's a big piece so for
instance let me just pull up the image
that I was thinking of this one see when
I saw this I was like yes I love this I
was in between this one and this one but
the thing is is what this shoot is that
the stuff isn't very wearable so I was
thinking it would be very helpful for
you guys because it's just like you
necessarily won't have to recreate it
because would you wear something like
this you know what I mean she looks
stunning and I'm obsessed with it but
it's just like not very wearable since
it's summer I thought it would be
perfect to try to find a swimsuit that
was similar so on her swimsuit she has
like an off-the-shoulder so that's
initially what I searched so I was
searching for off-the-shoulder bikinis
off the shoulders tops even just to go
along that route and signing mixed
flower prints like that was next to
impossible she's wearing a Tommy
Hilfiger one it's already sold out but I
was able to find one with mixed prints
like mixed florals and the same kind of
color and it's kind of a like a retro II
kind of I - I'm so excited and it's so
much cheaper than Tommy Hilfiger one
definitely not the same cut but I went
along with same pattern lines and the
mixed prints and the type of vibe that
I'm going to go with I'm going to
like big hoop earrings and like and
stuff like she did so that's my tip for
you is that if you're looking for stuff
like that try like just keywords so like
off the shoulder top floral print stuff
like that and you should be able to find
some stuff that's pretty similar at
least that's what kind of what I do I
also always go on the site called SHOP
style basically it's really cool this is
not sponsored and been using the site
for forever and basically you can just
type in here off the shoulder you could
do top or just off the shoulder and
what's really cool is like so what I
would do is I would go into colors and I
would pick color or I would go into
price and like I would usually keep it
trying to keep it under $100 and so I
check all of these and then you can just
like filter through and it shows all
different websites that carry it so
fingers crossed that I'm able to find
more things and I can get this video up
for you guys in the next couple weeks
because another thing that always
stresses me out about these videos is
that once I find the pieces that I
really like and I'm really excited about
that match I have to do the video so
quick after that because otherwise the
stuff can sell out and then you guys are
like what this is sucks you know cause
like I would be that if I was a viewer
and watching this and I couldn't buy any
of the stuff I'd be like so I feel you I
try to do it really quick where are we
going you're going to a brunch
yeah it could not be happier loaded okay
later the camera
