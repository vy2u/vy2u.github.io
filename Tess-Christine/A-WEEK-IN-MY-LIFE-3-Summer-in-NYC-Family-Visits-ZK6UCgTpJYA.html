beat we're going to the beach yeah
who's your friend yeah there yeah yeah I
mean damn that's pretty okay how do you
uh have you been on one of my blogs uh
probably not
nah that's up now you are and the world
is better off living of the broadband
you know you might have to get specific
and then we got a michael path brother
you're surfing we gotta wait for the
guys alright sweet setup
yeah I just got his ball ready we're
gonna play that and all the people we've
done let me take it to you where you
want me kick it over there go stand over
there
but the end of a day I'll kick it to you
ready
bro
sorry so Michael went back to listen
well cliff San Francisco we all know
that you're featured one which goes be
graduating I'll be pleased I don't know
if they're terrible team hell quickly it
was very different
yeah loves for special in the safe
before leave us really yeah he's moving
to Australia right exactly
but you have to toss your cookie you
snap you see Patrick keep busy GUI
let's go see em
I tried to spot you out there with law
camera but honestly you guys all look
the same joke
blend it in there's a lot of you and
Michael Paul is it best ways I've had a
TV Wow
yeah that's a good footage of you in
here - yeah you know I was taking a
bunch it's low in the face done
excellent time yeah tacos
when you look like it might have been
probably you want to read Oh cute I
didn't I joke I thank you we thought
this is okay hi guys today is a super
exciting day because my parents are in
town boo boo so basically what they are
doing today and I say they because I
helped them get tickets to the Stephen
Colbert show and it's really easy
they're free tickets anybody can do it
any of you guys can do it so I will link
the website that you just like apply for
it and basically it's just like a raffle
kind of thing and if you get selected
for free tickets on the date you choose
then you get selected so basically we're
just going to that part of town which is
kind of Midtown and we have to go there
really early because thing is even
though you have free ticket they have to
wait in line a little bit before because
it's first-come first-serve meaning like
if you get in line first then you get
better seats so the earlier you get
there the better chances you have
getting close to the stage so we're
going there around 2:30 and they're
going to wait in line once they get in
line they can't leave line leave the
line so the show actually starts at 5:30
so they're going to be there a minute
there's like zero cabs right now oh my
god
actually there is one hold on I see it
go just uh
we're kind of killing time because we're
very far from where we live so it
doesn't make sense for us to go all the
way back and divorce women that come
back to pick up my parents for dinner
we're just going to kind of hang out
and now we're going to go meet Kari
because she's off work at 5:00 and it's
4:30
um yes and now that it worked for home
talk to work on this bar from Olympus
hi what they had in my vlog of what look
how cute she looks forward it's like you
work at a fashion company or something
ah weird oh thank you I look so much bye
oh yeah oh yeah
Oh
okay so we just got done eating lunch at
freehold and now we're going to take the
ferry
Saba's place on Facebook I thought it'd
be a perfect opportunity to take my
parents hi guys - it's a restaurant on a
boat so I'll show you guys that we're
going to grab during sweet dress
presentation like you did plan that at
all
where's our striped shirt and your
captain body help fricking for is the
pressure inside it's like the decor is
really awesome it's just a cool
experience
drinks for good we got one sandwich the
only thing is like since they're so new
and so talked about already is that
they're not prepared so it was a little
bit of slow service so if you go there
that's kind of hopefully they'll figure
it out but um yes and I recommend it
though I think it's cool
I like so that no they look great
super cool if you come to the basement
of this point or not the basement down
more speakers and they have old train
cars that you can walk in
so the one we were just in was 1907
this one's 1927 1947 the only drawback
to this place as they catch it really
authentic and there is no agency down
here so it's really hot let me show the
photos ah you're such a pro it'll focus
boom look at that
dad what'd you get
except in mustard on an original native
rock correct
oh yeah when kale denied you suck right
I know exactly why you're doing this
one minute I am Joel garden great juicy
big yes look hard in jaw art you and
your beloved will never part
we just got done doing the teacups I
have to do one because does anyone else
remember uptown girl just say four whoo
probably that is the to earth of all
sewers with his bag full of Coney Island
shirt that I had my okay goodbye
goodbye as you just thought my parents
just left and it's a very gloomy gloomy
day he had both fat brother come visit
and my parents so it was a busy week and
now we basically just need to play
catch-up
so it's towards the end of the day as
soon as they left we kind of just got
down to work right away we've kind of
been a little bit behind as you guys
have noticed but I'm going to explain my
video schedule and all of that stuff in
a different video I really want to know
want you guys to know what was in my
head for the past few months and just
kind of getting back into the swing of
things I had been meaning to film the
Selena Gomez which I have half done it
rained today so that really sucked but
tomorrow it's supposed to be nice I'm
going to finish it up and then get it up
for you this coming weekend so Pat and I
are hungry and I thought I would you
along with us while we cook because why
not pretty normal thing that we do I'm
going to cook pizza so let's go all
right so I propped you up on our coffee
machine because it's the best I could do
so hopefully this works I'm not going to
cook in the dress I was only in the
dress
I was going to film so boom do you like
that classic youtuber transition hey you
guys know what ahh spell plated before
this not sponsored this would be where
the sponsored part would be but it's not
sponsored I talked about plated before
got it a while ago for Christmas for my
grandma and I kept using it and they
have a really really good pizza recipes
I mean it's really good they give you
dose or roll out and the ingredients are
just really fresh and I'm all about it
so if they want to toss some um doubt I
really love it right keep the little
cards that they give you so this is the
one that we're making
it's the zucchini tomato pizza with
ricotta and spicy honey
YUM creating a oven to 400 laws not too
many ok this is what you get for the
ingredient there's not a lot for this
one it's another reason why I
particularly like the pizzas is because
there's really not that much to them and
you can always leave stuff out you don't
like it but most of them are really good
and the cleanup is the cleanup is easy I
literally found like an ad I'm not I'm
gonna do it but I'm just like really all
about
zucchini and tomatoes are done and then
I just have to let chop the oregano and
that's like pretty much it as far as
like prep which is awesome so he have
fun fact I shall try that she'll
probably more than I should because I
know that like them and I like them too
but like where they're finely chopped
not a huge jump
I'm not we're weird gotta stay hydrated
taught in this kitchen
actually yeah I get so hot in the
kitchen to their windows me about an
early living room every time you turn
the oven on because I as you can see of
it or take it is old like it's not if
they work just fine I'll let her know
anything the work one so it's like they
knew what size right okay so then you
just do like a drizzle of olive oil and
then rub it with your hands
can you me do this off okay I don't want
to track down the floor it's okay will
you that's going to be based zero German
whoa so once you get it like in a weird
shape it's not what I was going for
round here we're also not ready for
perfect
you basically just lay it down on the
parchment paper that they give you that
you lie with oil and there's always like
a rectangle Pisa I don't know why
where's your bedroom because it's easier
obviously
you
all right just took the peeps out and is
originally wanted me to make like a
honey-glazed but I just drizzled the
honey over it and then I'm going to just
sprinkle some red pepper flakes YUM
Pisa was the success as you can see it
was really easy kept cutting it now
we're going to eat and we're watching
orange is the new black
so I'm going to end the week in my life
log here I really hope you guys enjoyed
it and stay tuned for this weekend I'm
uploading my Selena Gomez video so I
will see you guys then
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
