the way Shh
thanks for hanging out today books oh
yeah I love Sundays you know yeah you're
there it's all right give me people
learn you you hope to get some vlog
footage and um yeah got to hang out you
said Keenan cooped up a little
all right so we are currently at the
airport in Los Angeles at at home to get
back at like 11 p.m.
that I actually saw I wish I could say
the same line
so last time you saw me I was in L a lot
has changed
well back in New York for one second I
cut my hair which you guys already know
because I uploaded a video before this
one where I showed you guys my short
hair but I got back and I had just so
much work to do I had to like go through
emails which I say all the time but it's
basically just like catching up with
work cuz every time I go out of town
whether it's two days five days a week
it just takes me so long to just like
get back into the swing of things so I
did that and then it's tax season huh
so I had a bunch of crap to do with that
health insurance all like boring adult
stuff that just makes you wish you were
in high school again and living with
your parents so you don't have to deal
with all of it but anyways uh so cut my
hair I was really excited about it I had
been wanting to come in here like this
short for a very long time and all my
friends kept telling me to do it I was
kind of scared because I've genuinely
never had it this short maybe when I was
a little kid so it was kind of just a
lot of things adding up and I was like
you know what I'm just gonna chop it
I've always wanted to and then plus if
you guys follow me on Instagram you know
I did a poll over the holiday
for a get the look video and Olivia
culpo won so I thought that between that
and then me filming and get the look
video I'm like girl you gotta do it just
chop it so I went in to Tommy love him
and he cut all my hair off and it was so
scary but I loved it right away I didn't
have one of those panic things after you
go to the salon you know where you're
just like oh my god what did I do I did
not have that I was like oh my gosh this
is so cool I love it
here we go guys
but it doesn't even look like it's that
much of my hair that was there you know
why you had stairs in the front yeah
yeah
I'm obsessed with it thanks Tommy
it looks so good but today back to
vlogging I wanted to finish out this
week in my life which has now turned
into like two weeks later but whatever
same thing Pat and I got a new camera
yes we finally invested in a new camera
it's taken us years to do that because
you guys know cameras are friggin
expensive and it just takes kind of that
okay we're gonna upgrade some things so
we're really excited we're gonna go
around and shoot a little bit while
getting lunch we're gonna go we're gonna
get soup and then we're gonna play with
our new camera and it's gonna be so fun
I don't want moving my hands like this
