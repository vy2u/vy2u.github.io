channel today's video as you can tell is
another week in my life a very exciting
one with that because you can probably
tell by the title so to kick off Fashion
Week the first thing we did was go we
were invited to the ombre gala with YSL
Beauty which was so exciting Ambar is
basically an organization that helps
raise awareness and money for the
research of AIDS and I think it's
amazing we were surrounded by very
powerful very awesome people so that was
really exciting like I said I went with
YSL Beauty they're not sponsoring me
from this video they just were kind
enough to invite us but I was able to
try out some of the products beforehand
and wear them to the event which is
really cool so the first thing was the
foundation I wore the white cell all
hours foundation and this stuff heavy
duty you're the type of person like that
likes full coverage you're gonna love
this I personally do especially if I'm
going somewhere that half my makeup has
to last I may be getting photographed
all that fun stuff this foundation is
great for that so I absolutely love it
it looks so good and then the other
lyocell product that i used is that I'm
actually obsessed with more so even than
the foundation is I have it here because
I don't want to forget it it looks like
this I'm pretty sure it's a lip stain
it's in the color 12 it's just a really
pretty red color but I'm not even
kidding you when I say that this laughs
like this stains your lips I was
constantly asking Pat throughout the
night like I was like do I need to touch
up my makeup do it is my red all over
the place like do I need to go in and
fill my lips in he was like no it looks
fine and then you're like okay so then I
went to the bathroom and it still hadn't
moved we had ate food I had been
drinking like nothing it's just it's one
of those awesome really really well made
products I brought it actually just a
cliche - and we're at one of the nights
and this thing just it just rocks I love
it and the applicator is really cool I
am officially ready for beyond for a
gala with YSL Beauty very excited love
my dress it is from revolve here's some
photos I took or I'll have them film
something to show you guys my outfit
the Matt and I obviously had a good time
at dinner and at the actual event what
was really cool is actually Halsey came
up and performed which is really awesome
and then we got to meet her which was
very exciting Pat was actually super
surprised he's kind of on a halsy music
kick right now so he's really excited to
meet her and hear her sing she's amazing
and so nice so that was really fun
good morning yeah you always do that
today really excited because for one I
straighten my hair haven't done that yet
I really like it very Olivia culpo which
is what I'm filming today I have a break
before I have to do any fashion we have
a break before I do any Fashion Week
things so I don't even have to be
anywhere till like 5:00 which is great
because I was really nervous about
having time to film this week for a
video on my channel so unfortunately a
lot of the outfits that I picked for
Olivia she's not in New York okay not in
the cold so a lot of them are like in LA
which is really challenging when you're
trying to film in New York when it's
freezing so I'm gonna make do how I
think we're gonna use our apartment for
a lot of it and then film like outside
for like a quick second I'm just gonna
suck it up and be cold for a second take
a photo and maybe the full-body shot and
then come back and really quick and
change so fingers crossed it goes well
and I'm not too freezing
what I do
all right done shooting Olivia now an
event we have the Jill Stuart show some
wearing Jill Stuart love it I think I
have to give it back though
sad there's Pat I'm not wrong Joe
Stewart oh so we're gonna go to her show
and hang out up at risk
so the next morning was a very very
early morning I had to go shoot with B
for their like flat fashion blurb on
their site I believe that went by super
quick and then after that I came back
and I just like speed edited Olivia gulp
oh that video for you guys and then I
had to rush over to at red made dinner
we got to listen to some amazing
hairstylist speak about their work and
the people that they've worked with and
that was really fun and then we got to
do like a little mini photo shoot and
then we just had dinner and then came
home and went to bed so tired last day
of Fashion Week whoa so I'm excited to
be done not because I didn't enjoy it
because it's just exhausting to be
honest but yay last day how exciting
wearing a lot of store ATS but you guys
know you'll see it on my Instagram so
we're cold dressing super appropriately
for the weather lacks so now that the
Fashion Week clips are done this was
super exciting because I had been in
talks with Alex my really good friend
you guys know her she has a YouTube
channel I'm sure you guys have seen her
and you see Alex and Dan and a bunch of
our travel vlogs but we were talking and
I was like ok I really want to do some
sort of like mini trip where I can get
some good content and get some stuff for
like a vacation guide or like packing
guide which you guys have already seen
so we plan a really mini vacation type
of thing where we could film this
content and get it up for you guys and a
lot of the flights to st. Lucia we're
stopping in Atlanta so I had always
talked with Pat I was like I randomly
want to get stuck in that Lana and he
was like why you're crazy
and I'm like no because Covington
Georgia is where they filmed Vampire
Diaries and I've always talked about how
I really want to do the tour and I've
just always thought about that because I
just love visiting sets and things like
that I just think it's really fun so who
can I was telling her that there was
this vampire stalkers to her but they
had their where you go around to the
houses and you get to like explore the
town she was like yes I'm in so we
actually but didn't without telling the
guys although because I mentioned to Pat
a bunch of times he can I already had an
idea
we had a layover in Atlanta Alex and I
extended our way over because what's in
Atlanta like one of the dorkiest things
but I have zero shame when it comes to
fangirling and this is the my actual
dream
you guys can't talk about it that would
you find I think we could live in here I
was just telling Alex the guys we're
gonna go get them before we start our
tour they're getting vampire lattes so I
think they're really excited as well at
least they might not want to admit it
but I think that they are how are you
guys liking your vampire alright so we
left the town square now we're starting
to look at the houses we just went to
the cemetery but briefly didn't film too
much but Pat and I'm that did a funny
boomerang to like match the scene
enjoying it oh my god
but now we're going to the house yay do
you like it and then the dress I'm here
when they're shopping for Caroline's
wedding dress and their home addresses
oh that's one of those and it's also the
closest to kiss normal rock and roll
they're stuck on the way they like build
a movie file and you check that the tag
down and the season and like you have
these are his students they brought a
separate mannequin we are walking to the
roof will zoom in and lean out there if
I had good editing skills I would have
them jumping up like when I stand oh hey
babe thanks for coming to Mystic Falls
today
so the lady on our tour told us to come
to this poops place I guess
Ian came here and his favorite drink was
this thing that it's called the daemon
special it's basically a banana
was it a banana something banana
milkshake putting the banana pudding
milkshake it's really good and now it's
that we really melt the ice cream would
you get Dan oreo cheesecake he'll be
better so that was their time in Mystic
Falls we had so much fun I'm not even
kidding you I could have ended my whole
trip there and just like been done and
gone home and been so satisfied so I
wanted to give you guys a little quick
rundown because I posted an Instagram
after I went there and a lot of you guys
didn't even know it existed so a little
tip for you if you want to do it we we
weren't like paid to go there sponsored
to go there anything I had found this to
her online it's called vampire stalkers
Covington Georgia is about 45 minutes 30
40 minutes outside of Atlanta give or
take so we just woke up in the morning
and took an uber it was the super early
tours at like 10:00 so we left it like
9:00 but it's a three-hour tour she
takes you to all the houses or most of
the houses and you get to go into the
Lockwood mansion you get to kind of
explore the grounds there which they
sung so much um but yeah I just wanted
to give you a heads up in case you want
to do it I will have the tour website
that we use linked below right
unfortunately we're back to Mystic Falls
we took a break now we're gonna
where we going it's like not even fair
well the leader cook is from Maine
shut us from me yeah so yeah my salad
not to that found on YouTube I'll Shazam
mukbang eating show I really hope you
guys enjoyed it this week in my life I
hope it wasn't too short I know the
clips are a little bit different with me
kind of narrating it but I still hope
you guys enjoyed it I still am peaking
out about Mystic Falls and for those of
you guys that have been following me
like ogee following me you know how like
obsessed I was or I am so sad that shows
over but just how cool I was just eating
the whole time and I feel like that show
when I did that Vampire Diaries video
that really like skyrocketed my viewers
on YouTube and I just started doing more
get the looks and it just it holds a
special place in my heart but corniness
aside I don't have a Eddy shame when it
comes to being a fangirl I just think
