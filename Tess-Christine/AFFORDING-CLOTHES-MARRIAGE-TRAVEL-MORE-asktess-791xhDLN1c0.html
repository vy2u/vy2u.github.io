you guys questions yesterday so I
thought it would be the perfect time to
answer all of your long awaited
questions I can't remember the last time
I did a Q&amp;amp;A but they're always my
favorite to do just because I get to
answer some of those questions that
either keep popping up on my Instagram
or in the YouTube comments but quickly
before we get into it it is my last time
on style code live tonight so I will be
on alive tonight all of the information
will be in the description box below I'm
showing you guys how to style chokers
these kind of crazy rap chokers that you
guys have seen me rock before I show you
how I style them how I tie them all that
fun stuff so be sure to tune in tonight
and yeah that's it Joe I screenshotted
my favorites and that I don't think I've
answered before or it's been a while or
new I don't know whatever here we go
let's get started
what clothing item do you own the
longest and what's the newest item in
your closet love you - love you -
there's a denim jacket I think I might
have like just been like alright it's
time to let you go I actually bought
that from American Eagle in like my
freshman year of high school I'm not
even kidding you is there any video we
regret filming or find embarrassing
maybe from your early years on YouTube
like my first few years on YouTube
they're so cringe-worthy I can't it's
like looking at an old awkward
photograph and then like having it talk
back to you and you're like do you end
at the mono gypsy Patrick fight often
and why uh yeah yeah we do fight I know
like a lot of people - especially on
Instagram which i think is so I love it
but I'm really glad I didn't have it in
middle school in high school because I
think I would have felt really down on
your on myself because Instagram is very
much a highlight reel of your life
you're not going to put a photo of you
guys like pissed right you're going to
put the the best times of your life on
Instagram or even just you as a single
person you're gonna put the best times
of your life on their relationships just
in general matter who they're with
you're not gonna like be a hundred
percent every single
and especially with Patrick and eyes
case like we work together he films my
videos we're together like 24/7
so yes occasionally we have fights but
most of the time we are happy happy
people and we love being together but I
don't want it to seem like on camera and
on our instagrams like we're just this
perfect couple who like never fights and
we're just like lovey-dovey all the time
because that's not the case and it won't
be with any relationship if YouTube ever
stops being your main job at what career
would you want to pursue I graduated
college I have a degree in public
relations and marketing so I think if
YouTube didn't work out I would go into
some sort of field involving that I
obviously really love fashion and beauty
so since PR and marketing is huge for
that I would love to go work in the
fashion industry I'm from Wisconsin and
I love it here what is one thing you
miss most about the Midwest so if you
also didn't know I am from the Midwest I
am from Wisconsin I grew up in Wisconsin
I started YouTube though when I was in
college in Minnesota I think the thing
that I miss the most about living there
being there is the people all my friends
and family who were there until we moved
here and we kind of just got up and left
everything people are really really nice
there so it's always kind of refreshing
to go somewhere and know people are
going to be you know pretty nice to you
for the most part what country would you
like to visit next I actually have a
trip potentially planned in August I'm
going to Montreal Patrick and I are to
visit our friends Alex and Dan next is
you seem so confident without being
arrogant what's your biggest confidence
tip I guess with the whole arrogance
thing I think that there's a huge
difference between being confident and
loving yourself and feeling good about
yourself and just like kind of walking
with this like you know what I'm me type
of attitude versus walking and talking
and being like you think you're better
than other people that's when it gets
dicey you know because you'd never want
to think that way first of all but ever
come off that way next is would you ever
consider living somewhere else in the
world it's so where for the longest time
I wanted to
live in England I went I studied abroad
there and when I was in college and
looked there for four months and I was
like I don't want to be that I remember
when my parents pick me up from the
airport I cried like I actually cried
driving home I was like I don't want to
be here I want to be like in England
like I just loved it that much are you
and Pat planning on getting married if
so when I cannot explain to you guys how
often we get this question Pat yeah
people want to know a really serious
question okay really serious are you
miss you for serious question I probably
yes
a super serious answer all right when
are we getting married I didn't know we
were dating it's on the to-do list
there's like no it's not like we're in a
rush we don't want to rush into that so
do we want to get married we've talked
about it yes so anyways yeah that's our
answer the question it'll happen soon
ish hopefully unless something drastic
happens and we break up god forbid it's
not gonna happen
why did you decide to live in New York
City and why not LA I had been to New
York multiple times I really did like
New York or liked New York at the time
yeah but also to like I was getting
really into like fashion street style
the blogger type of stuff doing more I
love having seasons and being able to
film look books for you guys with
different seasons and New York just
seems like a really good fit and I will
say in LA I just didn't feel 100% me
there I felt a little bit I don't know I
just it wasn't me and I just I knew it
wasn't it didn't like I knew it wasn't
gonna feel right being there and I just
the vibe of New York
I just prefer I don't know I just really
liked it what would you want to have
accomplished in ten years from now
um personal life aside like if I would
say like my career and like what I'm
doing on YouTube I think it would be so
epic to have some sort of fashion line
for you guys that's affordable where did
you get this or that like I could just
have it for you like I just think that
would be so amazing I could be able to
do like the look for Less videos that
I'd want and you guys could have it just
right there and so accessible and I just
think it would be a really fun project
do you think your style has evolved
since you moved to New York if so what
have you been influenced by 100% yes
there's no fashion limitations here it's
kind of like the fashion hub and
anything kind of goes and I love that I
just I feel more creative whereas when I
lived in Minnesota Wisconsin it was more
laid-back chill and I felt like I would
get looked at weird for dressing a
certain way I just I remember this one a
little bit of story time for you guys
here you know and obviously times have
probably changed but one time I was in
high school and I remember seeing on
some sort of show because get the look
from the start and I saw this girl
wearing a leather jacket and I was like
she looks epic I want a leather jacket
so saved up my money I was working at a
restaurant and I was like I'm gonna get
a leather jacket and I can't even
express to you guys the feeling of
walking to school and feeling like
everyone was like woah like they I
remembered like I got this one comment
like greaser like oh like from the movie
Grease you know like the t-birds and
like I don't know I got like kind of
judged for it I was like this is so cool
like what and then I remember taking it
off halfway through school because I
thought people were like making fun of
me and for just dressing like a little
differently long story short I think my
fashion has evolved tremendously I just
feel more free the craziest thing you
have done with Patrick but we were he
had been dating for about a year and he
was like hey like let's have a date
night I have like a place I want to take
you I was like okay we went like
downtown and we went behind this
alleyway and he was like okay you're
gonna need to climb I was like he wanted
me to like scale this building and I'm
like uh it was actually really cute he
had like this like blanket set up with
like food and like dinner was on top of
this roof in downtown Minnesota and it
was super cool but I remember freaking
out the whole time because what we were
doing was totally illegal what would you
say your spirit animal is definitely
bird biggest reality check tip for
people who moving to NYC who have never
been you don't have a car figuring out
where with freaking grocery stories was
like my biggest thing and like how to
get groceries and like carrying them and
like like freaking out I also like the
subway getting around the accessibility
of things walking when you get out of
the subway that's like a huge reality
check okay so this question I get so
much let me take a sip of coffee it's
how do you afford your clothes
specifically how do you afford your
clothes before fashion became your
career when I first started doing it the
look videos I did not do intense like
six outfits like all these different
pieces like I did like one maybe two
outfits and I did get the look videos
like once every couple months every few
months and it was like I focused on like
even the hair and makeup more not so
much the clothes whereas now it's like
strictly the clothes um so I genuinely I
just kind of like saved my money like
that's pretty much it I had a job all
through college I had a I had jobs like
growing up like I didn't just start
YouTube when I was 16 and like didn't
have a job I literally had a job I
started YouTube when I was 20 and saved
up some stuff and just kind of like had
a really shitty camera and whatever
times change and at YouTube now people
are making money off of it that's no
secret everybody knows that so I always
looked at it as like I'm going to use
that money to create better content for
you guys and sometimes I will return it
depending on like if I genuinely want to
keep it I used to do giveaways all the
time on Twitter with like the get the
look stuff but then that kind of got a
little dicey and like giveaways kind of
get sketchy because there's like spam
accounts and things like that so that
was kind of fizzled out a lot of the
times I will take all the clothes and i
will donate them to either like a
shelter or like a Salvation Army
goodwill that kind of stuff but I really
want to look into doing something where
I can like resell them like on a site
where I can resell and like pick a
charity and like have all the money go
there because like I don't need like I'm
not gonna buy the clothes and then have
you guys buy them for me and like keep
that money and be like yeah um so I'm
trying to figure out what to do with
that but a lot of you guys have been
asking me about that and I I prioritize
what I spend I that's why I haven't done
an apartment tour because
it's taking me forever to put my
apartment together because I'd rather
buy clothes and stuff like that for
outfit posts outfit videos get the look
videos travel videos are huge now
Patrick and I saved a bunch last year so
we could travel a bunch of this year so
it's all kind of like how we prioritize
I have an old-ass phone like I like so
you pick and choose what you spend your
money on but that's kind of my short ish
explanation this next one is how do you
make friends and how do you find good
spots around the city to film for the
finding places around the city to film
that honestly just takes time we film a
lot in areas that we know are really
good Dumbo like I showed you guys in my
New York guide is really great for
filming and photography because it
doesn't get too crowded friends though I
will say has been the hardest part about
moving here making friends here has been
really really difficult we knew a few
people when we moved here but especially
how we are inside working um we don't
meet a lot of people but it definitely
was the hardest part about moving I lost
a lot of like friends close friends that
you know you just grow apart because
your careers are different you live in
different places it sucks it's sad so I
think that that's a huge thing you have
to factor in when moving to a new place
and kind of like leaving where you're
from but that is it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and got
to know a little bit more and more about
me and I hope I answered your questions
if I didn't please let me know in the
comments below and I will go through and
try to answer as many that I can um but
anyways thank you guys again so much for
watching you guys are always so
supportive and sweet to me and I'm just
like doped you guys are my followers and
have been for so long I love you guys
thank you so much for watching I'll see
you guys next week bye
