updated haircare routine and I say
updated because if you've been following
me for a while I did previously make an
all about my hair video in the summer
and a lot of you guys were requesting me
to do an updated one because obviously a
lot has changed well not obviously but I
mean my hair color has but other than
that a lot of things have changed so I
thought I would make an updated one
because I've gotten questions all from
my hair color to my haircut to what
products I used how I keep it healthy
all that kind of stuff so I figured I
would make a whole video on it telling
you exactly what I do so you guys know
everything to start out my hair I do use
extensions most of the time I have
extensions in I know in some of my
videos you're like a lot of people you a
lot of you guys catch on which I'm
impressed because I mean my hair isn't
that different it just gives me a little
extra volume and a little bit more
length so not much so not nothing not
enough to notice because a lot of you
guys haven't noticed I mean a lot of you
guys have but a lot of you guys haven't
- anyways so I know when like my Selena
Gomez video my hair was a lot shorter
than this and then some videos my hair
is really long like this so I do have
extensions I get them at Sally's they
are in the red box I don't know the name
of them off the top of my head but I
will look it up and I will have it in
the description box as for my natural
hair my hair is layered it's layered in
long layers as they like to say at the
salon so if you ever go to the salon a
lot of you guys were saying or
commenting that you want to get your
hair cut what kind of haircut do I have
all that kind of stuff so what I would
go to and say to them is that you want
very long layers meaning that you don't
want short choppy layers you want them
to be long like it has texture to your
hair but so like ok let me show you so
like what's my shortest layer
it's I don't really have okay my
shortest lair is probably this okay so
here and then my natural hair stops like
right here so I mean I guess you can
kind of see it's layered all through
here but it's not layered up here
obviously I do not have been my longest
bang is I mean I don't have them at all
like I don't even have a longest bang
when I go to the salon now ever since I
got it cut and asked for long layers I
just get it trimmed so they basically
when I say could I just have a trim they
trim up everything so I don't really
have to ask for long layers anymore
because they know because that's how my
hair is cut so that's why I asked just
for a trim as for the color of my hair
all right now this is kind of tricky to
explain because a lot of you guys were
wondering if you have been following my
videos for a while or if you haven't go
click on one of my last videos from the
summer my hair is significantly lighter
than it is right now very light and that
is all natural the Sun does craziness to
my hair literally the Sun I have an
outdoor job in the summer so I'm
outdoors all the time the Sun lightens
my hair so much I get so many highlights
from the Sun that my hair is just not
worth to die in the summer because the
Sun crazy lightens my hair right now is
still in the process of fading from the
last time I dyed it now I have a video
on that a while back if I will have that
linked in the description box below that
is right after the summer right at the
end of summer in August I decided to dye
my hair very dark when I went to England
and that is because I like having dark
hair in the fall winter months
that was a motorcycle in they'll fall
winter months and it fades significantly
so I decided to dye it very dark when I
left and then throughout those months
while I was there until now it will be
fading until I get to the summer and
then it'll be perfect so I only usually
dye my hair once a year and that was
that video so I will have that linked in
the description box with all it shows
everything that I used I got my products
at Sally's Beauty Supply so I will have
that link - you guys can see the exact
color that I dyed my hair then when I
came back from England a lot of you guys
were asking me what did I use to color
my hair back lighter how did I get my
hair from being so dark - so light and
that unfortunately is naturally my hair
lightens craziness like I can't even
explain to you the little bit of Sun or
the little bit of daylight my hair gets
lighter so every time I wash it every
time I go outside my hair gets lighter
so right now I'm still in the process of
fading from that one color that I used
in August that is my whole explanation
on my hair color I'm sorry I wish I
could give you more exact colors because
a lot of you guys are wondering and I
wish I could but I just it's just my
hair naturally does that kind of stuff
so as for shampoo now this has been a
battle for me because I constantly
switched shamp when I started making
videos I was kind of under the
impression that I'm doing so many like
hair tutorials I'm using so much heat on
my hair I should really invest in
something that's really good for my hair
so I started buying really expensive
products like the joy Co the Redken all
that kind of stuff really really
expensive stuff that I just hated buying
because they were so expensive and I
thought it was doing wonders on my hair
come to find out that it really didn't
change much because I used that all
through the summer and then when I got
to England
I just bought Tresemme like the Tresemme
naturals and I just bought that and
that's what I used in England my whole
time and my hair grew significantly I
felt a lot healthier and my hair grew a
lot longer which is so weird to me
because you think you'd be like getting
what you pay for
by buying really expensive shampoos and
granted those probably do work really
well and work probably a lot better than
some of the drugstore brands but I just
was really happy with my hair when I was
using Tresemme so I came back
I'm here and I was using the joy
co-products
and I bought those bought like huge
bottles at t.j.maxx and I bought the joy
pillow shampoo and conditioner and my
hair kind of felt like it was drying out
and then I so I tried to switch to like
or an organic shampoo hated the organic
shampoos that I got at Target I
absolutely hated them my hair was like a
tangled mess I didn't like it at all I
was drying it out like crazy so I was
like you know what I was so happy with
the shampoo that I used in England so
I'm just gonna switch so I went back to
the Tresemme naturals this is the two
that I use the shampoo and the
conditioner and that is what I've been
using on my hair for months now so I
really really am happy with these I use
the radiant volume type and again try as
many Naturals I really like these I got
these at Target now if I don't wash my
hair a day or something like that I will
use the swab dry shampoo and I've tried
a bajillion and one dry shampoos and
this is the one that I actually have
stuck with because I like the smell of
it and I think it works really well and
it doesn't some dry shampoos seem to
make my hair a little bit even more oily
than before so I didn't like bad at all
and then some left the white residue
blah blah blah you guys know all about
that but this stuff I really like and
I'm trying to take this cap off oh and
the smell is actually really decent
because a lot of dry shampoos smell
really bad
but this one I don't mind at all this is
the swab dry shampoo it looks like this
has yellow catcher I get out of the
shower I will use a lot of protectant on
my hair because like I said I do use a
lot of heat on my hair so when I get out
of the shower I will use this one and
only argan oil and I got this at Ulta
and I like using oil on my hair just
because I feel like it helps it out a
lot I suspect especially the ends so I
take a little bit and I mean a little
bit because that stuff a little goes a
long way put it in the palm of my hand
rub it together and just focus it on the
ends I don't use go into my roots at all
just because it would just defeat the
purpose of trying to prevent them from
being oily in the first place so I just
keep it at the ends where you would
normally wear your hair would normally
dry out first so I do that and then I
all
so use the Redken satin wear blow-dry
lotion I've been using this this hasn't
changed from my videos when I you made
my first haircare video this I've been
using forever I love this stuff I think
it's really important to use a lot of
heat protectant on your hair so I do
blow-dry my hair a lot and that's really
really harsh heat so I wanted to get
something that protected that now a lot
of you guys were asking me every time I
do a hair tutorial I never show you guys
that I use heat protectant because I
just kind of feel like that
self-explanatory I just don't feel like
I need to repeat myself in every video
and I just kind of feel like you guys
get it like you should use a heat
protectant so I don't really include it
but the heat protectant that I use is
the Tresemme heat tamer spray I like
this stuff a lot again you can get it at
Target I really really like this stuff
it smells good it keeps my hair
protected which is the whole point of it
so that's what I use to protect my hair
from curling iron straightening irons
all that kind of stuff I know a lot of
you guys are asking don't use a heat
protectant and of course I do I just
kind of figured that you guys would know
that already kind of thing I don't know
um if I want a deep conditioner you guys
have seen this a million and one times
on here but it is so good that that's
why everyone uses it and it's it's a
really really good product and it's 100%
worth the money and it is the macadamia
natural oil deep repair mask I don't
even know how many times this can be
repeated on a youtube video but it is
worth trying out if you haven't because
it works so good I absolutely love the
stuff I've been using this over for over
a year now actually no probably a year
just about a year I've been using this
and I don't use it everyday I use it
probably two three times a week most
likely two times a week it just really
helps out my hair a lot especially from
me filming and doing a lot of hair
tutorials just this is really important
to have for me because I want to keep my
hair healthy and I know I'm filming a
lot and doing a lot of things with my
hair that I shouldn't necessarily be
doing everyday I haven't tried this you
can get this either on Amazon I believe
or Ulta is where I got mine yeah that is
seriously all I use on my hair I don't
use a crazy amount of products I just
kind of used the basics and that's it
and then
for my hair cut in color hopefully you
guys can figure something out with that
but yes everything that I mentioned in
this video I'll have in the description
box below I really hope this video
helped you guys out a lot a little bit
at least with kind of looking into new
products that has worked for me and kind
of helping out with your hair anything
like that so again I really hope you
enjoyed this video thank you guys so so
much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
