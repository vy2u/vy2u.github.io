going to be all about my hair and I had
a lot of you guys commenting asking me
what I use on my hair and I know most of
my hair tutorials I show you guys hair
spray all that kind of stuff what I use
heat protectant but I kind of was just
gonna put a whole video together on
everything that I do to my hair
literally everything I'm gonna tell you
what I when I go to the salon what I
asked for when I get it cut all that
sort of thing because I get tons of
comments and I'm just gonna make I just
decided to make a whole video on it I'm
gonna start out with products that I use
in the shower on my hair so first
shampoo and conditioner I'm like out of
this I need to get more but I use the
bedhead look at you can see right
through it literally I have none left
but anyways I used the bedhead brunette
goddess shampoo and conditioner i just
brought out the shampoo because the
conditioner looks the exact same but
this is what i use and it's lasted me
quite a bit and I got this at Ulta I
know you can get them at pretty much any
salons I think you can even get some bet
head products at Target I don't know if
you can get the brunette one if you have
brown hair but I haven't looked I need
to go get some obviously I'm like out so
I should probably go tomorrow but I
really love this shampoo I think it
smells really good and I know these
products are a bit pricey but I love
going to Ulta to get these because they
always have stuff like this on sale like
this one this product I think is
originally $20 and I got it for $9.99 so
ten so I got it like 50% off and then
the conditioner was like 30 and I got
that for like 13 or 15 I'm not really
sure cuz I got it a long time ago I
switched improves a lot though because I
don't know I just get bored with them
and I want to try different things plus
I watched YouTube videos like crazy and
so I always get new ideas and new
shampoo products that I want to try but
this is what I'm using right now this is
what I've been using for I don't know a
couple months now continuing on with the
shower what I use for a deep
conditioning treatment is the macadamia
natural oil deep repair mask and I'm
sure a lot of you guys have seen this on
YouTube before I got mine at Ulta I
don't remember the price of this because
it's been forever
it's lasted me seriously forever because
you're only supposed to use at the max
this in your hair two times a week I
believe so you don't need to use this
very much I do use this about twice a
week and I love it it smells amazing
it's basically like a big paste I'm not
going to talk about this too much
because I seriously think you guys have
seen it before and I'm literally almost
out but it's like a big goopy paste and
you only need like a little bit more
than a quarter size amount on your hand
I have fairly long hair so I need a
little bit more than a quarter size
amount and I focus that mainly on my
ends and then I work it like whatever I
focus it on my ends and then what's ever
left I kind of massage into my scalp and
you leave it in for seven minutes and
then you rinse out and then when I get
out of the shower for my hair I usually
let my hair towel towel dry quite a bit
I don't use it like using a lot of heat
on my hair especially because I use a
blow dryer and curling irons
straighteners all that stuff so I don't
like using that a lot so I let my hair
dry quite a bit and then I comb it out
and I use the macadamia nourishing
leave-in cream and if I use if I'm using
this I make sure that I don't use these
together because I don't want my hair to
be too oily and conditioned you know
what I mean you don't want it to be too
so on the days that I don't use this I
use this when I get out of the shower so
this is like majority of the time that
I'm in the week I will get out of the
shower and I will put this and again I
will focus this mainly on my ends and
then kind of work it up because I do
have higher layers up here before I blow
dry my hair I use the redkin satin wear
ultimate blow dry lotion looks like this
it's got a pump I use one pump that's
what all that needs to cover my hair and
this smells really good too I love this
I just feel like I have like a good coat
on my hair before I use all this heat on
it so it just it makes my hair very soft
and I love it after I'm done blow-drying
my hair for heat protectant I
use I used to use a chi 44 iron guard
and then I ran out of that so I decided
to try something a little bit more
inexpensive because that was quite
expensive but it did last me a long time
however so I think it was worth the
money but this I think is gonna last me
a long time and it was cheaper so bonus
right this is the Tresemme heat tamer
spray I'm sure I heard about it through
YouTube I'm sure you guys I'll have to
but I really like this stuff it makes my
hair really soft and really shiny and it
feels really good again like with the
other two it just feels like you have a
nice coat on your hair and when I spray
this I spray this mainly on my ends up
here a little bit and then I comb
through it with a brush and then
depending on how I'm going to style my
hair if I'm planning on straightening it
like I did today
after I'm done straightening I use the
John Frieda Frizz Ease flawless flawless
finishing cream that's a mouthful but
it's basically just a cream and it makes
your hair shiny here I'll squeeze it's
kind of thick so you only need like
about a pea-sized amount in the palm of
your hand and then you're just gonna rub
it together and then just kind of work
it through through your hair that's what
I did today
and it makes your hair it kind of tames
down the frizz and it makes your hair
really smooth and shiny and silky and I
really like this stuff however you have
to have a light hand with this because
this can be very dangerous
if you get too much of it on your hand
and you use too much of it on your hair
your hair can become very PC
just kind of greasy I'm planning I'm
teasing my hair I don't like to use a
hairspray at the crown of my head I mean
I have before if I want it to be very
stay all day but if I'm just trying to
get a little bit of volume and still
want to run my hands through my hair I
use the matrix's Vavoom shake maker and
this is basically like if you've ever
heard of the big sexy hair spray in play
hair spray this is like this it's
basically like a hold hairspray you
spray it on your hair and then you can
kind of play with it it's not going to
make your hair crusty or hard it's you
can actually move your fingers through
it or if you don't like where you
sprayed something you can kind of like
shake it through and it'll come out so I
really like this for curls when I curl
my hair or if I scrunch my hair I spray
this because it's not gonna leave my
hair crusty or to where I can't run my
fingers through it especially with curly
hair and my naturally curly hair you can
get these I believe at a drugstore I
mean this this brand you can get us at a
salon or also this is where I got this
but they have spray and play kind of
hair sprays and drugstores as well so
just look for that if for hairspray a
lot of you guys know through my hair
tutorial so I'm not going to spend too
long I switch up my hairspray every time
I run out unless I love it if I
absolutely love the hairspray I'll get
it again but I like to switch up my hair
sprays to kind of figure out which one I
like plus the smells are all different
so it's kind of nice to change it up but
the one I'm using right now is the red
kin quick dry 18 I got this with this on
a sale so that's why I got this hair
spray that's really the reason why
because I wanted to get more of this so
then I was like hey I'll get a hair
spray cousin ran out so um this is I
like this right now it smells really it
smells good it's not like the best smell
in the world it smells like hairspray a
lot of you guys know I have naturally
curly hair if I'm planning on scrunching
it I've showed you guys this before I
show it to you again but it's the volume
inject mousse from Garnier Fructis it
smells really good I need you know quite
a big amount of it on my hand and I
scrunch that through my hair does the
job and then I use the shape maker to
kind of hold everything in place with my
curls and that's all I use for my curls
for dry shampoo
I mean I never really been a fan of dry
shampoo I want to try the new I think
it's pipe an teen I think I think it is
yeah I want to try that one because I've
gone through a bunch of shampoo or dry
shampoos and I've gotten a lot of them
at Sephora and I don't know I'm just not
a fan like none of them smell good they
kind of leave a weird film on my hair
and I don't like it and some of what
turns it white and I don't know I just
haven't been a fan and sometimes I can
deal with my hair without having to use
dry shampoo the next day but sometimes I
can't so I need it so it's the one I'm
using right now is the Oscar blondie
volumizing dry shampoo and I got this at
Ulta a long time ago like I said I don't
use dry shampoo all that often because I
don't tend to like it very much this
doesn't really smell very good it smells
like sour kind of I don't know it I just
have never really been a fan of dry
shampoos but I mean I'm gonna look
around because they are really handy
when they do work but yeah that is all
everything I use on my hair from the
shower to not everything I use now on to
if I color my hair I do color my hair
not in the summer I do color my hair in
the winter because I like it darker in
the winter because my hair gets very
light in the summer
very very light the Sun Punk this in the
winter I like my hair to be dark just
because in the season it's just kind of
nice I never dye it black or anything
it's just it's just dark chocolate brown
that's what I usually go to in the
winter then um in the summer I don't dye
my hair because I think it's a waste of
money for me because my hair changes
colors like I changed nail polish it
changed this so often because I'll be in
the Sun a lot one day and it'll just
like make my hair have these like crazy
highlights of blonde like no joke if it
lightens my hair so much I get so many
comments especially when summer started
and I started making videos like do you
dye your hair your hair looks lighter
your hair looks darker in certain lights
in certain Sun lights it looks so many
different colors because my hair changes
so often as
cutting my hair when I get it cut I
again this switches all the time you
guys have no idea I used to just go to
the hair salon and say I want long
layers I want them my layers to start
like I always told them I like my long
hair I don't want to cut it love of LA
so I'd always usually just get a trim
and then they'd like force me to layer
it they're like please layers I would
and so I just tell them to do like very
long layers but then it's probably grown
up quite a bit but um I went in and I
decided to get it very much layered so
my shortest layer was probably to my
well okay my shortest layer was in the
back and at the time my short so if I
were to take a back hair they had cut it
to like here so it was like at the top
of my ear that was my shortest layer
again it has grown quite a bit since
then but I got it short so my first
layer started here so I had very short
hair in the back which I loved because
if you're the type of person looking for
volume in your hair and you have very
fine hair and it doesn't have a lot of
volume get it cut because if they cut it
too very short layers and you have
layers starting here you can tease your
hair a lot easier and it'll just look
more it'll have more volume because of
the way it's cut but anyway so I started
having layers there and again it went
down and she kind of cut it at a slant
here and then there's long here so I
mean that is I just asked for shorter
layers and your hair stylist will know
what you're talking about when you say
shorter layers but you can always tell
her where you want your shortest layer
to start so like when I went in the
second time I told her that I wanted my
shortest layer to start I don't know
like the tip of my nose ear level like
middle of my nose like right below my
eye I said like for different things but
just tell her where you wanted to start
I mean again I had it like middle of my
face
so just say that or like top of my ear I
don't know or say your chin I used to
that used to be might fall back that I
would say my shortest layer be at my
chin and so they always have my shortest
layer here so I always do that and then
as for my bangs I don't really have
bangs so I I did hat used to get cut
bangs like very side-swept bangs I'd get
on like here you know very side-swept
and then I started to grow them out now
she just trimmed them so my
bangs are probably let's see a little
bit below my chin so like this is
probably my shortest one and yeah I
really like it it's very versatile I can
wear part my hair down the middle and it
doesn't look awkward the one stylist I
had she had cut my hair start parted in
the middle and so she cut my layers that
way and so that way she said that when I
do part it on the side it'll still look
like I have somewhat of bangs if you
just tell her that that you'd like to
part your hair in multiple different
places she'll cut it that way they know
what they're doing if you guys have any
further questions about my hair comment
below now I get a lot more comments now
so it's harder for me to reply because I
don't they don't all tell me on my home
page they'll say like you have two
comments and I'll look and they'll be
like five so um it's kind of hard to see
everyone's comment I will be able to
answer like simple questions down in the
comments below cuz I'll see all those
but if you have a very elaborate
question message me you guys kind of
know that is it for this hair video I
really hope you guys liked it and again
if you have any questions or comments
comment below or message me tell me what
you think give me a thumbs up and yeah
I'll see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
