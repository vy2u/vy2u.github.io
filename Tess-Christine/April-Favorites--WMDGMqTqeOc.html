video is going to be my April favorites
it's May first of all which meaning may
means that school's out today actually
was my last day of school yay so super
excited because no more school and now
it's summer for me so I just have all
the time in the world now to just crank
out these videos for you guys another
reason why made rocks is because I got a
new camera and I am so excited about
this new camera it was kind of an early
birthday present and I'm still trying to
figure it out so hopefully this video
turns out okay I'm just kind of like
testing the waters with it I have not
used it this is my first time filming
with it so hopefully it turns out the
camera by the way that I got is the
Canon Rebel t3i so yeah I'm excited
about it i really like it so far but yes
today's video is going to be my april
favorites and april was kind of a hectic
month for me because it was the last
month of school and so I had a bunch of
stuff for my classes to do and it was
just crazy crazy crazy and I don't have
a lot of products to show you actually I
have more like fashion favorites more so
than like product favorites but I'm just
gonna get right into it and start right
with the product favorite so the first
favorite that I'm loving right now that
I actually just started trying in April
is the Smashbox ready BB cream and this
is actually not the first BB cream that
I've tried the first BB cream that I
tried was when I was back in England I
tried the garner one but I think that's
what it's called the Guarnere BB cream
and I absolutely hated it I thought it
gave me no coverage it made me like way
more oily and so judging by that that
was the first BB cream I had ever tried
and I absolutely hated it so I kind of
steered myself away from BB creams just
for that reason but then I heard good
things about this one and I wanted to
try it so this is one I got this
matchbox camera ready BB cream and the
color I got in was light medium but this
is actually a tad too dark for me right
now so I mix it with a lighter
foundation which kind of defeats the
purpose i guess i'll go BB cream but
right now i really do like it when i get
obviously more tan in the summer i will
this will be the perfect shade for me
and i like this because it's super light
um and it doesn't feel really heavy on
my skin which i like especially for the
summer because here in the summer it
gets really really hot um which is crazy
because in the winter is here it's like
really really cold so it's like a
complete 180
that's why I like wearing either like
tinted moisturizers or something like
that in the summer alright so the next
thing I'm loving right now is the
concealer that I've showed you guys
before and it is the Maybelline instant
age rewind concealer and I really really
like this stuff a lot i'm like almost
out of it and i've been using this all
of april and i just use it under my eyes
i started to use it more so like on my
other parts of my face but i found that
it actually made me break out I don't
know for sure if it was this but I'm
kind of positive yeah that it was so um
I just stick with this underneath my
eyes and I really like the way that it
covers my under eye circles because I
have really bad ones and this one really
helps a lot and the color i'm in is in
this is light and that is it for makeup
stuff actually which is really
surprising i only have two really
different stuff i mean i'm using
basically the same stuff that I've
always shown you but those are my two
like stand-up favorites for the month of
april my next favorite is actually a
nail polish kind of it's a top coat and
it's from SE and i really really like
this stuff and it is the fast drying one
it says good to go on it i don't know if
there's like different ones of that but
um it's just like the fast drying top
coat and this seriously works so good
and i used to use the OPI topcoat and i
found that i didn't like that stuff at
all i feel like mine might have just
been really old because it got really
thick and like made my nail polish weird
on top I just didn't like it so I tried
a different one and I really like the
stuff and this fast drying stuff
actually really works if you're the type
of person who hates just like sitting
around waiting for your nails to dry for
a really long time this stuff works in
like a couple minutes seriously no joke
so I really like this stuff a lot the
next thing I'm loving is a hair product
and it is the one and only argan oil oil
at oil treatment and I actually started
this before April but i've been using it
ever since and i absolutely love it and
I don't think I've actually ever
mentioned this in a favorites video
before I don't do a lot of favorites
videos but um yeah so I thought I would
include this it is the one and only
argan oil I really love using this stuff
after my after I take a shower it smells
seriously so good I really like how my
hair feels especially after I blow dry
my hair because I tend to blow dry my
hair a lot so I like that a lot I think
it makes my hair feel very soft and just
very healthy next thing is a face
product and if you guys watch my
skincare routine you guys know that I
used
sonic proactive all that kind of stuff
but I'm actually really loving the for
the morning sorry backtrack for the
morning I use a different face wash
because proactive is just a little bit
too hard for me in the mornings um
because I use it at night so I try to
steer away from that and in the mornings
I use something else and I've always
been a big fan of the cleaning clear
morning burst and I found a new clean
and clear product that I really like and
it's by morning burst but it's the fruit
infusions which I think are awesome and
I love this one especially this one is
the mandarin orange one well it's an
orange one but the scent is mandarin
orange and seriously you guys this F
smells so good I love it so much and it
just makes me feel so much more
energized in the morning I just love
having like a fruity bright scented
smell in the morning when I'm taking a
shower or even just washing my face in
the morning I love this stuff this one
is for it's a fruit infusion purifying
cleanser and it is for cleanses to
purify pores which I really like because
I have pores I hear that I like to take
care of and this stuff really works I
like the stuff a lot they have a couple
other ones that um do different stuff so
make sure you check out the bottom like
right here on what it says this one is
for pores so this 1 i'm loving right now
and you can get this pretty much at any
drugstore the next thing i'm loving is a
scent and especially for right now
spring into summer this is like my
all-time favorite scent you guys have
heard me talk about this before but i
have to bring it out again because it's
no longer winter it is now spring and
summer so my favorite scent right now is
daisy by marc jacobs i love it i think
it's so festive for um spraying with the
flowers on top of it i really really
like this stuff a lot it smells so good
and I don't know why every time I talk
about her perfume or anyone on YouTube
packs water perfume they smell it
because I already know what smells like
and it's not like you guys can smell it
but if you guys could you guys should go
smell this stuff if you haven't gotten
it already because it's like seriously
the perfect summer scent it just feels
so fresh and awesome when you wear it in
the summers the next thing I'm loving is
fashion pieces and one in particular are
big statement necklaces and I never used
to be a big fan of these until like
April so I've been
these right now they're just really
really awesome way to like dress up an
outfit so this one I'm wearing right now
is from hmmm this is probably one of my
favorites I don't have too many but if I
had to pick one this one is like my
seriously absolute favorite I got this
at h and I'm actually pretty recently
like in april so they might still have
it so if you have an HTM you should
definitely go check that out I love
other ones like big chunky ones you
probably have seen before like this one
this one is from forever 21 just like
big chunky necklaces I just really
seemed to love lazy and like this one
you saw in my hall this one is like a
kind of like a peter pan collar looking
one this one is a really cool one it's
very unique which is why I like this one
a lot and then kind of like just like
basic statement jewelry I like this one
it's a chain um that's these both of our
Windsor I like those a lot so yeah
that's like one fashion accessory that
I'm absolutely loving for April is like
big statement necklaces and I think they
look really great with dresses to like
I'm wearing a strapless dress right now
and I have like a big statement jewelry
piece on and I think it kind of adds
like flare up in here so it's even
really perfect for summer too so that's
why I'm loving it for April but i'll
probably continue wearing it through May
and June and all that stuff another
thing i'm really loving is collars any
type of collar whether it's a peter pan
collar just like a basic collar i'm
loving collars right now in the winter i
didn't really get to like wear that a
whole lot because where i live it's gets
very cold so scarves is like a must-have
was probably like my everyday thing to
wear but now that it's getting warmer
spring and summer I love wearing collars
seriously like chiffon collared shirts
or just like collard tank tops I
absolutely love that look I think it's
really really like put together and you
still look cute but also casual and the
last fashion thing that I'm loving right
now is anything high-waisted I'm
absolutely a sucker for that trend I
think the highways to turn it is just
awesome i love it so much I'm it's
actually very difficult to find
high-waisted things if you're like I'm
hunt for them because I know I sherry m
and it's very hard to find some like
skirts you can wear high waisted I love
that I love the hi-low trend right now I
absolutely love that but I also love
like the high-waisted shorts and those
are like a hot commodity and they're
very hard to find if you want to find a
cheap pair because you can find very
expensive pairs but i don't really like
spending like hundred dollars on a pair
of jean shorts so i'm on
first the more have like two pairs now
but I'm on the hunt for like cheaper
versions of thumbs so that's what i'm
loving right now as of like fashion
favorites for april and probably made
two in the summer so this that's why
favorites videos are just like kind of
weird to me because i loved it all of
april but I'm like continuously loving
them that's why I don't really do
favorites videos all that often because
like when I have a favorite it doesn't
just like stopped at the end of the
month like usually these things like
continue so I just feel like very
repetitive when I start talking about
them that's why I don't really do
favorites videos all that often but
anyways that's what I'm loving right now
i hope this video kind of helped you
guys out find new products and that kind
of stuff if you're interested in trying
them because i recommend everything that
i showed you guys today so yeah that is
pretty much it for this video i really
hope you guys liked it i hope the
quality is better because i really hope
so i really hope so I hope you guys are
having a wonderful day it's the first
day of summer for me so I'm very very
happy and very excited but yeah I will
see you guys in my next video bye
