be an ask test video you guys know
exactly what these things are so I'm not
going to really explain it but if you
want to be a part of the next ask test
then go ahead and follow me on my
Twitter because that's where I use the
hashtag and also if your question that
doesn't get answered or something you
want to know about me doesn't get
answered in this video it might have
already been answered in my previous ask
test video about a month ago
so I'll have that linked below ok so the
first question that I see is what is
your favorite song from one Direction's
four and why and I think the reason why
I got this question is because I've been
tweeting a lot about it lately because
I've been listening to that album like
crazy I'm in love with it but my two
favorite are probably where do broken
hearts go and Stockholm Syndrome what
has been your favorite get the look
video so far probably my Taylor Swift
one I know that might be kind of
surprising cuz she dresses a little bit
different from me but for whatever
reason I just really liked her outfit it
was also a very smooth sailing get the
look video as far as finding the outfits
for less because that always takes a
while so I just think I really enjoyed
that one I loved how it turned out this
one I thought was a little bit different
and it is are you more of an Anna or
Elsa from frozen definitely probably
more of an Elsa Anna is very outgoing
and bubbly and kind of like super hyper
all the time and that's definitely not
me if you know me I'm a little bit more
shy kind of more on the Elsa side of
things so I'd definitely say more of an
Elsa what do you want to do after
YouTube obviously not saying you should
ever stop but if the time ever comes
after YouTube I probably will want to do
something with PR and marketing I'm not
quite sure what but I definitely love
marketing side of things I also really
love beauty and fashion so I definitely
want to stay in the realm of that sort
of thing I also really want to continue
on my get the look videos umm I just
feel like I have a knack for a look for
less type of thing so I would love to
either go into like a column or write
for a magazine something along those
lines if I don't end up doing YouTube
for the rest of my life
biggest pet peeve definitely fake people
I it's like my biggest pet peeve I feel
like I have a knack for reading people
really well when I first meet them kind
of like I don't know the energy they
give off and I just feel like I'm a
cancer if you're into horoscope signs
and I feel like that's something we
possess as cancer
is being able to kind of like pick up on
certain signals with people and I feel
like I'm able to tell if they're being
real with me or not and if they're not
it's like my biggest pet peeve because I
just absolutely hate it what are your
favorite YouTube videos to watch now
that's kind of funny because I don't
actually watch videos that I make like
the type of videos I make I love to make
beauty and fashion videos but I don't
watch other beauty and fashion youtubers
like sometimes I do most the time I
really enjoy watching blog type videos
like the Shaytards or Zoe and Alfie I
started a blog channel myself and I
really enjoy blogging but um yeah I tend
to steer away from watching other beauty
and fashion videos just because I also
feel like sometimes you can be
influenced if you watch them too much
and want to do what other people do so I
tend to just kind of like stage my
channel and do what I want to do and not
try to get influenced by other things
what is your favorite season of the year
and why fall only because it's like the
best weather where I live you guys know
I live in Minnesota summer it gets crazy
crazy hot here but fall is just like the
perfect temperature and colors it's just
really pretty outside what was the last
picture you took with your phone well I
guess it wasn't a picture I actually
took but I just saved it to my camera
roll so this is the last one on here it
is a picture of me my grandpa and my
brother and we're eating Donuts next is
what was the hardest part about starting
a YouTube channel for me it was
definitely putting myself out there for
the world to basically say whatever they
wanted to say I was a very kind of like
shy person especially in middle school
in high school it was kind of very timid
about everything and so when I randomly
decided to start a YouTube channel I was
really nervous because people can say
anything that they want and there's no
like repercussion for it but also I was
I was really confident in what I was
making but I was also really scared of
like what other people would think and
like people that I know so I was
probably the hardest part what advice do
you have for someone considering
starting a fashion blog or YouTube I
think my biggest advice has changed over
the years obviously of course be
yourself but I think now YouTube has
just changed so much we see people you
know can we get this to 5 million
thousand likes and comments and I
like who can have you know the best
editing or you know the nicest cameras
and it's just it when I first started
doing YouTube it wasn't about that at
all it was just people just genuinely
sharing what they loved and it wasn't
about the numbers or how many followers
you can have and I think my biggest
advice for you if you want to start
something is to not look at those people
that are super successful and try to be
like them or do your videos like them I
definitely am guilty of getting caught
up into it and this year I kind of
realized you know what I'm gonna do me
and not try to do what's trending and
what's getting a lot of views and you
see such a common thing in YouTube now
and the way videos are being edited are
very similar I think that's a huge thing
that if you want to start your own it's
making sure that you're doing you you're
doing what you love and you're being
creative in your own way instead of
getting caught up and what's really
popular what's getting a lot of views
who's getting the most subscribers I
definitely think that that's
intimidating and I think if you don't
get caught up in it that's my biggest
recommendation and advice for you is to
really make your channel your own and
not try to be a duplicate of anyone else
what's your guilty pleasure
definitely dorky TV shows like The
Bachelor or like MTV are you the one or
those kind of shows that are just kind
of like stupid but really fun to watch
favorite emoji I'm gonna look in my
recent emojis but my most I think my
most used one I love the monkey going
like this when he's like covering his
nose I think that one is so cute I also
really love the smiley face it's like
smiling but um it's like blushing I
really like that one and I also like the
one that's like this she's like a girl
and she's like hey how old are you I'm
23 going to be 24 in June next is what
is your favorite TV show and I have a
bunch but most recently I think my
favorites are revenge because I just
started watching that on Netflix
American Horror Story Dexter Vampire
Diaries and Pretty Little Liars are
probably my top 5 would you rather go
back in a time machine or to be able to
see the future I think she meant future
um definitely not see the future I do
not want to know I think that's the
exciting part about the future is you
don't know it's coming and I
like if you knew you wouldn't work as
hard or I don't know it would it would
just change everything if you knew what
was coming but I think going back in
time I wouldn't want to change anything
that happened in the past just because
that would mess stuff up but I would
want to go back and experience things
like I think of Vampire Diaries when
they wear like the decade dresses I just
think that that'd be so fun and like
different to experience I don't know if
you could spend the day with any
celebrity who would you choose and it's
funny because like I said I've been
really listening to one Direction's
album recently so I think I would say
one direction only because they seem
like super cool dudes and from what I
can tell they're just really goofy they
remind me a lot of my guy friends so I
feel like they'd be super fun to hang
out with or it would be like Johnny Depp
or Leonardo DiCaprio they would be
really cool to like sit down and have a
conversation with which program do you
use to edit your videos Final Cut Pro
how long does it take you to find the
clothes for your get the looks I get a
lot of questions I'm gonna get the look
videos and they definitely are my
favorite videos but they're also the
most time-consuming it takes me a really
long time to find the clothes if I
dedicate like a whole day to finding
them I'll be fine and I'll find them
mostly all of them and then I'll just go
ahead and order them right away but it
usually takes me a few days of kind of
looking through because you guys know if
you watch my get the lip videos that I
usually do about six outfits name your
three favorite snacks almonds Pirate's
Booty popcorn and apples and peanut
butter is there anywhere else in the
world that you could see yourself living
and I hate to say it but definitely the
West Coast California area it just sucks
that all youtubers move there and now
it's become such like a cliche thing but
Patrick has always wanted to live there
I've always wanted to live there we both
lived in the Midwest our whole entire
lives like Wisconsin Minnesota and I
just am sick of the cold it's cold here
six months out of the entire year I
would love to live by the beach and the
warm weather when will you do a meet-up
I want to see you do I want to see you
guys too honestly I want to do a meet-up
so bad I've never done one believe it or
not that's just crazy to me but meetups
are actually so hard to coordinate if
you have to get approval from malls and
stores and it's just a matter of finding
stores that will do that I have some
plan in the spring and summer so fingers
crossed that they go through do you
believe in standards being too high as a
bad thing as in when it comes to dating
love you love you too
no actually I was just having this
conversation with my friend Carrie and
we were talking about guys and standards
and I think there comes a point where
you're being like too picky to where
you're like I'm only gonna date Harry
Styles and that's it I think that's
really high of standards and that's
probably not realistic but I think that
there's no such thing in high standards
and knowing what you want I think before
you even really start looking for a
partner or dating or anything like that
you should really be comfortable with
yourself and know what you want and
yourself as a person and then once you
do I feel like you'll know what you like
and what you feel like you'll click with
and gopher Gulch girl there's no reason
that you shouldn't be happy and you
should never settle if you knew that
whatever you tried doing you would
succeed what would you do I think I
would definitely be an actress I feel
like that would be a really fun job I
could be completely wrong I've never
done it but I feel like that would be
I'm dying to be in your video I love you
you're in my video I love you too would
you rather have the ability to not sleep
or to not need food if I didn't have to
sleep like my body just didn't have to
sleep at beach so stoked I'd be like all
right I have just like an extra you know
eight hours to do stuff and I would love
that I've just never really got him in
and I was kind of an insomniac growing
up so I would definitely choose no
sleeping over no food cuz I love food
what's the first thing that you notice
about people definitely the way that
they present themselves their energy
their confidence and their eyes what are
you excited about I think the most thing
the biggest thing I'm excited about is I
wish I could tell you all the details
but I don't think I can it's a personal
thing that I'm working on and I'm so
excited to show you guys this and I just
honestly can't wait um a hint it has to
do with my get the look for last videos
what is your favorite milkshake it's
either chocolate or strawberry as
switch-off what is your favorite pizza
topping all of the above as much as I
can put on my pizza I will put it on who
is your current style icon definitely
Selena Gomez or even Kendall Jenner um
between those I would take both of their
closets in a heartbeat what is a beauty
tip that you preach but don't always
practice cleaning makeup brushes
Halloween or Valentine's Day Halloween
hands down Valentine's Day is super
overrated Plus Halloween you get to
dress up if someone were to make a movie
about your life who would you hope to
play you nina dobrev those are all the
questions I decided to answer in this
acid test video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it stay tuned because I have I
get the look for One Direction video
coming out I know I keep saying that but
I want to make it perfect for you guys
I'm using a bunch of my friends in it so
it's hard to coordinate schedules but
it's almost done so stay tuned for that
and I will see you guys in my next video
