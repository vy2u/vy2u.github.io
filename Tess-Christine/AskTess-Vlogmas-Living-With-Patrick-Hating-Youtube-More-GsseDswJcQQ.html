video and I haven't done one of these in
a really long time and recently I've
just been getting a ton of requests for
me to do this video so I tweeted out
this morning and I was like should i
film a test video today and you guys are
all like yes yes yes OMG yes so I was
really excited because I feel special
that you guys want to know more about me
and I know it's kind of cool I am NOT
gonna do this in any particular order
I'm literally just gonna take my phone
and I'm just gonna start reading tweets
and answering questions that you guys
tweeted me okay so this one I'm getting
a ton and it's what do you love most
about your fans or subscribers I just
feel like we share a passion for this
together like I started this because I
love doing this stuff and I just think
it's so amazing when you guys get so
excited about a video equally as excited
as I do because I don't know I just feel
like we're friends like we get each
other we want to see the same things I
want to film the same things that you
guys want to see hopefully I don't know
I just think you guys are awesome and
you just always make me feel good like I
just can't express to you guys how many
times I've had like a bad day and I just
wake up and read through like Instagram
comments or tweets and Facebook stuff
and or even just YouTube comments and
it's just like makes me feel so good
what is your favorite song right now I
think what I'm listening to the most is
the Ariana Grande her new album but also
I really am enjoying ed Sheeran Sam
Smith
I'm loving the new Hilary Duff song all
about you yes I'm loving that she's
coming back okay this one is when are
you coming back to England hopefully
soon I don't know I don't have an exact
date plan or anything but you guys
didn't know I studied abroad my junior
year of college so about three years ago
maybe no I don't know and it was amazing
I lived in England for four months and I
travelled I went to Italy France Poland
Amsterdam Spain it was just amazing and
I was just so blessed to be able to do
that in college like studying abroad is
amazing and I recommend it to anyone
next question is what is your favorite
to fall drink what I get at Starbucks is
soy hazelnut latte or soy vanilla latte
I don't like the pumpkin spice latte so
if a fall drink that's kind of
stereotypical to say pumpkin spice but I
do not like that
ever since I can remember my mom used to
make chai tea during the holiday season
and loved chai tea what is your favorite
thing about you being a youtuber it's
amazing that youtubers are given so much
freedom to basically have a channel of
their own and create anything that they
want to I think it's amazing that you
can share like I said before a passion
with a group of people like you all my
viewers that love what I create and I
love what I create and I think it's so
cool what's your favorite thing about
the holiday time I love snow for a
little bit I wish it wouldn't last as
long as it does here but snow during the
holiday holiday time is something I've
always known and I love it I love that I
love the coziness the feeling of it I
think I'm gonna do vlogmas this year and
I've never done like a full-on vlog type
of thing at all so I feel like I should
try it I don't know what do you guys
think
next is which movie would you like to be
in off the top of my head just like an
overall like movie that I've seen
forever that I think would be great
would be Willy Wonka and the Chocolate
Factory or Wizard of Oz to be in either
of those films would be so cool how much
time in a week do you spend filming and
editing I would say I'm doing something
YouTube related every single day as you
guys know I graduated last December with
a graduated from college after I got my
degree I just kind of stuck with YouTube
if you guys watched my after graduation
video and so now I'm doing youtube and
eventually I'm gonna do something with
PR and marketing though how did you get
the courage to start your channel and
tell all your friends and family about
it ever since I was young like teenager
maybe even younger I would be obsessed
with like finding looks for cheaper for
celebrities that I loved people would
ask me questions on it and I'd be like
you know I got it here I got here and
then I was like oh I feel like YouTube
is a great way to put out what you love
to do and I loved that so I was like oh
I might as well start sharing my tips
and tricks for hair make
and outfits I wasn't really nervous
about it but I was nervous about my
friends finding out only a select few of
my friends knew and my family knew and
that was it and I kept it a secret for
probably two years and that's when
people started finding out about it is
was after that people talk and it's not
necessarily all good but now I get so
much positive feedback on it so it's
great but yeah the first few years were
a little rocky with people finding out
about it which celeb would you like to
be for a day and why hands down Nina
Dobrev she's my woman crush Wednesday
every Wednesday I love that girl I just
think she is seems I don't know her
obviously but she seems so down-to-earth
an awesome plus you guys if I could pick
a day to be her it would be a day she's
filming Vampire Diaries that's pretty
self-explanatory I mean have you seen
her co-stars what are countries you
would like to visit again and why would
you want to visit them I love traveling
traveling is one of my favorite things
to do if I could afford to do it and
have the time to do it I would do it
constantly I would just be like a little
gypsy and just travel the world
constantly that'd be amazing next is
what is it like to live with a boyfriend
are there certain problems or advantages
Patrick and I were kind of like thrown
into the situation of having to kind of
live together or have to do like severe
distance and we didn't want to choose
distance so I moved in with him in the
summer I'm still obviously here but he's
finishing up school now so I'm living
here at the moment I love it it's great
there's obviously some disadvantages I
mean you're with them all the time even
with families like I'm sure you have
times where you and your family don't
get along or you fight you know with
your brother or sister or your parents
it's it's just like that if you're with
somebody all the time you're not gonna
be happy and in a good mood all the time
so there's definitely some obstacles to
overcome
but it's also a huge test of your
relationship because if you can get over
certain things like that or certain
petty things that happen while living
with each other you know it's worth it
but is the best and worst part about
being a youtuber and I kind of already
answered this question some negative
things are obviously hate that is so
hard to deal with
and will continue to be hard I also
we hate the dislike button only because
I feel like you should write an
explanation
unlike why you're disliking the video
because it's like it's not helping me
like I've gotten so many comments or
people I like telling me why they didn't
like the video or what I can do
differently that is amazing because
that's like constructive criticism but
just like a dislike is like telling me
nothing like you know what I mean also
feeling like you have to compete with
other youtubers that's what I hate I
just I feel like it shouldn't be about
that I love the team internet thing it's
great um but I almost feel like
sometimes especially with beauty gurus
like there's similar videos going around
I mean there's like obviously trends
like morning routines look videos
lookbook videos um DIY designs and stuff
like that and it's almost like you feel
like you have to hurry up and do it
before somebody else does because
otherwise you're gonna be a copycat I
feel like sometimes when you upload a
video it's like oh this wasn't as good
as this person's or this wasn't as good
as this person's and I don't know like I
hate that part of it like I hate feeling
like you have to compete to like be
better if you could collab with five
youtubers who do you want to collab with
so my first one would be probably okay
like Tyler Oakley for sure another one
would be Miranda sings yes please next
one would be so Ella because she's
awesome I love her I don't think she
knows who I met I am or anything but
watching her videos I feel like we
relate in a lot of ways in in I don't
know just in personality um bethany mota
would be awesome and then that last one
hmm grace Helbig may be I always loved
her videos I still do but she'd be a
funny one and she'd be really fun to
collab with so yeah when will you do a
meet-up and hopefully soon I want you so
bad I just don't know really how to do
one like I'm so out of it but I really
want to meet you guys
and it's so hard to like coordinate
meetups but I've never done one and I
really really need to do more especially
international meetups that's what my
bucket list I want to do international
need
so bad and the last question is that I'm
gonna do is what advice do you give to
people who are self-conscious I think
that because I you know am so shy and
introverted I feel like I can relate to
you guys in this because being
self-conscious it's so hard everybody
struggles with I still struggle with it
it's one of those things that being
confident in yourself doesn't just
happen overnight
different experiences will you know test
you as a person and help you realize
more and more who you are when I was a
teenager oh I thought it was end at the
world man like I just was like it's
never gonna go up from here but it
really does so yeah and I'm here for you
guys you know that I always love
tweeting you and Instagram DMing you
guys all the time or with advice friend
advice boyfriend advice I love doing
that kind of stuff but yeah that
concludes my ask test video for today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I have
some awesome holiday videos planned but
I want to hear more so let me know your
requests in the comments below I hope
you guys are having a wonderful day and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
