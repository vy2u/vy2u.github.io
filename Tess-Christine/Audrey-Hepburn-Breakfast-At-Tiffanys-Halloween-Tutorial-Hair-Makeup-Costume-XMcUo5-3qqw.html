Halloween tutorial for those of you who
have seen Breakfast at Tiffany's I
recreated the lovely and ever so classy
Audrey Hepburn it's super easy to
achieve so I hope you all enjoy it
starting out with the makeup of course
I'm going to prime my eyes to make sure
that the eye shadow but more importantly
the eye liner stays in place so for the
eye shadow it's very minimal all I'm
doing is taking a beige color and
sweeping that over my lids and then
taking a matte brown color and placing
that into the crease to give a
definition to the eyes and a more
defined crease like Audrey has and then
I'm going to finish with some white
shimmery color onto the brow bone moving
on to the most important part of the eye
makeup look
Audrey has a very dramatic cat eye in
the movie so I'm going to create this by
using a gel liner from L'Oreal how I'm
doing this is working the eye liner from
the outside of my eye inwards I found
this to be the easiest for me to achieve
this look with my eye shape I want to
make sure that I'm keeping the line very
gradual and at the same thickness
Audrey has a very thick line at the top
of her lash line so you want to make
sure it follows your eye shape and stay
subtle because Audrey's isn't too
dramatic now I'm just flicking it out
and connecting it with the rest of the
liner to make sure it's clean and
polished I'm just going to go over that
with a liquid liner from Lancome I want
to do this because I want to make it
almost look perfect like Audrey's and
give it a little bit of shine to balance
the look I am just going to be taking a
light brown eyeliner and sweeping that
onto my lower lash line not in my
waterline because you still want to make
your eyes look big like Audrey's so I'm
just going to kind of smudge that in to
make it look a little bit more natural
now I'm going to apply some mascara in
preparation for the crazy false lashes
now Audrey in this movie is all about
false lashes but instead of using strip
lashes I wanted to make them look a
little bit more natural so I used
individual lashes and I used the medium
length now these are kind of tricky to
apply and it takes practice but luckily
the glue dries clear so you kind of have
room for error so once I did that I just
applied them all over my lashes to give
that big fluttery look that she has now
I'm just taking some concealer and
putting that underneath my eyes to give
a more polished and perfect look and of
course I've already applied some
foundation Audrey has amazing defined
cheekbones and
I don't so I'm going to cheat a little
bit by using a sculpting cream you don't
want to use a bronzer because back then
they didn't have like super brown on
their face it was more polished and like
perfect porcelain skin but I wanted to
define mine a little bit more to match
hers and then of course add some
highlighter to further define my
cheekbones now I'm going to apply a
light pink shimmery blush to the apples
of my cheeks it's not super noticeable
but you don't want it to be the eyebrows
are actually the second most important
part to this makeup look because Adri in
this movie has actually very thick and
defined eyebrows so I'm going to fill
mine in using a brow powder this is just
really important to match her look
because it kind of takes over the eyes
as well as the eyeliner so it's really
important to fill your eyebrows in and
match hers if you want to get that kind
of exact Audrey Hepburn look that she
has in this movie to match Audrey's lips
I'm just going to line my lips and fill
it in with a nude lip pencil this one is
from Too Faced I found that it matched
my lip color and hers the best and then
over it to give that kind of mafia pink
color that she has I'm just going to go
over this with this Rimmel lipstick and
that completes the makeup I really love
this I think it has kind of like an
elegant and classy look to it I think
it's just super super pretty so now
let's move on to the hair now I've seen
a bunch of versions of this hairstyle
but I decided to do something that gives
the same look but is a lot easier and so
many more of you will be able to achieve
it at home so first and gathering a
portion of the front of my hair and back
combing it for some volume then I'm just
going to loosely gather the hair
slightly to one side and pin it with
some bobby pins this will give you that
same parted and lifted look Audrey has
at the top of her head now after I
finish that I'm just going to begin
gathering the rest of my hair into a
ponytail at the top of my head now
normally you would see Audrey with kind
of like this French twist in the back of
her head leading up to the top but that
look can be very challenging and that's
hairstyle
not everybody can achieve on their own
so I wanted to show you something that
gives you a similar look to Audrey's
just an easier way now I'm sure many of
you have seen these donut looking things
before but what they do is they help you
create sort of a perfect bun so all I'm
doing is taking that and placing that
around my ponytail down to the
days now I'm flipping my head over and
making sure all of the hair pieces
covered with the rest of my hair now I'm
going to take a ponytail and I'm going
to slide that directly over the bun and
now you can see I have this kind of
perfect looking bun but I'm going to
pull this out a bit at the sides to give
more of an oval shape to it instead of a
circle to match Audrey's with the rest
of the hair I'm just going to lightly
wrap that around the bun and what I mean
by lightly is you don't want to pull too
tight around the bun with those extra
pieces you want to do it lightly because
you don't want to notice it's a bun you
kind of want it to look like a uniform
updo so I'm lightly pinning the rest of
the hair around on the rest of the bun
and now because audrey has these kind of
baby curls that frame her face and
around her neck I'm just going to take a
teasing brush and kind of try to match
those even though I don't have the same
baby girl she does now her hair look
wouldn't be complete without a little
crown so I picked this up at crafts
direct for only about ten dollars has a
little comb on the end so it fits
perfectly at the start of the bun now
that the hair and makeup are complete
I'm going to show you my version of her
outfit starting out and adding black
gloves from Windsor these are a staple
piece to the costume so don't forget
them for her dress I wear this peplum
style dress from Windsor that I've had
for a while now to achieve the same look
all you really need is a black sleek
dress with a higher neckline so look
through your closet and see what you
have
Audrey's look is very classic so adding
the basic pieces will give you the same
look without it having to be exact for
her necklace I wrapped a long pearl
necklace around my neck three times and
added a rhinestone pin from crafts
direct the cigarette-holder is from
Party City and was only about three
dollars but that is it for this audrey
hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany's
Halloween tutorial I hope those of you
