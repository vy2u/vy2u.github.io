be an autumn lookbook I got so many
requests to do this kind of a lookbook
this year so I thought I would do it for
you guys so I really hope you enjoy most
of my outfits in the fall are actually
pretty casual but this one in particular
is pretty plain there's not much to it
all I'm wearing are these disco pants
from American Apparel I really like
disco pants because there are a little
bit thicker than normal leggings plus
they have a shine to them so I think
they're kind of fun and add a different
kind of dimension to your outfit and
then for my sweater I'm wearing this
heart printed one from Zara it's really
comfortable and flowy and I thought it
looked perfect tucked into the disco
pants this next outfit is one of my
favorites because I'm really loving the
thigh high socks trend that's going on
this season so how I did it was I just
took these velvet textured shorts from
Topshop and then paired it with a grey
sweater from forever 21 and this big
chunky beroun sweater from Zara and the
socks themselves those are from Nasty
Gal but those are everywhere this season
because that's just like a huge trend
and I definitely wanted to try it out
the belt I'm not really sure where the
belt is from because I got it off of a
dress so I have no idea who that's from
but it's just a simple brown belt and
then for the shoes I just paired some
basic black booties from Express
clearly I'm loving the same black
booties from Express because I paired it
with this outfit too but this outfit is
so so simple acts like my favorite thing
to dress in the fall is just comfy and
cozy but still super cute so I just
paired these leggings from Zara that
have kind of like a zip detail they're
super comfy they're thicker which is
good because like you guys know I live
in Minnesota so it gets cold quickly
here
so I'm wearing that with just a white
sweater from H&amp;amp;M and then my necklace is
from Nasty Gal finding basic pieces with
like added detail like the leggings with
the zipper and then adding a chunky
necklace to a plain outfit really makes
it pop so that's why I like doing it
for this next outfit I really really
loved the texture of the scarf and how
it's kind of fuzzy so I wanted to keep
it with kind of like a subtle outfit so
for my outfit I'm just wearing basic
Levi's skinny jeans and then for the top
I'm just wearing this maroon colored top
from Zara the scarf itself is from Nasty
Gal it's super cozy and warm and I just
love it and then for my hat that's from
Urban Outfitters and then my buckled
booties are from forever 21
the snacks outfit I decided to wear the
same buckled booties from forever21
booties like I told you guys in my
favourites video are my favorite fall
staple accessory or clothing item I just
pair it with everything and I love those
because those are super inexpensive for
my jacket I just wore a leather jacket
this one is from karma my shirt or
sweater it's actually a sweater that's
from ASOS I love kind of like graphic
prints and this one was kind of subtle I
didn't want anything too crazy so I
really liked that and then for my hat
I've had this for a while but the fuzzy
hat with the pom-pom on the end which is
so cute is from Topshop and they're my
jeans are the same from before which are
from Levi's and lastly I thought I would
show you guys my favorite fall coat at
the moment this one is from Macy's the
brand is guest it was on a super great
deal and I just loved it because of the
bright red color but yeah that's it
special shout out to this cute boy who
helped me film the video you guys always
