giggles little middle of building okay
you I'm gonna take this no no okay
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel today's video is going to be a
fun one because it involves this
handsome man it's been a really long
time right it's been a while besides
like vlogs and stuff I feel like we
haven't done the challenge video in a
while
yes it's been a minute and I was kind of
searching on what to do because we kind
of ran out of ideas and we came across
the boyfriend buys my outfits or shops
for me whatever I thought it was perfect
for this channel because you guys know
he talks about fashion a lot but I was a
little hesitant to do it because Pat
films all my videos so he kind of knows
how I dress and how I put outfits
together so I thought it wouldn't be
really funny because I feel like you're
gonna kill it I hope so I tried I think
he did alright
so instead of going to stores to have
them pick up stuff I thought I would
just go on one site you guys know I shop
on Windsor a lot so I thought it would
be a really good option because Windsor
is not only affordable but it also has
like 50% of things I don't like and 50%
of things I do like so it's definitely a
toss-up so I thought that it would be a
good challenge for him to kind of go on
there and really test his skills because
it's sometimes a hit or miss so I
thought this would be a good option to
do so so I'm really excited to keep you
know office yeah I did like a couple
singular pieces that I thought you might
like and then some are meant to go
together okay so I think you three
really good at this but let's see so
alright I'm gonna close my eyes he's
gonna go get something and then bring it
back I'm really nervous actually okay
caocao yes you can I'm behind you though
okay so oh no all right skinny black
distressed jeans I think these are high
waisted yeah alright and a this is more
like a going out with the girls kind of
thing and then a floral bodysuit my
first impressions bodysuit this is
totally something that I would wear I
think you nailed this like the only
thing is maybe the flowers I don't know
pretty I think that they're pretty but I
don't know if I would have picked this
out myself but I don't think it's bad so
I guess I'll kind of judge it when I try
it on
we'll see yeah okay skinny jeans love a
good pair of high-waisted skinny jeans
but I don't think that these are my size
and these are gonna be a little too
small for me
I feel like this one was kind of
foolproof I think you did a good job
yeah did you get really bright mm-hmm
okay sorry we're using natural light so
if we get really bright and really dark
that's why um so I'm gonna rate you was
rating that goes with yeah I'm man I
didn't know that out of 10 I'm gonna
give you a 7 because this is what I'm
going this is what I would wear but I
think that it's gonna be a little too
small 7 out of 10 take it all right so -
yes I'll be number two all right
or I don't never do it alright um yeah
taking so long
okay so ready
shyona yes you can do that okay so I
think you have a pair of girlfriend
jeans and they're gonna be too small now
knowing that but you know at least um
case you never know maybe maybe they
will fit uh yeah definitely something
I'm such a girlfriend denim or like a
high-waisted denim type of person so
these are high waisted I'm in too long
and then second piece not what I'm
looking at them I'm not sure if I would
pair them together but we're already
here so I can keep going all right like
a little blouse that's kind of drapey
with bell sleeves and a little bit of
embroidery I thought it was just a cool
piece overall but I don't know if i pair
it with something so heavily distressed
now that I'm looking at them awesome so
I don't hate this top but I definitely
wouldn't buy this stuff
good to know it's just not my style it's
super cute it's just I if I was a girl
maybe I would wear I oh wait oh you
obviously can't I didn't know it was a
romper let's disregard the jeans but to
his defense and I looked at that I
really did but I knew what I was like I
didn't look tiny maybe when I did this
kit moment you know it's all right deal
look at me ah yes so it's a little tiny
romper but maybe when I try it on it all
actually worked okay so now that it's a
romper at that bell sleeves are okay
like I said I don't think I would pick
this out like on the site right away
so I think I'm gonna read this I think
I'm gonna give it a 6 only because I
don't even think I would wear this for
the season it's in me fall it's gonna be
chilly I should have taken that into
account with the last into you but
that's okay I'm doing so good I feel
like she's having these videos or me
because I'm just like you sac good okay
cool oh he's like just be confident just
roll with them
alright my GPA is slipping here oh my
god alright I'm open I am alright Oh
with the floral okay I okay
wait you gotta fold it up over the
camera where they show it so they can
see many more bell-sleeve them must have
animation I think of flowers and bell
sleeves and I just love it now I don't
even know if this looks like okay I
really like this
I like the colors of the this I feel
like this is very yeah I like this I
don't
that I don't know if I went a hundred
percent pick this out but I would style
this like over the knees it's and it
would be really cute so I think I'm
gonna write this on higher I like the
floral print because it's not too loud
and the colors are muted I'm not a huge
bright bright color person so I feel
like yeah I feel like this looks good
I'm gonna give it an eight all right
little redemption there mm-hmm
it's like a long I saw these are more
penalties snow okay a little bit of it
well you love the crochet I'm like
always known that about her if you loves
crochet and loves embroidery so I like
okay so this is what this top looks like
I like the color the only thing I don't
really like about it is the the cut of
the top I wear a lot of tops like this
but they're kind of high maintenance
because you have to work either wear a
bra light underneath it or you're like
we just come out so I don't have boobs
right correct if you can I give it a 5
I'll see myself out you've been doing
good still though okay ready
yep oh my god it actually really like
these Hail Mary right there guys tell me
this is not something I would buy and
show in a hall thank you did good
I got a recover from that last five so
cute
we're doing it they're gonna be long I
need some kind of short but still I
really really like these like a burnt
orange color and stripes
high-five you killed that one I want to
give you a ten on this because that was
for sure pick me up okay and we're
moving into fall but I thought to be
like a fun festival piece okay what okay
continue
it's here it's we're doing a man doing
it live yeah more burnt orange
oh this is cute I like this I'm gonna
have limited time to wear it but this is
actually really cute I would make this
out kinda loose and flowy it ties in the
front
good job was I supposed to wear this
with anything maybe maybe what maybe
that with the jeans maybe with the jeans
and the wrong / Viki did you gonna go
grab the jeans me you simply oh there
you go that's cute
I really like this I'm gonna give this
one a nine okay I'm gonna give it a nine
I'll take that I really like it and this
one out there yeah it's like a this I
don't they styled it on the on the
website really well and now that it's
like oh I don't but do you think it is
then I would assume us discourage it's
actually very cute I don't think this is
one I think you do something with that I
don't know you're the stylist I mean
it's cute this will be good for fall no
this is good this will be really cute
like a black sweater and some
over-the-knee boots but it oh wait Louie

like I ready too high but I knew you
