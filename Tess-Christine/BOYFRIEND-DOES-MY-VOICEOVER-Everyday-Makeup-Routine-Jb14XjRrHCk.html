channel today's video is going to be a
super fun one but first I feel like I
have to talk to you guys in a while or
at least sat down and films like an
intro so I apologize for my little short
mini youtube break even though I didn't
it felt like I was gone for a really
long time just because of winter break
but thanks for bearing with me I needed
a little mental reboot as far as like
where I wanted to take my channel in the
new year and all that fun stuff so that
leads me to my next request which is to
leave video ideas in the comments below
you guys know I love lifting listening
to you and doing what you guys want to
see so please let me know I'm in a
little bit of a funk trying to figure
out what I want to do so yeah let me
know
but anyways today's video is going to be
fun it's kind of a great way to kind of
kick it off and that is with Pat it's
the boyfriend does my voiceover and I
asked you guys on Instagram for a
challenge idea with Pat and a lot of you
guys are requesting this and that was
past favorite request so we're going to
do it I watched a few on YouTube and
they're hilarious I'm really excited to
see how Pat does because he actually
knows quite a bit about makeup so we
will be here's Chad Knauss cameo I got
close and then he is going to do the
voiceover so hey guys it is Tess here we
are going to do makeup on our face and
we're going to start with applying some
crema stings to our face look at that oh
my goodness on to the next product we
have mud ish mustard and we're going to
blend that with a 10 ish also liquid and
we're just going to rub that around look
at that so fun alright lips cheeks chin
we're going to take our Beauty Blender
and we are going to blend the out
of that all over our face creating a
wonderful single colored base all over
why do you ask
I don't have an answer all I know is
going to be very pertinent to the rest
of the video now we're going to take
this other thing and we're going to put
on her fingers and make dots under our
eyes and that's going to be wonderful
because we're going to take
or color and we're going to put more
dots under our eyes and we're just going
to slowly spread that with our finger
and here we go oh my goodness we're
going to just paint paint paint away
there your left hand sent the shape
because why not and shortly followed by
the eyebrow the upper eyebrow / lower
forehead because who doesn't love and
evenly highlighted face in places you
want things highlighted yep
that that is so terrific just smash that
all over the place now we are going to
take this brush and just gently dust our
face because we're going to real of dust
we love beauty dust and we love it
because there is something to put on top
of it now we're here about another color
a darker one and we're going to put that
on our cheeks and make sure to keep it
out of the way now we're going to keep
blending that on the top of your cheek
and just just going till you feel like
you know it's been good it's been great
now we're going to grab another brush
and we're going to highlight on the
outsides of the bridge of our nose and
once that's done we're going to grab a
lighter color put a little bit of blush
so fantastic I know I can hardly help
myself from applying too much
we're going to hit the upper end of our
cheekbones again now this is going to
create a nice lifted look very natural
so we're gonna grab a different brush
another color and we're just going to
like brush it on in arbitrary places top
of the nose ends of the cheekbones now
my favorite part on to the eyebrows
eyebrows it is okay so we're doing the
eyebrows we are we are fluffing them for
maximum volume how fantastic is that
nothing I love better than a fully
fluffed eyebrow now we're going to add
some fullness with this darkening tool
used on the eyes to create a fuller
heavier look for the
eyebrow how fantastic I just cannot get
enough we have the look we're going to
brush them out again
why because we love it oh there we go
awesome that other brow looking on fleek
now this lovely little container with a
variety of colors in shade we are going
to start with two colors blending them
postive generously and applying them to
the top of our eyelid why I'm not
entirely sure at this point but what I
do know it's going to be gorgeous when
we're finished we're going to go down
the shade and we're going to add it to
the crease adding a little bit of depth
and a little bit of dimension to the
overall look now we're going to grab a
darker color and we're going to put this
right above our upper lashes why because
it's gorgeous don't ask me why it just
is alright now we're going to mix the
first two tones to create something a
little in-between there and we're going
to put that on our under lash it can I
say under lashes out of thing it is now
alright we're taking the darkest color
we have like a charcoal black and we are
going to add some weight to our upper
lashes by applying that on top and we
are going to grab a eyelash curler that
looks like a medieval torture device and
just hammer way on those lashes until
they are crude like a half pipe there we
go and we are going to add a little bit
more volume we're going to pull them up
with a pipe cleaner type device founded
most women's purses and which is we're
going to keep going yeah we're going to
just add a bunch of volume just a bunch
of all you don't forget the bottom
though nobody likes the top any eyelash
job there we go yep can't forget the
outside you know I'm going to refine
this working our way in isn't that
lovely oh my goodness that volume
oh man you could surf on those eyelashes
am I telling you all right onto the list
we're going to grab a pencil colored not
colored pencil but a pencil for lips
that is colored
and we are going to fill in the entire
lip creating a crease in the middle and
doing a strong outline on the top there
we go now we're going to add some kinds
of glossy thing and we're just going to
just smash that all over the lip area
and careful on the top though stay
within the lines it's like an adult
coloring book kind of person ah there we
go we're going to grab another color and
we're just going to highlight you know
just where the Cupid's bow is on the
inside of puffy eyes and a little on the
crease to add a little bit of highlight
because she does a love a great
highlight and that is it oh my goodness
how cute do I look alright guys goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
