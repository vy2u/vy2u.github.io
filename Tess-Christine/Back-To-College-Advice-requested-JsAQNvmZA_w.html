be a little bit different today today's
video is actually going to be an advice
video and I've been getting a ton of
requests for this ever since I mentioned
to you guys that I was in college now I
didn't really know how to go about doing
this video because I am no expert at
college I am in my fourth year now
currently and I am no expert by any
means but I know a lot of you guys
wanted me to kind of give my own tips on
college and what I do to kind of help me
get through it since I am in my fourth
year I figured I might as well make it
now and kind of tell you guys what I've
been doing that semaine helping me get
through college and hopefully it helps
you guys out and that's kind of why I
wanted to make this video now you're
probably asking me why I'm deciding to
make this video now and not back in the
summer when it was back to school and I
kind of just thought about it now and
also it's back to school technically for
college students because in college you
go by semesters when you start all new
classes every semester so I guess I
decided to give out this video for all
you college students out there that it's
back-to-school time for you as well to
start out the first category I guess I'm
going to talk about is textbooks don't
under these are seriously a college
students nightmare because textbooks are
so expensive having to buy a new
textbook every semester for every class
that you take is horrible and you have
to buy sometimes more than one textbook
for every class and they are not cheap
let me tell you that so my tip for
textbooks or even trying to save money
on textbooks is what I like to use and
what I have been using is this website
called slug books calm
basically what slug books does is it's a
website that you go on and you type in
either your University and course name
or you can just type in the book that
you're looking for and it compares
prices on websites like Amazon or Chegg
and sometimes you might find out because
I know that my university bookstore
they're very expensive there so I like
to go on this website and see you know
if I could find it somewhere else
cheaper so if I can see maybe if Amazon
offers a cheaper or if Chegg offers a
cheaper this website will tell me and
then sometimes they won't be cheaper and
then I can just go buy it at the
bookstore but at least you'll know
instead of waiting in line for hours and
hours at the bookstore you'll know right
away on your computer if it's the same
price or if you could just order it
right offline my first couple years I
didn't even know the six
did and I went straight to my bookstore
and purchased all the books and I was
like yeah but this you can actually save
hundreds of toddlers like I'm not even
kidding my second tip for textbooks
would be to share with friends because
not necessarily if you're in the same
class but if you meet new people or
you're kind of in your last years of
college ask your friends if they've
taken any similar courses or if they
take in the same course and they own the
book if the professor hasn't changed the
Edition that they're using definitely
just buy it off of your friends because
more often than not they'll give you a
great deal because they purchased it
probably from someone else and if you
kind of just all rotate books you'll end
up saving a lot of money so I know my my
friends and I have done that before
where I've taken a class after them and
we just kind of use each other's books
so that works out great as well now
moving on to the next category which are
study tips and I'm no expert when it
comes to studying in fact I am the
procrastination Queen sometimes when it
comes to studying for exams
so I guess my tips are what I've learned
over the course of years in college is
flashcards are really effective
especially when you have to know terms I
definitely would recommend flashcards
now obviously for certain tests flash
cards won't work as well but if you have
to know a set of terms or certain
principles or something like that
flashcards are definitely effective in
my opinion they work great for me my
next study tip would be to go to the
library and not study at your home
apartment or dorm because more often
than not you will get distracted like
crazy there all of your stuff that you
own is there and I get so distracted
whether or not the TV's on I'm gonna go
make food now I'm going to go see what
my roommates are doing I'm going to go
on the computer anything like that I'll
get distracted at my house or my
apartment that I live in same goes for
dorms as well or if you live in a house
I would definitely recommend going to
the library because one you have to be
quiet and two you can't really chat with
your friends and you can go off and kind
of be alone and that's really effective
for me at least I can't get really
distracted by anything so another
effective way to study is to study in
groups study with people in your class
and you guys can all talk about you know
the test that's coming up if you talk
about it with other people sometimes
that helps me out and actually
understanding it better instead of just
trying to figure it out in my own head
talking about it with other people is
actually really effective but that's
only works for me if they're not you
know people that I hang out with all the
time because then I'll go off into some
tangent about something else and long
they're talking about other things not
pertaining to our class but if you're
working with people in your class it
actually works out a lot better now that
leads me into my next category which is
time management or procrastination my
tips for this is I only have one really
and that's to keep a planner because
that's the only thing that really helps
me usually in the beginning of every
class you will get a syllabus from your
class or from your professor and it'll
explain everything you're gonna do
throughout the semester and you can kind
of go through and write in your planner
you know when things are due and this
way it'll give you kind of an outline of
when what time you have to do a certain
assignment or have until you have to
study for a test so it kind of gives you
an outline so if you have a planner it
kind of keeps track of it for you which
i think is really helpful for me now
let's move on to picking your classes
each semester because this can be kind
of tricky because like I said for
college students you pick classes every
semester not for like a full year like
you would in high school so each
semester you have to pick your own
classes and you're responsible for that
but obviously there's people to help you
so my biggest tip for you would be to go
meet with an advisor because they know
what's best for you and what's best for
your major plan or your minor and kind
of know what cost is to take when and
what's suitable for you now if you've
already done that and you're still
looking for classes to pick I would
definitely kind of mix it up my biggest
tip and what I like doing is obviously
there's core classes that you have to
take for your major and core classes
that you have to take for your minor so
I like to do instead of taking them all
at once I like to mix them in with
electives that you have to take because
more often than not electives aren't as
challenging as your major and minor
classes so this way it will keep you
kind of a little bit less stressed when
it comes to studying and things like
that because you'll have kind of two
really hard classes for your major maybe
one for your minor and then like a
couple more that are just electives that
you have to take before you graduate so
that way you're not kind of like swamped
with things to do and swamped with you
know a lot of homework you're kind of
mixing in classes and I know a lot of
your advisers will tell you to do that
as well now obviously I've mentioned
major and minor obviously when it comes
to picking
now some of you guys may be like I don't
even know what I want to do for my major
and minor and that's totally normal
because my first two years I had no idea
what I wanted to do my biggest tip
obviously for picking a major and minor
is to go meet with your advisor and kind
of see you know what she or he or she
has in mind for you and you can kind of
tell your advisor your interest what you
like to study things like that and they
can kind of pick a major that you want
to go into or you can even tell them
what profession you're into and then
they'll put you on a path that kind of
leads you that way in your first couple
of years you kind of have leave what
leeway to take a mixture of classes
because most often than not you'll be
required to take elective courses and
those you can kind of pick and they
range in so many different areas that
you'll kind of be able to find what
you're interested in and then you can
kind of go into that field another thing
that's really important in college is to
get involved now so many people probably
tell you this you know your teachers
your parents advisors get involved in
college but what does that really mean
because I didn't know what that really
meant so my biggest tip for you would be
to get involved in things that your
major kind of it pertains to so for
instance I'm involved in PRSSA which is
public relations student Society of
America it's basically a club at most
universities that you can join obviously
since I'm in public relations that Club
was suitable for me and basically what
you do is you meet people all in that
same major and you can kind of network
because you never know when the people
that you're gonna be meeting at college
could be either future employers or
future people that you work with to give
you a good word when you're trying to
get a job later so it's really important
to kind of meet new people and meet
people that are involved in the same
field as you are because then you'll be
able to network with those people and
gain contacts and be you know more
well-rounded in the university and
you'll get involved with people that are
interested in the same things as you are
another thing is to get involved in
things that are kind of fun like fun
hobbies that you enjoy because most of
the time universities have clubs or
organizations that involve something
like that which i think is really fun so
like my first year I did dance team
which I thought was so much fun
obviously it got a little too busy so I
decided to just stick with like
university stuff and then obviously with
YouTube but that
totally personal choice they have so
many clubs that you can join that are
just fun and like quirky clubs like you
I mean they have so many that you can
choose from so definitely check it out
for your University like what your
university offers and just join them
they're usually free and they're fun and
you meet really fun people now this
brings me to my last college advice or
college tip and that would be to study
abroad it is the best experience ever I
have a whole video that I made on my
blog channel about it so I'll link that
somewhere on here and down below if you
guys are interested at all in studying
abroad you guys can hear my experience
I'm not gonna ramble in it now because I
already made a whole video on it so if
you're interested go check out that
video because I think something abroad
is awesome and if you have the
opportunity to do it definitely take it
and with that that concludes my college
advice video I really hope you guys
found this video helpful and you learned
some new tips in case you're going to
college or you're in college right now
let me know if you're in college and
this helped you guys out or if you have
your own tips for me that would be
awesome if you're in college and you
kind of know something that I didn't
mention please let me know in the
