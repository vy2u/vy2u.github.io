school maybe if we don't say it actually
verbalize it it won't actually come you
guys know that I'm not in school I
graduated college already so I don't
have to worry about back to school but
I'm just looking out for you guys with
back-to-school time comes back to school
videos on YouTube like crazy and I've
never really done a back-to-school
series before so I thought I would do
that actual school is like minute but
like making these videos is so much more
fun plus I haven't decorated a locker in
years so whoa
throw back there for me poofter but as
you guys can tell by the title today's
video is school outfits I made these
outfits super casual and you can modify
them however you want so if I'm wearing
shorts and you can't wear shorts just
wear jeans it's really that easy
if you can't wear a tank top just throw
in a cardigan over it all these outfits
are super versatile which is why I
wanted to make this for you I asked you
guys on Twitter to send me your personal
style when you go back to school and the
number one thing was comfort which I
totally get because who wants to really
like not be comfortable in school
because you have to be there all day so
all these outfits are super comfortable
they all have different kind of styles
in them some are edgier some are super
girly some are just kind of like casual
and simple I hope I nailed what you feel
comfortable in also don't mind my hair
i've been using way too much heat on it
so I'm trying this like treatment on my
hair so it's just kind of like rocking
its natural Ness today so disregard that
I just turn on my computer that's my cue
enjoy the video and I will see you guys
in my not gonna say that cuz you're
gonna see me in two seconds okay bye
okay guys so we all know that school can
be a total bore sometimes but that
doesn't mean you're out
has to be and I find that when I feel
good in the outfit and feel confident
and ready to take on the day my day goes
a lot better so my first recommendation
is casual tops because they're so easy
to wear and style so comfortable and
they can be worn a bunch of different
ways so for my first outfit I decided to
wear this button up top from Topshop my
movie bans some white shorts from Target
and a floral headband from forever 21
moving on to the next one I wear this
distressed purple cutoff shirt with a
rope necklace from both forever 21 and
just some jean shorts with some converse
to make a super cute and casual outfit
so I definitely pulled some fashion
inspiration from The Vampire Diaries for
this next outfit because their style is
perfect for back-to-school
I'm just wearing this basic tank top
from Urban Outfitters a leather jacket
some jeans and booties from Target the
way you see me for this next one I
didn't want to give up my crop tops just
yet so to make sure I wasn't violating
the dress code I pulled out my
high-waisted jeans from Nasty Gal
paired it with this white crop top from
Urban Outfitters and a big statement
necklace from forever 21 for more of an
edgier look okay you may think I'm crazy
but I find booties very comfortable so I
wanted to wear my Sam Edelman fringe
booties along with some jeans and this
really cool embroidered top from PacSun
for a super casual and comfy look with
kind of a bohemian vibe in most places
back-to-school season still has summer
weather so skater skirts are perfect
because they're so breathable and you
can wear them a bunch of different ways
this first outfit reminds me so much of
a cheerleader I think it's just really
cute both my top and my skirt are from
PacSun and then of course I've got my
high-top converse on
this next one is for all you girly girls
out there my skirt that I'm wearing is
from Kohl's and then the bluffs that I'm
wearing is from forever 21 with of
course some navy van
this next one definitely has more of a
sporty ER vibe very Emily from Pretty
Little Liars if you ask me but that's
mainly because of this Jersey top from
cotton on it has like a holographic
number print on it super cute
my white skirt is from forever 21 and if
it skirts not your style and you want to
wear jeans go for it this next one is so
easy to recreate with stuff you already
have in your closet I just wear this
white basic t-shirt mine is from Zara I
wore a blue a skater skirt this one is
from ASOS
and it then just some basic sandals from
Target and a headband from forever 21
now you can never go wrong with a
t-shirt and jeans so stock up on your
graphic tees for back-to-school because
this was my favorite outfit because it
was so ridiculously chill and
comfortable so for this first one I wore
this super awesome edgy like Brooklyn
tiger shirt from forever 21 with just
some blue jeans and some Old Navy
flip-flops but if that's too edgy for
you and you want something girly I just
found this one at forever 21 is Audrey
Hepburn holding up Donuts oh my gosh now
last but not least our jackets because
with back-to-school comes
fall and when it gets a little bit
colder you need something to throw on
and jackets are perfect to throw on all
of the outfits I've already shown you so
for this first outfit I wore this white
dress from PacSun super pretty I really
like it and I wore it with a jean jacket
that I've seriously had for like six
years from American Eagle some combat
boots from Steve Madden and a gold chain
necklace from H&amp;amp;M
this next outfit I love so much I just
wore a jersey dress a prom at Topshop a
really cool jacket from Zara that's like
a mix between leather and denim the same
gold chain necklace and some high-top
converse now before you comment about
the skirt our school had a rule where if
you stand straight with your arms at
your side and your skirt goes to the end
of your fingertips you're good to go but
if it's too short for you you can go
ahead and grow tights under something
like this and the trumpets there you go
this last outfit has my favorite
clothing piece of all time a leather
jacket so I wear this one from karma
with a red skater skirt from PacSun and
a white top from Windsor and of course
my converse but that's the video for
today I really hope you guys enjoyed it
and found some fashion inspiration
whether you're going through your closet
or you're going back to school shopping
also be sure to let me know which outfit
was your favorite in the comments below
and stay tuned for my next
back-to-school video which is going to
be a walker organization DIY school
supplies all that kind of fun stuff so
the end look out for that and I will see
you guys in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
