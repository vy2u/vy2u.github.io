me
in my last school video I didn't do my
hair and in this school video I'm still
in my sweatpants the motivation for
school is just never leave it's always
the same
none what's up guys at today's video is
another hashtag Becht school of test
video and my first back school test
video did so well I'm so happy you guys
were loving that I worked extra hard on
that so yay for good comments I'm so
happy you guys liked that um yeah so
that was my outfit video so you haven't
seen that be sure to check that out but
today's video is a DIY locker
organization /su school supplies I
didn't really know what to title this
basically I just show you guys some
locker organization and I do a DIY for
that and then I do a DIY school supplies
as in like decorating your folders and
notebooks so I really hope you guys
enjoy this video be sure to give me a
thumbs up if you enjoyed this back to
school series because I still have more
planned and yeah let's get right into
the video alright guys it's time to
transform this locker from super boring
to super awesome and customized so when
I was shopping for Locker stuff the one
thing that I noticed was locker
wallpapers I love the idea but they only
had a few patterns available and I
wasn't really diggin um so I thought I
would give you guys a really easy DIY
that allows you to customize it
completely yourself so all I did was
went to the fabric store and bought some
fabric that I loved this print totally
is my style and I basically measured it
to the back of my locker and cut the
cording lean now lockers vary in sizes
so I will have some common Locker sizes
listed in the description box below but
you can always trim and cut it more once
you get there now how I'm holding this
fabric up is with four magnets in the
four corners and they actually are
concealed pretty well once you get all
your stuff in there now there was a hook
in the back of my locker so I'm just
cutting a small square in the fabric
which I marked with a pen once I had it
hanging and it's super easy to do and
like I said these will vary with lockers
but all you have to do is cut a square
and
and we'll fit right over the hook as you
can see here and once you have a jacket
or a backpack in there it'll hide all
the mistakes now lastly I'm just marking
with a pen where the wall ends and then
with the scissors I'm just cutting a
straight line on to that line and
remember it doesn't have to be perfect
because once you get all your stuff in
there it's going to hide all the
imperfections
now this Walker had a shelf at the top
so with the extra fabric that I cut off
I'm just going to place that with some
more bang Mnet's on the top I was pretty
lazy and I didn't trim it up but um that
you would trim it accordingly on the top
but this is what it looks like when you
step back I love it I think it's so cool
and apparently now they have Locker
chandeliers so I bought this black one
because I thought it matched the fabric
a little bit more than the other colors
and it's completely magnetic so you just
stick it to the top and it's so chic
right now I use these locker shelves
when I was in high school they're so
awesome they create way more space so I
put one of those in there and you can
get those pretty much anywhere like
Target Walmart all that stuff and now
they have these like little carpet
looking things so I bought a black one
because it kind of is matched in the
whole vibe that I'm going for but what's
really awesome about these is they don't
allow your books to slide anywhere so
when you put them on the Shelf they kind
of stay put which is awesome and mine
was a little bit big for my locker so I
kind of had to tuck the sides in a
little bit but now I'm just putting in
my notebooks and binders which I'm going
to show you guys a DIY right now which
are so awesome these have been going
around on YouTube so I kind of thought
of something that I don't think
anybody's done yet and that is basically
just taking letters from magazines which
i think is so cool I used to do this
with like scrapbooks and stuff basically
you just cut out different letters from
magazines that spell out the subject of
whatever class you're going to so for
this one I did English and it's really
cool because all the letters are
different fonts they have different
designs behind them and you can totally
customize this to your personality so
you can add like different pictures from
magazines and just really kind of like
make it you which I think is so fun so
instead of doing like just like labels
or whatnot this is a little bit
different and like I said you can show
your personality through it so I bought
these 3d stickers from a craft store and
it just kind of adds a little bit more
to your notebook totally optional of
course I originally put this glitter
thing in the corner but I
ended up taking that off and doing stuff
differently and then I found this cool
thing from a Maybelline ad it has like
glitter and it fit the binder of my or
the spiral part of my notebook perfectly
so I just glued it on the side because I
thought it looked really cool and then
added the black swirlies instead of the
glitter one but now I'm just cutting out
some more letters and finishing up some
subjects like I said this is really easy
to do even like last minute all I'm
doing is using some rubber cement which
is just a type of glue it sticks really
well and it doesn't like have the
magazine they don't like curl up on the
sides which is really nice so really
really easy and I thought I would just
show you guys a quick DIY to totally
customize your notebooks and no matter
what they're gonna be different from
people's which i think is pretty awesome
and then after you let them dry for a
couple hours they're done and what was a
dollar make five dollar folder and
notebook turned into something that
looks way cooler moving back to the
locker some things that I like to add as
well are a dry erase board like pencil
or pen holder that's magnetic super
inexpensive at like Target or Walmart so
I just added some pencils some pens some
highlighters and an eraser whatever you
pretty much need for school goes in
there
super easy to grab to if you just open
it and of course I had to add a little
fake flower Airforce um you know
decoration and then of course some
post-it notes
another thing I added was a magnetic
mirror and there's a bunch of DIYs on
these around YouTube so if you want more
of a personalized one you should check
out those but this one worked for me
super inexpensive and then I also just
added a bulletin board for some flyers
or memos that go around school then on
one of the hooks I would put either a
purse or a book bag whichever I had in
this case I had a person I'm not in
school anymore and then of course a
jacket in the back hook is what I always
did especially for me in Minnesota
jackets were a must I put my reading
glasses or sunglasses here along with a
snack because I'm always eating in
school if I remembered correctly and
then for my school essentials in like a
small makeup bag I would keep deodorant
especially after gym
nice to freshen up some tissues which
are just always needed some concealer
you know just in case some lip balm in
this case I have vastly and cocoa butter
because moisturizing my lips was just
like must have some perfume again to
freshen up if needed a lip liner this
one is my favorite right now it's Mac's
world I love that so much again to touch
up like after lunch or something some
hair ties and some bobby pins are the
last thing of course so I would just
then put that on the top shelf as well
and then of course in the bottom part I
would just put some extra pair of shoes
or my gym shoes whichever I needed and
that's it for my locker DIY
Organizations school supplies I love it
I wish I had thought of this stuff when
I was in school because I totally would
have done it I think it's so cute I also
decided to do a giveaway since I'm not
in school and have no use for this I
thought I would giveaway it pretty much
this locker so if you want all of my
locker
organization stuff that I used including
the locker wallpaper fabric all that
stuff then comment below what you're
most excited about for school mine was
definitely seeing all my friends every
day that was awesome so let me know in
the comments below and I will see you
