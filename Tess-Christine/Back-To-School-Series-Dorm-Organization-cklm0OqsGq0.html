is going to be another part of my back
to school series but this is kind of
like a selective back to school because
this is just for you guys who are going
into college but I feel like a lot of
you guys can learn a lot from it because
if you are at all in high school
thinking about going to college this
might help you later so yeah basically
this video is just going to be
organization tips for incoming college
students for dorms if you are planning
on staying in a dorm it's kind of like
how I organized my dorm so to start off
I'm just going to tell you a little bit
about how my dorm room was set up
because that will make a huge factor in
how what I show you that I used to
organize my room my room was very very
small it was so small when I first saw
it I was like oh my god I was like I
don't know how I'm gonna fit all of my
stuff in here how it was set up is when
you walk into the door it's basically
just a huge square so that's all it
really was it was a huge square so at
the day we had twin beds obviously and
hid nothing else sort of fit but they
were shaped in an owl so like self
picture square so then on this side of
the square was the desks and these desks
were built-in so he could not move those
at all so those have were stuck there on
this side of the wall two desks for me
and my roommate so those were right
there so that was enough with that and
then um on this wall was a bed and this
wall was a bed so the beds made like an
L and then on this back wall and the
door was like right here and then this
back wall is where the closets were at
our school we had the option if we
wanted to loft our beds and if you are
not sure what loft in your bed means
it's basically like a giant bunk bed
while it is a bunk bed but it was no bed
underneath it you had the option to bunk
it like that where someone would be on
the top in the bottom but we just
figured we both wanted to locked her so
we kept her beds in the same L position
but we just lofted them so they were
just higher now and we could put stuff
underneath so how we organized it that
way was so our desks were here our beds
were lofted up and on her this was her
bed my bed was the alp right on the wall
so under her bed we had a futon and our
school supplied us with options to buy
some Tron's but
I know futons they can sell futons
everywhere I know like where I saw a lot
of futons were Shopko but I know target
has kind of like the college style
futons which are probably cheaper
anyways but anyways we put a futon
underneath there I am so that took up
the whole space under her Neath
underneath her bed and then underneath
my bed lofted or whatever we put she had
brought this like wooden entertainment
center kind of thing so it was basically
they got a giant wooden box that had
shelves and then a big open spot for TV
so then I brought the TV and I put the
TV in that open spot underneath my bed
and then the shelves need organized with
like movies and kind of like snacks not
meals but snacks so like I don't know
crackers or nola bars stuff like that
that we'd wanted in there so we put
those in like the shelves and then next
to that there was still a little room so
we put like a mini fridge where we had
water juices things that we wanted to
eat or things that we had leftover or
something like that we kept in there
I was basically it for our entire room
now for like organizing for our stuff we
bought we both bought the big plastic
containers the white plastic containers
if you guys saw my room tour or my
makeup collection actually just my
makeup collection there's I had a big
plastic thing with three drawers for my
makeup I bought like a giant one of that
was a three-tier drawer and I put that
right on the side of my desk so here
there was a space here and then I put
one of those mirrors the standing tall
mirrors if I can find any pictures of
the dorm room and that sorts of stuff I
will insert those but if I can't sorry
but hopefully this is helping a little
bit and then I had like one of those
stand-up mirrors just like the plastic
they're like I think they're like five
ten dollars at Target and then next to
it I had that pull-out shelf thing and
in there I kept like blow dryers curling
iron straighteners makeup products hair
care products stuff like that all in the
air so that was enclosed into that so
that saved a lot of space and those are
fairly an Express been expensive at
Target every closet it was set up it was
one big closet and it had two like doors
that went like here if you know what I'm
saying like you pull out and they're
like here and then you can fold them
back again if you
I'm saying I hope you do but then in
that it was like her side my side and
they had rods at the top and rods at the
bottom and then one thing down the
middle and then on the top it had a
shelf above the top rod for the shelf
then it had two giant shut up up there
so how I organized it was at the top of
the shelf I had like towels laundry
detergent extra towels laundry detergent
let's see what else I had oh I had a
purses up there so I had purses that I
didn't use every day up there I had old
schoolbooks I had things that I didn't
need every day because that was very you
know not very accessible up there so I
had things that I don't use every day up
there on my top Ronnie had basically
like jackets and sweaters and things on
the top rod because it was a lot shorter
and then I left a space open for this
particular organizing thing it looks
like this it's like one of these I hope
you guys can see this it's like one of
these giant things I lost the little
things I think they're up in my room but
you hang it on the hanger rod and it
hangs down and I believe there's five
compartments and in here I catch I got
this at I want to say Shopko I believe I
got this there and was again fairly
inexpensive a lot of the stuff is fairly
inexpensive for school they get it a lot
for her back to school but in these
little compartments
I kept jeans so I folded my jeans and I
folded t-shirt and I folded tank tops
like the cami tank tops not the really
fancy tank tops that I wanted to hang up
but like just kind of plain tank tops
plain t-shirts v-neck
jeans sweatshirts I kept in here as well
so this saved a ton of space because
instead of hanging everything it went
down so I actually gained a lot more
space from that and you really don't
need to hang everything I mean obviously
the wrinkle purlins stuff you should
probably hang in like jackets and stuff
but for folding sweatshirts and t-shirts
and jeans you don't need to hang those
so you can fold them and put them in
here which is what I did and it saved so
much space you know how I told you that
there's like a thing that separated both
of our rods they were little
compartments and they fit these little
fabric boxes and you can get these at
Target and again they come in many
different colors I just got brown
because I thought it was a very neutral
color here I kept like bras and
underwear and that sorts of stuff in
here so like stuff that you don't just
want to be like just chilling in your
closet you know you want to be kind of
in side of something so that's what I
kept this in and also in here I kept
swimsuits socks that sorts of stuff in
one of these also if you don't have a
closet well you should have a closet but
if you don't have that much room in your
closet and if you are not able to loft
your beds and you just have flat beds
you can get these in there they're more
they're like cut in half and they go
back farther and you can get those and
put those things under there and slide
that underneath your bed or you can get
those plastic bins that I showed you in
my room tour that I used for my tank
tops you can get those plastic bins that
fit perfectly underneath beds so that
will save you a ton of room I'll show
you what I use to keep my shoes in and
keep them kind of organized I mean this
isn't really super presentable way to
present your shoes but it worked and it
saved space and it's like one of these
crates and it's just a big square and
they're called stacking storage carts
and it's show the picture shows being
like put books in it and like CDs and
stuff like that but I used it for shoes
and it worked out great I mean obviously
be careful with putting heels in here
because they might go through these
little holes and could break but I put
things that I switched them out by
season so if it was not warm enough to
wear boots I put boots in there and
tennis shoes and things like that
and that worked out great and I put that
on the floor of my closet so I put that
in like the back floor and then I have a
little bit of extra floor space that I
kept my hamper in and I just got a
plastic hamper with a lid that I kept
that in there and I think there was like
a little bit more space where I kept
shoes that I literally wore every day to
class so I had like my UGG boots out and
like my tennis shoes and maybe like my
converse I had in that area another tip
that I would have for you for space
management is that if you ever go home
to visit maybe your family or something
like that or your family comes there
um think about giving them some clothes
to bring back to your house because I
know I did that a lot because my family
would come to visit or I would go home
and I would kind of like look at my
closet and be like what do I never wear
and so things that I don't wear I would
bring back because like when I first
moved to college I literally brought
everything I realized okay I never wear
that shirt I never wear that when have I
ever worn these shoes so I bring those
back and it saves a lot of space that
way and I also did that by climate too
so if it was like when you first go up
to school or at least one I did it's
still fairly warm so I had like shorts
and stuff there but when it turned into
winter and like when winter comes where
I live it lasts forever so like I took
shorts home I took flip-flops home I
took things that just took up space so
that really helped me out a lot as well
so I would definitely recommend that for
you take advantage of those crates and
plastic things that you see everywhere
in like Target and Shopko and stuff
because they are space management savers
for sure and you would definitely
definitely find use for them for those
of you incoming freshman college
students I really hope you guys found
this video helpful and you found some
ideas to go pick up while you're going
back to school shopping and have some
ideas to reorganize your room maybe if
you haven't met your roommate yet and
you're just kind of talking to Revilla
internet or something like that maybe
you guys can discuss some organization
tips that way and because I know me and
my roommate save a lot of space using
those plastic containers and these types
of things make sure you stay tuned for
my next video where I talk about college
and all that sorts of stuff so I again I
really hope you guys found this video
helpful stay tuned for my next college
video and I will see you then
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
