is going to be another part of my back
to school series and I had so many
requests to do a back-to-school fashion
video but I decided to do a little bit
different than my normal fashion videos
instead of kind of like just showing you
five or six outfits with little words
that pop up of what where I got it I
decided to do like a fad era
back-to-school wardrobe essentials if
that makes sense like things that I
think that are staple pieces for I don't
know back to school or even like an
everyday wardrobe but especially for
back-to-school because I know a lot of
you are probably thinking about going
back to school shopping and instead of
going off with five or six outfits that
could be very different I wanted to give
you guys sort of options to purchase
that could be worn in multiple different
ways and multiple different styles and
so again this video was cut was kind of
hard for me to do because I don't know
everybody's dress code everybody's
personal style you know what I'm saying
hopefully this follows everyone's it
followed my dress code and I picked
things that are very appropriate for
school so I hope that all these follow
under the dress code again don't hate on
me if you can't wear these things or
something like that I don't know this is
just what I wore in high school this is
what I found myself wearing a lot of the
times in high school one of the first
things that I remembered wearing
literally all the time were v-necks and
multiple colors I have so many colored
v-necks you can get them literally
anywhere so like I don't know this one's
from Gap
this one's from American Eagle where
else
there's Victoria's Secret so like
literally you can get so many different
color of Enochs
and you can wear them with anything you
can wear them with jackets you can wear
them with jeans you can just wear them
plain you can wear them you can dress
them up or dress them down you can be
really casual with them or you can you
know just throw a scarf on it and make
it look cute like that or you could
throw you know a lot of jewelry on it or
wear it with like some sort of a skirt
or something like that and make it
dressy so I think the Phoenix are like a
huge staple item especially for school
because they're so easy to just throw on
the next staple clothing back-to-school
piece I don't have to say our chunky
sweaters and this one is kind of a
climate friendly one I thought if you
make sense where I live in the end of
fall winter and like most of spring it
is seriously freezing freezing freezing
snowing constantly so my big go-to piece
were big chunky sweaters or big loose
sweaters or cardigans my favorite place
to get cardigans are Target because
they're fairly inexpensive and they're
really comfortable they're not itchy at
all and they have so many different
styles and colors that it's like it's
hard not to find what you're looking for
they're so like this one is from Target
it is just white and gray striped
cardigan and it buttons down the front
and I really really like this cardigan a
lot I found myself wearing it all the
time
so one is also from Target it's just a
plain gray one they're all fairly shaped
the same and fairly the same price so
you shouldn't have to worry about that
at all and they're very flattering to a
lot of people so I think these are great
and again the same with the v-neck you
could throw these over a v-neck you
could dress these up and dress these
down as well now with back-to-school
season and fall starting up again kind
of cardigans are coming out everywhere
so you shouldn't have a problem finding
them
if you live in a cold climate like I do
then this would be most appreciated it
is this big chunky sweater these big
knitted very thick very very warm
sweaters you can find these cheap I find
mine at t.j.maxx you can get them fairly
cheap and they're getting a bunch in now
this is by American Eagle but they were
selling this at t.j.maxx for like $12 so
I jumped on that because it's a very
good quality sweater it's not itchy at
all and it's very very warm so that's
what I look for because I love throwing
these over leggings or tights or
jeggings or something like that so um
they were definitely warm and they're so
comfortable that's my biggest thing is
to be comfortable while in school
because if I'm not comfortable and I'm
sitting in a classroom learning and I
just like feel like I'm stiff and I feel
like I have to just make sure everything
is in place and like proper then I'm
just not going to learn anything I'm
just gonna be uncomfortable and just
annoyed all day so I have to make sure
I'm comfortable
yes this would be accessory if I've kind
of already talked about them but it is
scarves and I get where did I get this
one I got this one I t.j.maxx and this
one at Target just these big kind of
kind of what kind of fabric is this I
don't even know but they're really
really soft scarves they're not like
wool or knitted scarves I do have those
and I do like those but that's kind of
more of a winter thing this is just kind
of nice in school because they add kind
of flare to an outfit or color to an
outfit I love wearing these with
sweatshirts so um that's what I love
adding scarves - or just scarves -
v-neck scarves - cardigans scarves -
anything you can kind of mix and match
everything with this so these are really
really good two halves
for bottom's uh my probably go to bottom
of all time would be these jeans well
not these particular jeans I mean I
really like these jeans but any type of
skinny jeans I absolutely love I find
the skinny jeans very very comfortable
some people may disagree with me on that
and fun that they don't like skinny
jeans at all I love dark wash jeans
personally I just think that they
flatter you a lot more they kind of hide
things that you don't want to be seen as
would a lighter wash would so um that's
why I really really like dark jeans plus
I think they just go with everything so
um I definitely these are my go-to jean
style would be have to be skinny jeans
and they have those out everywhere now
on the ones that I have are from
Hollister they're just a dark washed
skinny jean I believe these were like 40
50 dollars but that stores can be kind
of overpriced
so you can find skinny jeans a lot of
places I know target has really good
pair and I just recently bought a pair
of skinny jeans from Target and I
absolutely love those so um you can find
skinny jeans pretty much anywhere and
now it's especially with back-to-school
so you shouldn't have a problem with
that and then for more bottoms a big
trend right now are those bandeau bando
skirts something like that this is the
one I'm loving right now it's red and I
have a black one and I have a floral one
but for some reason I'm really liking
the red one they sell these bando skirts
or I don't even know how to pronounce
that but whatever
um they sell these everywhere now I know
forever 21 has a crazy amount of skirts
like this so but however be careful with
these especially at forever 21 because
they can kind of run short there and you
have to be careful because if your
school's anything like my school we
always had a rule about how short things
could be so just make sure it's an
appropriate length this one is from
Charlotte Russe Roose yeah Charlotte
Russe
and this one is perfect length on me
again you'd have to try these on because
every body shape is obviously different
so with towards the length leg length
all that sorts of stuff so make sure it
is long enough to you for you
the next thing I would have to say is
high-waisted shorts and we all know that
these are in a lot now this season so um
I just recently picked these up a couple
days ago from PacSun so you can still
get them I think they're fairly new but
they look like this and they're just a
black cuffed short so they kind of have
like a nicer feel to them they're not as
casual as like a jean short so um
they're kind of more on the dressier
side so you kind of could almost go for
like a uniform feel with these I think
they're very cute and they add a very
chic and like elegant look to you so if
you're going for that kind of look for
school if you ever have to like dress up
or something because know you guys know
me I like love to just be casual at
school so I would not wear these daily
or weekly whatever but if I had
something to dress up for maybe like a
presentation or an interview we had
school interviews for one of my business
classes or I was involved in a sport if
we ever had to dress up for our sport I
would wear maybe something like this but
stuff like this is always good to have
when so if you go school shopping
picking up something like this would be
good to have because you never know when
you're gonna have to dress up and know
in high school I've had to dress up
multiple times so having something like
this is nice especially if the weather
is warm having some sort of like dress
short or tailored pant is really good to
have but these are really nice and
they're a very appropriate length
they're not too short at all I feel very
comfortable in them and they look very
nice and very put together
absolutely love jackets especially for
the fall and I have so many of them but
the two that I mean I'm gonna show you
and that I love to wear that I usually
wear are a jean jacket and this one is
from American Eagle and a jean jacket is
always just good to have in your
wardrobe if you don't have one already I
wouldn't suggest wearing Jean on Jean
unless you like that Jean on Jean look I
like wearing these with maybe a black
pant or a grey pant or a skirt something
like that and another thing this is
obviously a style choice it's up to you
if you like this style but I absolutely
love leather jackets
obviously it's mock leather this one I
got at Kohl's I think for like $40 it
was on sale for so I love these and I
can throw these over again a v-neck or
anything like that just a plain shirt to
something and it adds kind of a little
bit of an edge and again you look like
you actually got ready so that's why I
love things like this for school because
you can kind of just throw things on
like that like jackets or a cardigan and
it still looks very put together and
nice at school and you still look really
cute so that's why I love that for
school shoes I do not like to wear heels
at all I don't think I've ever really
worn heels to school unless it was for
something that I needed to I keep it
very casual and very simple and again
this is all dependent on style and taste
but these are my personal favorite shoes
to wear for school even now first pair
of shoes that I cannot live without that
our map favorite shoes and have been for
so long our converse absolutely love
converse these are so dirty
don't mind them but these are my
favorite style the white and the red and
the blue I really really like this one
because I feel like they go with a lot
of things and I found myself wearing
these a ton obviously I still wear these
all the time I love converse I have them
in black as well and black as a really
solid color to have too because that
goes with almost anything as well black
or a gray or these white ones it's
always fun to get colorful ones too so
if you want to do that for
back-to-school you're more than welcome
to do that I just personally love the
plain colors because you can wear them
with so many things
my next favorite pair of shoes um you're
probably going to know this because if
you watched my fashion video
they're in a lot of my fashion videos
because I just think they're so cute and
comfortable and they're kids and I like
the Navy type I don't know why I just
like the Navy color because I just feel
like they go with a lot more again I'm
more about having a versatile shoe
instead of having buying one shoe that
only goes with one outfit I just think
that's ridiculous so I like she's like
go with a lot of things and I think that
Navy kids go with a lot of things got
these at jcpenney and I believe they
were like $30 I think they were 30 but
you can get these at jcpenney
I believe you can just get the Navy or
the white ones I believe but if you want
like multicolored ones I'm not exactly
sure we can get those my last favorite
shoe for school would have to be some
sort of a boot and I have a ton of boots
living in the Midwest boots are just
kind of an like a necessity again and
when it snows I have snow boots I have
ugg boots I have tall boots short boots
brown boots black boots I have so many
boots because seriously living here it's
like that's all you can wear for 90% of
the year my favorite boots right now and
I think are so cute that yeah that have
been going with everything are these
boots I got these at Urban Outfitters
they're fringe boots
I believe they're the Minnetonka but I
seriously love these boots they add such
a cool flare to your outfit and add like
a I don't know an edge it's I just love
them I love them and they were like
fifty dollars I think but yeah that is
the video for today I really really hope
you guys enjoyed it and I am going to do
