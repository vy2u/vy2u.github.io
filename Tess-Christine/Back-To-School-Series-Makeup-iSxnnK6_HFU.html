is a another part of my back to school
series and the last video I did was
what's in my school bag video so if you
haven't seen that one you should go
check that out but today's video is
going to be back to school makeup look
and I was really excited to do this look
because I don't know going to school you
don't want to take too much time in the
morning getting ready because if you're
anything like me getting up for school
is so hard I hated getting up for school
because it was so early and all I wanted
to do was sleep so most of the time out
over sleep and my alarm and I would just
have to like hurry and get ready so I
think this look is very easy it doesn't
take any time hardly any time at all
this look I would say is more for like
high school look I would even wear this
look now I think this is very
appropriate for even like a middle
school look maybe even less makeup for a
middle school look because middle school
your skin is still very fresh and new
but if you are the type of person you
know who feels more comfortable with a
lot of coverage or more coverage than no
foundation at all then you're more than
welcome to do my tutorial which I did
because I didn't want to just like come
on here and be like all I'm gonna do is
add a little bit of cream blush and some
mascara because I know a lot of you
girls you know want to have more
coverage and you know feel more
comfortable with coverage and going to
school you want to feel as confident as
you can so I really hope this makeup
tutorial works for you and you can try
you know feel feel feel good and look
your best going to school alright so
first we're going to start off with the
face and my recommendation for you would
be to wear some sort of a tinted
moisturizer but if you don't have a
tinted moisturizer you can kind of make
your own which is what I'm going to do
because I want to use the foundation
that I have but I'm not going to use it
as a foundation I'm going to mix it with
a moisturizer to make a tinted
moisturizer because I feel that a
foundation can be a little bit heavy for
school and I feel like it gets really
draining during the day so the
moisturizer that I'm going to be using
is the vino lifting and firming daily
moisturizer and I'm going to mix it with
my Mac Studio Fix fluid foundation but
again any foundation will work for this
and if you have a tinted moisturizer I
would recommend using that but I do want
to use this up so and this is my color
for summer I'm going to apply it with a
brush and the brush I'm using it is
is an elf powder blush and even though
it says powder I like using it for
foundation I never really liked it as a
powder brush so that's why I'm going to
use it for a foundation so I'm just
going to pump a little bit on my brush
like that and then I'm going to take
this and I'm going to do one pump on
that and then once you blot it over your
face it'll mix up so I'll show you
you
you
next I'm going to take a concealer the
concealer I'm taking is the Sonia Kashuk
hidden agenda concealer but again any
concealer will work this is just my
favorite
I'm going to set everything with a
powder and the powder I'm using is the
Maybelline Dream matte powder in the
color beige medium and I'm just going to
take a small kabuki brush and I'm just
going to buff that on my face this is
just going to help again set your
foundation and make sure it doesn't get
that oily sheen during the day
and that is it for the powder foundation
that sorts of stuff because we wanted to
look very natural and you don't want to
spend all that much time contouring your
face and stuff because you really don't
need to do that you want it to look very
natural and but still obviously have
some coverage for you to you know feel
confident school but we are going to
take a blush to kind of add a little
color to our face so the blush I'm
taking is an elf blush and the color is
peachy keen and this is just a very very
light almost kind of natural skin cone
skin tone color but has a little bit of
pink shimmer to it so it's perfect for
this look because it's very subtle so
you don't look like you are trying too
hard with your makeup I'm just going to
be taking a blush brush and I'm just
going to be applying that on my the
apples of my cheeks
when it comes to eyes you don't want to
be too crazy overdone have big smoky
eyes so we're just going to be using one
color today but but first we want to do
make sure we do is prime our eyes and
I'm just using Mac's painterly paint-pot
but any sort of eyeprimer works because
you especially when you're moving all
day and you know you want your eye
shadow not to crease or come off during
the day so I mean it's self-explanatory
but yeah
the eyeshadow I'm using is the beauty
brush eyeshadow and this is by
Victoria's Secret Victoria's Secret
carries these eyeshadows and it's just a
really really pretty gold champagne
color and I think it looks very natural
and subtle but with some Sparkle so
it'll be able to tell that you're
wearing something on your eyes and it's
a very light color so it'll not only
give some color to your eyes and you
know have that fun effect of wearing
eyeshadow but it would all will also
brighten your eyes a lot sorry the color
is gold rush by Victoria's Secret again
it's just a really really pretty
champagne color I really really love
this color a lot and I recently got it
too so I'm just going to be taking a
large shadow brush and just putting that
all over my lid and just a little bit on
a little bit in the crease but not too
much
we're also going to take that color and
put it in the inner corner of our eyes
we're just going to skip eyeliner in all
that jazz and just Carlo lashes because
you don't want to spend the time getting
in the morning try to you know make your
eyeliner all perfect and you don't
really need it it's perfect just to you
know get some color on your lids and
mascara because this will just overall
brighten your eyes and make them look
very natural and subtle and again not
look like you're trying too hard so I'm
just going to curl my lashes and apply
mascara the mascara I'm using is the
voluminous voluminous millions lashes
mascara
you
that is it for the face makeup now onto
lips and lips you know you don't want to
waste your time and money and product
putting on lipstick because you know
it's just going to come off right away
throughout the day especially after you
eat and all that stuff unless you
reapply but who really wants to do that
so um what I love and you guys know I
love this is the elf conditioning lip
balm and peacefully pink and this is
just a really really nice subtle hint of
color but it doesn't feel overwhelming
on your lips are very cakey or anything
like that and it doesn't get anywhere it
doesn't get on your teeth or anything
like that because that would be
embarrassing so this is perfect for that
so I'm just going to apply this on my
lips
and then that is the completed makeup
look I think it looks great for you know
when everyday back-to-school look I
think it's very subtle it feels very
light on your face and it's not going to
run off or get messy during the day I
mean if you are the type of person that
likes to experiment makeup you know wear
eyeliner wear that kind of stuff you are
more than welcome to this is just my
interpretation of a back-to-school easy
look for a lot of girls to achieve it's
not very hard at all if you are the type
of person who you know wants to wear a
little bit more makeup to school my
recommendation for you if you're a
little bit older you know later in high
school or what I did in later high
school and you know wanted to get a
little bit more ready for school I would
put a little bit of a I would probably
do the same thing and I would add a
little bit of a dark color to my crease
not too crazy I would just add a subtle
color this color is by the Victoria's
Secret beauty brush again it just looks
like this it's just a bronzy brown color
and the color is bronzing err bronzing
or something like that and I would just
take a fluffy crease brush and I would
just kind of windshield well windshield
wiper motions run that through my crease
very very lightly you don't want to look
too overdone again for school like I've
been saying and then I would add some
eyeliner to my top my my upper lash line
but yeah that is it for this makeup look
I really really hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and you know kind of
learned a little bit from it and you can
kind of take what I used and use that
for back-to-school again it's very easy
and very quick for the morning though I
really really hope you guys like this
video and until my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
