tutorial using the Revlon three barrel
jumbo waver and I had a lot of you guys
request this video when you saw it in my
Ulta haul so I definitely wanted to do
it for you guys because it's a very easy
hair tutorial and I kind of showed you
how to make it look a little bit more
beachy than so crimpy if you know what
I'm saying and instead of like you just
walked out of the 80s and walked off the
beach so that was my whole deal with
this video I really hope you guys enjoy
this and if you are interested in seeing
how I got my hair like this please keep
on watching to begin I am starting with
blow drying hair and I'm just going to
section my hair off starting from the
bottom and clipping that up with a clip
next with a bottom layer that I have
section down I'm just going to split
that in two and then on each side I'm
going to split that into again with the
back section of hair I'm going to start
by clamping it with a three barrel jumbo
waver from the top and work my way to
the bottom this clip is in real time so
you are able to see how long I hold each
section before I release the clamp when
you are clamping your hair make sure you
are starting your next clamp where you
ended the first one this way your waves
don't mix up and you don't go over the
waves you already did I am taking fairly
large sections of hair to prevent the
waves looking unnatural by taking bigger
sections of hair your waves are gonna
look a little bit more natural instead
of silk crimp like like what I was
talking about in the beginning so that's
why I'm only splitting my hair into two
sections so I'm just gonna repeat this
process on both sides of my hair and
then take down the second layer
once I have taken down the second layer
I'm just going to repeat this process
again throughout the rest of my head
until I get to the top layer so I'm
doing a sectioning again into twos and
then clamping from the back to the front
there's no reason why I'm doing the back
to the front it's just how I like to do
it just so it I'd know that I don't miss
any hair but you can do it however what
you want to and what I like to recommend
is when you start clamping at the top of
your head just do it kind of a loose
clamp don't hold on to it very hard
because you're gonna get that weird
crease at the top of your head and it's
gonna be more noticeable if you let the
heat stay on there a little bit longer
so once you get to the top section of
your head you're going to start not
directly at the root but about eye level
and start crimping all the way down you
are going to do the same thing for your
bangs if you have shorter bangs I would
recommend lightly clamping it and not
clamping it so hard as if you did the
rest of your head because if you have
shorter bangs especially the bangs even
that I have you don't want them to be
too tight around your face because it's
just gonna look unnatural and not so
beach-like
so just be careful when you are clamping
the section near your faces because you
want it to look as natural as possible
now to smooth down any weird creases
that the krumper may have caused I'm
just going to take a basic Conair
curling iron and I'm just going to
smooth those down a little bit and wrap
those sections around the barrel that
framed my face
this is just gonna make it a little bit
more flattering and not make the curls
so intense and by wrapping it around the
barrel you're still gonna get that
wave-like effect so it'll blend in
really well with the waves you've
already created and I'm just going to do
this on both sections around my face and
there's no really precise way that I'm
doing this I'm kind of just doing it
randomly until I see that I like it once
you're finished with that I'm just going
to finish with hairspray and next with
the john frieda smoothing cream I'm just
going to take a little bit of that on my
hand and run it through the waves this
is just going to kind of give it a
textured look and make it look a little
bit more beachy and a little bit more
put together and less frizzy that is it
for my hair tutorial using the Revlon
three barrel jumbo waver I really hope
you guys liked it please let me know
what you think in the comments below and
as always I'll see you in my next video
