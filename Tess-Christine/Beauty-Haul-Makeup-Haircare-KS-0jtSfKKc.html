beauty haul as you guys can already tell
by the title and it's funny because I
was thinking about what video I wanted
to film today and I have a ton of
styling videos coming up and like get
the look videos and lift books and stuff
and I get so crazy when it comes to
styling videos and I do them like so
much but then some of you guys really
enjoy just like the simple videos like
hauls and everyday makeup tutorials and
things like that so I definitely wanted
to get back and doing more of a mix so I
figured I would just show you guys a
beauty haul because I went to Ulta
recently and I picked up some new things
to try out the first thing I purchased
were makeup brushes and now makeup
brushes for me are like eyeshadows I
feel like you can't really have enough
I'm always finding uses for makeup
brushes A+ they're always so fun to buy
new ones because it's like new and fresh
you know when you have like old makeup
brushes they're so shiny oh my gosh I
saw these I was like oh those are
supercool makeup brushes and then I was
like okay looking into them and on the
back they were designed with the help of
pixie woo it's a YouTube channel here on
YouTube obviously I don't know if you
guys know them but pixie woo Sam and
Nick Chapman and my solid sounds like
YouTube family I have to support
youtubers because I know if I were to do
something cool like this I would want
people to support me so I was like oh I
have to get these plus I've used Real
Techniques brushes before and they are
super soft and super good brushes so I
basically purchas the whole whole
collection cuz team Internet the first
one is this and this is just a powder
brush this this and this one which is a
foundation brush it's angled really
differently I've never seen a brush like
this it's basically supposed to help
apply your foundation all over your face
but then the angled parts are supposed
to get in like where your concealer or
like by your nose the nooks and crannies
of your face so it's supposed to be
really awesome so I'm super excited to
try these out so they're kind of
color-coded which is really cool so the
gold ones are for your face and then the
silver ones which look like this are for
your eyes so they have just like an oval
shadow brush this is just supposed to be
for like your lid and then they also
have like a crease brush it's a pointed
crease so it's supposed to help get
achieve a flawless smoky eye
also the angled liner brush which is
always really good to have because I
love using shadows for liners and also
underneath your lash line it's kind of
like the perfect eye you really only
need these three if you're doing
eyeshadow looks like I do which is
pretty simple and then the last color is
a rose gold and that's for like the
finishing touches
so contour and highlight which I love so
these are the two contour and highlight
ones I just dropped them but this one is
a contour one it's flat which I'm so
excited to try out because I don't have
a flat contour brush yet I have the
angled one but not a flat one and I've
always wanted to try it so there's a
flat contour for obviously bronzer and
then the highlighting one which you
could also probably use this for blush
but otherwise just like highlighting
your cheekbones the bridge of your nose
or even like your brow bone - so these
are overall this whole collection is
just like all you really need if you're
going for simple makeup looks like I
usually do like I said I've used Real
Techniques brushes before and this is
the bronze metals collection and they're
just as good as the other ones - so fun
fact about those brushes if you are
interested in those those are only
available at Ulta I think it's kind of a
collab that pixie woo did with Ulta and
Real Techniques next up I purchase let's
see they're pretty much all makeup or
beauty things the first thing I guess
I'll start off what with is makeup wipes
I wanted to try these because I've never
tried the yes two blanks like yes -
cucumber this one's yes - grapefruit
wipes before and I really like using
makeup wipes I also like using makeup
removing oils but these ones are just
really easy to travel with more so than
and oil so I decided to try these out
this one is yes - grapefruit and it is
the correct and repair and I'm super
excited to try this out also I wanted to
find the Ingrid ones too
but I couldn't find those so you know
how Ingrid did I like a collab with them
so many youtubers are just killing it
lately there's we're taking over you
guys taking over next up I got a mascara
and I've heard a few good things about
this one and it is the L'Oreal
voluminous miss manga mascara and I
usually use the covergirl LashBlast
mascara
I also just started using a Lancome
mascara that I really like but this one
I heard good things and it's just really
cute and I wanted to try it out plus I
liked that it had um like what is this
like a pointed brush it's not all one
sides it kind of like tapers towards the
end my Lancome one that I have is the
shape of that and I really like it I
just started using it so I want to see
if this one's good because the Lancome
one is super pricey but this one's
drugstore next up I got a Maybelline
instant age rewind eraser for dark spots
and I got this in the color light/medium
when I was breaking out a lot I
afterwards I had a few dark spot areas
where I'm still kind of trying to cover
up so I thought I would give this a try
cuz sometimes concealers don't always do
the trick for me so I thought I would
try something that's more geared towards
dark spots and hopefully this helps me
out have you guys tried this I know I've
tried the age rewind dark circles but
never dark spots so I'm curious next I
got my favorite eyeliner and it is the
L'Oreal what is this I don't even know
voluminous smoldering eyeliner it looks
like this it's always the best when you
first buy it because it's super super
sharp and pointy I can never get it like
that when it starts to get dull and I
use my own sharpener I can never get at
this point E again but this is awesome
it lasts a really long time I only for
just one before and it lasts me like
seriously a year next up I got an
eyeliner and this one is from NYX and
it's the NYX slide on glide on stay on
and definitely a turn-on waterproof
extreme shine eyeliner oh my gosh that
is about full but I got it in the color
olive because from my winter my go-to
winter makeup look I was using an olive
shadow for my eyeliner and I really
liked it and I still like it but I
wanted to try an eyeliner and this is
pretty much the exact color that I was
using before I don't know I've just
really loved using like an olive or
smokey green color for a liner instead
of more of a black I don't know why I've
just been really into that lately next
up I got my Holy Grail under eye
concealer and this is a cosmetics buy my
under eye I purchased my first one when
did I purchase that my Nina Dobrev get
the look video that's when I heard
because they said that she wore or she
uses that all the time for BAM
Vampire Diaries and you know nina dobrev
is my girl i love her and so anything
she says she likes i'm gonna try so it
cosmetics bye bye under I went through a
whole tube of it I love it it's a really
thick and creamy and it really gets rid
of your under-eye I wouldn't use this
for like spot concealer just under-eye
because it's amazing and I just love it
also I got this in the color neutral
medium for those curious next I'm super
excited to try this I'm kind of an
eyeshadow palette hoarder I love eyes
shadow palettes just because I feel like
you get more for your money they're kind
of pricey but you get so many different
eyeshadows and I just feel like it's
worth it
and I heard such good things about the
lorac Pro palette that I really wanted
to try it I'm gonna open this so you
guys can see what I'm talking about in
case you haven't seen it but I'm sure
you guys have there so me too you guys
know I'm a neutral girl I hardly ever
play around with color so this is just
like the perfect I'll show you a
close-up just the perfect colors like
there this is all matte and then this is
like shimmer I'm just so excited to try
this out I got some lashes and I've been
getting a lot of questions on a few of
my recent videos on my lashes some of
them not all I'm wearing false lashes
and a lot of you guys are like oh my
gosh my lashes what did you do and I can
totally do a tutorial on this as well
because I don't just use the whole strip
so basically I buy the demi whispies by
the ardell lashes and I cut them up I
really like individual lashes I could
probably just stick to that but for
whatever reason I've just been really
into this lately I just kind of cut them
into like chunks and I put probably four
in my eyes I don't do like a full lash
Bowl but I do it so it's kind of like
sporadic and fluttery very like kendall
Jenner is kind of where I'm kind of
feeling this kind of like little bursts
of lashes it's so it's not just like a
full lash it's kind of like Boop so I
don't know I like it and I got a lot of
comments asking about it so yeah that's
what I use and then last but certainly
not least I need a new shampoo and
conditioner and I like changing it up
and I was using the bumble and bumble
shampoo and conditioner
and I was all out of that and I was like
oh should I use more of that and then I
was like I'm going to get this stuff and
I've used this before when I was dyeing
my hair a lot and I used the matrix by a
lodge a colors day one for like color
treated hair and my hair still colored
but it's not like recently colored so I
got the hydro source for dry hair
because my hair needs it but that's it
for my beauty haul I hope you guys got
some either ideas of stuff you want to
pick up the next time you go out
shopping or stuff that you already have
let me know in the comments below if you
like it or don't like it also give me
some ideas in the comments below of some
drugstore brands that you really like or
some foundation concealer things you
already have because I wanna start doing
more tutorials that are a little bit
more on the drugstore brand level just
because those are a little bit more
affordable and accessible for a lot more
people so I definitely want to do that
because I wanna help you guys and that's
my favorite thing I think my next video
is gonna be another get the look video
and this time it's a bunch of guys one
direction I don't know I'm so excited I
definitely got to be a little bit more
creative with this one because it's a
boy bad so get really excited for all
you one Direction fans because I'm super
excited to show you guys this video but
anyways I really hope you guys enjoyed
my haul thank you guys for watching and
I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
