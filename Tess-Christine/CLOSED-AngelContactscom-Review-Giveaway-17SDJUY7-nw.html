title already today's video is going to
be all about colored contacts now if you
haven't noticed in my last video I think
it was my last video I was wearing I
don't know if you noticed but i was
wearing colored contacts so pretty much
my whole life I've always wanted to try
colored contact lenses but I never
really got the opportunity because as
you guys know or maybe you guys don't
know I don't know but I don't wear
glasses and I don't need glasses so most
of the time when I was growing up even
in middle school high school and I
wanted to try them because some of my
friends had glasses and contacts and
they had really fun different colors and
I always thought it was really fun but
every time I would ask my parents I'd be
like why would you want those you don't
even need glasses or contacts so I never
really tried colored contacts prior to
today so I'm really excited about them I
just think they're awesome the context
that I'm wearing are from angel contacts
calm and if you haven't heard at this
site I will link it in the description
box below so you should definitely go
check it out if you are interested in
purchasing context but more importantly
because today's video is a giveaway how
fun is that I haven't done a giveaway
yet but today's video was actually
giveaway sponsored by angel contacts
calm so before I get into all the
giveaway rules and all that fun stuff
I'm just going to talk about the contact
contacts a little bit more just because
I feel like you guys would want to know
a little bit more about them before you
enter a Content a giveaway and then
receive these contacts that you don't
really know anything about the context i
am currently wearing are the geo nudy
gray ones and i'm going to show you a
close-up of my eye so you can see it a
little bit a little bit better in case
you can't see it that well from far away
but this is what they look like I don't
know if they're creeping you out yeah
it's definitely a change I'm sorry I'm
like blinking a lot you can go on their
website and they have really good
quality close-ups of the contact lenses
so you can see them a little bit better
but I'm probably blinking a lot because
as like I said in the beginning of the
video I've never had glasses or ever had
to wear contacts so that this whole
contact thing is very new to me and it
takes me probably like 15 minutes to get
it into my I just because I'm a newbie
but if you've been wearing contacts for
a long time then it'll just be like
quicken for you not a big deal but for
me it takes a little bit of practice as
for the contact itself it's a very soft
contact
because it's a soft contact lenses lens
but it's very comfortable in your eye so
once I actually go through getting it
into my eyes it doesn't I can't feel it
I well okay I can feel it just because
I've never had contacts before and so I
kind of feel that it's there but like
once I'm focusing on something else and
not thinking oh my gosh I have a contact
in my I have a contact in my either
something in my eye I can feel it but if
I'm just like not really thinking about
it I don't really know what's there or
when I look in the mirror I'm like whoa
my eyes like not used to it at all but
they're very comfortable once they're in
your eye and they are very easy to take
out that's the one thing I can take
these out really quickly it's just
putting them in I just need a little bit
more practice but I absolutely love them
the color is great as you guys know I
have very dark brown eyes and this shows
up great it may not show really great on
a film but in person and in the light
and the daylight you can see these
really well and I absolutely love them
and they just look so cool and I'm so
excited to have a different color I for
a little bit than a brown one so I got
the geo nudy gray ones and then I got
some magic black ones
once you actually get these contacts
or if you win the giveaway they will
come in a package like this obviously
and mine came in a like a a parcel like
this but um once you get the contacts
they will look like this and they come
in this little baggie and inside of it
you get the contacts itself right here
and they come in these little glass
containers and they're floating in Nam
solution and then you'll get a contact
case so I want to use these for the
first time you don't put them back into
the clear case you will put them into
the contact container and you will use
contact solution and just soak them in
over that overnight or whenever you are
done using them and then also what comes
in them are directions which I read
through quite a bit to make sure I knew
what I was doing one thing with this
contact these contacts though you don't
want to leave them for in for too long
so these are not the type of contacts
that you really want to have it all day
they are more of like a four hour span
that you want to keep them in just
because they're not meant for long you
sir prolong you so it's kind of just
like maybe if you're going out to a nice
dinner or going out for a night with
your friends or some sort of party or
maybe halloween even you can get crazy
halloween ones if you want to um so you
could wear them for that they're just
not meant for wake up in the morning put
your color contacts in and leave them in
until you go to bed they're not really
meant for that but now on to the
