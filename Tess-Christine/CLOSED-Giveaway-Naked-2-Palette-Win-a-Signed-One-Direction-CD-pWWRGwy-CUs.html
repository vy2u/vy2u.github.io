be my very first giveaway and I'm super
excited about this because this is my
very own first giveaway meaning that
this is stuff that I purchased all by
myself and things that I bought
especially for you guys so I was super
excited about this and the reason why
I'm doing this giveaway is because I
just have reached 50,000 subscribers and
I'm so excited about this you guys have
no idea I was ecstatic TIFF I know that
I was reaching 50,000 subscribers and so
I wanted to do something special for you
guys to thank you guys for subscribing
to me and watching my videos and it just
means a lot that you guys are taking the
time to watch my videos when I put in
all this time and effort to do it so
it's it makes me feel really good and
appreciated when you guys watch my
videos and subscribe to my channel this
giveaway is gonna be kind of different
it's gonna be split into two giveaways
so the first giveaway is just gonna be
kind of a general giveaway that you guys
are used to and then the second giveaway
is gonna be at the end of the video but
that one is in particular if you are one
direction fan so if you're a One
Direction fan stay tuned the end of this
video but if you're not a One Direction
fan you can just X out of this video
after I announce my first giveaway so
you guys are probably all wondering what
I'm giving away and that is the upper
still famous naked 2 palette and I asked
on my facebook in particular what you
guys wanted to win because I was kind of
unsure and I know that there's been a
ton of giveaways with involving the
naked palettes and I kind of was like
are you guys over that kind of thing but
a lot of you guys suggested that I give
away naked 2 palette or one of the naked
palettes and I was totally up for that
because I absolutely love this obviously
you guys know that I own this myself and
I love it I love that it has a variety
of matte colors and shimmer colors I
know the first Naked palette has like
two matte colors so I kind of like this
one a little bit more because it has
more matte colors and then obviously it
has like an equal amount of matte and
shimmer which I really really like if
you do have a Naked 2 palette already
still feel free to enter because these
make great gifts so even if you do win
this and you already happening it's your
palette you can always just win it hang
on to it and give them away as a gift or
something like that if you are
interested in winning this I will tell
you the rules now obviously you have to
be subscribed to me that's just in
general obviously it's a thank you to
all my viewers who watched my videos so
if you are subscribed to me obviously
that would make sense for you to win
this and then all you have to do besides
subscribe to me to enter
this giveaway is comment below saying
enter me and then next to it say a
request because I always need more
requests I know I have a ton of requests
because you guys send me them all the
time which I'm so thankful for but it's
always fun to get new and different ones
basically all I'm gonna do to pick the
winner is do random org and just do you
know the usernames at random and then I
will have that announced I believe two
weeks from today and I do want to
mention that this giveaway is going to
be international the last giveaway that
I did was not international but I am
going to make this international because
I have a lot of international viewers
and I didn't want to single you guys out
so this is going to be international
please remember that if you are 18 years
or younger please have your parents
permission because I am going to be
asking for your address if you do win
and I will have that shipped to your
house so I don't want your parents to be
like freaked out if you get a random
package at the door for you so just make
sure your parents know but yes that is
it for this giveaway I really hope you
guys enter because this is a really
awesome prize and it's just a way for me
to say thank you so yeah if you are
interested in entering please enter
below if you're one direction fans stick
around now if you're not I will talk to
you guys later bye
alright hello my One Direction fans if
you guys watch my videos for a while now
and have followed me on Twitter or
Facebook you guys know that I'm a crazy
One Direction fan I love them I think
they're adorable I love their music all
that fun stuff if you have followed me
on Twitter or watch my get ready with me
video and read the description box you
will know that about three weeks ago or
maybe a month ago I went to a One
Direction CD signing near my town and I
was super excited and super fortunate
and lucky to have met them and got my CD
signed by them I was very very excited I
know a lot of you guys were fans and I
found this out when I did my 19 random
facts tag I found out when I said that
I'm a One Direction fan a lot of you
guys commented saying that you were too
and I know that on Twitter I have a lot
of One Direction fans I asked on my
Twitter if any of you guys were One
Direction fans and I got like a ton of
mentions saying you were so I wanted to
do something special for you guys
because I know a lot of you guys follow
me and I just kind of wanted to share
the One Direction love because I was
very fortunate enough to get my CD
signed at the CD signing not only was I
able to get
my CD signed but I was able to get
another one signed so I'm super super
super excited to announce to all you
guys that I will be giving away a signed
One Direction CD and I'm so excited
because this is awesome and I would love
to win this it's signed by all five of
them and if you guys can see they're all
the signatures are there how they signed
it in case you guys are interested is
it's just the CD you'll get the CD -
obviously it's not just the CDs in there
I'm sure all of you one direction fans
have the CD but I think this is kind of
a fun collectible I guess if you want to
just hang on to it like this but they
signed it on the actual paper so not on
the plastic but they signed it on here
so um this is so it's not gonna like rub
off the plastic or anything it's signed
actually on the paper so and they
actually Louie actually like kind of
personalized not personalized it but he
kind of made it fun by him he drew a tie
on Niall so cuz that ties not normally
there on the CD cover but he'd retire
not that was kind of funny but all their
signatures are there this giveaway
though is gonna be a little bit
different it's not gonna be through my
youtube because this has nothing to do
with my youtube channel at all obviously
my youtube channel is Beauty
fashion-related all that kind of stuff
not One Direction related I don't want
my YouTube channel to be like crowded
with One Direction comments I don't want
that at all the the only comments I want
to see in this video below are for my
naked 2 palette giveaway so keep that in
mind you can't enter both because
they're so non related at all but this
giveaway is actually gonna be through my
Twitter because I just figured it would
make a little bit more sense to do it
through Twitter than my youtube channel
I wanted to announce it on my youtube
channel to give you guys all
opportunities and to let you guys all
know because this is a part of my 50,000
subscribers giveaway and I just wanted
to thank you guys and that way cuz I
know a lot of you guys are wondering
fans so if you are interested in winning
this signed CD by all of them you can go
to my Twitter page I will obviously have
that linked in the description box below
I want you guys to follow me on Twitter
and then all you're gonna do is give me
a mention so you're gonna say at test
Christine one two then you're gonna say
what what it what is one thing or what
do you love about Wonder
action and then I will take all of your
usernames or your Twitter names and
write them all down I'm gonna have to
write them all down because I won't be
able to keep track of it on Twitter so
I'll have a notebook and I'll write them
all down and then I will choose it at
random so yes that's all you have to do
to win the sign One Direction CD I
really really hope you guys appreciated
this because I was super excited to do
it for you and I don't want to get any
like hate comments or anything for this
I mean I totally this is this was
totally out of me like thinking of you
guys thinking of fans because I totally
get it I totally get the fan thing this
is only going to be going for one week
from today so one week from today I will
close the giveaway I will announce it on
my Twitter that I'm accepting no more
mentions after one week and then the
Twitter names that I have I will pick
that at random I will announce it on
Twitter and everything I'm not going to
announce it on my youtube it'll all be
through Twitter so that's why it's very
important to follow me because you want
to know if you won this or not and then
I will follow you direct message you and
get all your information to send this
sucker to you I really hope that you
guys all enter because I'm super excited
about both of these giveaways so really
