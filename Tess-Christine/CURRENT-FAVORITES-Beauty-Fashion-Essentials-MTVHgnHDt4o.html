today's BL is going to be a favorites
video and it's been a couple months
since I've done one of these so I have
some new stuff that I'm loving and some
updates on the stuff that I told you
about in that last video because I got a
few questions about it so was concerned
okay so first I'm gonna start off with
CV and the first thing is a new product
I haven't told you about it yet because
I think it's actually like a super new
product but I'm freaking in love with it
and I'm so happy it exists and it's the
fluff well it's benefit hoola like the
bronzer but it's a contour stick this is
my dream I'm so happy about tickets
I love hoola bronzer I think a lot of
people do and so when they came out with
this I'm like yes it just makes your
life so much easier
she's the contour stick pretty
self-explanatory but it's just perfect
and I love it and I've been using it
pretty much every day since I got it and
to go with that I wanted to mention this
makeup brush it's by elf super
affordable but it's basically what I use
with the contour stick since I have been
back and forth on cream contours I just
find it a little high-maintenance
sometimes for me and I just want to
throw on bronzer and go but lately and
this has been so easy so I've been
pairing it with this contour brush which
is perfect for blending it doesn't
smudge anything it just works really
well next up is an update on a product I
told you about in my last favorites
video and it's the cabinet Quan skin
enhancer and I basically just want to
tell you that I'm still loving it I'm
still using it but more importantly
because I know that this is a more
expensive product I wanted to show you
that I've barely made a dent in it and
I've been using it pretty much I would
say every day because I film a lot and
I'm on camera a lot and it's just
freaking awesome and so if you're kind
of on the fence on buying it I would let
you know that you don't go through it
very quickly because like I said usually
you're you use like a little tiny amount
that's all you need but I just think
it's so worth it
but that's it for makeup because you
guys know that I hardly try out new
products and when I do I how you put
them right away and then I keep telling
you about them forever so now moving on
skincare so in my last favorites video I
mentioned Rene reuleaux products and
that I'm super stoked about them and yes
I've been getting a lot of questions if
I'm still using them as I still like
them and the answer is yes
I've been using it like crazy I have a
new products that I wanted to tell you
about but first I wanted to bring this
back up this is a mask still one of my
favorites I use this all the time I
think in my last favorites video I said
I was only using this once a week but
this is actually really good for when
you're breaking out and around that
times a month I tend to break now I'm
sure a lot of people do so this is just
the rapid response detox mask and I use
this at night if I have a few breakouts
or I'm freaking out more than usual I'll
use this more than just once a week and
it's a lifesaver I can't even get over
it I wake up in the morning and my skin
is just so glowy it's not like a miracle
worker where I wake up in the the
pimples are suddenly gone but it
definitely speeds up the process and
it's for sure a staple of mine and I'll
keep buying this for forever the next
one is another Rene over lo product and
I had reached out to her because I
wanted to figure out how to fade my acne
scars and she's just kind of like I text
her unlike I need help like what do i do
so i can like relay the message to you
so hopefully this helped some of you
guys out and she recommended this
product it's the vitamin c and e
treatment and i use this in the morning
after my toner my cleanser and my toner
and then i used this and she says it's
going to help with the fading of acne
scars which i need i still obviously
have breakouts time and time again it's
not going to like magically go away
right away but I do have some scars left
over from like my cystic breakouts and
this has been awesome I've noticed the
difference with this it smells really
good and I really like it so I wanted to
recommend this Q eyes because I know
I've gotten so many comments asking what
I do about that and how I fade that
because I'm sure you guys can notice
over the years of my videos doing makeup
tutorials you see my skin so I wanted to
mention this because I love this and now
her hair I have a couple things new but
one again I wanted to mention is the
Gifu hair product I can't even tell you
guys
comments I get on my hair and what I'm
doing is growing faster it's healthier
looking especially on my Instagram is
where I get the most comments about it
and illogic are asking if I'm still
using this and yes it's like my Holy
Grail product I love it
buying again she's one of my favorite
bloggers love her so much it's quite a
bit gone now what since you last saw it
Pat my both uses he steals it and I know
he does so that's why I think it's going
down a little bit Riger than usual but
I'm going to keep buying this because I
love it and then another one by her
haircare line she only has two products
out now but I hope she just keeps making
more because they're so good and this is
that heat protectant and I recently got
this I've been using it everyday and I
like it key protection is just a staple
this smells really good I would
recommend it if you're going to buy this
just get this too because it's really
good and I love the combo and then
lastly for hair I wanted to mention hair
extensions because I haven't been using
hair extensions for a really long time
just because I kind of got sick of them
to be honest I was like I used to wear
them a lot like years ago like almost
every day I think when I was in college
but it just got like heavy I just didn't
want them anymore I was like whatever
I'm just going to like use my own hair
and be fine but if you guys saw my last
video and the hair in my face you guys
saw in my last video for ariana grande
that obviously I had to wear hair
extensions because her hair is freaking
long and so luxy hair extensions had
really really long hair extensions for
hiring on the current day so I was like
yes getting those then I also got the
more of a natural length and there's
like 20 inch I think but they're perfect
because they match the length of my hair
now they actually don't give me any
length but they give me thickness which
is actually what I need my hair is not
very thick it's nice and I'm not like
complaining but I just sometimes need
like a little bit of extra and I'm not
wearing the mouth but when I do when I
go out and I have anything or have to
look like extra nice or I want my hair
to just last a lot longer I always find
that adding
hair extensions make like your curls
last longer I just kind of holds
everything in place and I'd like just
adding like a few of them in there I
just think it makes the world of
difference and I really like to use
their really good quality not sponsored
by the way I'm genuinely mentioning this
because I kind of got back into your
extensions after ariana grande imagine
that but like I said they're not very
long and the color that I got them in is
chestnut brown that way in case you have
to spin hair colors me they match pretty
perfectly alright so that's it for
beauty products now let's move on to the
fashion stuff what do I want to mention
first let's mention shoes because these
are like my new favorites they look like
these and they are so cute I picked them
I'm not very good at explaining clothes
for how much I feature fashion on my
channel I'm not very good at it but
these are freaking cool I like them I
want to mention them in specific because
it's my first time trying out the brand
tony bianco I probably butchered that
like always but I love the color of it
the suede obviously is great I just love
this so yeah they're like higher up on
the ankle and it's just like my jam
right now they go out they go really
well with all the new spring swirls of
so excited next up are short and it's
not quite warm enough to really a whip
out with denim shorts here in New York
but it's getting warmer if you probably
I don't know hopefully you can't tell
when I'm sweating right now because we
don't have AC in our apartment yeah we
got it window AC units because we don't
have central air so I'm like sweating
but regardless these shorts are great
they're high-waisted leather shorts that
I bought us I see on a victim shop and I
wanted to mention them because they're
so great they're perfect for the weather
right now like I wear these with tights
and like a sweater tucked in and it's
just so nice so I wanted to mention it I
don't think I linked the Etsy shop in my
haul when i featured these I'm better
with link the Etsy shop I actually just
purchased a jacket from that same Etsy
shop for potentially Coachella we'll see
but I wanted to mention him again
because I love them and she had great
stuff on her SE site she just has cool
vintage stuff so I wanted to mention it
in case you guys like vintage and all
that fun stuff
someone in my apartment building is
cooking something that smells amazing
distractions okay I'm next
sunglasses perhaps sunglasses just
glasses frames in general so this is
kind of like obviously a new trend
that's popping up a lot and it's the
colored clear frames blended these are
great a lot of celebrities are wearing
them you know I love my look for less so
these are awesome because I got these
from ASOS there's ones that they sell in
Windsor that are super affordable so if
you just kind of want to try or
experiment as a new trend but you're
like saying I do not want to pay that
much money if I don't know I'm going to
look good at all this is a great option
so these ones are from ASOS I like them
they're pink they're definitely not for
everybody it's kind of a crazy style but
I think they're really fun I think
they're going to be really cool for the
spring and the summer
I might even bring these to Killa no
next up are blouses and I just grabbed a
bunch from my closet just to show you
what I mean um this time of year I just
find this is like one of my favorite
things and I'm always wearing them
because the weather isn't like super
warm yet but it's not super cold anymore
but you still kind of want to layer keep
a what I'm saying so whether I'm wearing
it with like the shorts and tucking them
in or just denim jeans this is so easy
and it's definitely one of my favorites
they're just these like basic
button-down I have a bunch of different
print obviously I'm loving the stripe so
yeah this one's cool cuz it has
squirrels from badger all from revolve
this one is from Primark only like ten
dollars this one is from rotten boa this
time is from Reformation and this one is
from frame I thought I just mentioned
that I don't know if that was necessary
but now you know anyways this style of
shirt you can find everywhere they're
just like flowy blouses this will save
your life if you just want to have them
an easy to wear but still want to look
fashionable definitely one of my fashion
favorites and I love wearing that just
like tucking them into jeans or shorts
with a big belt and then for a hat I
wanted to mention you can actually see
my lap of color hat right there I'm not
to grab it but I do really like them
touch you'll see that more in the spring
in the summer so I'm gonna weed on that
guy but I did wanna mention this guy I
know you have seen him so much and
you're like we get it shut up about it
so they sell these all over the place
range of prices you can get them for
super affordable
I know Windsor has an epic one which is
just like this
but these hats are just great if you
have a better day uh we ran out of
conditioner like a day ago and I did
wash my hair for like three days so plot
this guy on and I was good to go it's
just it makes your outfit look so good
and then lastly Allan is mentioned my
necklace I don't think I ever take this
thing off I'm in love with it I
mentioned it in my haul video but it's
by Maria Pascale it's such a great
necklace it's such a staple necklace I
wear it with freakin everything it's so
good I want to go on and buy like a
bunch more in case I lose it um but I do
want to buy actually the bigger for a
necklace of this this is a small one I
want to buy the bigger one and just cuz
like I wear it so much and I'm like I'm
getting such good use out of this this
is definitely my favorite I get a lot of
questions from you guys about it I will
have it linked below so yeah those are
my favorite I hope you guys enjoyed it I
know I kind of Reem ention some things
but I hope I really nails it into your
brain that I really love them because
