channel today's video is going to be a
favourites video and I know you guys
know how these things work so I'm just
gonna get started so as always in the
start off with beauty and the first
product has been my absolute favorite I
recently picked up this hair oil which
I'm pretty sure is pronounced Gesu and
it's a honey infused hair oil and it's
really awesome and you know when you buy
those new products and you're like
instantly think at you it works like
it's a placebo effect and you're like
yes this is doing something and you get
so excited about it well I was thinking
that and I'm like okay does this
actually work and then for the past
month on my Instagram and Twitter I've
been getting a lot of people being like
have you been doing anything to your
hair recently like it looks really good
what are you doing differently so then
I'm like okay now I know it's working or
doing something because it's the only
thing I've changed I use this when I get
out of the shower and I use it after I'm
done styling my hair so like today after
I was done curling it I just kind of
like ran it through the ends now moving
on to makeup favorites and my first ones
are these makeup brushes and they're the
Revlon makeup brushes and they're all
nice and clean and pretty for you guys
but you know I've been using these for
months now and they're definitely one of
my favorites they have been for a while
I love them they're just multi-purpose
and amazing for example the foundation
brush I've been using a lot for my cream
contour which has been awesome it works
so well and gets everywhere even with
the nose I don't have to use another
brush or anything so I'm really happy
with them this one is another one of my
favorites and I use this to kind of set
my face kind of finish it when I'm done
and the crease brush is also my favorite
they're just really good definitely one
of my favorite so I'll have where you
can buy those in their scripture box as
well next I have a concealer or I don't
even really know what this is called is
it well okay it's the Kevin of Quan skin
enhancer to me I look at it as a
concealer because it's freaking sick
like this thing is hefty duty so how I
use it is I take like a little bit out
of it and I put it on the back of my
hand and then I do a couple pumps of my
foundation and I mix it
and it just gives you the most flawless
appearance ever like it covers any
imperfections it's just amazing I don't
use it every day because I think my skin
would be like let me breathe um but it's
really good for filming or if I'm
shooting with Patrick or I don't know
I'm has an event or just where I'm going
to be on camera or I just really want to
look good moving on I have a mascara and
it's the benefit they're real mascara
and fun story about this is I use this
in college for a while and the one
drawback that I didn't like about it was
it was so difficult to get off like I
hated how long it took me to get it off
at the end of the night it works really
well and that's why it's one of my
favorites it just makes your lashes
amazing so I've really started reusing
it again because I told you guys about
coconut oil for so long but when I was
using this in college I hadn't
discovered coconut oil and it's magical
benefits but it does the trick it takes
this off super easily at night so I'm
back on to using this and I really love
it and lastly for makeup products we
have this which is the Kat Von D liquid
lipstick in the colour bow-and-arrow I
think I featured this in my last like
sit down video as a haul but every day
this color is on my lips on now I'm
obsessed with it now moving on to
skincare yay because I'm really excited
I found some new amazing products and
I'm so pumped um so I recently well in
my haul video I featured the anti cyst
spot treatment by Renee rule oh that's
how you say her last name hey got it
first of all a lot of you guys in that
video we're like I don't believe you
have problematic skin like it doesn't
look that way which hop back to the
cabinet Quan amazing but I have been
documenting my whole skincare kind of
journey um for a while now with photos
and stuff so you guys will see when I
make an actual video um but I was
fortunate enough to get a facial
biron a reuleaux and she was able to
really look at my skin and see what my
skin needs like I said I'll talk about a
lot more of that in that video but I
have two products that I've been really
loving the first one is a cleanser and
I absolutely love this cleanser by the
way I'm not being paid to talk about
these products um I just want to get
that clear skin care is really important
to me and I know if you guys have
problematic skin I really want to help
so this is why I'm talking about it so
much
the hhha BH a deep pore pore cleanser
Wow talk it just smells amazing it feels
good and I use this at morning and at
night now but it's been working amazing
I'm really happy so far so stay tuned
for more information on this but this is
definitely a favorite out of all the
products I've been using and then the
second one is a mask and again it's by
Rene Rulo when it's the rapid response
detox mask and this thing is awesome
I'll like insert a cutaway clip so you
guys can see it
first of all it looks beautiful it's
like this gold shimmery goodness one of
those masks that feels super relaxing
but it also does wonders for my skin
like I've used it a couple times now and
I'm obsessed with it it just makes you
look super glowy when you have it on
obviously because it's a gel but when
you wash it off your skin just feels so
smooth it looks glowy it's amazing so I
can't wait to ship have you guys see
these guys in action because oh okay so
that's it for like beauty favorites now
moving on to fashion I really had to
narrow myself down because I could talk
about a lot of different fashion things
these leather pants they're like leather
leggings I don't really know they're
from Sahara and oh you guys I'm in love
with them they were only like $29 and
they look so good and they just fit so
well they're comfortable they're like
legging but they look like a pant so you
can dress them up dress them down
they're just really become my favorite
especially in the fall in winter next up
is a sweater and I've been kind of like
reevaluating what I grab in the morning
and if I'm not like going out to like
shoot a video or shoot something where
I'm just kind of like I need something
to throw on really quick I'm constantly
grabbing at this sweater it's so comfy
but I think more of more so I just
really like the style of it and how it
like fits on me let me tell you the
brand's the brand is Elliott and I
actually don't have anything
this brand but this is like the first
thing and I'm super happy with it next
up is a jacket and oh it's getting
really cold here in New York so yes I'm
gonna make another like cold weather
outfits video that's like when I say
cold weather I mean like it's snowing
and it's cold and you have to like wrap
your face type of gold I got you but
this jacket what I love about it is that
it actually is warm it's not just cute
and that's the second thing is that it's
cute and it's stylish and I can kind of
wear it a different way then just kind
of like your normal like big puffy
jackets by the brand Moon River I'm in
the last fashion favorite are oh so
these are like my last fashion favorite
and they are booties and these in
specific I really like because I like
they have a heel I love heels booties I
just think they make everything look
good and when they're not super high
these are that's the other thing is that
they're not super high they're by Steve
Madden so they're affordable I'm gonna
link them below if I can find them but I
love is that it's like a matte leather
it's not super shiny but they look nice
there's a pointed toe it kind of goes up
a little bit they just look really sleek
and nice and I can wear them a bunch of
different ways moving on to a couple
lifestyle favorites which I don't know
if I've done this before but I had a few
that kind of stood out to me and I
wanted to mention them so the first one
is now this is gonna look hella
sponsored because like I feel you but
it's like one of those meal services but
I'm not sponsored by them I wish I was
because like being sponsored by food
would be so tight so it's plated and I
know a lot of people have talked about
blue apron and whatever but I
specifically Pat and I we really love
plated how I even got started on this is
last year for Christmas my grandma got
me like a gift card to sign up for this
plated so it's like free credit and then
once we finished with the credit we're
like okay do we want to continue it did
we like it we want to start paying for
it ourselves type of thing um so we
ended up doing it and we freaking love
it the one we had last night was this
pumpkin ravioli oh they have unique
stuff like this quinoa casserole it has
like butternut squash and cauliflower
and it's like everything I love so
they're all like really unique meals to
where I feel like I'm you know getting
these ingredients
I can make the food and it's not like um
super easy stuff that I can figure out
myself like this stuff I need the help
so that's why I feel like it's worth it
and then my last lifestyle favorite is I
want to talk about a netbook show that
I'm into because I feel like sometimes I
do that but Pat and I are huge Netflix
fans so lately we've been obsessed with
Criminal Minds I know it's kind of an
old show but we've been getting on that
we missed our Dexter binges and it's
been so long since we finished that show
that we're like we need another crime
show so we got onto Criminal Minds reads
my favorite character he's amazing
so I thought I would share that with you
guys and have you let me know if you
guys have any shows that you're really
into right now because I love hearing
what you guys have to say in the
comments so anyways that was my
favorites video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and maybe found some new
things you wanted to try trust me these
are things that I genuinely love so I
know and I hope that you guys will love
them too so yeah I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
