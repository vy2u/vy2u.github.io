channel today's video is going to be a
favourites video and I haven't done one
of these in quite some time
so I figured I was doing for another one
I really limited myself this time I only
have I think about 10 things but I
really wanted to give you guys a good
idea of stuff that I'm just constantly
grabbing for so I really stood back and
I was like okay what do I really really
really love and I that I'm using right
now and so I hope that that's helpful
for you guys so you know how these
things work let's just get started
so as always I'm gonna start off with
beauty items first
first thing is haircare something that
I'm really loving and that I've talked
about before I'm pretty sure it was in
my last favorites video but I had to
bring it back because this is my second
bottle I really really love it it's the
geese ooh honey infused hair oil love
this stuff I really religiously use it I
use it almost every single day after I
get out of the shower or even if my hair
if I'm using second date hair and my
hair just feels a little dry on the ends
I'll just use a little bit of this and
it just makes my hair it just brings it
back to light so I definitely recommend
I also think this would be a great gift
next up is my Dyson supersonic hair
dryer I recently started working with
them so I got my hands on one of these
things and I've been using it like crazy
I really really like it this thing is
super handy and it's pretty quiet too
which is nice
besides the fact that it's a blow dryer
and it blow dries your hair I really
loved the attachments magnetic so it's
super handy it also gives you heat
control settings and airflow control
settings which i think is really awesome
it also comes with a little carrying
case which is so handy even just to
store I just think it's really sleek
it's nice and pretty I think this would
make a really excellent holiday gift in
fact I think I'm gonna get this for my
mom because she's blow-drying your hair
every single day she has curly hair so
the diffuser attachment is gonna be like
her favorite thing in the world so I
definitely think she's gonna love it and
get her use out of it I just feel like
this is one of those things that is such
a awesome gift and people will use it if
they both are there
they will use it a ton so if you are
interested in it I will have a link in
the description box that will take you
directly to it moving on to skin care
the one thing that I really wanted to
include in this video and I'm going to
say it before I forget because I
physically don't have it here because I
just ran out and I forgot to save the
container and I need to get more before
I leave for the holidays but it is the
Clinique take the day off
balm oh my gosh I think I mentioned it
in a haul couple maybe like a month ago
two months ago and I was like I'll let
you know and girl you need it it's so
good and I'm not just saying that I
really I was kind of skeptical I'm like
okay I take off my makeup with sometimes
coconut oil and it does the trick but
that stuff is just really awesome it
feels good on my face and most
importantly it doesn't break me out so
thumbs up get your hands on it if you
can next up is a mask and I mentioned
Renee rule Oh what before but I think
I've narrowed it down to this one that I
think is kind of like my Holy Grail mask
it's the Renee reuleaux triple berry
smoothing peel this one's awesome
because I find that this really helps
for kind of like resurfacing your skin
in the sense that like I always had a
lot of little marks and stuff from when
I would have cystic breakout and I just
feel like this is really helping than
just overall appearance I feel like my
skin is getting smoother use this like
once or twice a week
max and it's like a really quick mask I
think you only leave it on for like
seven minutes sometimes I go a little
over under I'm not too precise about
stuff but it's like and I love it and
I've been using it for a very long time
so definitely recommend if you're
looking for something like that for your
skincare routine so next up I have to
makeup products that are at my all-time
favorites this one the first thing one
I'm gonna mention is my like I love it
so much it is the Nate Urban Decay Naked
heat palette I don't know where I was
like I don't know where I was when this
came out because I feel like it's been
out for a while and I recently started
discovering it and fell in love it's all
these really awesome warm and neutral
tones which you guys know is my jam
I don't mess around this too many like
crazy color shadows even
my shadow's i don't really mess with and
this just has like the perfect amount of
each they're all neutral they have kind
of these like red tones and they're just
awesome Purple's in there I just love it
I love what it does to my eyes I'm
wearing it now it's nothing too crazy
you can obviously control how much goes
on but I definitely definitely recommend
this again I just think this would be a
great gift also if you have somebody
that's looking for just like a one-stop
shop make a I shadow palette this is it
because absolutely love it
I've been the last makeup product that I
recently switched over to is the what
brand is this L'Oreal Lumi vault
voluminous lashes paradise I think it's
L'Oreal oh my gosh
I've used it so much to like writing war
off it but I will have it obviously in
the description but it's just the best
mascara recently that I found I was so
hooked on the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara for like years you
could go back on my videos and watch it
I pretty sure in my apartment in college
I was using nothing and I just like
stuck to that for so long and then
recently I was told to tried the lash
paradise and it's pretty awesome like
the brush is really good I like what it
does to my lashes you know the whole
things mascaras are supposed to do this
does it and I love it so try it out and
it's a drugstore so affordable okay now
let's move on to the fashion items did
you guys know are my favorite but I only
picked three things crazy right
the first fashion item oh so big is this
coat and I did not realize how much I
would actually love this coat I knew I
was gonna love it but not like to the
point where I was just constantly
grabbing it it is so warm and right now
in New York it's like on and off snowing
it's cold regardless so you just want
something to bundle up in and this does
the trick it's by the brand I am Gia
which is another just like brand
favorite that I've been loving right now
but this thing is just so massive it's
like wrapping a break a break it it's
like wrapping a blanket around you and
going outside it's super cozy I love
that it's a neutral color because if it
just goes
everything that could possibly we're so
yeah I definitely recommend getting your
hands on this if you can they also make
these all over I'm pretty sure I seen
this on private 21 of an outfitter it's
just like a big teddy bear coat it's
just something I feel like I would
recommend to you because I've been
wearing it more than I even thought I
would so thumbs up to this alright next
for fashion items are pants in specific
patterned pants yes yes yes they're both
from Urban Outfitters and I feel like
this is a hundred percent one of my
favorites I was thinking about it when I
was taking them out today like all of my
favorites and I was like I've just been
really grabbing patterned pants I just
think they look so good especially with
the coat that I'm obsessing over like it
just matches all of these in specific is
this if a store I could recommend to get
them at and that's Urban Outfitters
actually pretty sure I just ordered and
should be here today another pair of
patterned pants they're like check black
and white check but they're just so cool
they look so cool I like wearing pretty
simple tops that wearing stuff like this
just makes your outfit look better and
these are really comfy like these are
fleece lined which is amazing for the
winter time and then these just all-over
feel like fleece so you just feel like
you're wearing leggings and they're not
too constricting and like they're just
great I definitely recommend they're
high on my list a favorite so yay and
then lastly for fashion favorites feel
like you guys saw this coming I feel
like I always feature some sort of a hat
but this time it's Berets do you think
oh I could rant and rave about these all
the time I'm constantly grabbing these
to put on I just think they make an
outfit look so chic so cute and they
help your hair you're having a bad hair
day which is always a plus
you can find them all over and they're
so affordable this one's from Urban
Outfitters this from but this one's from
Windsor store I think a block and a tan
or like a beige it's just like all you
need you're good to go although I did
think I just ordered a red one from ASOS
but I just think they're so cool I'm
such a hat person you guys know this but
they also keep your ears warm
I know some people like to wear it like
on top of their head but I just like
pull the whole thing over and slouch it
good to go and then lastly I have a
little bit of a light style favor I feel
like I always mention beauty and fashion
but never anything else and I want to
start doing that something that I've
been really really loving and something
that I asked for for Christmas and that
we got a little early since we're gonna
be all over the place
and that's essential oils are like an
essential oil kit I'm just showing you
guys the little oil things but there
actually is like a little machine that
like you put water and oil and it like
disperses but it's plugged in and it's
just I can't be bothered to move it but
you guys get the idea they are so
awesome
I've just been obsessing over them
what's really cool is that they have all
different types of sense and reasoning
for them like they give you a little
pamphlet of stuff you can mix into it
and then it helps like if you are
stressed something very relaxing you can
do all sorts of things with them and Pat
and I have just been loving it yeah I
thought I would mention it because like
I said I want to mention more stuff like
that because that stuff is helpful - you
guys are looking for another gift or
something just to treat yourself with
definitely reccommend essential oils I
feel like you'll love it you can also
use it on yourself too it's not just for
a hair thing so they're just
multi-purpose and I love them so yeah
those are all my favorites I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and got some new
ideas of stuff that might benefit you in
your life because these things are just
what I'm constantly just living for
right now and I love them so I hope that
helps you guys out thank you guys again
for watching and I will see you all in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
