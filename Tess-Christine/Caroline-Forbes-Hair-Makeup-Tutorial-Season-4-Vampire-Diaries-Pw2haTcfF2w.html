the second part of my be Empire Diaries
hair and makeup videos my last video was
Elena - Katherine day and night video
and now today's video is going to be
Caroline Forbes now I always get
requests for Caroline and Rebecca and
this is the first time I've ever done
actual like makeup and hair for either
of those girls obviously since the show
has had 4 seasons the makeup and hair
has changed a little bit so I just chose
one of my favorites that I thought would
be perfect for like an everyday look not
really one of her more intense looks
like when she first becomes a vampire
her makeup is a little bit more intense
plus I have seen tutorials all around
YouTube for that kind of makeup so I
decided to go with some of her more
natural ones which is in the recent
episodes season 4 in particular because
I thought I would keep it updated and do
things that you guys are seeing normally
please remember that these videos are my
interpretation of the characters I was
getting a lot of comments on my Elena
Katherine video about some of their own
opinions on the makeup and the hair etc
just so you guys know this is my
interpretation you guys are more than
welcome to do whatever you so please at
home by yourself if you think it's
different I just thought I would give
you guys an interpretation of my own
because a lot of you guys were asking
for it so just keep that in mind when it
comes to the hair and makeup because of
course I'm not a makeup artist and I
don't do their hair and makeup for every
episode so how am I supposed to know so
I do my research as best as I can do you
try to get the accurate eyeshadow shades
and things like that for you guys
so I'm trying my hardest to get it as
exact as possible but of course it's all
open to interpretation
so yes I really hope that you guys enjoy
this video and let's get started
starting with the makeup I'm going to
begin by priming my eyelids with a
primer to act as kind of a base for the
rest of the colors that we're using now
I'm just taking a light brown matte
shade and I'm building this up onto my
lids as the main color for this look
to add some highlight I'm just gonna be
taking the shimmery white beige color
and placing that onto my brow bone and
then to add a little bit more shimmer
that Caroline does have I'm just going
to be placing a shimmery light pink
color into the inner corners of my eye
now to start off with the eye liner
which is the whole main point of this
look I'm just gonna be taking a liquid
eyeliner and tracing a very small line
on my upper lash line and winging it out
slightly now so you get that smokey eye
liner look that Caroline has I'm just
taking a flat top I shadow brush and
picking up some black eye shadow and
kind of smudging that into my lash line
along with the liquid liner once you've
completed that I'm just applying some
big eyes mascara to give those big
voluminous lashes that Caroline does
have of course you can't get these
vampire diaries look without adding some
false lashes because the girls always
have these full thick lashes which I'm
absolutely obsessed with so of course
I'm adding some inter with the
individual eyelashes to the outer
corners of my eyes and that completes a
shadow look now let's move on to the
face so all I've done is applied some
concealer and foundation whatever you
normally use and now we're going to give
ourselves a little bit of shape to our
face we're gonna contour with some matte
bronzer and this is going to give you
kind of a defined look like all of the
girls on the show have and of course I'm
gonna highlight my cheekbones and the
bridge of my nose along with my Cupid's
bow now let's move on to the cheeks so I
know that the makeup artist loves NARS
blushes so I'm sticking with the one
that I use for Elena which is a light
pink color and I'm placing that on the
apples of my cheeks now to match
Caroline's always glossy pink lips I'm
applying this one from Victoria's Secret
which is basically like a lip plumper
and a gloss in one so it's perfect to
match Caroline's and that's it for the
makeup so now let's move on to the hair
starting with the hair I'm starting with
second day hair I just find it easier
for me to curl and have bigger curls
when I have second day hair where my
hair isn't as clean so if that's for you
too then I would definitely recommend
doing that so all I'm doing now is I'm
sectioning my hair from the bottom to
the top and we're working with the
bottom section first and all I'm doing
is taking the Conner infinity wand which
is probably one of my favorite curling
irons because you can do so many things
with it and I am curling about one-inch
sections of my hair this is a very very
simple process I'm I sped it up even for
you guys and cut out a bunch of Clips so
you guys didn't have to sit here and
watch me curl my hair but basically all
I'm doing is I'm curling my entire head
with this curling iron and leaving do
not touch the curls you want them to
cool completely because we're not gonna
leave it like this cuz obviously that
would be more of a Catherine look and we
want Caroline's so we're gonna leave the
curls as they are for now but later or
in a minute I will show you exactly what
to do with them to match Caroline's so
right now I'm just finishing up all the
sections of my hair and curling it away
from my face don't forget about that and
so now once it's done curled being
curled I'm going to let it sit and wait
until it is cooled this is very
important because if you brush them out
with your fingers like I'm doing now
when it's hot the curls are gonna fall
out right away which is not what you
want so all I'm doing is brushing
through my hair with my fingers being
very gentle and as you can kind of see
I'm wrapping it around each other like
I'm grabbing sections and I'm twisting
them around each other so I don't lose
the curl but I'm also shaping it to
match Caroline's which Caroline kind of
has this wavy texture but still these
bouncy curls so that's all I'm doing now
I'm kind of shaping it how I want and
you can be totally random and play with
this until you like it so once I finish
I'm just going to spritz with hairspray
and the hair look is complete I really
really hope you guys like this tutorial
I hope you found it helpful and I will
see you guys later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
