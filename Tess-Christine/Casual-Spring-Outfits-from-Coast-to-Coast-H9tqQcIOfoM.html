styling video as you can already tell
and if you follow me on social media
which if you don't you should just
because you know everything before
everyone else but I got the opportunity
to work with kids recently and I was so
excited about this because if you're
anything like me you've been wearing CAD
since you've been like 5 so for the
styling video I thought it would be
really fun and different to do like a
coast to coast thing I filmed half of it
in LA when I was there for work stuff
and then I found the other half here in
New York so I thought it'd be kinda cool
because I totally dress differently when
it comes to where I am I mean it kind of
makes sense right so I thought it would
be really fun to do casual very very
casual everyday spring outfits la New
York style I don't know something
different thought it would be fun to
watch so if you are interested then just
keep on watching for this first outfit I
love how colorful it is but it's also
super laid back which I absolutely love
it's kind of sporty even too so for the
shoes I kept it really simple with just
a solid color pair of kids or my
leggings I love how colorful they are
they are a legging material so they're
super breathable I pulled out the colors
from my leggings with a just a simple
colored top and of course a jean jacket
because it is spring so it's a little
bit chillier or by sunglasses I thought
it'd be really fun to do some mirrored
lenses so I did that along with my
all-time favorite backpack
from Target
for this next outfit I really like it a
lot because it incorporates a lot of my
favorite clothing pieces from my
wardrobe and it also has floral print
which you guys know is my favorite for
spring so I'm just wearing this blue and
purple flowy floral top with some
high-waisted skinny jeans which are my
go-to right now and then I wore a black
floppy hat which is my favorite trend
for the spring and summer along with of
course some gray heads which are my
favorite I think from this video this
outfit is definitely my go-to kind of
thrown together look very casual and
easy to wear so I started by just
nodding a simple tank top I like doing
this it gives me a little bit more shape
and makes it casual and then I also just
wore some basic blue jeans with some
slip-on cads which are awesome in New
York by the way over my tank top I'm
just wearing this green collared shirt
open and if I wanted to add a pop of
color since it is the springtime I will
just go ahead and wear a lightweight
scarf like this one from Keds they have
a new accessory line that has some super
cool stuff this last one is definitely
my favorite and the one that I would
probably wear the most often so starting
out I wear these really awesome leather
black heads and then for my jeans I just
wore some really fun distressed skinny
jeans and then for my top I just kept it
super simple with just a white top and
if it was chillier I would throw a
jacket on over this for accessories I
wore a black choker necklace with a
heads ball cap which has the super cool
print I love wearing hats like this
backwards in the summer and then of
course my gold and white iPhone case
from Kaz that you guys have seen before
but that is it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and
found some spring style inspiration
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you guys in my next video bye
guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
