another celebrity inspired look and
today's look is cher Lloyd and if you
haven't heard of cher Lloyd she is a
British singer she was on The X Factor
UK if you haven't heard of her I will
link the music video that I'm doing this
look from in the description box below
it's a fairly new song at least for
people who live in the u.s. I don't know
if in England it's been out for a while
but at least for the u.s. I just
recently watched the video and heard of
it so I will link that in the
description box below the song is called
want you back it's a really really
catchy song and I think if the lyrics
are kind of fun because I don't know if
you've ever had an experience like that
you'll totally relate to the song
because I think it's hilarious now
whether you like cher Lloyd or not I am
when I announced at Twitter I was doing
cher Lloyd I got a few tweets that not a
lot of people liked her or some people
didn't like her but whether you like her
or not this video is just about her hair
not about her personally not about her
singing or whatsoever
I just thought her hair was really cute
in this part of the video and I think a
lot of people would enjoy this just
because it's kind of cute and different
and it's an updo I don't do a lot of
updo hairstyles so I thought this one
was kind of fun and that's why I wanted
to show it to you guys but it is
inspired because I have a very different
haircut than cher cher hair kind of has
a crazy short haircut so I don't have
that haircut and I don't have bangs or
anything so this look was a little bit
challenging to do but I figured I might
as well show you guys how to achieve the
look with all different hair types if
you have short hair you're good to go
and if you don't I kind of showed you
how to make it look the same way without
having super short hair or having to cut
your hair anything like that or cut your
bangs so if you are interested in seeing
this hairstyle please keep on watching
let me know what you think in the
comments below and I will see you guys
next time
bye guys to begin you can use second day
hair or just blown dried hair whatever
you prefer and you are just going to
begin teasing now this look requires a
lot of teasing to get that big full
effect in the bun that she has so I'm
just going to tease the crown of my head
and I'm teasing it and I believe the
layers and I'm gonna taste the crown of
my head and then the sides of my head
once I'm finished easing I'm going to
gather the back section of my hair and
pinch it in between my two fingers and
push it up onto my head to give that
kind of pouf look and you can gather as
much hair as you want in the back but
I'm just going to secure that with a
little butterfly clip or whatever
they're called just the little clips you
can get it like Target or something but
now I'm going to section off my bangs or
quote-unquote bangs what I do have or
just a section of your hair on each side
I'm not too big of a sections but not
too small either and I'm going to put
that in a ponytail now with the ponytail
you're not going to bring it all the way
through you're gonna stop right at the
ends to create kind of that bun or donut
shape look and then you're just going to
pull strands out of that bun just to
create a more messy look and they're
gonna be strands that we curl later so
with the Conner infinity one I'm going
to curl those sections of hair this will
also make the look a little bit fancy
and not so messy like you just rolled
out of bed so curling the ends will help
a lot too and then with the bangs
because I don't have short hair or I
don't have my bangs cut I'm just going
to take sections of the bangs and pin
them to the side of my head this is just
gonna shorten the strands of hair and
make it look like my hair's a lot
shorter than it is and so you can I'm
going to use this technique on both
sides of my hair and I'm just going to
curl opposite directions I'm not going
to make it too precise with the Conner
infinity wand it can be totally random
because you wanted to kind of still look
messy but still really cute so I'm going
to repeat that process on the other side
of my bangs as well
so once I finished curling I'm just
going to gather a section you can kind
of play with this for a little bit and
see how you like it and I'm just going
to take random sections and pin them to
the sides of my head make sure you're
using colored bobby pins that match your
hair because this is gonna be on the
side of your head so you don't want to
look it make it look too noticeable and
again I'm taking the Conner infinite you
want and just curling sections of my
hair opposite directions not making it
too precise and I am finishing with
hairspray and that believe it or not is
the finished look it's super easy super
cute and I really really hope you guys
like this cher Lloyd inspired hair
tutorial I think it's a really fun updo
and I hope you guys liked it thanks for
watching so Sala Kyla culpa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
