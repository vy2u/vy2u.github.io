be a haul and I haven't done a haul in a
really long time so this is going to be
a collective haul and it's all a
clothing haul and like a couple
accessories but it's basically clothing
and the stories that I'm gonna be
hauling are from Windsor PacSun and
Urban Outfitters so if you are
interested in seeing what I bought from
those stores please keep on watching so
the first door I got stuff from was from
Windsor comm and if you haven't heard of
the store I will have it linked in the
description box below because I know the
store isn't chained like to where
there's a lot of stores around the u.s.
it's mainly just a West Coast store so
they do have an online store though and
it's a huge huge website and they have a
ton of clothing that they focus on
dresses but they also have a lot of tops
and bottoms and stuff that are kind of
just like basic shirts that you could
kind of wear like everyday they're not
super fancy or elaborate but they're
just kind of like basic tees and tanks
and shorts and pants and stuff like that
so but the first two things I'm going to
show you our both dresses these are not
super fancy dresses they're kind of just
not casual dresses because I definitely
weren't one wear these on like a day to
day basis but they're kind of like more
fancy but not super fancy if that makes
any sense so the first one I'm going to
show you is this peplum dress I think
that's how you say it it's where it's um
a line kind of collar and then it has
this kind of like flowy material at the
hips where it kind of flows out and then
it gets tight at the end I really like
this dress and I know this is like super
in this season this peplum style dress
and I really wanted one and I really
liked this one a lot and I think it
flatters me really well which I like and
it has a lower back in the back of it
too which i think is cool and this was
3990 so I will have all the prices and
sizes and stuff that I bought in the
description box below so you guys can
know in case you're interested in any of
the things that I bought so you guys can
know like what size they're like how
much things are I'll have that all in
description box and then the second
dress that I got is a very tight fitting
dress and it has a lace detailing
throughout the whole entire dress so
it's kind of like this lace um yeah it's
basically lace it's a very different
kind of lace it's not like your typical
lace I don't know it's a really really
pretty dress and it's very stretchy so
it's super comfortable I like this one a
lot it's a very high
neckline and then on the back it is as
well the back has kind of like a it's
buttons here and has like a hole in the
back and then it zips in the back as
well this one's a very very form-fitting
dress keep that in mind in case you're
interested in it I would maybe go a size
up if you don't like it super
constricted onto your body because it's
definitely a very tight fitting dress so
if you don't like it super tight on you
I would definitely go size up I keep
that in mind this dress is something
that is meant to be tighter which I like
I think I like these kind of dresses I
think they're very fun to wear and kind
of very sleek and sexy I guess okay so
the next thing that I bought where's the
only bottoms that I actually got besides
obviously the dresses and there are
these like loose-fitting shorts they
look like this and they're kind of like
a bright coral color I wish I could
describe the material a little bit
better but they're very very soft and
really flowy which is what I like and
these are high-waisted obviously they're
really really cute and really
comfortable they kind of give off the
look of like a skirt when you have them
on but they're definitely shorts and
they feel like shorts so these are super
comfortable I would like seriously
lounge around and these these are
awesome shorts um and these were 1990 so
yeah this is what these look like
and like I'm a lot so the next thing I
bought was a shirt and it was kind of
like on the blouse trend shirt and I
don't have anything green I realized
that I rarely have anything green and
green used to be my favorite color which
is kind of funny that I don't own
anything green but I wanted to get a
green shirt and I really liked this
blouse a lot and it's green and white
and it kind of has this like zigzag
pattern on it and then the buttons on
the front only go down like halfway it's
a really long blouse so I definitely
would wear this with like leggings or
tights it covers my bum and everything
so I can wear it with leggings I like
that a lot it's really um soft loose and
flowy which i think is really
comfortable and I really like wearing
tops like that and this was 34 90 so
yeah looks like I got two of the same
style shirts but in different colors so
this first one that I got is in this
coral color
cause I really like that for spring
especially because it's a really bright
color and then I got it also in white so
it's the same shirt just in coral and
white I bought it in and the back is my
favorite part of these because it goes
down really low and has kind of this
like strappy design in the back I really
like that a lot and then the pattern is
kind of hard to tell on camera but or
maybe not it's like this kind of like
cheetah print pattern but not really
it's just got a really fun like polka
dotty pattern on it and again I got that
both in white and coral and the price of
these word 1990 so it's a pretty good
top they're really soft again and really
loose flowing another thing about these
shirts though they are high-low so this
one it go it's cut up here and then it
gets lower if you make a nice if that
makes any sense so it's higher in the
front lower in the back which I really
like wearing with high-waisted shorts
which you should have seen already I was
in desperate need of just like plain
white shirts so the site is perfect for
it because they have a ton of them this
one is has like a stripe design on it
just with like a little bit darker white
and a little bit more sheer which i
think is really pretty and it comes into
like a V on both the front and the back
which i think is really cute and it has
this nice strap here too that kind of
keeps it on your shoulder so it doesn't
fall off because if it didn't have that
it would probably fall off your
shoulders so that's super handy and this
one isn't high-low this one is just kind
of like your normal bottom of it but
yeah I like this one a lot this one is
super comfortable super soft basically
like all their shirts are and then the
last shirt that I got was another
chiffon shirt or blouse I guess you
could say and it's this one it's not
buttoned but you'll see it in the video
it's pink it's like a light baby pink
color it's really really pretty and I
like the length of this a lot because I
like tying my blouses at the end I've
kind of been into that lately for this
season I guess so I like tying them at
the bottom of instead of like buttoning
it all the way I like leave one
unbuttoned then tie it again you'll see
that but this is just a really pretty
flowy blouse and it matches just about
anything obviously I like wearing these
kind of blouses with my high-low skirt
it's kind of like the only thing I found
that
really like wearing with high-low skirts
and then on the back it has this cutout
which i think is really cool and kind of
unique for a blouse and so then the last
things from Windsor that I got we're
accessories and the first one is this
necklace and this necklace is really
cool because I've been really into like
the whole Peter Pan color kind of phase
right now and I really like this because
it kind of gives the illusion of it and
I've also seen these necklaces around
especially in like Seventeen magazine
they have these a lot and so I really
like this it's just like a cream and
cream color and then outlined in this
like gold design and then the next
necklace I got that I showed you in the
video was this chain necklace which I
think is really really pretty it's kind
of like this goldish like muted gold
kind of thing it's really shimmery and
really pretty but it's in like a chain
design which i think is really really
cool I like this necklace a lot and this
seriously goes with just about anything
I've worn this so much already and I
just recently got it so yes I love this
alright so the next door that I'm going
to talk about is pack satin because
that's the other place that I ordered
from and then the first shirt that I'm
gonna talk about is this one which i
think is really really cool it's a crop
top t-shirt but I really like it and
usually I'm not like a huge skull girl
but I really liked the shirt a lot for
some reason I just thought it was really
cool cuz the skull has like flowers in
it I just thought that was super super
cool and I haven't seen a shirt like
this before and I really liked the color
of it it's like a peach ish color which
I really really like so I wanted to kind
of step out of my normal style and kind
of do this fun skull because I think
it's really really cool then the next
thing from PacSun that i got was a
swimsuit top and I loved the swimsuit
top when I saw it it's like this bright
neon pink color and then it has all
these fringes that come off from the
seam which i think is super super fun I
really like the swimsuit a lot and I'm
just super excited to wear it for this
summer it's just a really bright neon
pink color and I think it'll look really
awesome like when I'm tan and then the
last door that I went to was Urban
Outfitters why I didn't go to it I
actually ordered it offline and I've
been kind of on the hunt for like
high-rise shorts I have a pair already
but I wanted to get ones that were more
distressed and like ripped and stuff and
I found these online and to be honest I
don't know if I
really I mean I'm really really happy
with them I really like them this is
what they look like I really like them a
lot and after trying them on they fit
like perfectly and they just they're so
comfortable and super fun and I just
really like them a lot and I like the
the height of them and I like how long
they are they're not super short to wear
like my little butt cheeks hang out so
that's why I I like these a lot they're
like the perfect length however they
were kind of pricey they were almost $50
and looking at them they're Levi's and I
could have made these myself if I went
to like Goodwill or something like that
and found like old high-waisted shorts
and just like or pants I cut them off I
could have done this myself so I'm kind
of iffy I'm kind of regretful for buying
them I really do like them so obviously
I'm gonna keep them but I'm definitely
gonna try to do like a look for less
video and try to go out and find shorts
and stuff and just show you how to
distress them that kind of stuff because
I think these are really easy to obtain
yourself for a lot cheaper than what
they charge you at Urban Outfitters
because sometimes I feel that Urban
Outfitters is a little bit overpriced
for what they sell so again I really
like these a lot I showed these
obviously in the video with like all of
my shirts so these are really really
awesome shorts I like them a lot but I
think I can make them myself in the
future for a lot cheaper I really hope
you guys liked everything I got there is
everything's fairly recent I mean I know
it's a kind of collective haul but it's
been like a month now and I'm pretty
sure most of the stuff is still out in
stores so if you're interested in any
buying anything I'll have all the
information in the description box below

accessories and shoes and stuff that I
