be a smokey eye makeup tutorial but
since it is summer I'm going to show you
guys how to add some color in a subtle
way just like I like doing it to create
this look I'm gonna be using my 28 color
palette smokey eyes edition from BH
Cosmetics surprisingly enough the smokey
eye palette actually has some color in
it and I was particularly drawn to the
pink in the green color because they
absolutely love those colors together so
if you're interested in this look please
keep on watching and let's get started
and how come it's so hard to begin I'm
priming my eyes to ensure that the
eyeshadow stays on and sticks to my lid
when I apply it with a large eyeshadow
brush I'm picking up this bright forest
green color and patting that onto my lid
and I'm going to keep building it until
I'm satisfied with the green color that
I have
now with my bring finger I'm just going
to be picking up the shimmery beige
color and placing it into my crease to
brighten up my eyes next with a crease
brush I'm just going to be picking up
this hot pink color which is a matte
color and I'm going to be placing this
into my crease and I'm gonna be kind of
using a patting and swiping motion to
place this and it is a very buildable
color so I'm going to build it up until
I'm satisfied with the color that I have
now with an angled crease brush I'm just
going to be taking this dark gray color
with gold shimmer and I'm just going to
be placing that on the outer corner of
my lid and extending it a little bit up
into the pink color with the same brush
we applied the paint color we're just
going to use that to blend the two
colors together now with a large fluffy
brush in the same shimmery beige color
we used before I'm gonna place that onto
my brow bone and a little bit into my
inner corner just to brighten the whole
look up now to deepen the look a little
bit more I'm just going to be taking
this matte black color and cut using a
pencil brush I'm just going to be
placing that into my crease and then
also sweeping it down onto my lower lash
line only on the outer half using a
small pencil brush I'm just going to
apply that green color on the inner half
of my lower lash line now with a basic
black eyeliner pencil I'm just going to
use that to lightly line my top eyelash
line now to smoke out the look a little
bit more I'm just going to be taking
this flattop eyes shadow brush and
smudging that into the lash line now to
define my eyes and balance out the look
I'm going to be lining my top waterline
and my bottom waterline
next it's time to curl the lashes in
preparation for mascara the mascara I'm
using is benefits bad gal lash and it is
just a really thick brush and I really
like it a lot so I'm going to apply my
bat mascara to my top and bottom lashes
when I now once you have completed that
the look is finished I really hope you
