the couples one-two-three tag so I have
Patrick here and you guys might
recognize him if you watch the boyfriend
tag video or the boyfriend does my
makeup video which we did like last
summer yeah a long time ago so if you
haven't seen those videos go check those
out but on my boyfriend tag a lot of you
guys were asking me to do another video
with Patrick so if you are unfamiliar
with how this tag works we just count
together 1 2 3 and then we say the
answer so they'll be like the question
goes for both of us so I will answer for
me and then we'll answer for him
probably really confusing but you'll get
the hang of it or understand it once we
start so ready here we go so the first
question is if your boyfriend or
girlfriend could be married to a movie
star who would it be so if I could be
married to a movie star who would it be
do you know you answer yeah ready 1 2 3
one direction that's not a movie star
yeah but you wouldn't say no to any of
them no I wouldn't but okay so you got
that right I have a lot of celebrity
crushes but Paul Wesley Stefan do you
even know the policy team Damon what do
you what I would marry him he's
attractive and he's my favorite
character on Vampire Diaries Oh marry
him but if he can marry a celebrity who
would it be ready do you know it do you
know your answer I already have thought
of these ready yeah 1 2 3
slightly Selma hi did you see her and
after the sunset okay
I would have never guessed that I guess
Blake Lively you what you guys always
talk about him his friends always talk
about Blake Lively
so sound like huh I learned something
new I would have never guessed that next
question is if your boyfriend or
girlfriend could be a celebrity who
would it be you know it yeah I do you do
not really okay I don't really know this
one myself so we'll see if you get ready
right okay 1 2 3
Watson ok true I like that was pretty
well that was good I was gonna say
Ariana Grande because I wish I could
sing like her Oh Tyler and I both
that yeah like instantly yeah but if I
had to be an actress Emma Watson cuz
she's like intelligent she's gorgeous
when I was thinking of my answer it was
between those two so you get a point
still that you could be a celebrity who
would you be I know this one hands down
ready 1 2 3
Johnny Depp yeah I knew it oh my gosh if
you could be anyone right now he would
turn into Johnny Depp and it's instant
which I would not complain in my life in
a week you've gone to 7-eleven to get
milk and decide to buy your boyfriend or
girlfriend a treat what could you buy so
what did you buy me so I have to guess
like okay I know what I would probably
get it changes though this is hard but
let's just go already 2 to 3
no does what that's like the shittiest
candy out there no Mel's days are so
good no it was if you buy me a treat I
would honestly pick up Snapple so you
got that right but Snapple isn't really
like a treat right that's like a drink
anything it counting counts because you
got it right but I would pick all
probably Milk Duds or chewy sweet tarts
yeah your turn I know exactly when I'd
get him ready try me 1 2 3
Oh your challenge P chose he loves P
chose I do love P chose B you eat it
can you I shouldn't get ice cream at
that like a convenience store like that
yeah you can yeah you can
that was a dumb question but I swear P
chose I would always but you soon what
percentage of housework would your
boyfriend or girlfriend say that they do
well we don't live together so that's we
can't really judge that but when we are
together I mean yeah other enough so we
know who cleans the malls 1 2 3
Easter event it's the first epic I said
most of it I wasn't about to like summon
up to percentage I thought that would be
doing advantageous I I would give myself
a tea I would agree with that so then
the next okay
now his turn how much does he actually
do
not much one two three 20% if you are
boyfriend or girlfriend could choose one
thing for you to get rid of what would
it be so I have to say what I think you
would make me get rid of okay so ready 1
2 3
make up oh my god I almost said make up
I feel like you would want me to get rid
of makeup over clothes because you don't
I don't know like you don't mind when I
wear makeup but oh no but you just like
I mean like I understand it's like part
of what you do right right it should be
like if I were to get rid of anything
you'd want me to get rid of that I
certainly wouldn't mind well right ok so
no your turn what would I want you to
get rid of I have one specific item that
I want him to get rid of 1 2 3
she cut off shorts oh those are awesome
no his shorts that you have they're like
cut off jeans no no I was wakeboarding
one summer I went to the lake and I
forgotten boardies somehow so I just
took the jeans and I cut them off a
little about the knees you're pretty
they're pretty short actually they are
pretty short they are pretty
they're also solution jeans they are
janky and they have some holes in them
they need to go there I dress out there
you just didn't like my schoolboy q
radio on Pandora no I don't mind
cuz that's bangin that is bangin okay
okay
next question is what is your boyfriend
your girlfriend's most repeated sentence
or phrase so you're gonna do laundry I
got this you have this I don't hide
yesterday no no I'll be on to do at the
same time I just I don't know if it's
right or not I didn't know what to say
1 2 3 I'm so sorry life this is really
anytime your rival is this real life
it's you out doing that I say I'm so
excited a lot like I'm so excited but
that's more like an expression I guess
you're right I didn't know what to say
so you get it I do say I do say that a
lot I don't know not neither of them are
wrong per se I mean I wasn't sure for
him he has a lot of catchphrases but I
think this one he says a lot
so it's only when I could really think
of ready one two three that's so rad
that's so rad you say that a lot what
you say go ahead that's so rad bro okay
but I don't say bro that's so rad homie
next question is what is your boyfriend
girlfriends most used cuss word I didn't
like this one site we don't really swear
like that often so like it was really
hard to think of it I mean usually it's
for comic relief not like cuz we're
angry
all right so mine first what do I
usually say when I knew you were on that
one good one to the bitch and then you
ready 1 2 3
hoorah emphasis on the W nice he doesn't
actually call girls that he just uses it
in a lot of yeah I actually don't really
use that at people know what's know I
don't even yeah I don't know next
question is what is your boyfriend a
girlfriend ultimate favorite movie
1 2 3 tiny notebook
what I almost said that notebook tango
and I thought that if I brought it up we
were gonna have to watch it again
tangled though I love you said that all
the time not my ultimate favorite movie
Tangled the notebook or the Titanic or
like my ultimate favorites the notebook
is so good I'm such a girl when I say
that like such a cliche but it's it's
true it's like one of my favorites
you're trying ready all right what one
two three roll Ares um that's an
excellent film cuz Johnny Depp but
Aladdin's pretty much always been the
breadwinner Oh
Top Gun not sure what I wish I woulda
said Top Gun because you always want to
watch Top Gun cause where the run
Diaries was like your face it's a
classic to me it's not like the
gnarliest film out there by any means
but it's like one of your favorites like
the
I'm Diaries Top Gun Top Gun that was I
can't believe I didn't think of Top Gun
that one you always want to watch though
I do not know getting answers god I had
that one I thought I had it next
question is a meteor just hit you've
saved everything important what would
your boyfriend your girlfriend go back
to get so what would I go back to get
wait we've already saved everything
important I don't know what that really
important means I'm assuming like photos
and like it's sentimental things okay
you know like so just like material
things that you'd go back to yet I guess
right like ready I know exactly what I
would run back to get and it's kind of
broad too just so you know yeah just a
little okay ready 1 2 3
mic sorry sophi that I even wrote that
down my closing some of them my Sammy
and Sophie are my precious kittens and
they are one of the important parts see
how I know that I don't know I assumed
you had taken all of your clothes them
already
next your turn what would what would you
go back and get I think I know there's -
I was teetering ready
were you tottering teetering and
muttering whoo 1 2 3
- camera no I'm important it would be
your camera your surfboard if we're
talking about material items not people
so it's very important you can choose me
but I'm one of the important things that
are already saved right so then yes
camera surfboard would be accurate next
and last question is the same opposites
attract is true because me and my
boyfriends are opposite at so let's just
say one thing that we both think we're
opposite at I think I have an idea
okay ready yep one two three music okay
nice at one point yeah he likes some
crazy music we we agree with music for
the most part like only we both have
like those outliers but I mean like I
would sit and listen to like ariana
grande and Wonder
sometimes and heat I don't mind either
of those but I'm good she was something
else and I'm not I'm not sometimes into
his music all that often that's it for
this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it I had a lot of fun did you
have a lot of fun Patrick nope
I'm gonna do that outro so that's it for
the video I really hope you guys enjoyed
it I had a lot of fun did you a lot of
fun did you a lot of fun ok good
cuz I like when he does videos with me
and I know some of you guys do too so
it's really fun cuz he usually films
them for me so it's kind of cool to have
his cute face on the camera to know it's
a little weird being on the other side
of a camera for sure I'm not used to
looking at them from this side but we do
like fun stuff like this like we do yeah
