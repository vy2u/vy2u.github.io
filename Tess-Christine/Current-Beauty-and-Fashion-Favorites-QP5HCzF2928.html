I'm sorry it's been a little bit since I
uploaded a video I'm back into my second
week of my fourth year in college so it
took me a little bit of time to kind of
get into the swing of things and get
back into making videos I kind of had to
go from like summer mode where I had all
the time in the world to film videos now
in a school mode where I have like a
strict schedule of when I can film and
upload to kind of make time for school
and for you guys because you guys know I
love doing this but anyways today's
video is going to be a favorites video
and as you guys know I don't really do
monthly favorites videos because a lot
of stuff doesn't change from you month
to month so I like to do favorites
videos every once in a while to kind of
show you guys new things that I'm loving
or that I've tried out that I really
like so my first favorite right now is
this and it's the poor professional
pearl balm to minimize the appearance of
pores by benefit and I've been using
this as a primer if you have problem
with pores on your face especially in
your t-zone where I have them definitely
try this out because this is definitely
worth the money it's really good and it
lasts a while because you only need a
little bit at a time when you're using
it the next makeup product that I'm
loving I've been loving for a really
long time and it's probably my favorite
concealer ever and it is the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer and I get
this in the shade light and I use it for
underneath my eyes I've repurchased this
probably two times or three times now it
lasts quite a while so even though
that's kind of a low number I've been
using it for months and months
the next thing I'm loving are these and
they are the Revlon just bitten kissable
balm stain and as you guys can see I
have quite a few of these I love these
I've used these and a few of my
tutorials and I'm wearing one right now
I'm wearing which one this one crush
they go on so smooth they have like a
minty taste to them which I really enjoy
and they're stained so they're not going
to come off as quickly as a lipstick
which I really like especially for
school so definitely go try these out
because I've been loving these for a
really long time my next favorite is
this mascara I'm really liking this
stuff a lot lately I like to try out
different mascaras when I run out of a
new one because I don't know I just
think there's so many to choose from in
the drugstore that it's hard not to like
try a different one but this one I've
already repurchased and I really like
this a lot and it's the Maybelline
falsies mascara
in black drama the next and last I guess
beauty product is for your skin and this
stuff seriously has been my lifesaver
and it is the cleaning clear advantage
acne spot treatment and my friend
actually my friend one of my roommates
Christina she recommended this stuff to
me because she used it and I am obsessed
with it I already got one of my other
roommates hooked on it it is the best on
the spot acne treatment that I've tried
basically all you do with this stuff is
if you have a blemish anywhere on your
face you just take a small amount of
this it comes out and kind of like a gel
consistency and you basically just place
it and kind of rub it into your blush
that you have before you go to bed at
least that's when I use it and I go to
bed with it on and I wake up wash my
face and my blemish pimples that
whatever you want to call it has
significantly decreased I'm not even
joking this is not me just trying to
sell this product it works so well
my roommate Christine Oh like I said has
used it for years I got my other
roommate hooked on it definitely try
this stuff out you can get it at
drugstores the next thing is a nail
polish that I'm absolutely loving I'm
wearing on my nails the right no and it
is an Essie color and it is called
fishnet stockings and I recently
purchased this and it is definitely a
favorite of mine especially for fall
because it's kind of like a red and a
raspberry color mixed in it's definitely
on the red side especially when you look
at it in the bottle you would think it's
gonna be red but it's definitely like on
the darker side it's just gonna be the
perfect fall winter color I'm obsessed
with it it makes me like look even more
tan on my hands which I really like the
next thing are candles yeah everybody
shows candles in their favorites videos
but seriously I had to show you guys
these I went for the two 420 bath and
Bodyworks teals and I got two candles
this one is leaves and this one is
pumpkin caramel latte and these are all
for like the new fall season at Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works so definitely go check out
their candles they all smell amazing I
could go in there and just smell candles
all day because they smell so good but
these are the two that I bought for the
two for 20 deal and I'm so excited to
smell at my apartment with these my
roommates are all pumped about it too so
because they really like these my last
favorite thing is a fashion
item and this style or trend or whatever
you want to call it is seriously my
favorite thing ever I cannot wait to
wear these I've already bought in two of
these and they are the contrast jackets
with the leather looking sleeves and
then like a different body to them oh my
gosh you guys I am obsessed with these
and as you guys know I live in Minnesota
so it gets pretty cold here pretty
quickly so I am just dying to wear these
are anyone this one a couple times when
it's been on the chillier side at night
but this one's a little bit more on the
heavier side so I'm waiting for this one
but this one I've already worn and I
cannot even express you guys like how
much I'm in love with this trend I just
think it's so cool and different and I'm
so excited to wear these for fall and
like early winter got this one at
Topshop and then this one at Zara but
these I think I'm predicting are going
to be a huge trend with this fall so you
should be able to find these kind of
contrast jackets anywhere so keep on the
lookout especially for forever 21 and
H&amp;amp;M I'm guaranteeing that they'll start
carrying it if they aren't already that
is it for this favorites video I really
hope it helped you guys find out some
new products you guys want to try out
it's all stuff that I'm genuinely loving
so I really hope you guys go try it out
too because I know a lot of you guys
will really really like this stuff too I
hope you guys are all having a wonderful
day and I will see you guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
