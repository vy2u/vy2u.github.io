favorites video and basically I'm just
going to share with you guys some things
that I've been loving for either a
couple months or even longer so I'm just
kind of chilling on my bed today and I
thought I would share with you guys some
things that I think that are worth
buying and that I really love
starting out uh it's the beauty blender
I know you guys have seen this a bunch
but I really really like it I've put off
buying it for so long and I don't really
know why I just never really thought
like it was worth it until I actually
tried it and then I was like okay I get
it now
but it really helps with like blending
um concealer foundation I even use it
for this one's really dirty and college
eyes like it's so gross but actually
because I used a right before I started
filming but the next thing is kind of a
splurge item and it's this it's the Tom
Ford um sculpting and illuminating duo
thing the reason why I bought this was
for my Alina and Katherine video that I
filmed for my Vampire Diaries series
hair makeup shenanigans I wanted to get
something for that video that was a
little bit more exact but this was like
70 bucks which in my opinion isn't
really worth it but it's my favorite
because it's a cream based bronzer and I
just started using it like a month ago
maybe two um and I really like it like I
really really really like it so let me
know if you know of anything cheaper the
next thing is a blush and it's by NARS
and the color is deep throat I've used
this in a lot of my tutorials lately I
bought it again from my Vampire Diaries
videos because the makeup artist loves
NARS blushes and she used this one on a
bunch of the girls so I bought it for
that reason to get the tutorial exact
for you guys I think it's gonna look
good on like any skin tone it's
basically just a pink color
I mean how basic description is that
like really it's just a perfect color
I'm wearing it now if you can even tell
so yeah this one's good worth it buy it
you want a new blush good my next
favorite and it's my last makeup tech
product it's this and it's mac fix+
and I've had this for so long when I
first started buying Mac products the
lady like somehow talked me into spying
this and I don't know why because at the
time I didn't know what it was for I
finally just realized that I love using
it to like what I shadow
there's probably dupes for it so I would
just buy those because this brand or
whatnot isn't like you know you need it
to make it look the same you don't um I
just had it and just found a use for it
so I really like it if you're on the
hunt for something no this is good like
if you want to buy this do it because
it'll last a while it's a huge bottle
and I just spray I mean I showed you on
my Halloween tutorials but I just spray
it on the brush after picking up the
shadow and then Pat it on my eyes and it
just makes the color up here just more
vibrant it's really really cool okay so
the next thing is a hair product and
like I told you guys I feel like I told
you guys this in a different video
my hair has just been really dry and
gross and I've just been doing a lot to
it whether its heat dye or something I'm
just really trying to get it back to its
natural state so I've been using a lot
of different shampoos conditioners like
hair products whatnot so I found this
that my hairdresser actually recommended
me after I got my hair cut it's a Nevada
product and it's a beta damage control
just this Aveda damage control but the
description on it says it helps protect
from the thermal and UV damage and
reduce breakage for all hair types it's
good if you're in the Sun a lot if you
use a lot of heat on your hair which I
do strictly because of my tutorials but
that's okay if you're on the hunt for
something like just kind of like an
all-purpose um protector for your hair
this is really really good the next
thing is a perfume and I got a sample
like those tiny little sample things
with something that I ordered and I use
it up because I really really liked it
and it was a Lancome perfume it's this
one right here so it smells really
really good and I'm not gonna just sit
here and describe try to describe the
scent to you because I don't want to
embarrass myself and just start rambling
off things so just take my word for it
go to Macy's smell it it smells good if
you can go to Macy's or wherever they
sell Lancome the next thing is a fashion
item and you guys know that in fall
winter months I love scarves I love hats
beanies whatever um coats different
types of coats all that I've showed you
guys that multiple times um but for
shoes and specific what I've been really
loving lately our booties these are from
Express and these are from Windsor just
like these ankle booties
in specific what I really like these are
nice because the heel isn't too BIG's
you can wear this during the day and
dress it up for a night time and then
these are just a little bit flashy err
with the buckles and you can make this
kind of like your statement part of your
outfit or it can just add a little flair
to your outfit I don't know I just think
they make all of my fall outfits look
really really nice you guys know if you
pull me on Twitter I think I've tweeted
this a couple times my roommates and I
love playing just dance we just got the
Just Dance 2014 and I love this we all
have so much fun playing this mostly
because um there's just so many good new
songs on it and the dances are really
really fun actually last night we got a
bunch of our guy friends to play it and
it was hilarious like if you ever have a
party or like a sleepover even like
family occasions for Thanksgiving or
Christmas or something like that this
would be perfect because you can just I
don't know it's just so goofy and fun
and like you can just be silly with like
your friends or family and just play
this my roommate Alex and I played it
for hours one night and the next morning
my arm was just like tired cuz you get
like a serious we're caught we were like
sweating we were like humming dance into
it like it's so much fun and you really
do actually get a workout from it so if
you besides the fun factor it's also a
bonus that you know you get an extra
calorie burn with it so I loved a
description in the are I'll have a link
below in the description box if you want
to look out at purchase it whatnot
definitely worth your time but yeah that
is it for my favorites video today I
