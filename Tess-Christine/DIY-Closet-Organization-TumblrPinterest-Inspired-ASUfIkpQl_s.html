DIY a closet organization video because
I thought that would be really fun and
different and I don't know helpful for
you guys because if you're anything like
me
keeping your closet organized is so
difficult especially when you're like
trying to find something to wear really
quick everything just goes everywhere
especially jewelry and my favorite DIY
that I did in this video is for a
jewelry board and that's by far the
hardest for me to keep organized so I
figured it would help you guys out too
and yeah let's get into the video first
I'm going to show you guys how to make a
jewelry board and when thinking about
what I was going to do I wanted to have
color and I thought I would use paint
and balloons because ever since I saw
this movie when I was younger it has
been on my bucket list so give me a
thumbs up if you know what movie I'm
talking about okay so to start I bought
a bulletin board at a craft store and I
painted it white with acrylic paint I
just wanted the colors to appear more
vibrant when they popped and just gave
me a solid base to work with next you're
going to need something to fill the
balloons with the paint so you can use a
water bottle with a spout on it a funnel
or an old mustard bottle like I did I
was just mainly looking for the point of
it to make sure it was really fine so a
water balloon could fit over it so now
I'm just filling up my a bottle with as
much paint as I can get out of the
bottle and I'm putting in about equal
parts of water depending on how runny
you want your paint will determine the
amount of water I put in a lot because
it was a lot easier to get into the
balloons but if you put less it's going
to be more of a paint splatter instead
of a runny sweater so now I'm just
stretching out the neck of my balloon to
make it a little bit easier for me to
get it over the spout and I'm squeezing
with all my might and trying to inflate
this balloon this is actually probably
the hardest part to get the paint in
there and actually inflate it and this
is a mess so make sure you do this over
the sink
also make sure the neck of your water
balloon goes down really far on whatever
spout you're using I tried to just like
set it on there and a paint went
everywhere so make sure it's really
secure at the bottom of the spout before
you squeeze another thing you can do is
fill the original paint bottle with
water shake it up and dump it back into
your my case mustard bottle or whatever
you're using to get twice as much paint
because I found what the size paint that
I'm using I got about 2 balloons because
I'm telling you this is like probably
the most difficult part of this whole
thing is inflating these things so now
all I'm doing is after drying them off
and making sure there are no paint and
not wet at all I'm taking pushpins and
I'm arranging them on the board you can
always rearrange them later even after
you pop them um just so your art is kind
of how you want it and I leaned mine
against a tree but you can totally hang
it up if you want to and I just whaled
away with some steel tip darts to make
sure that the darts don't break and I
missed like for 15 minutes and then I
finally hit this one and it was just
like the weirdest splatter ever but then
the purple one made up for it so this is
honestly so much fun you guys have to do
this with your friends all the pain of
filling up the water balloons is totally
worth it because look at how cool it
looks it's so pretty and it's gonna look
so awesome for a jewelry board so how I
assembled it was I basically just put
all the clear pushpins on the board how
I wanted my necklaces to lay so I put
the longer ones on the top and the
shorter ones on the bottom and then I
just placed the board on top of the
shelving unit that I put in my closet
you've been totally hanging it I'll
probably end up doing that later but for
now I just set it there and this makes
it super easy to just grab whatever
necklace you want to wear that day and
then put it back it keeps it super
organized and keeps away from a mess of
jewelry next I'm going to be showing you
guys how to make hanger dividers which
just go in between your hangers help
organize your closet a little bit better
they're super handy so all I'm doing is
taking a pattern to sticker sheet like
so mine is a chevron print and I'm
taking a circular object and I'm just
tracing circles mine had to be a bit
smaller actually to fit my hanger rod
that I had in my closet so measure
accordingly but all I'm doing is cutting
it out like so and then you're basically
going to double them so you're going
take one sticker off one side and you're
just gonna basically stick it on the
back of another doubling them so in
total I'll have four circles next with a
white sticker paper I'm going to be
measuring out two straight lines cutting
them out into basically white strips of
paper after you're done doing that
you're going to take a circle and you're
basically going to measure on the
backside of the white paper half of the
circle and you're going to cut that out
and that's going to be where you put
your title of whatever you're calling it
dresses tops whatever so I'm sticking it
on one side and then repeating that on
the other side so you both have a white
on each side and then I'm going to trim
up the edges a little bit just to make
it a little bit cleaner next I'm taking
washi tape which is super fun because
they come in a bunch of different colors
and I'm just placing it over the line
just to make it look a little bit nicer
and then of course trimming off the
excess now to make sure that I can stick
onto the hanger rod I'm just cutting a
slit in like so and then it's super easy
all you have to do is start rotating in
a circle turning as you do so and it'll
look like this little Pacman type of
thing now you just have to write your
text on it like so and on this clip I
wrote it backwards I goofed but you just
basically have to flip the text the
other way and it will look perfect in
your closet but these things are awesome
they're work really well for me for my
get the look videos because it really
helps me decipher what clothing is for
that and what's my own and seam with
tops and dresses they're just super easy
organizers and helps keep everything in
line
for the last DIY I'm going to show you
guys how to make thin labels which are
super awesome if you don't have a
dresser like me so all you need is this
basically you're just going to use the
same sticker paper that I use before
just in different patterns and with a
pre-cut rectangle which I cut already
you're just going to cut um a rectangle
in that sticker paper and it's going to
be slightly smaller than these labels
that I bought at a craft store and it's
gonna fit right in the center like that
and then all you have to do is take your
permanent marker and write whatever you
want so I wrote crop tops t-shirts
I was super dorky and wrote undies and
socks and they're just super fun to make
and they're really really easy so I'm
just tying some hemp or some twine to
the ends of this to tie them on to my
basket like so they're just super fun
they help decorate it a little bit and
definitely keep you more organized some
other things I helped organize myself
was I tipped the Shelf that we had up
right I added my baskets my jewelry my
perfume and then I also added a shoe
rack which I had before but I just
expanded it a lot wider so it fit a lot
more shoes and then also we had so many
hats cuz Patrick and I love wearing hats
so I made this really cool string hat
thing all I did was take the twine that
I used before and add these little like
clips to it and clip my hats on like so
so easy to do super inexpensive and it
helps keep it more organized and more
accessible and lastly here are some
before and after shots I really think
these made a difference and I'm
seriously in love with my closet now
but that's it for the video so I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
