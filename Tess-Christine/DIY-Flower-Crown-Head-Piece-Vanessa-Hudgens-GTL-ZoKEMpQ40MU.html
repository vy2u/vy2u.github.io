DIY video for a flower crown and a
headpiece that was featured in this
video my Vanessa Hudgens get the look
video if you haven't seen it yet I will
have it linked below but a lot of you
guys were asking me to show you guys how
I made the headpiece and the flower
crown that was featured in that video so
that's exactly what I'm going to do for
you guys today so if you are interested
then just keep on watching to begin I'm
going to show you guys how to make the
flower crown first this is so easy it
hardly takes any time and you can make
it with any type of type of flower that
you want this one that I warned the
video is obviously already made so I'm
going to show you guys how to make it
with some other flowers but like I said
you can use any color or any type of
flower you want so all you're going to
need is obviously fake flowers I bought
mine at a craft store headbands a hot
glue gun and some scissors super super
easy so with the headband you want to
make sure that you get a headband that's
only stretchy in the back or where it's
going to go around your head you don't
want it stretchy by where the flowers
are going to be because if it is it's
just going to kind of rip the flowers
apart once you put it on your head so
you can get these type of headbands at
Ulta or Target super inexpensive and you
can also use braided headbands like this
as well so the first thing I'm going to
do is grab my fake flowers and all
you're going to do is just pick them off
the stem that you kind of have to pull a
little bit but they come off pretty
easily and you're going to be left with
a bunch of flowers like this and they
kind of have little nubs at the back
which is perfect because how I made the
Vanessa one is I just took a headband
very similar to this and you just poke
it through which is another reason why
you want to make sure you have headbands
that have kind of like gaps or holes in
them it's just gonna make it a lot
easier to put the flowers through it but
since my flowers are a little bit
smaller than the Vanessa ones I'm going
to use a headband like this they both
are assembled the same way so all I'm
going to do is grab my hot glue gun and
place a good amount of glue on the back
of the flower and then all I'm going to
do is separate the headband as you can
see here and push that little nub I
guess I keep calling it through and be
really careful because obviously the
glue is going to be hot so you can let
it sit for a few seconds and you're just
going to repeat this process until the
whole band of the headband is covered or
however much you want the flowers to
cover it but has a headband like this is
really easy because it has the gaps
through it like so so all you have to do
is really stick it through and let it
dry for a couple seconds and you're good
to go it's really easy as that
so once you've finished putting your
thought flowers through the headband now
you can see that there are gaps in
between the flowers so I'm going to do
is place a little bit of glue on the
petals on the outside and just kind of
push them together almost so the flowers
stick together it's just going to
prevent you from seeing the headband and
kind of having the flower space out once
you put it on your head now if you're
left with these little like stem pieces
sticking out you can just take a
scissors and snip them off super easy
and voila it's done so cute you can make
it like I said in all different colors
you can totally customize it get really
creative with it that's the best part of
DIYs moving on to the headpiece that was
featured in the Vanessa video the actual
one that she was wearing was like $200
so I recreated this one for like less
than 20 I thought it was going to be a
lot more challenging but it's actually
super easy so let's get started so
you're going to need chain or an old
necklace jump rings charms a jewelry
cutter and appliers
so from the Vanessa video this is what
mine looks like she was wearing a
turquoise charm at the top of her
headpiece so I found this at crafts
direct it's like a snap jewelry thing
that they have but all you really need
is a turquoise charm to get the same
look but for this video I'm going to
show you with charms that I picked up
just at my craft store to show you
different versions so what I thought was
a great idea is to just use old
necklaces that you don't wear anymore
because they're just chains that are
just kind of sitting there so all you
have to do is remove the jump rings that
are already there like the charms and
the clasp and you'll be left with a
totally usable chain for your headpiece
so as you can see here I'm just kind of
destroying this chain and once it's done
you're going to measure it on your head
my hair is wet by the way because I took
a shower so it's kind of damp so ignore
that but all you're going to do is
you're going to take the chain and
basically place it on your head however
you want it starting with the sides
first I don't know I like to so once you
have it measured all you're going to do
is snip it where you left off and then
you're going to measure it for the other
side of your head as well so you're just
going to make sure you have to even
strands for the side pieces and for the
Vanessa video I had two strands you can
totally do that as well but for this I'm
just doing one on each side so it's
super easy if you lay it out on the
floor I just found that it's super easy
this way but now you need the center
piece so I just have this chain from the
craft store measured it to the back of
my head like I did with the other ones
snippin it and then I'm going to set it
out and make kind of like a layout for
myself so now it's time to assemble so
you're going to grab your jump rings and
with your pliers you're just going to
separate it and I'm going to assemble my
charm first so I found a charm with two
holes on each side just so I can mirror
the Vanessa one really well so all
you're going to do is place the jump
rings through those holes and it's very
very similar to the time that I used for
the Vanessa one just one the Vanessa one
has two strands that go on the sides of
your head and mine that I'm making now
only has one but it's very very similar
so now we're going to assemble the back
first so you're just going to take your
jump ring and in order you're just going
to thread on the chains you're going to
start with one of the sides then the
middle and then the other side so just
making sure that it's in order then
you're going to shut that and you have
the back of your headpiece assembled
moving on to the front you're just going
to take your charm and with the two
outside pieces of chain you're just
going to assemble that like so to the
charm so it's going to be assembled like
this now you're left with only the
middle piece kind of hanging free now
with my Vanessa one what I did since it
didn't have a hole at the top to connect
a jump ring I hot-glued it now you're
probably thinking what but this thinks
days I promise it'll stay it worked
really great for me so that's exactly
what I'm going to show you guys now so I
just placed somehow glue and while it's
still really hot you're going to be very
careful and place that chain there hold
it for a few seconds and wait till it's
dry and with that it's done so for all
of you guys asking in my video how I
made the headpiece that's exactly how I
made it just obviously with a different
charm I just think these things are so
pretty and so inexpensive to make - and
you can totally customize them to your
own style which i think is awesome
so I've went a little bit crazy and I
found this charm that I liked so I did
the same thing with the jump ring and
the chain all that jazz and I made
myself a whole new headpiece within like
a couple minutes so awesome and they're
way cheaper than buying them in the
store and I think these would look
awesome with like gold chain and just
kind of like just going crazy with it I
love it but that's the video for today
if you enjoyed e aí wise be sure to
give this video a thumbs up if you want
to see more of them in the future send
me a photo if you try any of these out
and of course I will see you guys in my
next video love you guys so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
