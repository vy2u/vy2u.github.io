another holiday video and I'm super
excited about this one because it's a
DIY gifts video which I love because I
feel like when you give somebody a gift
that you've made it's a little bit more
special and meaningful plus it's perfect
when you don't really know what to get
them and you don't want to spend a lot
of money so I went on Pinterest and
Tumblr and I found some great ideas and
I'm super excited to show you guys how I
made them plus what's really awesome
about them is they're not holiday themed
you can make them holiday themed if you
want to but they're perfect because you
can give it to somebody on Christmas and
they can use it all year round because
it's not like a Christmas decoration or
anything like that a lot of these are
kind of geared around girls they're a
little bit girly um however I am going
to make a DIY gifts video for him
meaning my dad brother boyfriend that
are totally guy stuff so I'm super
excited for that one because hopefully
that'll help you guys out because they
are the hardest to shop for at least I
think so but anyways I'm super excited
about this video because the gifts are
so cool I would love to receive any of
these but yeah I really hope you guys
enjoy this and let's get started the
first gift I'm going to show you guys
how to make our em stew coasters this is
perfect for anybody super into Instagram
or photography in general fun fact I
lost all of my footage to this DIY video
and had to re-film everything so these
are the coasters that I'm paid first and
they are circle but imma show you guys
how to make square ones same process
just different shape just to show you
guys an option so the first thing you're
going to need is to print out photos
from their Instagram or cute photos from
tumblr or whatever that you think that
they'll really like so the first thing
you're going to do is take your cork
pieces that you have whether they're
circle or squares and you're going to
trace them on to some card stock paper
it's a little bit thicker and this is
going to be the base of it that goes
underneath all up your Instagram photos
and you can get the all the stuff at a
craft store super inexpensive once you
have all of your cardstock pieces cut
out you're going to do the exact same
thing with the Instagram photos I
printed mine a little too big so I had
to do some cutting and trimming but you
can definitely write resize it the exact
shape of your cork piece but like I said
I had to do a little trimming which
didn't matter all too much now you're
going to take your modge podge and your
sponge brush and you're going to begin
applying that directly onto the cork
piece and then this is going to act as a
glue for the paper piece that you're
laying down so you're going to put that
right stock over it and then you're
going to go over it with that glue what
Mod Podge is that's different from glue
is it creates a hard surface on the top
which is perfect for a coaster since
they possibly could be getting wet so
I'm then applying the Instagram photo
over that and then taking my sons brush
and applying modge podge in a very even
layer this one is the most important
layer because it's going to dry on the
way that you brush it so just make sure
you're brushing it on pretty evenly now
all I'm doing is repeating that exact
same process on the rest of my core
pieces / Instagram photos this is so
easy and it takes hardly any time plus
it's super inexpensive and they look
super awesome also as you can see I have
a little white edges sticking out that's
because I didn't really size mine
correctly um so you can be more perfect
with it with your actually making this
gift for someone now let them dry for
about 20 minutes you'll notice when
they're dry when they're nice and glossy
and hard on the top and then you're
going to put some backings on them to
make them more like coasters I would
prefer to buy felt coasts or felt pieces
to put at the bottom by confining me so
I settled with these magnets which
aren't really the best choice felt
bottoms are the best but that's it all
you have to do is tie a little bow
around them and they make such a cute
gift for a friend or even a family
member moving on to painted mugs these
are so cute perfect for a friend who's
super into coffee or tea and moms and
grandmas will love these you're going to
need a plain mug it doesn't have to be
white but I chose white and you can get
those at the dollar store or Walmart has
pretty cheap ones oil-based paint
markers and some scrapbook stickers
whether they're letters numbers or
designs
I made a Christmas one for you guys for
reference just to see what it looks like
but you don't have to make it
Christmassy you can make it sayings or
monogram letters whatever you choose for
whoever you're giving it to all you have
to do is peel off the scrapbook sticker
and stick it onto your mug Patrick
wanted to decorate his so I gave him a
letter B so now all you have to do is
take your marker and take whatever mug
you're decorating and you're basically
just going to create dots if you want to
create like how I did it you're just
going to put more dots towards the
center by the letter and then kind of
scatter them out you can definitely do
some where there's more on the bottom
and it like
gradients up that looks super cool but
totally be creative with this this is
like so fun so you don't have to do it
exactly how I am just be creative have
fun with it I think dots look super cool
though um and also you can use a bunch
of different colors so I'm using purple
I used a silver one and I also used a
blue I would say that probably only
three colors looks the best but you can
definitely go crazy with it if you want
to um but I think these are so fun to
make and they're so easy so once you're
done painting or putting all of your
dots on there wait to let it dry for a
little bit and then all you're going to
do is peel off that scrapbook letter
revealing your amazing design next put
your mugs into a 350 degree oven for
about 30 minutes let them cool off in
the oven completely and then they're
going to come out so amazing and shiny
and you can put them in the dishwasher
and they won't wash off and a great gift
idea is to fill it with coffee and tea
that you know that that person that
you're giving it to loves um super cute
affordable and it makes such an awesome
gift now if you have a friend a sister
or mom who loves decorating getting into
like Tumblr inspired stuff a decorative
clock is such a great option for a gift
you can find all of these materials at
the crafts store they have clockmaking
kits in sections there so you're going
to take your wooden piece that's already
kind of shaped into a clock for you and
you're going to trace the bottom circle
of that on to scrapbooking paper or even
wrapping paper or fabric just for the
main design of your clock then on the
outer half pick any type of accent color
I love gold so I picked that and paint
that on the outer sides of the clock
just for added detail and once that's
dry then you're going to take some Mod
Podge and you're going to paint that all
over the face of your clock and then
you're going to apply your scrapbooking
paper or your fabric or anything like
that and apply that like so and then
with a pen I just use I poked a hole
into the paper to kind of make sure
there's a hole still there for the clock
pieces and then of course I'm going over
it with Mod Podge to give it a nice seal
and shiny coating after waiting about 20
to 30 minutes to make sure that your
clock is completely dry you're going to
begin assembling the cloth pieces
together there's very simple
instructions on the back of the clock
kit that you buy like I said it's in
expense
and it hardly takes any time so I'm just
assembling it like so putting batteries
in the back and you have yourself a
working clock that like I said a friend
or sister would love because you can
customize it to their room last idea is
a customized camera strap which is my
personal favorite so perfect for anybody
who has a camera or super into
photography you're going to need these
swivel hooks paint flat cotton cording
some masking tape fabric glue and a
sewing kit which all can be found super
inexpensive at your craft store now all
you have to do is take down your cotton
cording by the way I bought two yards of
this and I made two camera straps just
in case it obviously depends on how tall
the person is but that seemed to be like
the perfect length so now basically I'm
just creating a design this is now this
is the part where it becomes you you can
be creative you can do whatever you want
um you can follow my exact design if you
want to like it like slants triangles I
used a bunch of different colors but the
masking tape really saves your life and
making it look super perfect and like
straight lines and you can be messy with
it and then take the masking tape off
and it's like awesome so like I said be
creative use as many colors as you want
on dirt use like a couple but you can
also ask the person to like what are
their favorite colors and kind of
customize it to whoever you're giving it
to like I said I lost all my footage so
I kind of had to rush through this so I
would have made this much more perfect
if I was giving it to someone but I
think they turn out super cool
so now after your straps are completely
dry it's time to assemble them into the
little hooks you're going to take your
swivel hooks and you're going to thread
it through the bottom make sure the
swivel hooks that you buy are the right
size to fit the side of the camera to
like fit in that little hole to clamp it
on but these are the ones that I found
that fit pretty much all the cameras so
now I'm just taking some fabric glue and
I'm securing that down holding tightly
you could leave it with just the fabric
glue if you wanted to but since it is a
camera strap and possibly holding a very
nice camera I wanted to be secure so I'm
just taking a needle and thread this is
so easy and I just kind of picked a
color that went along with my color
scheme and I'm just threading it twice
through the center of that flap that I
fold it over just to be a little bit
more safe to make sure that no accidents
happen
and that's pretty much it I think they
turn out so cool all you have to do is
hook it on to your camera or whoever
you're giving it to you could wrap it
really cool or hook it onto their camera
and give it to them like that I think it
looks so fun and it's definitely cool
once you actually have it around your
neck and I think anybody who's into
cameras will love these but that's the
video for today I really hope you guys
liked it if you recreate any of these
gifts be sure to send me a photo using
hashtag test miss which you guys created
and I will look at them and like them
but yeah I hope you all having a
wonderful day and I will see you guys in
my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
