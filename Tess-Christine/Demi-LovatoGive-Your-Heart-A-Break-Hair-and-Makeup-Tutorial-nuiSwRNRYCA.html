inspired hair and makeup tutorial and
today's look is demi lovato
now I asked on my Facebook and Twitter
which demi lovato
you wanted to see because if you have
are you if you're familiar with demi
lovato you know that back in the day
kind of she had a very smoky look going
on and then now recently she's been
having very natural looks so it was a
total which one do I choose because
they're both very very different and
I've asked on my Facebook and Twitter
and my most popular response was now
demi lovato so her very natural and just
simple really pretty look but if you are
interested in her kind of more smokey
looks that she has I will definitely do
another demi lovato inspired tutorial
for you guys if you send me smokey looks
on my either my Facebook or Twitter but
today's look is actually hurt one of her
natural looks and it is particularly
inspired by her new music video give
your heart a break I thought she looked
so gorgeous that music video and I want
really wanted to do the hair and makeup
tutorial for you guys because it's a
very very simple and very wearable look
for it everyday I think the makeup is
just beautiful it's just plain and
simple and really easy I think I only
used like three different eyeshadows and
they're very neutral colors so I think
it's a very age friendly look as well so
you can wear this look if you're young I
know that some of her smokier looks can
be kind of iffy for those of people even
just starting out a makeup or maybe like
younger but this one is perfect for all
ages which is why I wanted to do it for
you guys you're interested please keep
on watching let me know if you think in
the comments below if you want to see
your celebrity get done go check out my
Facebook and Twitter and send me your
requests and I'll be happy to do them
for you and yeah I will see you guys in
my next video
bye guys to begin I'm starting out with
a matte cream base primer to ensure that
my eyeshadow stays on all day next I'm
taking this light matte brown color and
then placing that on my lids this is
just going to give a nice and natural
wash of color to your lids
next with this light creamy beige color
I'm just going to place that on my brow
bone and kind of sweep it into my crease
next with the shimmery beige color I'm
going to place that directly over the
cream color to kind of give a shine to
the brow bone and I'm also going to
place this into my inner tear-duct to
brighten my eyes next with that same
matte soft brown color I'm just going to
place that on my lower lash line next
taking a matte black color and with a
pencil brush I'm just going to smudge
that into my lashline
Demi's eye look is not very dramatic
here so you can keep it very natural by
smudging a soft shadow into your
lashline to give your eyes a bit more of
a dimension I'm just going to tightline
using an eye pencil next I'm going to
curl my lashes in preparation for
mascara now Demi is definitely wearing
false lashes in the music video but for
an everyday look I don't know about you
but I don't like wearing false eyelashes
every day so I just chose to add
different mascaras for dummies' cheek
she just has a subtle wash of color over
her cheekbones so I'm just going to mix
a bronzer and a light pink blush and
sweep that onto my cheekbones and a
little bit underneath my cheekbones this
is just gonna give your skin a nice glow
as Demi has in the video now for my lips
she doesn't have a shine to her lips
they're actually very natural so you can
just leave your natural lips if you want
to but if you want to add a color I'm
just going to take this light pink lip
liner and kind of fill in my lips this
is just going to give a nice look to
your lips and give it a little bit of
color if you need some
lastly with my finger I'm just going to
blend that lipliner into my lips a
little bit more and that is it for the
makeup so now let's move on to hair I
chose to use second day hair for this
look because my hair when it's second
day holds the curl a lot more now it's
time to get your extensions out because
Demyan in this music video has insanely
long hair so if you don't own extensions
this look will be completely fine
without them but if you want to get
Demi's close to exact look I would
definitely recommend in getting some
clip in extensions now once you finish
adding in all your extra hair I am going
to begin teasing now Demi has a lot of
volume in this particular look I think
her hair might be very thick or maybe
just have a lot of volume but I
definitely need to tease to get the
volume that she has obviously this is
optional definitely up to you if you
want to tease or not but I chose to to
give my volume the exact look that she
has so as you can see I'm teasing the
back section of hair of my hair and the
sides and I'm teasing before I curl
because I don't want to ruin the curls
the curls that she has in the music
video are very very precise and I don't
want to ruin them by teasing it
afterwards so now to begin curling I'm
going to split my hair into two sections
from the back and I'm going to begin
curling from the back to the front now
as you can see I took a small section of
hair from the back and I'm just going to
begin curling with a Conair curling wand
I believe it as one inch I will have
that in the description box below my
curling technique for this look is very
very simple all I'm doing is taking a
small section of hair obviously from the
back to the front and I'm taking the
clamp opening it and working it all the
way down to the bottom section of my
hair and I'm curling it upwards now
normally in my hair tutorials or curling
hair tutorials I start in the middle and
work the curl through the rod this way
this the way I'm doing it now is I'm
starting at the end and curling it
upwards this will give the curl a more
dramatic curl at the end and a less
dramatic curl towards the top so it'll
be more curlier and bouncier at the
bottom as you can see there as it would
be on the top so if you have layers like
me it's gonna be really tricky to start
at the bottom of the hairpiece and work
your way up so if you need to start from
like
fourth of the way from the bottom you
can you'll still get the same look as I
am here you can kind of tell that I'm
starting from a little bit down the
bottom and working it up because I can't
go straight to the end of my hair
because it won't hold all the layers and
a lot of the pieces will fall out you'll
still get the same look don't worry but
remember when you get close towards your
face you can kind of start in the middle
and work the curl through it this way
the curl will be curlier towards the top
and kind of frame your face a little bit
better now once you're finished with
that side you're gonna get all these
bouncy curls don't touch it too much
because you don't want to lose the curl
so now all you're gonna do is repeat
repeat the same curling process on the
other section of your hair working from
the bottom upwards with the curling wand
now you may not be able to tell in the
video footage but I am curling every
other way direction meaning that I'm
taking the curl one way and curling it
away from my face and then I'm taking
another section and curling it towards
my face this is just gonna prevent the
curls come together and keep that bouncy
texture that she has in the music video
now once you're finished curling you're
just going to kind of shape the curls
the way you want it and kind of scrunch
up don't comb through your hair at all
it's gonna lose the bounciness of the
curls that she has in the video so just
make sure you don't comb through it with
your fingers or anything like that
now that is the finished look I really
really hope you guys enjoyed this demi
lovato inspired hair and makeup tutorial
from her latest music video thank you
all so so much for watching and I'll see
you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
