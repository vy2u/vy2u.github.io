these draw my life videos so I hope you
guys enjoy and here it goes
so it all started in Wisconsin on a June
summer day June 24th to be exact I was
born and my parents both told me that
when I was a baby I came out crying and
didn't really stop until I got a little
bit older I definitely quieted down a
little bit and I was super super shy my
mom told me that I would just hide
behind her when we'd go out in public
and I was very shy to other kids I was
not very outgoing I just kind of wanted
to stay at home and play with my mom and
not really hang out with anyone else but
because both of my parents had full-time
jobs I had to go to daycare so my
daycare lady's name was Diane and I
absolutely loved her she was the
sweetest lady ever and I definitely came
out of my shell once I hung out at her
house because there was about six other
kids there that I became friends with
and I all opened up to them and we
became really good friends and it was
kind of a way to teach me how to
socialize a little bit but then that
didn't last long because about three
years later on May 22nd my baby brother
was born and his name is Nick now I
think I was a little bit too used to
being an only child so when my parents
brought him home from the hospital I was
like can we please bring him back I
liked being an only child but then once
I realized that he makes pretty awesome
Lego houses for my Barbies I ended up
liking him and we got along for the most
part and so I was actually pretty happy
that we kept him once I got to the age
where I could start playing sports I
didn't really know what I wanted to do
but I was a super active kid and my
brother kept me really active when he
always wanted to play outside and stuff
so I definitely wanted to get involved
in something and so did my parents but I
didn't really know what I wanted to do
so my mom came up with the idea that she
wanted just to kind of put me and
everything and then I could pick later
on what I liked the most
so I did things like soccer softball
gymnastics dance and swimming and it
took me a couple years to figure out
what I wanted to do and I stuck with
gymnastics and dance the longest but
then ended up just sticking with dance
because as you know if you are a dancer
or a gymnast the time commitment is huge
so I had to pick one and I loved dance
it brought me the most joy and I just
felt so fun and girly in all the
costumes and I loved it
one memory in particular that stood out
to me was my sixth birthday because I
was so excited with my grandma support
rised myself men my brother with two
kittens and I was so so excited their
two little boobies kittens and then me
and their names are Sammy and Sophie I
was so excited that I brought him around
in a little stroller to all my neighbors
to show them and it was just awesome and
I still have them today and I absolutely
love them now besides the sports I was
also a big TV fan in particular when I
was younger in elementary school I loved
Lizzie McGuire and that's so raven they
were my favorite Disney Channel shows I
watched them every night I loved it I
was obsessed with it basically anything
on Disney Channel in general I just
loved moving on to middle school middle
school was kind of a for me as it was
for a lot of people I went into middle
school in sixth grade and I had braces
so I was super small super awkward
haven't grown into my body at all and I
was a brace face and it just was kind of
a but I do remember one friend in
particular her name is Sammy and she was
my best friend in middle school
particularly in sixth grade we were best
friends we did everything together and
it was just so much fun but then
unfortunately times change and we kind
of drifted apart in middle school she
became friends with some other girls who
she knew through gymnastics and I was
just kind of left out of the whole kind
of friend group and when I was friends
with all of them I felt super awkward
and I just didn't feel like I fit in at
all and I just kind of felt like I was
out of place and I wanted to find
something new so after that I remember
specifically meeting my friend Briana
she was my best friend during middle
school she even lived near me so it was
super convenient every time we want to
hang out
I specifically remember memories of us
eating Cheetos and fruit roll-ups and
having sleepovers and watching movies
and I just have so many fun memories
with her but unfortunately once high
school came around we did end up
drifting apart but on the bright side of
things I found something that I really
wanted to do and that was dance team and
in the summer going into high school I
decided a tryout for the poms team and
it was actually really scary I didn't
know anyone and I felt like a little
fish in a big pond and it was kind of
sad because I didn't even end up making
the team and so I was really really sad
about that but it also made me work even
harder over the summer so then once fall
came around I tried out for the dance
team again
and I was super super nervous and I just
really wanted to make the team I was so
determined and luckily out all the hard
work in the summer did pay off and I was
so excited to see my name on that list
and I ended up making the JV team
freshman year so I was so excited about
that and then what sophomore year came
around I saw my name on the varsity list
after tryouts again and that was even
more encouraging and I was just so
excited to make the varsity team it was
a huge goal of mine and I just love
dance that's kind of where my outlet was
I just absolutely loved it
but I did have friends outside of Dance
these were my five best friends in high
school I finally felt like I found some
people that I really connected with and
we're into all the same stuff I was as
far as like personality goes and we just
had so much fun together and I seriously
remember so many memories in high school
we did everything together
Alexandra Hannah Alex que corre and
Melissa they were my friends for life in
high school and we just had so much fun
together the summer going into my junior
year I was super excited because I got
my license and it was so awesome
I felt so accomplished and I was like
yes finally I can drive myself places
but then my mom was like time to get a
job and at first I was like oh my god
but then I was super excited because I
thought working would be fun so I
applied at TGI Fridays as a hostess and
that was super fun also in high school I
had a crazy obsession with these three
boys if you can imagine who they are
from my awesome artistic work not but
these are the Jonas Brothers my friend
Han and I were obsessed with them even
had crazy Jonas Brothers walls on our
inner bedrooms I love Nick he was my
favorite also in my junior year I
decided to leave TGI Fridays and work at
Outback Steakhouse and it was fun
working there we got to save funny
things like g'day mate and then I
decided to also pick up a second job
because dance is super expensive and I
wanted some extra cash so I decided to
teach dance lessons at the studio that I
went to and I loved that I played Hannah
Montana all the time then it came around
to the end of senior year and my friends
and I were all graduating and it was
kind of sad to leave each other because
we all knew we were going to university
and we were all going to separate
universities except for my friend Alex K
and I we were going to the same one but
everyone else was splitting up so it's
kind of sad but we were all super super
excited for each other
so once that was over I packed my bags
and I traveled from Wisconsin to
Minnesota for university freshman year I
decided to room with Christine in the
dorms and I actually knew Christine in
high school but we got to know each
other even better in the dorms which i
think is super cool also freshman year I
decided to make a bold move and try out
for my University's dance team and I was
so nervous and hesitant but I was also
really excited for putting myself out
there like that
and luckily it paid off because I ended
up making the team and it was the best
news ever I was so so excited and just
to meet everyone I had no idea it was
going to be as much fun as it was and I
ended up meeting three girls in
particular that are still some of my
good friends today and their names are
Christina Alex M and Jenny and we had so
much fun on dance team together it was
like the best experience ever and I'm so
glad I decided to try out freshman year
and we had so much fun and got to know
each other so well that sophomore year
we all decided to move into an apartment
together
and that was so much fun I had crazy
crazy memories from that place sophomore
year was also when I decided to major in
public relations and also the year that
I decided to quit dance I needed the
time to focus on school because school
is really important to me and I just
kind of had to end it at some point
sophomore year was also the year the boy
that I was seeing and I decided to break
up and so with all the extra time that I
had I decided to get into YouTube videos
for some random reason and I found the
YouTube Beauty community and I
absolutely loved it so with Christina's
encouragement I decided to stack a bunch
of DVDs on top of my desk and film a
video and I absolutely fell in love with
it and I did it over the summer and it
was so much fun but then YouTube had to
stop and take a halt because I was on a
plane to study abroad in England and I
was so excited because I've always
wanted to do this so junior year fall I
decided to study abroad and I hold video
explaining this so if you want to see it
click here once I got back from England
I realized how much I missed YouTube and
I just kind of put everything into
YouTube it was like my life that's all I
did I if you followed me back then you
knew that I had uploaded videos like
daily and I just saw my numbers
increasing and I was just so so ecstatic
that all of you guys are taking the time
to watch my videos while I was super
excited I was
also super-nervous and I didn't want any
of my roommates to tell anyone I was
making these videos but then once people
started finding out people from my
hometown they said you know what we love
it tests and then I was super excited
and I felt even more encouraged and
proud of it than I did before
in March of my junior year my roommate
Alex K and I decided to be super
spontaneous and drive to the Mall of
America and meet one direction at their
CD signing and it was so much fun we
waited in line for hours but it was so
worth it because Zane even said I was
pretty and I freaked out oh my gosh best
compliment ever
but now moving on to year 4 which is
almost up to date my friends Christina
Christina Alex and I all moved into a
new apartment together and this one has
been the best yet it has just been so
much fun and I love those girls to death
in October my friends and I decided to
go to a fun party and there I saw this
really really cute boy taking photos at
this event party that I was at so I
decided to be bold and go up and talk to
him and the next day he asked me out for
coffee and next thing you know it I am
in love we have been dating ever since
and he is just the love of my life and
I'm so happy I met him and he has just
brought me so much happiness since I met
him and I love him to death then in
March of this year my friends and I
decided to pack our bags hop into vans
and drive ourselves from Minnesota all
the way to PCB Florida for spring break
and my goodness was this a fun time it
was like the best bonding experience all
twelve of us were just had the time of
our lives on the beach and you know just
having an awesome Spring Break together
it's kind of a last hurrah as our senior
year of college like it was just so much
fun but that leads me to now my life has
had its ups and downs but I can happily
say that I've had the best friends and
family a person could ask for I've had
amazing opportunities come my way
because of YouTube and I could not have
done it with all of you you all are like
friends to me and I'm so happy to have
people like you to make these videos for
