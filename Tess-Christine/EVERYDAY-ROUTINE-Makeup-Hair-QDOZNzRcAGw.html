you
what's up guys today's video is going to
be my everyday routine or as some of you
guys are familiar I get ready with me so
I just show you guys my makeup and hair
that I pretty much do yeah every day so
I hope you guys find this helpful I
switched out a few products since the
last one I did was just was a few months
ago um so I thought hopefully you guys
find this helpful I'm all like flustered
but before we get into the video I
wanted to share a fun experience with
you guys I got to go on set with Revlon
and sets are always so fun to go on for
me because they're so different from
like my setup it's always just you know
Patrick and I but to go on something
with like fancy lights fancy cameras
awesome set design and everything it's
just really fun so I had a lot of fun
with them I got to film three videos a
flawless face it smokey eye and a
contour and I got to use their new
makeup brushes I was introduced to them
so that was really cool I got to even
take them home and now I get to play
with them all the time which is really
awesome so if you guys want to check out
the videos that I filmed with them I
will have a link in the description box
below but anyways I really hope you guys
enjoy this video and let's get started
to begin I applied some coconut oil to
moisturize my face and then I go right
in with primer I love using the benefit
Porefessional primer you guys know I've
been using this stuff for a while it
smoothes down my face really well then
for foundation I go in with the Armani
luminous self Foundation which I just
recently started using and I really love
it feels really lightweight and nice and
I apply that with a Revlon foundation
brush I like using a brush for this part
because as you can see I have some
problem areas right now girl but it
helps kind of pack on that product and
really get it to where you want it to be
and then I go in later and blend it out
so then I go in with a concealer and I
take a concealer brush for this part
because if you've ever used it cosmetics
bye bye under-eye you know how thick it
is so having a concealer brush to kind
of go right up in the areas that you
want it to go really helps you out then
I go in with the Urban Decay Naked
concealer and I basically apply this
wherever I have a problem areas the
other concealer is mainly for under-eye
so this helps kind of conceal all of the
blemishes that I don't want to be shown
then I go in with a Beauty Blender to
just kind of Pat that and press that
into my skin for a very airbrushed look
like I said I like using the Beauty
Blender to do this at
the foundation brush to really apply and
get the product everywhere I want it to
go then I go in with the Revlon powder
brush and I pick up some translucent
powder I like using the Laura Mercier
one and I basically just spread that all
over my face to give kind of a modified
look and to set everything next up I'm
carving the contour brush and I'm
picking up some bronzer I've been using
the Becca cosmetics bronzer duo for a
long time now I love it and I basically
just use circular motions in the contour
places of your face so under the
cheekbones on your forehead underneath
your jawline and on your nose if you
want to then I go in with the blush
brush and I pick up some blush lately
I've been using the NARS blush in the
color deep throat and I place that on
the apples of my cheeks now I'll grab
the Kabuki brush and I pick up some
highlighter my Holy Grail highlighter is
the Becca cosmetics one I just love it
but having this brush kind of packs on
the highlighter exactly where I want to
when it shows up really well now moving
on to the eyebrows so I grab a spoolie
brush and I comb out my eyebrows first
this is really important because if
you're anything like me when you sleep
if they just kind of get all crazy plus
my brows are crazy in general so combing
them out really helps then I go in with
the Anastasia brow duo and I basically
go in with a wax one and because I find
that that really helps tame my hairs and
it really fills in into the places that
I want to and I basically start at the
bottom of the brow first and then work
my way upwards in small strokes and then
I can not forget to brush it out
afterwards this just helps give it a
more of a natural appearance moving on
to my Holy Grail eyes shadow primer
which is by NARS the stuff is awesome
and doesn't make your shadows freeze at
all and I'm going to pick up the
all-over shadow brush and pick up colors
from eat any urban decay palette
basically Naked palette I will have the
colors I use in the description box
below but I place that all over my lid
and then I grab the crease brush and I
pick up a matte Brown this is something
I do every single day the thing that
will change up is my eyeshadow base
color I'll either do a shimmery or a
matte but I will never not use a matte
Brown in my crease just because it
blends so amazing then I go in with the
eyeliner brush and I love this because I
don't use eyeliner I have it in a really
long time and I just pick a darker color
and place that on my lash line to make
my eyes stand
out and then I go in with some mascara
I'm using the Revlon all in one mascara
and placing that on my lashes and then
you already know this part Urban Decay
Naked 2 lipliner is my go-to I love it
just really pretty matte light pink
mauve color
and then moving on to hair I'm gonna
keep this brief because you guys seen me
do this so many times but you know
everyday what I love to do is just these
like loose waves lately I've been making
them even looser than I usually do so I
just take a curling wand I have always
been using the new me ones and I
basically just wrap it around the barrel
I when I'm just like in a hurry or just
like an everyday basis I will do it
really quick like as you see here I'm
just kind of throwing them on the barrel
but I like it because it gives kind of
like a straight wavy look to it very
messy that's my thing I love it to look
messy I hate uniform so this kind of is
just like my go-to wait for the curls to
cool off and then I go in with a
texturizing spray or like a beach spray
and that's how I get the texture and
messed it up a lot and it looks perfect
for the next day to like second day hair
it's my go to love it of course finish
off with hairspray and I'm done
for my outfit I kept it super spring
wins the floral dress I got that from a
revolve clothing and then my shoes are
from Jeffrey Campbell this is kind of
like a super spring inspired outfit but
