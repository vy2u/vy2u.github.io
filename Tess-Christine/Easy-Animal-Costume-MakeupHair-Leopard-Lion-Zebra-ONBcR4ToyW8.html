ha okay what's up guys today's video is
going to be my first Halloween video
this year yes so for today's video I
thought I would start out with something
super simple
I wanted to kickstart my Halloween
videos with something easy even though I
normally do like more simple costumes
when it gets closer to Halloween but
anyways I want to do this one first this
is perfect for those of you guys that
like to dress up for Halloween but don't
really want to spend the money to get a
costume you still want to be like
creative not just like basic Halloween
costumes this is a little bit more fun
you can make it a group costume you can
make it family costume you can do it by
yourself
it really doesn't matter so if you're
interested then just keep on watching
but stay tuned because I have a ton of
Halloween videos planned group costumes
couple costumes more individual costumes
scary costumes I'm so excited so be sure
to subscribe for all that fun and yeah
let's get into the video
okay so first I'm gonna show you guys
how to get the leopard makeup which is a
lot easier than you probably think so
starting out you're just gonna have your
face makeup on and we're going to move
right into the lids so I'm just taking
NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk which is
just a white cream eyeshadow and I'm
placing that on my lids and blending it
out with my finger this is just going to
make your eyeshadow stand out a lot
stronger which is what you want for this
look so for the eye shadow I'm just
using a bronzy coppery color and I'm
placing this all over my lids extending
it into my crease making sure it's
blended really nicely and then I'm also
gonna bring that on my lower lash line
for the eyeliner you're going to want to
do of course a cat eye eye liner so I'm
going to use a liquid eyeliner pen but
you can also use gel eyeliner you just
want to make sure that you extend it all
the way into the inner corner of your
eyes because not only are we going to do
the cat eye eye liner but we're going to
bring it inwards and extend extend it
down like you see here this is just
going to give you more of a cat-like
appearance and it's just going to make
you stand out more quick tip use a
pencil eyeliner for this inner corner
part it just gives you a lot more
control than a liquid eyeliner does
so then I curled my lashes and applied
some false lashes and then now I'm
placing a caramel colored eyeshadow on
the places where I'm going to do at the
leopard-print so on my neck on the top
of my forehead and then I'm just taking
this really handy tool that I got from
Maybelline and it's just this kind of
shimmery bronze color and I'm basically
placing spots or circles just around
where I want the print to go and you're
basically going to repeat this until
it's all finished and then I'm also
taking a sparkly gold color which is
just a little bit lighter and I'm making
slightly smaller dots in between all
those larger dots that I did now that I
have a bunch of bronze and gold dots all
over my face
to make it look more like leopard print
I'm just taking my eyeliner pen and I'm
basically just outlining those circles
as you can see I'm not doing all
outlined completely I'm doing some half
circles this is really what's going to
make it look like leopard print and as
you can see I'm not being perfect with
this at all the key is that they're
they're print isn't perfect so the spots
don't have to be either so you can
really be kind of messy with this and
once you outline it in black it's really
going to make the leopard print stand
out for the nose I'm drawing somewhat of
a heart shape on my nose not too intense
just slightly curved at the top there
and then I'm extending the lines upwards
when then blending it out with my
fingers to give it more of a natural
effect because leopards seem to have
this type of nose or this like shadow
right there and then I'm going to go
ahead and draw in the bottom half and
connect it to my lip and then fill it in
slightly not all the way and filling it
in with the NYX jumbo eye pencil in
black it just makes my life a little bit
easier and then I'm also going ahead and
filling in my top lip then for the nose
I'm going to fill it in with some bronzy
gold eyeshadow and I'm going to blend it
with my finger to give it kind of a
great in effect this just gives it more
dimension and then for my bottom lip I'm
just going to outline the outsides and
blend it in with my finger to give it
this kind of rusty pink color and after
that the makeup is complete super easy
right so for the hair I decided to slick
it back just because when I think of
love words I just think of super sleek
so I combed my hair into a low pony and
secured it and then I added some ears
which I got from Target for the rest of
the costume I just wore all black so
this part makes it super easy for you
just to dig in your own closet and
super-easy last-minute costume next up
I'm going to show you guys how to get
this super easy lion look that I think
is probably my favorite so starting out
I'm taking the NYX jumbo eye pencil in
milk and I'm placing that all over my
lids again and blending it out with my
finger but then instead of putting a
shadow over it I'm just going to take a
matte brown color and place that into my
crease lines always have the super
highlighted lid and then a more defined
crease so this is really what's going to
help you get that look then for eyeliner
is since it's a cat like the leopard
you're pretty much going to do the same
thing so winged it out and then extend
it on the inside this is really what's
going to help you give that cat-like
appearance in your eyes so I think it's
super important then with the NYX jumbo
eye pencil I'm basically going to
highlight around that inner corner part
I just think this gives a very similar
look to a lion's highlighted point to
their face if that makes sense I'm just
going off kind of cartoons if that makes
sense for makeup I hope it does
anyways mascara false lashes of course I
applied that and then for the face I'm
placing this kind of rusty reddish-brown
color on where I would normally contour
and then blending it out with a Beauty
Blender sponge between this on my face
and my hair it's really going to help
you get that appearance of like a huge
mane for the nose lines have more of a
prominent heart-shaped nose so I'm
basically recreating that with some
black eyeliner on the tip of my nose and
then I'm going to extend that down into
a slight curve and then of course
connect it to my top lip to fill in the
nose I'm using a reddish pink color and
I'm basically placing that in the center
and then blending in with the black to
give it kind of a gradient more
realistic look and then for the whiskers
I'm just taking an eyeliner and it
basically just doing little circles
little dots all over the top of my lip
and then I'm going to take the sponge
part of that eyeliner and I'm basically
just going to smudge it outwards making
it kind of look more realistic like
whiskers and then lastly for the lips
you're just going to fill them both in
completely with black eyeliner or a
black lipstick and after that you are
done with the makeup now moving on to
the hair this part is the easiest and
most
fun you basically just get to mess up
your hair girl tease it back home it
hairspray it like crazy you just want to
make this crazy wild fierce lion mane
after that throw on some lion ears if
you have them and wear anything tan and
you have a super easy lion costume and
last but not least the zebra look which
I think turned out super awesome so
you're going to start out with of course
the next jumbo eye pencil in milk and
you're basically going to trace out
wherever you want your zebra print I
decided to go for a mask type of look
but I think what look really cool is
like a half base or like a diagonal
split face basically all you're going to
do is just fill in in white wherever you
want your zebra print to be also if you
didn't notice at this point I do have my
eye makeup done so keep that in mind and
then after you get your print lined out
I'm basically just going to take my
finger and smooth out the edges to give
kind of a gradient look so it doesn't
look like such a harsh line and it'll
just end up making the zebra print look
cooler so now I'm just taking a NYX
jumbo eye pencil in black and I'm
filling in my eyebrows and then this is
where the fun part slash kind of
challenging part comes in I'm just
taking a brush and some gel eyeliner but
liquid eyeliner will work too and in
basically just creating a zebra print
now how I did this is I basically just
looked at a zebra and they're print and
I try to recreate the lines I realized
like right now I kind of look like the
girl from Black Swan um the bun is not
helping me but anyways it ends up
looking super cool you just got to keep
making lines it's kind of a trial and
error thing um but my tip for you is to
make the lines thicker in the center and
then they kind of go out at a point
that's kind of how I notice deeper
stripes are um so it's basically kind of
catering to your face however you end up
creating it will end up looking cool so
I just did that all over my face and as
you can see I also extended that down
onto my neck as well for my lips I just
filled them in with black so black
lipstick would work if you want a more
exact zebra look make a huge oval around
your nose and mouth and you'll get a
super intense
zebra look after that the makeup is done
so now moving on to the hair you're
basically going to put in three
ponytails in the center of your head go
down then with a teasing brush you're
just going to backcomb your hair a
little bit and rat it and kind of smush
it up into a little big bun on the top
of your head and pin it with bobby pins
this is where you're going to create
this kind of mohawk looking horse mane
which I think ends up looking awesome so
I'm basically just taking pins ratting
and just kind of connecting the hair as
you can see here and pinning it together
to make sure there's no spaces and I'm
doing that until all the hair is pinned
up and then you have this really cool
faux hawk looking horse mane that I
think looks so awesome and then I'm just
going to add some zebra ears from Target
and the look is done for clothing all
you have to do is wear a black-and-white
printed top I also think zebra leggings
would look super cool for this costume
but that is it for my video today really
hope you guys enjoyed it be sure to give
me a thumbs up if you did and yeah
