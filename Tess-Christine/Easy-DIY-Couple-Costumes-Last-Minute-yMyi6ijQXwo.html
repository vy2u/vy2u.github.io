super easy DIY couples costume video and
obviously I'm here with Patrick and we
were thinking about couples costumes
because we wanted to make a video for
those that were interested in that and
so we did three we did a funny one I
like a classic like Disney one and then
we did like a scarier one and I'm super
happy with how they turned out I think
they look so awesome you can also do
this with friends too you don't have to
be like dating to do this you can do it
with whoever you want they just are kind
of like paired together so I don't know
we thought it would help some of you out
so if you're interested then just keep
on watching
okay so first up I'm going to show you
guys the Mary Poppins a couple costume
so obviously there's a Mary Poppins and
Bert so starting with Mary Poppins all
you need to make is the Hat because it's
like crazy flowers on top of her hat so
all you need is just a hat that you can
find at any costume store super
inexpensive and then just buy some fake
flowers preferably in yellow white and
then red berries cuz that's what she has
on her hat and all you're gonna do is
just glue them around the Hat however
you see fitting and it's really that
easy and then for the rest of my outfit
I just wore a collared shirt from
forever 21 a red bow tie which I got at
a costume shop a red belt and then a
black miniskirt and of course you can't
forget the umbrella and a large bag
moving on to Bert all you need to do for
this DIY is get a broom because we're
going to make a chimney sweep so all you
need to do is just spray paint it black
I found mine at Target super inexpensive
and basically it's just gonna create
soot so it's gonna look super black like
a chimney sweep wood and that's all you
really need and for the rest of the
outfit you just need some sort of cap
like shown here you need a vest a
collared shirt and then I found this
scarf at a thrift shop that matches up
birds from the movie but most of the
stuff your guy will probably have in his
closet so it's really easy to do and
just throw together last-minute Plus
everybody will love it at a costume
party
now for the funny costume I thought it
would be really cute to do something
from Sesame Street and in this case I
did a Cookie Monster and a cookie so for
the cookie all you're going to need to
do is cut out a big circle out of
tagboard which you can get pretty much
anywhere and you're just going to cut
two of those and then with some brown
acrylic paint I'm just going to begin
painting my entire circle Brown for the
base of the cookie obviously so I'm
going to do that for both of the circles
and then once that's pretty much dry I'm
gonna be taking some black paint and I'm
just going to be creating the chocolate
chips so there's no precise way that I'm
doing this I'm literally just making a
bunch of circles all over the place or
ovals whatever you want to call them and
then once they are dry you're just gonna
take some brown fabric which you can get
at any craft store and then with just
some group glue I used fabric glue
you're going to begin gluing that onto
your cookie to make the shoulder straps
for your costume so I'm just doing that
on both sides and then I'm going to
attach them to the other side of the
other cookie but trying it on of course
make sure that the shoulder length or
strap length of your costume fits your
shoulders really well and it's at the
right length of your body for where you
want the cookie to sit and after that
you're done and all I did was wear some
black clothing underneath just a black
shirt from American Apparel and then
some black jeans now for the Cookie
Monster this one is so easy all I did
was I found this blue fluffy hat from a
costume shop super inexpensive and I'm
basically just gluing foam balls or
styrofoam balls on to at the hat and
those are going to be the eyes so this
is so easy you guys you can do this
literally the night before Halloween if
you want to and then I'm just taking the
black acrylic paint that I used before
and I'm just creating some eyeballs
making sure they are little at
off-centered because that's how Cookie
Monster's eyes look and then that's it
and then all I did was he just wore a
blue sweatshirt that he had and he was a
Cookie Monster and then together you're
the Cookie Monster and the cookie and I
think it's so cute
moving on to the kind of scarier costume
I'm gonna do something from Dexter which
is the television show on Showtime so
for the first costume this can be a guy
or a girl you don't have to be a girl to
do this because he kills both in the
show
I'm just wearing a nude slip which you
can get at any department store or you
might even have in your closet and I'm
just taking some cling wrap which you
can buy at a grocery store and I'm
basically just wrapping it around a
bunch of times around my body to kind of
create the look from the shell when he
kills people he wraps them in plastic so
you're kind of looking like one of the
victims in the show then with some fake
blood I'm just going to begin placing
that on the center of my body kind of
right below my boobs and I'm just
dripping some blood there and then to
make sure you don't get blood on
yourself or anyone else I'm just kind of
wrapping the cling wrap around the blood
and it gives a more realistic look and
it kind of looks like you're bleeding
through or wherever a Dexter killed you
so it looks I don't know I don't think I
just think it looks cool
and it's not easy your costume is done
now for Dexter all you need is a green
henley because that's kind of his iconic
look in the show and then i just
splattered some fake blood on Patrick's
face and he looks like a killer doesn't
he but that's it for the video today I
really hope you guys like it if you try
any of these out be sure to send me a
photo on any of my social media and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
