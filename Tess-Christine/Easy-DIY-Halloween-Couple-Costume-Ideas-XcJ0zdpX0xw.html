decided to do another DIY couples
costume video like we did last year
they're all super fun and really easy so
I really hope you guys find it helpful
and let's get started okay so starting
off with the first costume idea Patrick
and I were watching Willy Wonka and the
Chocolate Factory recently and thought
it would be a really fun couple costume
idea I also think what would look super
cool is if you did this with friends and
had someone else do you win a balloon
bah and it instantly becomes a group
costume and I think that would be really
cute too so the only DIY part of this is
the ticket so all you're gonna need is
some gold scrapbooking paper I got mine
at a craft store super inexpensive and I
just glued those two pieces together to
make a bigger ticket then with a pen or
pencil you're basically just going to go
on the top and the bottom part of the
ticket you're going to draw triangles
this is just gonna give it more of a
ticket like appearance I'm not doing
this perfect by any means it's just
Halloween but if you're a perfectionist
which I totally get you can make them a
little bit more perfect or fix them when
you cut them out so then you have your
ticket all ready to go and then with
this sheet of paper I'm just going to
basically trace a straight line this is
the part where I'm just copying the
ticket from a Google image so you can do
that exact same thing for the marker
that I'm using I'm just using a Sharpie
paint marker I found that it stayed but
I'm sure just a regular Sharpie would
work too
okay so after I have my lines mapped out
I'm going to write the big text golden
ticket this is the part where I really
recommend using a stencil I kind of ran
out of room if you don't really care you
can kind of just wing it like I did but
a stencil definitely helped you at this
point and then the rest of the details
I'm just copying from a Google image
then after that your golden ticket is
complete so how to hang it on your body
I am just taking some yarn and some
fabric glue and I'm basically just
gluing that onto the back of the ticket
on the horizontal part you can leave it
like this and lay it on your body
horizontal but I did two strings so I
could put it on myself vertically for
the rest of outfit I just wore a dress
and some lace-up shoes for the wonka
costume all we purchased was a top hat
and a purple bowtie although we did
forget a cane so make sure you don't
forget that the rest of the clothing a
guy should probably already have in his
wardrobe so you don't have to worry
about that and that's it I think it's a
really cute idea for a couple costume
really easy and like I said you can even
make it a group costume idea number two
is from the movie castaway with Tom
Hanks if you haven't seen it he's
stranded on an island and makes a
volleyball best friend named Wilson so I
think this is a really cute idea for a
couple costume you don't even have to be
a couple you can be best friends because
that's what they are in the movie so the
only DIY part of this is a Wilson so
what I did is I had Patrick dip his hand
in paint just cuz he has a bigger hand
than me and put it on a paper you can do
this on your actual white t-shirt if you
want to if you don't care that it gets
ruined
um but all you need to do is basically
just have a guy your dad you if you want
to do a handprint in red paint and then
with a sponge brush I just kind of went
over it to make it look really smudgy
because in the movie it's actually blood
so you could use fake blood I guess too
and then for this part I just traced out
the eyes nose and mouth I did go ahead
and go over it later with some paper
cutouts because this wasn't super
visible um so you can do that as well
and then all you have to do is cut it
out into a circle or an oval like in my
case that I did and put it on your shirt
so how I put it on my shirt is I just
safety pin it I think it would look good
if you did a huge version on a t-shirt
but if you don't want to ruin it and
you're kind of last-minute this is a
really great option for you and then for
my hair I just put some
you can put little twigs in there too if
you want to because he puts that in
Wilson's head eventually for like hair
and then from Patrick's costume all you
need is a FedEx envelope
since he is a FedEx employee if you've
seen the movie you understand and then a
really scraggly fake beard and then
that's it super easy and I think it's
really cute and funny I think people
would love it at a party okay so for
this last idea I actually got the idea
from one of my best friends she did it
with her boyfriend last year and I
thought it was so cute and clever
basically it's just you're struck by
lightning so he's a lightning bolt and
you're all disheveled from the lightning
strike it's just really cute and it's
really easy to do last-minute so all
you're gonna need is a yellow sheet of
tag board and all I did was basically
traced out a lightning bolt shape and
then I did a circle in the middle to put
over his head so like I said you're just
gonna trace out a lightning bolt I made
it the size of the tag board so what
would fit him really nicely and I'm just
cutting out that shape
so then all he has to do is just wear
black clothing and some sunglasses if
you want to place the lightning bolt
over his head and that's it so now for
my costume I just took an old gray shirt
and I basically just cut holes in it and
ripped it and then with some black
eyeshadow I just placed that around the
holes to make it look kind of like burnt
and fried so it doesn't look like your
clothes are just ripped it just makes it
look more like you got struck by
lightning and then for an umbrella just
get a cheap one and go scissors happy on
that and just cut it apart super easy
and the rest I just wear black jeans and
some converse and I also messed up my
hair a ton you can also put the black
stuff all over your face and that would
look really cool too and that's it I
think it's really fun and different and
I think you'll definitely stand out at a
party but that's it for the video today
I really hope you guys enjoyed it be
sure to give it a thumbs up if you did
and I will see you guys my next video
