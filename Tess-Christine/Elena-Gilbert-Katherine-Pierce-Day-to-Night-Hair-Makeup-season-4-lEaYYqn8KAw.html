title today's video is going to be the
start of my Vampire Diaries hair and
makeup videos a while back I uploaded a
video with my friends for season fives
outfits for their inner pair Diaries I
meant to get these hair and makeup
videos up sooner but it just didn't work
out that way so I hope you guys still
enjoy them today's video is going to be
Elena and Katherine I decided to combine
them and turn it into like a day to
night video day obviously being Elena
and night being Katherine the reason why
I chose to do this is because their
makeup as a whole is kind of similar
being met it is the same person but
Katherine's is a little bit darker which
I thought would be perfect for like a
night look and then Elena's for a day
and then same goes with their hair so I
thought it would be fun to kind of
combine them into one you don't need to
be a fan of the show to do this it's
very easy very simple and I really hope
you guys enjoy it my next video is I'm
going to do the rest of the girls so be
on the lookout for that and yeah I hope
you guys enjoy this video and let's get
started
starting out the latest makeup all that
I put on my face so far is some
concealer and foundation so what you
normally use is what you would start out
with this tutorial next I'm going to
contour my face now this specific
contouring kit that I have is definitely
on the pricier side but I did find that
it was what Nina Dobrev uses or her
makeup artist uses for either some of
her photo shoots or maybe even on
Vampire Diaries I'm not exactly sure but
I thought I would try it out it is a
concern it is a cream based consistency
so it's going to take a lot of blending
so all I'm doing is putting that on the
contours of my face so basically like
the three be focusing more underneath my
cheekbones because that's where she's
heavily contoured but I'm keeping this
very natural because it is Alana's look
so I'm basically just blending blending
blending until I like how it looks I am
satisfied with it I do think it's a
great product although it is on the
pricier side in my opinion so a bronzer
would work just as well I'm same with a
natural highlighter as well and now all
I'm doing is going back in it with a
brush I'm a clean brush and kind of
buffering that into my face to make sure
I don't have any harsh lines because it
is a cream consistency it's a little bit
difficult to work with
to finish off the basic face makeup I'm
just applying a light baby pink blush
the apples of my cheek keeping it very
light but also still noticeable so
throughout the four seasons of Vampire
Diaries I have noticed that Alana's
makeup tends to stay this kind of matte
brown color so what I'm doing is I'm
basically applying a matte brown shade
keeping it dark and I'm applying that
onto my lids Elena always has kind of
this darker Brown on her lids and kind
of lightly extends it up into her brow
bone
so what I'm doing now is I'm just taking
a lighter shade of brown and I'm placing
that into my crease to kind of
transition into my brow bone what I have
noticed for Alana's makeup is she does
keep it dark but focuses more on the
eyelids and into the crease instead of
more dark on the outer corners and up
into the crease like most makeup is so
how I'm going to achieve this is I'm
just taking an eyeshadow pencil brush
and I'm applying a black color very
lightly into the outer shape of my eyes
so I'm kind of just tracing along the
inner crease of my eyes and extending it
to connect with my eye lashes so
basically all this is going to do is
define your eyes a little bit more
without being too dark so instead of
applying you know like a black color all
over your lid it's just going to define
it a little bit more and give you that
Alena look so now to complete it all I'm
doing is dragging the rest of that color
onto my lower lash line to kind of
balance out my eye makeup look now Elena
never really goes with black on her eyes
like black eyeliner so I'm applying just
a basic brown color to define my eyes on
the top eyelash line and then with a
flat top shader brush I'm just going to
kind of smudge this out to give a more
natural and smokier effect for the eyes
and of course I'm going to curl my
eyelashes and apply some mascara now I
did read that for Vampire Diaries they
do use individual eyelashes to kind of
give that full effect that Elena and a
lot of the girl characters always have
so I'm applying a few false eyelashes
individual eyelashes to the outer
corners of my eyes to give that fluttery
yet full effect that Elena does have to
finish Alana's makeup I'm just going to
apply a matte lip color on this is the
closest I could find to match my lips to
Alana's and the reason why I chose matte
is because it never really looks like
she's wearing lipstick but she
definitely does have some color I don't
know if it's
natural lip color or what not but I just
chose this one by Rimmel to kind of
match mine to hers a little bit more so
now let's move on to the hair so all I
did was just start with my natural hair
texture which is kind of this wavy curly
type thing and I'm so excited because
Alena finally changed her hairstyle and
she's not straight anymore so I can
finally show you guys how to curl it so
all I'm doing is taking this curling
iron by Hot Tools it's a one inch or one
and a half inch I believe and I'm just
going to basically curl my hair this is
very very simple I don't need to go into
a full explanation for you guys but I'm
just taking about 1/2 inch sections and
I'm being super random with this and all
I'm doing is with the clamp I am just
curling my hair until it is basically
finished curled I just I found that this
size of a curling iron which is one one
and a half inch I believe those two
really don't matter you're still going
to achieve the same um makes for a
better Alayna curl once you you know
comb it out and what not I feel like he
gives that kind of natural wave texture
that she has but also still curls it
underneath so basically all I'm doing is
obviously layering my hair until I've
completed curling my entire head of hair
also I do want to say that I did use my
natural hair and you can use yours as
well I do recommend though if you have
curly err typed hair too maybe blow-dry
it out first and kind of straighten
those a little bit more so you get the
exact look that Alena has
so once I finished curling my hair I'm
not going to touch it hardly at all
because you want to make sure that the
curls are completely cooled before you
shake it out or do anything with it
because otherwise you're going to lose a
lot of the curl but in the meantime I'm
just going to give my hair a little bit
of teasing to add some extra volume so
I'm going to do that on the crown and
then on both of the sides of my head and
kind of style my bangs or what I have of
them how I like it
now I'm going to do is run my fingers
through my hair shake it out be very
gentle because you don't want to lose
all the curl but you can kind of shape
the curl and pull it out you know twist
it to how you like it and even how to
match hers
once you have it how you like it or how
you want to match it to Alana's you're
just going to spritz with hairspray and
then the look is complete so now I'm
going to move on to the night look which
is Catherine and I think this look is
super fun just a little bit darker and
the hair is a little bit curly err which
is always fun for nighttime so all we're
going to do for this makeup is I'm just
taking an eyeshadow pencil brush and I'm
applying some black into the corners of
my eyes into kind of a v-shape you can
be super messy with it because as you
can see now I'm taking a clean fluffy
brush and I'm just kind of buffing that
out and blending it in to get a nice
sultry smoky look which is what you want
for Catherine and of course I'm going to
add some black eyeliner to deepen look
even more and to finish it all off I'm
just going to apply a darker Mavi pink
color to my lips to give a sultry pouty
look that Katherine has and that
completes the makeup because that's all
that there really is that's super
different so now let's move on to the
hair since we are starting out with
already curled hair this part is going
to be really easy all I'm doing is I'm
taking this Conair curling wand it's
basically a wand that gets skinnier
towards the end and I'm curling random
sections of my hair around this I love
this one I think it gives the perfect
spiral that Katherine has I can get
achieve the look flawlessly I've used it
actually for years and I first did a
Katherine tutorial so I love it but all
I'm doing now is I'm parting my hair
down the middle to achieve a more exact
Katherine look and then curling the
sides to blend it in a little bit easier
because we did most of the work for the
day look this night part takes little to
no time which is why I thought it would
be perfect to combine it into a day to
night look lastly all I'm doing is
giving my hair a little bit more volume
by teasing it and the look is complete I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
thank you guys so so much for watching
and of course I will see you all in my
next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
