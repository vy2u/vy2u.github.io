celebrity inspired hair and makeup
tutorial but as you guys know from the
title you guys obviously know what I was
doing last night and that was watching
Vampire Diaries because if you tuned in
to watch last night's episode of Vampire
Diaries you would know what hair and
makeup this is from but it is from Elena
and if you missed out on the episode or
don't watch the show last night's
episode was an original vampire ball and
I thought her hair and makeup looked
absolutely gorgeous so I was sitting
there watching the episode I'm like I'm
so good at filming hair tutorial and
makeup tutorial for that tomorrow it's a
really fun hairstyle and I think that it
would be perfect even for prom and I
know that prom is coming up and I've
gotten a few requests to start prom hair
tutorials so I figured I would throw
this in because I think this is a really
fun hairstyle I guess I don't think I
would wear this and as an everyday
hairstyle but I think it's a very cute
and elegant hairstyle for something
formal you go to a dance maybe a nice
dinner or something like that this
hairstyle is very very pretty and it's
very easy to do and that's why when I
was watching it I was like that's
achievable and I know you guys can do it
so I decided to film it for you I really
hope you guys enjoy it so if you are
interested in seeing this hair and um
Alana's makeup please keep on watching
and I will see you guys in my next video
bye guys
to begin I'm priming my eyes using Mac's
painterly paint-pot and I'm just going
to spread this all over my lid as the
base next with a matte soft brown color
I'm going to be placing that just
directly onto my lids I'm also going to
be picking up an even light soft brown
color and placing that directly over
this all the exact colors that I'm using
I'm going to be putting in the
description box
next with an angled eyeshadow brush I'm
gonna be picking up a dark brown matte
color and I'm just going to be creating
an outer V with that angled brush now in
Alana's makeup she does have a very
defined outer B it's not so much blended
out it's more defined so that's why I'm
using an angled brush instead of just a
normal crease brush so again I'm just
going to focus that on the outer corner
of my eye using that dark brown color
next with a crease brush I'm just going
to slightly blend that out a little bit
you don't want to blend it too much
because you still want the definition of
the V to be noticeable just not as harsh
so I'm going to blend that directly
around where I placed it and in my
crease next with a matte champagne color
I'm just going to be focusing this on my
brow bone as a highlight and blending
out any more harsh lines that I have
from the brown that I placed next with a
pencil brush I'm just going to be taking
that same matte brown color and I'm
going to be placing that on my lower
lash line next with an eyeliner I'm
going to place a very thin small line on
my upper lash line
and then next with a flattop I shadow
brush I'm just going to be smudging that
eyeliner into my lash line just to give
more of a natural look next I'm going to
curl my eyelashes in preparation for
false eyelashes now this is optional but
Alena is definitely wearing them in the
show and I'm just using dummy eyelashes
that I bought at Target and I'm just
going to be placing that on my upper
lash line next with mascara I'm just
going to coat my top lashes and bottom
lashes with these mascaras just to blend
my eyelashes with the false eyelashes a
little bit more so the two mascaras I'm
using our cover girl lash blush and NYC
high definition mascara next with AB
Revlon lip butter this is in sugar plum
I'm just going to be placing this
directly onto my lips
Alena does have a dark color on her lips
a dark maroon color but it's not very
harsh so that's why I feel a breath or
lip butter is perfect for this look and
then to make the look a look a little
bit more natural I'm just going to blend
it out with my finger a little bit more
now that is the completed makeup I
really hope you guys liked it and now
time for hair for this hair look I'm
starting out with second day hair your
hair does not have to be straight for
this look it just has to be workable to
curl so I'm going to begin by curling
the side of my hair that I'm going to be
pinning back so whichever side you are
gathering your hair start curling the
opposite first this is just going to be
in preparation to pin back and you don't
want to have to over curl your hair so
what's being pinned back doesn't
necessarily have to be curled so I'm
just focusing on curling this one
section of my hair so that part is looks
curled once it's pinned back and the
curling one I'm using is the Conner
infinity so I'm going to take that those
strands that I just started to curl and
I'm just going to pin those back with
bobby pins
now to begin gathering my hair to one
side of my head I'm just going to gently
twist and pin as I work so I'm just
going to twist it up over the bobby pin
and then pin and I'm going to repeat
this process until I get to the other
side of my head so as you can see I'm
working the bobby pins one by one and
then taking sections of hair and
wrapping it over in kind of a twist like
effect so once I've gotten my hair onto
one side I'm going to start from the
back and start curling with the Conner
infinity wand away from my face and I'm
basically just going to do the same
curling process until I curl that whole
section of my head
once you get to the top section of your
head make sure that you continue to curl
the strand all the way up to the root
because you want to make sure that the
curls are noticeable all the way up
there instead of just at the ends
because Elena's hair is very curly all
the way to the top of her head so just
make sure that you're focusing on that
as well next once you finish curling
your hair you're just going to finish
with some hair spray the hairspray that
I'm using is gone your forties hair
spray now once you're finished with that
the hair look is complete and that is it
for this video I really hope you liked
this Elena Gilbert inspired hair and
makeup video from the originals ball I
really hope you liked it let me know
what you think in the comments below and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
