an empties video and as you guys can
tell by the title that means products
that I've used up I decided to make this
empties video obviously products that
I've used up but products that I would
repurchase because I find these videos
really helpful because you see all these
reviews and people using all these
products but like I don't know I like
finding out if they actually are worth
buying like if people actually use them
up like that's awesome so I love
watching these so I thought it would
make them for you guys also before we
get into the video I wanted to let you
guys know that I am going to be
uploading videos on PopSugar girls guide
it's a channel here on YouTube it's
great I love it and I'm excited that I'm
gonna be uploading some more videos on
there I'm gonna be doing kind of double
the video so I'm still gonna be
uploading on my channel but I'm gonna be
doing a video kind of like once a month
on their channel they're pretty much all
the mini fashion videos and the video
that's up right now is a fashion video
that Patrick and I filmed it's a fall
outfit video it's three fall outfits
styled around a basic pair of black
booties it was super fun to film and I
really was happy with how the video
turned out so if you want to go see that
check it out on PopSugar Girl's Guide
I'll be responding to comments on there
as well definitely subscribe to their
channel if you want to see more videos
from me because I'll be uploading there
too so yeah I'm just gonna jump right
into it I have a huge bag of goodies so
the first product that I've used to the
end is this hairspray it's the Guardian
forties flexible control anti-humidity
hairspray I really like this stuff a lot
I find that it doesn't make your hair
crusty or sticky and I really look for
that in hairspray because I tend to be a
little not indecisive but when I spray
hairspray I like to be able to still
move my hair like it gets the job done
with keeping it where I want it to be
but if I need to move it in anyway like
it's not like yeah it came through my
hair trying to get this hairspray out so
I really like this stuff a lot the next
product daiquiri purchase is the Sonia
Kashuk eye makeup remover I repurchase
this so many times you can buy this at
Target I love it it takes my makeup off
really nicely it's super smooth
it's not really really oily and it
doesn't burn your eyes or anything crazy
like that so I really like it does the
job for me and I just kind of always go
to it when I need a new eye makeup
remover the next is a hair product and
I've used this up and repurchased it
once already but it lasts a while that's
why I only repurchased it once but it's
it's a 10 miracle leave-in plus keratin
um like hair conditioning thing I don't
know I use it when I get out of the
shower in my hair is wet too damp I will
spray this in and comb through my hair
and it's really good because I've been
dyeing my hair a lot if you've noticed I
dyed it red like last November and since
then I've been trying to get it out and
get it back to my natural hair color and
it's just kind of been a process so my
hair has been through a ton so I've been
trying to buy products that help it and
kind of are trying to make my hair
stronger and healthy and smooth again so
this I found that I really like and it
helps my hair a lot the next thing that
I repurchase
is makeup or a makeup product and it's
this Laura Laura Mercier translucent
powder I purchased this this is the
second one I purchased but the reason
why I've only bought this like for a
second time is because it laughs
seriously forever it's just a
translucent powder that I use to set all
of my foundation and whatever I put on
my face I set it with this I really
really like it I think it's like 35
bucks so it's kind of pricey but like I
said this has lasted me probably like
the first one I ever bought last to me
honestly like a year like you only need
a little bit obviously to set your whole
face and like the amount you get in here
is just massive so it'll last you a
really long time if you're looking for a
good setting powder I really do enjoy
this stuff the next one is another
makeup product and it is benefits the
poor professional pro bone to minimize
the appearance of pores and I really
like this stuff
I've been using it kind of as like a
primer I kind of stopped using a primer
for a while I just felt like it was
unnecessary and I just got kind of lazy
and I forgot about it but this really
does make a difference especially for me
because
I get a lot of pores on my t-zone like
through here I have really large pores
so this helps out it just kind of smooth
this out your face and acts as kind of
like a nice space for your foundation
the next two things are mascara and I've
used these up probably two or three
times now I always grab for these two
mascaras this one is the benefit to
their real mascara I really like this
stuff the only thing that I dislike
about this stuff is the fact that it's
really difficult to get off my lashes
like I feel like I have to go through
that eye makeup remover like twice with
the pad like with like a cotton pad I
have to go over it like so many times
just to give this much scare off but the
benefit to this is that it really really
does make your lashes like super full
and big and I really like it I think
it's worth the extra time that takes
that it takes to take it off whoa that
was a lot of Tanks and then this stuff I
used for so long and I really liked it
it's the Maybelline falsies mascara this
one is in black drama the next thing is
a concealer palette and this one is the
Sonia Kashuk one from Target it's a for
concealer palette one is a powder that I
don't touch that often but these ones I
really like I tend to go more for the
green one if anything like I really
really like the green concealer for any
blemishes redness that you have this is
like the perfect color green and it just
covers it up so well and it's not a
super noticeable green either like it's
just awesome and I repurchase this so
many times mostly just for the green
color like I wish they made it
separately the next is a bronzer and I
really really love this bronzer I prefer
just it a punch and I found it in a
bunch of obviously but it is a hoola
benefit bronzer what I like about it is
it's not shimmery like it doesn't like
make your face look like a disco ball
and that's kind of hard sometimes to
find in bronzers but what I like this in
specific for is contouring obviously
with my cheeks I'm the 3b stuff this
this is perfect for it and it lasts a
really really long time
plus the brushes that they give you in
these are perfect for contouring
I've been using them now instead of like
buying your own contouring brush the
brushes that they give you are like
straight and they just make like a
perfect angle to do the whole contouring
process the next thing is another makeup
product and it is an eye primer or what
I use it for it's Mac's Paint Pot in the
color painterly and is a perfect primer
for your lids it goes on super smooth
honestly I've used this up until it's
like dried out I've had it for years I
want to save had this for like a year
and a half at least and this is the only
one I bought because you don't need that
much of it when you're priming your eyes
and they give you like a huge pot of it
so like it lasts for a while it's
perfect
to kind of put over your lids and makes
like a clean pallet for any eyeshadow
look you want to do the next is for your
skin and it's this I haven't emptied
this but that's because I threw away the
empty and bought a new one already but
it's the clean and clear advantage acne
spot treatment I've talked about this in
so many videos I can't express you guys
how well this works all you do is you
put it on a pimple that you have and you
put it over there and it kind of stings
a little bit but that means it's working
and it goes away within seconds but it
works so well like overnight you'll I
like put this on if I have a spot on
anywhere in my face I'll put this on go
to sleep wake up and the blemish pimple
whatever you want to call it has
significantly decreased this stuff is
awesome and I've empty this probably two
three times the next thing that I've
used up our eyelashes these are the
Ardell individual lashes I really like
these a lot they're perfect for whenever
I want just kind of like an extra boost
on my lashes like all I have to do is
apply like three or four on the outer
half of my eyelashes and it just makes
such a difference and it's so easy once
you get the hang of it now trust me I've
had to practice a lot with individual
lashes but they're awesome I love
I've emptied so many of these like
whether it's a video that I'm doing or
it's like going out at night or it's
something that I have to get a little
bit nicer for I always grab these they
really do make a huge difference with
your lashes the next thing is a nail
polish it's by Essie and it's called
good to go and it's a fast drying top
coat I've gone through three or four of
these with my roommates we put them out
in our living room in this huge nail
polish bucket so we all caner nails we
sound like such girls but whatever we
have them all out there and we all paint
our nails and this is the top coat that
we all like to use because it dries
within seconds the last thing that I've
emptied is a hair product and it's this
and it's Tresemme thermal creations eat
tamer spray I really do feel like it
protects my hair now I don't know for
sure but I'm pretty sure it does and
it's pretty inexpensive instead of some
of like the more higher-end
heat sprays this stuff is good and I
feel like it works the same so that is
all my empties I really hope this video
helped you guys out find any new
products that you want to try and I
really hope that if you do try them that
you like them as much as I do because I
wouldn't every purchased them a bunch of
times and MGM and feed them like that if
I didn't love them so I hope you guys
give them a try stay tuned because I
have a bunch of Halloween videos coming
up and yeah I hope you all have a
wonderful day and I will see you guys
next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
