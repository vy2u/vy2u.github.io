channel today's video is going to be a
beauty and fashion haul and I always
kind of do these at the start of every
new season so being that it is
officially fall I'm going to do one for
you guys I don't have like a bunch of
fall themed stuff I guess like the
fashion stuff would be I guess included
in that but I don't have like a bunch of
fall candles or anything like that yet
which is actually really sad because
it's gonna be November here before you
know it but anyways so first we're going
to start off with beauty products more
specifically skincare because over the
past I would say few months I've been
really getting into skincare products
more so than I ever have been before
because my skin and I have been having a
battle for over a year now so finding
new products that really work is really
important for me so I've been buying a
lot of that also I should mention that a
lot of these products are kind of like
my first thoughts like I've used them a
couple times before they're not in like
a favourites video because I haven't had
them for that long but they're kind of
like like I said my first thoughts so so
the first product is one from Maddie
skincare and cosmetics and it's the
cucumber toner and I had hadn't been
using a toner in my skincare routine in
such a long time and I hadn't I've known
it's very important so I really wanted
to get back into it and I've always
noticed my skin reacts well to cucumber
anything cucumber infused it doesn't go
crazy doesn't break out not sensitive to
it so I tend to steer towards those
products so when I saw the cucumber
toner I definitely wanted to try it try
it out the next product is from Clarins
and I'm actually working with them on
this so they sent me this little box and
inside has these things called boosters
and basically there's three of them
there's the Repair energy and detox so
when I opened up the package I initially
grabbed the repair one you guys know
that I'm constantly outside filming I'm
exposed to a bunch of different climates
because I travel a lot New York the
weather is so crazy plus the pollution
it's just my skin can really take a
beating when it comes to being outside
going in and out doors places traveling
on airplanes is like the worst so my
skin can become really dry and irritated
and just overall like I
said in the beginning of the video how
my skin has just been having this like
battle back and forth with me
I need the repair booster so much so
this stuff I'm really excited to try out
more because it's just awesome so what
you do is you unscrew the cap and it's
got a little drop leg and you're
supposed to mix it into your moisturizer
so I just put my moisturizer in my hand
and do a couple drops in there mix it up
and put it onto my face it feels really
good it smells really good so it's
definitely a product that I think is
going to be an essential for me so like
I said and really excited to keep using
it the next skincare product is one from
Renee raloo skincare and basically what
this is is an anti cyst treatment now
you're probably thinking what the heck's
unless you've gotten these so I don't
know if you ever suffer from breakouts
that are like really deep underneath the
skin they take forever to go away and
they're just annoying so I've been
searching for something to have like a
spot treatment for it because just
regular over-the-counter spot treatments
don't work so I did my research and
online I found some great reviews on
this and like I said I've been using it
a couple times and I've noticed a few of
them take a little bit less time to go
away but like I said I'll keep you
updated next up from Sephora I bought
some sheet masks and these are the
pharmacy sheet masks I've been trying so
many sheet masks lately because I love
them for when I get off the plane or
just in general because I just think
they feel really nice and they're so
easy instead of applying like a cream
mask or something like that you just
like throw it on there look a little
scary for a while and then it's good to
go
but these are awesome these I've been
favoring so I went up and I picked up
some more I got the oil control one and
then the deep moisture one and lastly
for beauty products are - what makeup
products one is a pallet and I'm really
excited about this this one actually is
probably only product I haven't tried
out beforehand but when I saw the colors
I just had to I was like I love it so
much so it's the Anastasia master
palette by Mario and I'm so excited the
colors you guys kind of look
the Kiley um hi shadow palette which I
wanted to get and I just like couldn't
wait for it which is going to but I'm
going to talk about my next product but
you'll see so the colors in this are
just like perfect it has this like
orange one which is called Isabel that's
like I really want to try out there just
like my colors in a palette like all the
colors I will ever use on my eye are
there so I think this is going to become
one of my staples and I'm really excited
about it and the last beauty product is
what I was referring to with the whole
Kylie thing and it is a liquid lipstick
and I've been trying to find not dupes
but other liquid lipsticks I like just
as much as Kylie lip kits because I just
can't do that whole ordering online
Fiasco again so I found this one it's by
Kat Von D and the color is bow and arrow
I'm wearing it on my lips now and I just
love it I think I'm gonna keep hauling
this for the rest of my life because
it's a really really good color and
honestly it's less drying than her lip
kit so now moving on to fashion so the
first place I bought stuff on and you
already know ASOS is like one of my
favorite stores so do you remember those
jean shorts that I wore pretty much all
summer yeah well I found the pants
version and you guys have seen these in
videos already but I literally just
bought them and I wear them so often
it's ridiculous but they're from ASOS
there's mom jeans
I'll have them linked below they're just
great and that's all I really have to
say next up is a pantsuit kind of it's I
don't even know how do you describe
these but I love these for the fall
because they're so easy this one looks
like this it's kind of this greenish
gray color got off of a Sousa Brandis
River Island I really like it because I
can wear boots with it I can layer it
with jackets like I said it's just one
of those really great pieces that when
you don't know what to wear you can just
throw it on and you have yourself a bomb
looking outfit next up I have stuff from
revolt and I love myself some revolve
although it is can be very pricey so you
have to get stuff that you know you're
going to wear a lot and that's going to
be worth it so for me I wanted to get a
fall colored dress that I can wear and
dress different ways so this one I loved
because I love
color for the fall it's like this
mustard yellow color by the brand
Tularosa which is one of my favorites um
and has like these crochet inserts here
and I like I said I just love it I can
rock it with a jacket some boots uh and
the other thing is a sweater and I'm
really excited about this one because I
love this one you guys saw this in my
last video and/or my last fall video and
it's basically just like a turtleneck
sweater it's white and it's so comfy and
so warm I've already worn this like
probably three times and I literally got
it like last week earlier last week next
up we have Topshop and I only got a
couple things and they're kind of fall
things I don't know one's a bodysuit and
it looks like this I love body suits
because easy is key for me like if it
can be easy and look super like trendy
and cute and you can wear a bunch of
different ways I love it um but I
absolutely love it I love the red color
it's kind of like the perfect fall color
the other thing is a blouse and it looks
like this it's just a basic white blouse
but why I like wearing these is fall and
winter can be kind of annoying when it
comes to dressing I'm just wearing
outfits because you are so bundled up
outside but when you get inside it can
be a little bit warm so shirts like that
are awesome because like I said you can
layer them really easily next up from
Lulu's I got a bomber jacket you know me
and bombers but I really liked this one
I like this one in specific because it's
oversized and like I said in my fall
jackets video oversize is awesome
because you can layer it really well and
you can just wear it with a bunch of
different things so having this color
first of all you know it's fall when
girls bring out this color but like if
the legit colors and the last thing from
Lulu's are these boots and they're
basically like kind of like soft booties
but they're black and they're leather
and they're mass and they go with
everything and that's really all I have
to say I'm repeating myself with every
one of these items but I got these a
couple weeks ago and I've already worn
him a ton so I wanted to include them in
this haul video because I like couldn't
wait to film this before I already bore
all this stuff so don't kill me
and lastly for clothing
is a dress and it's a sweater dress and
it's inside-out so that's cool but it's
a turtleneck dress it looks like this
I'm just gonna show it to you guys
inside out oh my god it's great to layer
and it just it fits really well it's
comfy and cozy and just fall everything
and I think it would look really good
with like a dark burgundy lip oh and the
last two things our accessories the
first one being this hat I don't even
know what style of hat this is called
but it's just something that actually
bought a while ago but I wanted to
feature it in the haul video because I
think everyone should get one because I
love styling these I think they look so
cute so if I wouldn't have already
bought it I would have bought it for
this haul video because it's amazing and
the last thing are my glasses
yay okay so I've been getting so many
questions not only on YouTube but on
Instagram about my glasses and you guys
remember my ASOS glasses I wore those
all the time and I actually went home in
August and ended up needing real glasses
ironic so I got a prescription and I
went in and I wanted to invest in some
good frames because you know if you wear
glasses that um lenses are expensive so
you want to put them in quality frames
so they don't break and you don't have
to buy them again fingers cross um so I
like to Garrett Lite and I got these
ones they are the Wilson frames for
those asking I love them so much I just
feel like I should always just I was
meant to wear glasses I just feel good
in them so yay but that is it for my
haul video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did be sure to give it
a thumbs up and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
