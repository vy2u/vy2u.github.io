be an outside of the week video
basically I just show you guys outfits
that I wore through a whole week and I
hope you guys get some fashion
inspiration from it so let's go ahead
and get started okay so starting off
with Monday I thought Oh keep it simple
and cozy by wearing it this sweater
dress from Lulu's it's super soft super
awesome for Monday because it's super
easy to style so all I did was wear some
over the knee boots from Stuart Weitzman
and a lace choker from Vanessa movie for
Tuesday's look I wore my new favorite
jeans which are from Lulu I love the
lace-up detailing in the front I just
think it's really different and so with
that I wore just a basic white sweater
from Revolt and my go-to fall booties
from Lulu's for Wednesday's look I had
to incorporate another sweater it's just
like perfect weather outside for it so I
wear this one from Lulu's it's like a
rough one and then I wore it with a
suede skirt from Nasty Gal
some the same Lulu's booties and a
rag-and-bone hat Thursday I decided to
rock another sweater dress I love
sweater dresses especially for the
weather right now because they're so
comfortable this one is a mustard color
from Lulu's and I love it and then I
were the same booties and then just a bo
Joker from revolve Friday's outfit
consists of two of my favorite things in
the fall time and that's high-waisted
denim chains and body suits so starting
with the jeans those are from Lulu's
they're super stretchy and comfortable I
belt it on with a belt from Urban
Outfitters and then wore the same
rag-and-bone hat and a bodysuit from
Topshop Saturday's outfit was one of my
favorites
I love the coat again that I'm wearing
that's from Lulu's it's so comfy and
warm I wore it with a grey tank top from
Topshop and then in my hat which I love
styling now especially for the fall is
from shop bomb and then for Sunday's
look I just kept it very simple I just
wore some basic denim jeans from ASOS a
top from American Apparel gotta have my
converse since I've been rocking heels
the whole week and then an oversized a
bomber jacket from Lulu's which I love
because you can just throw it on over
anything

really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
