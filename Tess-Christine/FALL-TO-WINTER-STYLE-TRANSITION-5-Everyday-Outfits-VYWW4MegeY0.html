channel in today's video is going to be
a styling video yay you guys know these
are my favorites so of course I have to
do one because it's now winter and it's
part of the reason why I love living in
a place with all different seasons
because I love dressing differently
throughout the year and seasons make you
do that so I'm really excited to show
you guys this video because it's kind of
like a fall to winter outfit transition
video and I know fall is long gone but
right now in New York this is stuff
that's like perfect for it depending on
your tolerance with cold dressing
obviously depends I like to layer
sweaters and jackets and I really tried
to stylize it for you guys so you really
got something out of this video and
remember as always like every year I
always do a snow cold weather below
freezing outfit video for you guys so I
know most of these outfits if I was
trucking around in the snow I wouldn't
be able to wear my cute booties I think
some of you guys forget that I grew up
in Wisconsin Minnesota and it's freezing
six months out of the entire year so I
feel your pain and I always wait until
it's snowing to film this video but I'm
going home for a long time over the
holidays so I think I'm in a film of
freezing outfit video I read what to
wear when it's cold when I'm there so
please don't leave in the comments about
how all these outfits are useful or not
useful whoa okay but I hope you can
still modify them they're super cute and
I really like them so I hope you guys do
too so without further ado let's get
started in the video
okay so starting off with this first
outfit I took two pieces from my fall
wardrobe that I absolutely loved I think
they were my favorites it was this
sweater that I'm wearing from ASOS I
love the colors in it I love the stripes
I just think it's so fun to layer and it
kind of makes your outfit a little bit
different than just like a plain sweater
and then the other thing where my brown
booties from forever 21 um these are
amazing they were so affordable and they
have the sock light type style that I
know is really sought after right now
but they add a little extra warmth on
your ankles there which I think are
awesome you can layer them with socks
like big chunky socks I think would look
so cute um and then moving on to my
jeans and those are just ones from
Levi's I'm pretty sure just your basic
blue jeans and then the real kicker here
is the jacket and that I bought from
Moon River and I absolutely love it I
will link it below it is so warm I think
I am going to feature it in my cold
video because it's not warm it's just so
comfy
for this next outfit this looks a little
bit deceiving because it looks like it's
not as warm as it actually is so far my
pants those are from Zara they're like a
leather legging but they are a little
bit thicker than a normal legging which
is crucial for the winter so that's why
I wanted to feature them with this look
and then for my shoes I just wore some
basic black booties from Steve Madden
they're like my go-to when it's not
snowing and then for my sweater that was
also featured in my favorites video
that's just a gray sweater from Elliot
and I love it it's great to layer and
then my favorite thing is the velvet
bomber jacket from ASOS it might not
look like you did but it is padded it is
warm I've worn this thing so much
already I think it's my most worn jacket
coat out of this whole video I love it
but I think this look would also look
amazing with like a little pom-pom hat
and a scarf like I said it all depends
on the weather so you can kind of style
it however you want
this next look I love because of the
simple pieces that it incorporates
starting off with the jeans jeans are
just kind of something that I think
everybody just kind of throws on
especially in the fall and the winter
time they're just just super easy you
can style any outfit with them they're
just great so I wanted to feature these
because embroidery is a huge trend right
now I bought mine jeans that I'm wearing
now from blank NYC and I just think
embroidery is a great way to kind of add
a flair to your outfit and make just
like a sweater and jeans look way
different and help you stand out even if
it's just a little accent I just think
it looks so good so how I styled those
is I just wore a big white knit sweater
from revolve love it it's super chunky
and like warm again you can layer stuff
underneath it I absolutely love it and
then for my jacket I bought that last
year at from ASOS I love the color and
the like shearling stuff on it I just
think that that style of coat is awesome
and then of course I just wore my black
booties from Steve Madden
next for this one I think this one is
very a winter looking just because of
the colors in the actual outfit the
Blues the Browns the black everything is
just kind of screams winter so I love
this one specifically because of the
coat that is again from Moon River I
love their coats I just think they're so
different looking and they still provide
warmth which is huge and I just think
they look so cute I love the print on it
and how it has the fur throughout it I
just think it looks really good um so
how I saw that is again with a sweater
kind of the trend here but it's like my
biggest tip for you is just a layer
layer layer in the winter and you won't
sacrifice your style so I wore that
sweater which is from JOA and then with
it I just wore some girlfriend denim
jeans and without holes and on because
trust me that one provides an extra
warmth for you and then for my belt I
just belted that from with a belt from
Urban Outfitters and then for my shoes
those are from Frye but I'd probably
replace them with some combat boots or
something a little bit more sturdy if it
were to be snowing
and lastly I had to include one that's a
little bit more dressy this is something
that you can wear not just like
day-to-day but something if you have
somewhere nice to go it looks a little
bit more put together but it still keeps
you warm so starting out with my sweater
slash shirt combo it's like connected
that's from ASOS I think it's really
cool it adds a different kind of flare
to just a normal sweater and a
turtleneck is key I'm pretty sure I wear
a turtleneck in all of these looks so a
huge bonus and then for my jacket that
is I can't remember where that's from
but I think it's from rag-and-bone I
bought it a long time ago in a sample
sale but any type of long line coat or
anything that's like longer and wool
will keep you super warm and then for my
jeans those are just some black jeans
from Paige denim and then I decided to
add a little bit of flare to it and wear
this hat which is from shop Bob you guys
have seen it before and that's another
one that I pulled from my fall outfit
video and then for my shoes I just wore
some fun tan booties from Kendall and
Kylie but like I said I'd replace those
heels girl with something else if it
were snowing but that's it for my video
today I really hope you guys enjoyed it
if you did give it a thumbs up let me
know in the comments below if you guys
had a favorite outfit stay tuned because
I have a holiday party outfit video
coming soon and of course one for the
snow so be on the lookout for those and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
