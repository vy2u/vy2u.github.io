channel today's video is going to be a
clothing haul and I've done means plenty
of times in my channel so you know what
to expect so let's just get started okay
this first one is a new one for me and
it's princess Polly and I'm really
excited about this because I found some
really awesome staple wardrobe pieces
for full transition transitioning into
winter they have some awesome brands on
their site so I'm really excited to
continue shopping on there because it's
awesome so the first thing I found was
the brand I am gia and they have some
really unique really cool edgy things
that I really like so the first thing is
a jacket it looks like this it's like a
big fluffy teddy bear coat my dream coat
definitely something that you can layer
is super oversized so for the winter
this is gonna be great because I can
just like stack on a bunch of sweaters
underneath this but if it's a little bit
of a chilly or fall day which is kind of
getting out side now I live in New York
you guys know that and it's finally
getting cold I feel like everywhere it
just took forever to become fall weather
and it's finally that way now so I can
find where sweaters so the next thing
from princess Polly are a pair of
leather hands and I'm really excited
because these are really cool and I'm
definitely a little out of my comfort
zone from what I would probably normally
wear but I was looking for them
especially for the fall and winter
because I think these look really good
with sweaters they have the edgy part of
it is not necessarily as a leather but
the details and the hardware on it like
the zips and the lakes up I just think
they look super cool again they're by
the brand I am Gia
but I just absolutely love leather pants
and I just think that they make an
outfit stand out a little bit more
instead of just like regular black pants
so I definitely wanted to get a pair
because I was in need for some believe
it or not so then the next thing is a
sweater and it's not just a typical
sweater it's a little unique which is
why it caught my eye on the website it
looks like this it has like cutout
details here which I just think it makes
it look super unique again kind of
throwing a little spin on your normal
sweater that looks really cool with
jeans
really excited I found this because this
one will also be really good to layer
because it has the detail here that
makes it stand out so then the last two
things from princess Polly are
accessories so the first is a belt it
looks like this it's a leopard printed
belt and I was looking for something
just like this you know it's kind of
like my motto where I'm like throw
something into an outfit or like a
simple outfit that makes it like stand
out I feel like anything pattern or
something like this that you can just
add to an outfit even with what I'm
wearing now and just makes it look so
cool would it be one of my clothing
hauls if I didn't feature one of these
caps I mean seriously
these large caps or whatever I still
haven't gotten over this trend I
absolutely love it Pat steals a lot of
my hats if you follow him on Instagram
you notice that he wears a lot of them
too so we kind of share these and these
are freaking cool I love them this one
is like an olive green color which I
don't have so that's it from princess
Polly absolutely love that store and
since I'm teaming up with them I will
have a discount code for you guys in the
description box below so then the next
door is one of my faves you guys know at
Urban Outfitters I got a few things that
I absolutely love one in particular you
guys are asking me a bunch on my
Instagram but first let's start out with
something pretty simple and
self-explanatory and that is a gray
turtleneck it's a great turtleneck it's
but it's good I love these kind of
things I always buy stuff like this for
fall and winter because they're great
layering things because you can wear
them like cool jackets and things like
that this one's a little cropped which
is great because I always are
high-waisted jeans so adding a belt to
this makes your outfit lip balm and
simple and then the last two things I'm
Urban are a pair of pants both two pairs
pants one that I'm really excited about
and that is black denim jeans this might
seem really stupid that I'm like so
excited about something so simple but I
was looking for kind of like these faded
almost like vintage wash black denim
high-waisted jeans for a while now I
found a few places they just were super
overpriced and I wasn't into it these
I'm not even kidding you are the
comfiest I want them in all shades of
denim and then the second pair
pants I wore to the apple orchard which
I posted on my Instagram and a lot of
you guys are asking me where these pants
were from and they're from urban they
look like this they're just you know
your basic plaid pants love them they
flare out at the ends I just think
they're just a really cool piece and I
don't own anything like it which is so
surprising for how many times I feature
clothing on this channel and do calls I
don't have anything like this so I was
really excited do find this they're
really comfy what's actually really
unique about them as they have a fleece
inside which is so nice and perfect for
colder weather so thumbs up what would
it be a holic I didn't feature ASOS I'm
not entirely sure either but I have a
ton of stuff from ASOS and one new thing
that I have never shopped on before on
ASOS which is kind of weird because I
live on that site but that is Asus
market place and it's basically a place
where you think people can sell like
vintage things kind of like an etsy I'm
not entirely sure but it was really cool
so I found some things I absolutely love
the first one being a jacket I was a
little hesitant to put this in a haul
because it's not necessarily something I
can link because since it is vintage
there's usually only like one available
but I definitely wanted to like bring up
the market place because I think it'd be
a cool place to shop if you like vintage
finds or jackets that look worn because
that's my jam so this jacket definitely
looks like it's been worn which I love
it's just this like dark brown color
it's got a really unique cut about it
too you guys will see when I try it on
but I absolutely love it this is
something that I'm really really excited
to continue wearing throughout the fall
and winter and then the next thing from
ASOS marketplace art another two
accessories a belt the first one it
looks like this I love these type of
belts I think I featured it in a couple
of clothing hauls ago I found one from
Lulu's that I really like this one
definitely has more of a vintage feel to
it kind of reminds me of like a Chanel
style chain belt but this one again was
super inexpensive this vintage looking
it's definitely someone's worn this it's
wear and tear but I love that I just
wish
I had better look actually going into
vintage stores so when I found a those
marketplace it was like my dream come
true so love this these are kind of all
over the place for fall and winter but
this one is a leather beret so I
definitely think it has a unique
appearance to it it definitely looks
different when it's on I absolutely love
it I just think it's so cool so chic and
I'm really really excited to style it
this is actually one of the things I
haven't worn yet which is surprising for
a haul because I just get too excited
now onto regular ASOS the first thing is
the sweater and pull the wrong anchor I
love sweaters like this especially for
fall on winter this one I just think is
super unique because of the fringe but
more importantly I liked the colors it
has like this mauve color to it black
and white fringe and then this like
neutral base of the sweater tuck this in
to some high-waisted denim jeans with
like a cool belt you might not even need
a belt and it's just easy and that's why
I fall in winter hauls are my favorite
because it's just a bunch of fun
sweaters to jacket which is my favorite
thing to buy so then the next thing is
this it is a dress and I just think it's
so cute kind of looks like overalls but
it's not it's got this like pinstripe
detail to it and then on the front it's
unzips the straps are really cool
because they have these little like this
hardware that like connects it I just
think it's a really unique piece and
what I like to do with these and why I'm
buying it in the fall slash wintertime
is because I think these look really
good with sweaters or tights layered
underneath it could wear a really cool
jacket and I just think it's really cute
and something different than just like
wearing sweaters and jeans all day
because I definitely do that but this
kind of adds something different to your
wardrobe okay so that wasn't my last
thing from ASOS but I did want to
mention because I noticed a lot of my
Instagram comments over the past weekend
when I was in Vancouver I had to dress a
little bit nicer and this desk doesn't
necessarily fall into like fall or
winter but they're really cute pieces
that I thought I would share so I got a
lot of questions on them they're both by
the brands
and but they're sold on ASOS so you can
get them on the actual site too but that
I purchased them off of ASOS what is a
black lace top that I just wear like a
black bando underneath it this looks
really cute dress down with some denim
jeans and then the other is this dress
and I'm just gonna insert photos of me
wearing it because it's just the same as
trying it on but um this dress is like
this velvety material it's purple I
think this would look really cute for
the holidays which is why I'm kind of
mentioning it anyways but I got a lot of
compliments on it and a lot of people
we're asking you about it as well as you
guys so I thought I would include it in
the hall and I quickly before I go I
wanted to mention some accessories you
know I'm a huge fan of like gold dainty
jewelry and I recently found this brand
five and two on Instagram and I'm
obsessed with their jewelry it's so nice
and it's like all my favorite kind of
like dainty small gold pieces so I got a
lot of necklaces and I wanted to show
you guys so I'll have like insert
cutaways of my favorites I'm wearing
some on my neck now so I'll show you
guys that in a second but I definitely
wanted to give him a shout out because I
love when I find solid gold jewelry you
guys know when I mentioned Maria Pascal
she was like one of my favorite she
still is and then I found this one which
I loved so I will have all of the pieces
that I have it linked below but that is
it for my haul today I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and found some
inspiration whether you guys are
shopping online or pulling from your own
closet to figure out what I'm styling
for these next couple seasons be sure to
follow me on Instagram I always post all
my outfit photos on there probably
before you see it here so yeah I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
