Halloween tutorial I got so many
requests to do this but there are so
many fairy tutorials on YouTube so I
decided to think of something that
wasn't super intricate because I wanted
to make this as achievable for you guys
as I could so I hope you enjoy starting
out with the makeup I'm sure you can
guess I am priming my eyes then after
and picking up a gold shadow and I'm
gonna wet it and then Pat it onto my
eyes the reason why I'm wetting the
shadow is because it helps the shadow
stand out and the pigment appear
brighter so I'm just gonna keep building
that up until I'm satisfied with how the
shadow looks to make that gold stand out
even more I'm taking this nyx shadow
stick and putting that directly over the
gold i just placed this stuff is a bit
more glittery so it's perfect if you
want to look like a fairy
with my finger I'm pressing a yellow
shadow over everything I just placed it
make the color and the gold stand out
and be a little bit more vibrant to
match the color in my costume I'm taking
a bright pinkish coral color wetting it
and putting that into my crease building
it up as I go in slight patting motions
so I don't make the color too vibrant or
too overpowering I also added a bit of
orange shadow over the pink color to
make a bit of a gradient and bring out
more of the coral color also be sure to
blend out that shadow to prevent any
harsh lines so it doesn't look too
intense for some shimmer and highlight
I'm taking a white and silver shimmery
shadow and dusting that onto my brow
bone and where I'm putting the glitter
later
now of course to balance the look I'm
dragging the leftover pink and orange
shadow onto my lower lash line to match
the purple color in my wings I'm just
taking a light purpley shimmery color
and putting that on the outer half of my
crease and then dragging a purple liner
down my lower lash line and then
smudging it out with a brush
for some definition of course I'm going
to line my eyes I'm using a liquid liner
from Lancome and winging that out for
more of a wide-eyed and fluttery look
and of course I'm adding some gold
glitter liner over the black eyeliner
for more shimmer of course you can use
whatever color matches your costume
next I'm lining both of my water lines
and then applying some mascara before I
apply my crazy intense false fairy eye
lashes the false lashes that I'm
applying our from the Katy Perry lashes
and what I liked about them in specific
was that some of the lashes were purple
which i thought was super cool also that
they are very long and feather-like
which really helps make your eyes look
very esque
I also added half of some Demi lashes to
the bottom lash line to make my eyes
appear bigger and more animated now this
part is completely optional but since
fairy makeup can be super intricate I
wanted to find a middle ground by adding
a gold mask type thing these gold flakes
I purchase at Michael's kind of remind
me of fairy dust so I thought it was
just perfect plus it gives my face a
really cool shimmer and it matches my
outfit so I just use some eyelash glue
and traced and outline where I wanted
the gold flakes and then simply place
them around where I put the glue now
that the makeup is finished let's move
on to the hair now you can really do
whatever you want if you're dressing up
as a fairy because the hair really
really doesn't matter but I decided to
curl my and go figures right like
seriously I always curl my hair but I
curled my whole head using the infinity
wand and shook it out gently with my
fingers there's no precise way that I
did this I just kind of did it all over
to my whole head was curled and then of
course I'm adding some volume to my hair
by teasing the crown and the sides and
then to get some of the hair out of my
face I decided to loosely pin up the
front sections of my hair fluffing up
the sides I did decide to leave most of
my hair down so I could cover up the
wing straps when I put on my wings later
and of course a fairy wouldn't be a
fairy without her wings so my wings I
purchased from the spirit Halloween
store and went over the lines on them
with some gold paint to match my makeup
and as you can see the hair covers the
wing straps perfectly so now I'm going
to show you something that I would wear
if I was dressing up as a fairy for
Halloween I decided to wear a two-piece
dress from Windsor what I thought was
super cool about this was the fact that
you could also wear it for schools
errands by taking off the wings and
doing the makeup a bit different you
could totally reuse it
I thought the detail and the colors were
very whimsical perfect for a fairy so I
hope you guys enjoyed this and I will
see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
