to be a fashion haul video I feel like
I've been doing a lot of tutorials with
voiceovers lately so I kind of wanted to
throw something else into it by doing a
haul or a review or favorites video or
something like that
and I found a few things that I just
recently bought so I thought I would
make a haul video being that it is kind
of geared or on fall and a lot of the
stuff that I purchased is fall clothing
the first place that I bought clothing
from was ASOS and I really like ASOS
home it's like my favorite I love it my
boyfriend and I even like shop on there
together like he loves to store it as
well so I bought a few things on there I
didn't go too crazy well the first thing
that I got was this jacket or I guess
this is just like a heavy-duty cardigan
honestly it's like it's not like as
thick as a jacket but it's kind of like
a giant sweater and it goes down really
really long it's super soft and
comfortable and has pockets on the side
and it buttons up all through here which
is super convenient so you can either
leave it open or I can shut it too if it
gets a little bit colder when I bought
this I was like racing for the last
sighs but I'm pretty sure that they
restocked this so if you are interested
in this on the site I'm pretty sure they
just got like all their sizes back with
this and they have another color too I
believe I'm not sure what it is but I'm
pretty sure that they do the next thing
that I got is kind of boring because
it's just like a staple piece it's just
a great v-neck like I don't even know
why I'm showing you guys this but it's I
don't know it's really comfortable the
material is really stretchy and soft
it's just one of those shirts that I
like to have in my wardrobe because I
can just throw it on over leggings it's
long enough or I can put it with jeans
and then just put like a jacket over it
and it just matches so many things and
you can create so many different outfits
with this and it wasn't even that
expensive so I was like why not I really
like the style of it so yeah the last
thing that I got from ASOS wear booties
and I really wanted to find booties that
could be dressed up or down I have like
the combat style and then I had like the
heeled ones but I wanted some that we're
just like casual and exactly what I was
looking for in a super happy when I
found them they look like this so you
guys probably recognize them they kind
look almost like they're like the same
styles like the men's desert foods
almost which I love like I wish we had
like cool ones like that but these work
I love them I can make these like look
fancy if I wanted to but then they can
also be super casual and just worn with
like jeans and a sweater and another
thing that I really liked about them is
the texture on them they're like felt I
don't know I think that's the the fabric
I'm not really sure they're just really
fuzzy and comfortable and I just love
them and they add like a cool texture to
my wardrobe as well because they aren't
fuzzy you probably can't tell on camera
but in person you definitely can the
next place that I went to was forever 21
and I saw this on the way out and I had
actually been looking for it last fall
in winter but never ended up picking it
up so I saw this and I was like oh
perfect I'll wear this a ton during the
fall and winter seasons so it's this
dress the hang your strings out the
reason why I really wanted this dress
because or this particular style in
color was because I love the style with
tights like this color with black tights
is just my absolute favorite so I
thought this would be super cute with
like little heute heeled booties tights
this dress and I can even throw
something over like a casual sweater to
make it a little bit more casual or like
a nice blazer or something if I'm going
somewhere nice and it's like the cutest
outfit ever
the next place is Zara and we don't have
a store in the area where I live so I
ordered it offline they look like this
there are leggings obviously but they're
way thicker they're kind of they're
really really thick legging well I mean
not like super thick but they definitely
get the job of keeping your lights on I
think and what I really liked was of the
zippers I thought that that was so
unique and then this band obviously you
can't really see with what I normally
wear with it but they're just so comfy
and they look really nice like I've
dressed these up with like blouses or
like nice sweaters and put on like
booties and stuff and these look so nice
like they actually look like clean-cut
like good pants instead of leggings
which is I really thought was cool about
them
thing about these is they have them in
like gray black and I think another
color too I got them in the Navy
obviously but I'm totally buy more
because I think that they're like so
worth it
the next place that I ordered from was
Verve all clothing the first thing I got
was this so comfy it's like a blanket
like you know when you buy those
blankets um that are just really really
soft I don't know the material of them
but this is what this feels like and
then the outside of it is more like
matted I don't know it's not as fuzzy
just the inside is not it's not fur I
don't want you guys to think it's fur
cuz I'm totally not the type to work for
but it's so comfy like I said it's like
my blanket coat like I'm gonna wear this
with like a long sleeve or a sweater and
seriously I'm just gonna like wanna fall
asleep in class or something I'm gonna
do a styling video for you guys with
probably a lot of the stuff and more to
come
for fall/winter because I love both
seasons I've seen a lot of these vests
all over the place so it'll be helpful
for you guys who don't really know like
what to pair it with I will show you a
bunch of different outfits the next
thing from revolve clothing that I
purchased was this hat and I love it
it's so cute look at it I really like
the look of them I thought they were so
fun and I always see celebrities like
Nina Dobrev and Sarah Hyland and you're
just whipped wearing these like Fedora
type hats and they're just so fun I love
them and I think they're so cute it's
brown and then the band of it this
really cute bow like how cute is that I
like love that and then it has the
different color brown stripes on it and
then it's like kind of a topi brown
color for like the actual Hat the next
place that I ordered from was Urban
Outfitters and this is a while ago
actually but I'm pretty sure they should
have everything they're still um the
first thing was a flannel
I like flannels I don't wear them all
that often but when I do I think that
they're really fun they're comfortable
and they're so easy to style like you
can wear them with a lot of different
things you can pair them under jackets
you can just wear them with jeans I
don't know I really liked this one a lot
I liked that it was frayed at the end
so it gave like an even more rustic and
like edgy I don't know
just kind of like casual bum and look to
it another thing that I got from Urban
Outfitters was a tank shop and you're
thinking it's fall/winter Hall video
like you shouldn't be buying tank tops
but I really liked this one and the
reason why I buy tank tops in the fall
winter months is because they look so
awesome underneath jackets like if you
don't want to wear like a full-on
sweater or like a long-sleeve t-shirt
underneath a jacket that you leave open
obviously you can buy like kind of
casual nights tank top store underneath
and I really liked this one mostly
because of the color it's like this
purpley maroon color which seems to be
my favorite for fall has detailing all
over it like little floral detailing
it's so faint but it adds such a cool
like textured look to the shirt and
that's why I really liked it
but if you or don't like the color of
this I'm pretty sure Urban Outfitters
has like four other color options for
this tank top so right on with that well
I guess that's it I kinda thought I had
more to show you oh I do have one thing
I want to give you guys a sneak peak
board because I want to get a vote in
either the comments of likes below if
you guys want a video for this one
second okay so I'm actually like super
early for Halloween this year which is
like a first ever like I've never this
prepared for all need but since it's
kind of like my last Halloween because
this year I graduate from college I kind
of wanted to go out all out with
Halloween and I've never done a couples
costume so Patrick and I are gonna do a
costume idea so this is another thing
that I bought in the past month so I
wanna show you guys as like a sneak peek

favorite TV show she did the costume
