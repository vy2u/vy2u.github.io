be a fall favorites video I asked you
guys on Instagram and Twitter what
videos you wanted to see next now that
my Halloween series is over by the way
I'm obsessed with all of you guys that
recreated my costumes you guys tweeted
an Instagram to me and I made collages
and tweeted them out and I'm just so
excited they all turned out so well but
sad that that's over a lot of you guys
we're asking me to what tell you guys
like my beauty favorites fashion
favorites so far these past couple
months because obviously they change as
time goes on so that's exactly what I
did for you guys today I show you guys
Beauty favorites a food favorite that
I've been loving some fashion favorites
and some activities that I've just been
like doing all the time so if you guys
are all interested in this video then
just keep on watching ok so starting off
with fashion favorites my first
essential is definitely comfy sweaters
these two are gonna like my ride-or-die
because they pretty much go with
everything this first one is a cardigan
style it's beige it kind of goes with
everything you can just throw it on the
second one is a gray coat again style so
it's a little bit more heavy duty a
little bit more warm and both of them
are from Zara they go with pretty much
everything so they're definitely my
favorites
next up we have boots and booties I
narrowed myself down to four that I
think are essential that I wear all the
time the first are knee-high brown boots
the second are my favorite over the knee
of black boots these both of these can
go with so many different things dresses
jeans third the best moving on to ankle
boots brown ones are awesome because
they can be dressed up or down and then
also some black leather boots are just
essential for everyday so now I'm going
to show you guys an example everyday
outfit for me but I did make a fall
lookbook that just was uploaded before
this so be sure to check that out if you
haven't
but for this outfit one of my favorite
things do are wear sweater dresses and
this one is from Urban Outfitters
they're just super easy to throw on
I throw on my sweater my knee high boots
and I'm good to go I can modify this a
bunch of different ways it's just like
my staple fall outfit moving on to
beauty essentials I'm gonna start out
with lip color the first one is a color
sensational lipstick by Maybelline and
the color is nude and nuance I love it
it's a perfect everyday lip color I
actually found it and I was the perfect
dupe for a lot of the expensive lip
liners that I use so I was super excited
the next one is a berry color and this
is NARS bet I found it this season
actually and I'm in love with it it's
just like the perfect berry color I get
so many compliments when I wear it so
you have to try it out
moving on to some everyday beauty
favorites
the first being coconut oil I know
you've heard all about it but it's just
the best thing I found to take off my
makeup at the end of the night it
moisturizes my skin and I just love it
the next is some spa treatment this is
the Mario Badescu drying lotion I think
that's insane
but anyways I just take a q-tip stick it
into the bottom formula put it all over
my spots and I'm good to go this stuff
works wonders next up are some masks
during the season my skin dries up a lot
so I found these masks from Sephora and
they're sheet masks you basically just
put it on your face you look kind of
scary but they work so awesome
since one of my favorite things to do
during the fall time every year is go
apple picking Patrick and I had so many
apples in our apartment that we had to
Google so many different Apple recipes
to use them all so I'm gonna show you
one of my favorites which is an apple
Bri fake sandwich it's super yummy
and really easy to make so all you're
gonna do is start with two slices of
bread and I'm spreading some fig jam all
over this you can get those at the
grocery store it's pretty common and
then I'm taking some brie and that's a
cheese by the way and I'm placing that
on the sandwich and then I'm slicing up
the Apple I'm using two different types
of apples just for a different flavor
and I'm thinly slicing this to make sure
the sandwich isn't too bulky then I am
going to take some arugula because I
love arugula and I'm placing that on top
of the sandwich just to make it a little
bit more hearty and then after that I'm
taking the other side of bread and I'm
placing that on top and since I pretty
much only eat sandwiches if they're
grilled because it's my favorite way to
eat them I'm going to grill it so I'm
just taking some butter and I'm thinly
spreading that all over both sides of
the bread and then I'm going to put it
on the pan and Grill it like so after
that all you have to do is cut it and
enjoy this is one of my favorite things
to eat it's so good perfect for a snack
or lunch time and lastly for my
relaxation must-haves things I just
enjoy doing when I have free time
starting out with reading I've been
reading the Shay and Michaela book bliss
which is just a fun inspirational read I
recommend it and then for music I love
listening to music whether it's on my
record player on my headphones when I'm
walking around right now I've been
obsessed with James Bay I just love his
music and also Tori Kelly and one
direction I can't get enough lastly I
love bats and I know this is featured so
much in YouTube videos but for the fall
and winter time it's just the best way
to keep warm and relaxed perfect place
to listen to music and read of course
lush baths are the way to go they're
just super relaxing
oh that's it for my video I really hope
