fall to winter transition video
basically what that means it's just
inspiration for stuff that kind of
changes in your life when it comes to
seasons so more specifically decor and I
teamed up with target home on this
they're super easy decor ideas nothing's
DIY it's just stuff you can add to your
home that makes it look super festive in
holiday II without spending a lot of
time food obviously who does not like to
transition seasons with food or treats
in specific so I show you guys two of my
favorite really easy and then of course
some quick and easy fashion essentials
that I've been kind of digging out from
my closet since the weather is getting
colder in New York so if you are
interested in this video then just keep
on watching ok so the first decor idea
is probably pretty obvious but that is a
Christmas tree I always get buying at
Target because they are not real they
are fake Christmas trees there's so much
easier to handle put together and they
don't make a mess so I personally love
them plus you can get any size you want
I've got a size of this year um and then
I just go ahead and decorate it with
ornaments like usual the tree that I
actually got from Target is pre lit
which saved myself so much time so I'm
so glad they did that so all I had to do
was decorate it with ornaments and I
picked ornaments that kind of matched
the theme of my living room so I didn't
have to spend too much time or
redecorating things
the next idea is a festive pillows this
instantly transforms your living room or
bedroom into something so much more
festive so as always I go to Target just
because it's super affordable and I can
always find stuff that matches my living
room or bedroom so I found this one with
a polar bear I found another one with a
snowflake that already matched the
colors in my living room so it was super
easy just to transfer out some of my
pillows so like this one already matched
my couch pillows so I just switched it
out and it was perfect
and my third idea is a centerpiece or
table decor this is a perfect for at the
center of your coffee table or you can
even put it on your dresser so you're
gonna start off by getting a tray I got
mine from Target they have a bunch of
different styles and you're gonna get
creative and fill it with whatever you
want I filled it with this Lantern I
already had it has a little cute candle
in it and then I went ahead and I put a
bunch of pinecones in it if you guys
noticed from my fall video I had a bunch
of pinecones so I just kind of reused
them then I headed over to the ornament
section and I picked up some little tiny
mini ones and I felt that as well put a
candle in the other side and then I have
this reindeer I have like three from
Target because they're so cute put it in
like so and then filled it with whatever
else you put on your coffee table or a
dresser and you're good to go so between
those are three decor ideas I think your
space is gonna look awesome super
festive it's gonna look like you put a
lot of effort into it but really you
didn't
now what better way to transition into
the winter than with holiday treats so
I'm gonna show you guys how to make two
really really easy ones the first one is
a frozen caramel hot chocolate this is
so easy to make super yummy you're not
going to stop drinking it so the first
thing you're going to need is some
packet of hot chocolate mix and you're
gonna pour that into a cup then you're
going to add 1/3 cup hot water I
microwaved mine for about 30 seconds
stir that up it's still going to have
some chunks in it don't worry and then
you're going to set that aside and in a
blender cup you're gonna have one cup of
ice in there and then you're going to
pour approximately 1 cup of milk I use
soy milk so I kind of eyeballed it and
then I pour it in kind of a eyeball
amount of caramel syrup you can kind of
have fun with this and then you're going
to pour in your hot chocolate mixture
and then all you're going to do is blend
it up to the consistency of your liking
I like mine pretty blended so I did so
and then you're going to pour it back
into the cup and that's it of course you
can top with whipped cream I definitely
did because who doesn't love too whipped
cream on the top of your frozen drinks
so I did that and then drizzled it with
some caramel sauce and then I had to be
super festive and put in a red and white
striped straw so I did that and enjoyed
Patrick and I made both of these while
filming so we had two of them and we
could not stop drinking them they're so
good you guys have to try it
now I'm going to show you guys how to
make Christmas cookies and these are so
good they're a little bit of a different
take on a Christmas cookie because
they're with Ginger Snaps which are my
favorite so I started down by melting
down some white chocolate and then I
just just took some gingersnap cookies
which I bought from the store you can
get crafty and make your own ginger
snaps if you want to but this is just a
little bit easier and I dipped it into
the white chocolate half way and then I
just took some red and green sprinkles
and I sprinkled it on the chocolate
while it's still hot you want to make
sure that you do that and not while it's
dry because otherwise they won't stick
to it so I just repeated that process
until all the cookies were dunked and
then you basically just let them sit and
they're super yummy super easy to make I
seriously love them but mostly because
ginger snaps are my favorite cookie and
lastly moving on to my fashion
essentials when it comes to fall to
winter transition I think the biggest
thing for me is definitely having winter
accessories and winter jacket now I
still wear my comfy sweaters that I wore
in the fall all year round so what I
like to do is layer them so I take my
jackets which I usually buy in like
neutral colors so like a cream or like a
grey and I basically wear those all year
round I love really fluffy comfy ones
and then I love a little bit more of a
sleek one that you can wear maybe on a
night out or something a little bit
nicer um so you kind of have versatile
options and then of course scarves and
mittens are like my go-to it's just
something you need when it starts
getting colder so I always reach for
those just kind of neutral color ones
are always my favorite and then lastly
one of my fall to winter transition
favorites is definitely velvet I don't
know if you guys have been noticing but
velvet has been coming out like crazy so
I love this velvet maxi dress I
basically pair it with a cardigan that
you saw all over my fall winter or fall
fashion videos and I kind of dress it up
a little bit more wintery but I think
it's gonna look awesome layered and it's
just one of my essentials to kind of buy
that type of fabric this year so since
those are just like fall to winter
fashion essentials let me know in the
comments below what winter styling
videos you guys want to see this year
but that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you do and

this is just the start and I'm really
excited and yeah thank you guys so much
