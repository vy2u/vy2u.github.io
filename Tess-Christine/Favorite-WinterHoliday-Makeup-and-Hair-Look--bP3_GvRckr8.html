be a quick hair and makeup tutorial a
lot of you guys were asking me to do a
holiday inspired hair and makeup look so
I thought what better than to show you
guys what I've been wearing this whole
winter and holiday season so for
Christmas things that I had to look a
little bit nicer for it this is
definitely the look I've been going for
plus I instagrammed a few photos of
myself in this look throughout this
holiday months or whatever and a lot of
you guys were loving it so I thought I
would show you guys on my channel how I
achieved it so if you are interested
please keep on watching now like always
I'm going to begin by priming my eyes
using Urban Decay's primer potion and
then for the eyes in general and keeping
it very basic and very neutral so I'm
doing is sweeping a light brown matte
shade over my entire lid for a little
bit of highlight I'm just going to take
a shimmery white color and place that
onto my brow bone and then with that
same matte light brown color I'm just
gonna sweep that onto my lower lash line
for some balance in the entire look now
for some shimmer and sparkle especially
in the inner corner because I love doing
this I'm just adding a subtle gold color
to the inner corner of my eye moving on
to the eyeliner I love using either a
liquid eyeliner or even a gel eyeliner
it just depends on kind of what I'm
feeling for the day but I'm going to
wing my eyeliner out I like doing it
with more of a dramatic wing because I
have larger eyes lastly I'm going to
finish by applying a couple coats of
mascara to my top and bottom lashes for
my face I've already applied foundation
and concealer so I'm just going to add a
little of coral blush to the apples of
my cheeks
before I start with the red lips so how
I like doing my red lips which I've been
doing kind of this whole season is I'm
taking just a matte red color from Mac
and I'm placing that on to the main
points of my lips like the center part
and then on the outer parts I'm taking a
darker red which is more of like a
maroon color and putting that on the
outer outer corners of my lips and then
taking a lip brush and kind of blending
it all together so my lips give this
kind of subtle gradient look to them I
just think it looks really pretty and
kind of adds a different dimension to
the lips
so the
kind of the main focus of the look and
that's it for the makeup it's so easy
and simple I just love it now moving on
to the hairstyle that I've been
absolutely loving this whole holiday
season it's definitely something that I
always choose to do with my hair for
some reason I don't know I always change
up my hairstyle but you guys all know
that I love curling my hair so it has to
do with curling I'm all-in so basically
what I'm doing this is very very simple
as I'm just taking a one-inch Conair
curling iron and curling my hair every
other direction my whole entire head
whatever way you guys normally curl your
hair you can do you don't have to follow
my step process all I'm making sure is
that all the pieces are curled all the
way to the bottom of the hairpiece you
guys know if you've been watching my
videos for a while that this is actually
very similar to my ariana grande hair
tutorial or one of them I haven't like
three but I don't like going for the
full hair style that she does I really
like it but it's totally her I just like
the bouncy curls that she has so that's
kind of what I did here sometimes I'll
leave it down and sometimes I'll pin it
back just to get the bangs out of my
face it just depends what I'm feeling
for the day but this is definitely what
I go to as far as curling wise so lastly
I'm just finishing with some texturising
spray just to give it a little bit of a
messy feel instead of so uniformed
because I don't want it to look that
that crazy done up and then I finished
with hairspray and then that's the
completed look I love it it keeps the
hair out of my face and still looks nice
and put together and that completes my
holiday or winter season hair and makeup
tutorial that I've been absolutely
loving it was super easy and simple so I
really hope you guys enjoyed it and as
always I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
