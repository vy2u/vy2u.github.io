back-to-school video I was getting a lot
of requests on my Facebook and Twitter
to do a back-to-school kind of series
for my channel and I was thinking about
it and I kind of opted not to just
because I felt like I would kind of be
repeating myself just a little bit
especially with the makeup I just got
done doing a whole Pretty Little Liars
fashion or Pretty Little Liars hair
makeup and outfit series on my channel
so I'm gonna direct you over to those
for the makeup because the makeup there
is very it ranges like Hanna and Aria
and Alison's are a little bit more
intense with their makeup and then Emily
and Spencer are a little bit more
low-key so it's perfect for the wide
range of people so definitely go check
out those videos for makeup because
they're all of what I would do for a
back-to-school look today's video is
just going to be one simple hair look
that I thought would be perfect for a
first day of school look or even just
whenever you want to wear this for
school that was getting a lot of
requests to do this picture it's Selena
Gomez from her birthday party I believe
I thought it would be perfect to do kind
of like a back-to-school hair look for
this because it's kind of different and
fun and you can achieve this look in
many different ways and it's really easy
if you are interested in that hair look
please keep on watching don't forget to
check out my channel for a lot of other
videos that are perfect for
back-to-school I hope you all are having
a wonderful day and I will see you guys
next time bye guys okay so the first
thing you're gonna do is you're gonna
take some sort of heat protectant I'm
using the Tresemme heat tamer spray and
I'm gonna spray that throughout my hair
and then with a brush I'm just gonna
kind of brush through my hair again to
make sure that the heat protectant is
evenly distributed
now another way you can get these curls
without using a hot tool is you can just
sleep with your hair wet in braids and
it'll give you kind of the same wavy
curled like look but I'm going to show
you how to get it with a hot tool just
in case if your hair is kind of hard to
curl naturally so now with this Revlon
three barrel roller I'm just gonna be
working from the back to the front
taking very large sections of hair and
I'm just gonna begin clamping it all the
way down and the reason why I'm taking
large sections of hair is because I want
the waves to look kind of big and if I
take smaller sections of hair my hair is
gonna look a little bit more crimpy than
it is wavy so that's why I'm taking a
lot of hair each time and by taking a
lot of hair it's also gonna go by very
quickly which is why I also think this
is perfect for back-to-school because to
crimp my whole head I guess or wave my
whole head it only took me of like about
five to ten minutes when you get to the
front sections of hair you can kind of
be lazy with this and you don't have to
be too precise because we're gonna be
braiding this section anyways so it
doesn't really matter what the waves
look like so now all I'm gonna do is
repeat that on the other side of my head
until my whole hair has these nice big
waves
now like I said earlier you can achieve
this look by doing it heatless and just
sleeping with your hair wet and braids
but that's totally up to you what and
whether or not you want to use heat just
keep that in mind as an option so now
taking the front section of hair you're
just going to begin to Dutch braid now
what it means to Dutch braid is every
time I take an outer section of hair all
I'm gonna do is bring it underneath each
time and this is gonna allow the braid
to kind of sit on top and give you that
same look that Selena has with her
braids so now how far I'm braiding is
I'm just going to about a little bit to
the back of my ear and then I'm going to
begin braiding the hair all the way down
the piece now as you guys kind of know
or may not know Selena Gomez has very
thick hair so the braid is gonna kind of
look different on my hair than it did on
her hair because my hair isn't as thick
as Selena's so now once you have your
hair braided all the way down you're
going to begin pulling out the little
sections of hair on each side and you
can be super random with this and you
can kind of just tug and pull as you
please it can be super messy because
what you're essentially doing is you're
flattening the braid which is what
Selena Gomez had and I believe this is
called a pancake braid so that's what I
could tell that she had in her braids so
that's exactly what I'm doing and you
can just like I said be super messy with
this and just pull out random sections
until you get all the way to the bottom
now once you finish all you're gonna do
is take just kind of a clear elastic or
whatever kind of elastic ponytail you
have and secure that at the end moving
on to the other side of your head you're
gonna do the exact same thing so I'm
going to begin to spread splitting my
hair into three sections at the top
there and I'm gonna begin to Dutch braid
until I get to about behind my ear and
then I'm going to braid it all the way
down now like I said before if you have
Salinas they care you're gonna get more
of an exact look I have kind of like
medium to thin hair so my braids are a
lot thinner than Salinas meaning that
they're not going to give these kind of
big full braids that you guys saw in the
picture unless you have her exact hair
some hair type so keep that in mind when
you are recreating this hairstyle you
can definitely recreate it it's just not
going to be as exact as you may want it
from the picture so now once you finish
braiding both sides you're gonna begin
whichever side you want it doesn't
matter and you're gonna take each braid
and you're gonna wrap it to the back of
your head and pin it with bobby pins and
how you place this can be totally up to
you I'm just doing one kind of next to
each other and then wrapping the ends
underneath so now you can just pull and
play with it until you're satisfied with
where it is on your head and the
tightness of it as well now once you're
finished with that the look is complete
I think this is a really cute first day
of school hair look because it's kind of
fun and different but still kind of
keeps it natural looking so I really
hope you guys liked it and I hope you
guys all have a really great first day
thank you guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
