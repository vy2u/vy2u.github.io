be a styling video and I'm super excited
about this one for two reasons one it
involves back-to-school and I know I was
getting a lot of requests for that and
even though I'm not doing a full series
I thought a first day of school
outfit ideas video would be really
helpful for you guys for just some like
fashion inspiration but then also it
involves my own kids and you're probably
thinking what the heck but if you've
been following me on social media for a
while you know that months ago I'm a
part of something called the kid style
project and what that is is tanda beauty
bloggers vloggers illustrators and
designers we're all invited to the kids
headquarters to design a kid's champion
original shoe now when I found out about
this I was like oh my gosh that's one
amazing because I didn't know that going
into it and then - I was like really
scared because I've never one designed a
shoe but I'm not artistically awesome
when it comes to sketching illustrating
things so I was kind of nervous and I
was like oh my gosh this is an actual
shoe that's gonna be sold on cats calm
what the heck do I do well we go into
this room and there's just this little
box with our picture on it it's full of
art supplies and paper versions of Keds
shoes they had mood boards up there to
help us they had a room full of Keds
designs if we needed any inspiration and
then we were basically just set free for
hours to design a shoe so when thinking
about my design I was like okay what do
i do so I talked to a few designers and
I came up with the idea of henna I was
like I feel like henna would look really
awesome on a shoe I wanted it to be my
original artwork so I basically just
kind of sketched something that I
thought was henna inspired and then for
the colors I love tapestries so I kind
of pulled into this like gradient blue
teal that I thought would be really cool
for end of summer fall shoe and I got
the shoe a couple weeks ago before I
filmed and I just loved it it turned out
even better than I expected
so I thought I would show you guys how I
sell my Keds for different ways and
they're all perfect for back-to-school
obviously if you don't have my kids you
can still style it with whatever you
want but I thought it would be good
outfit inspiration for you guys in
general so if you are interested then
just keep
watching so for the four outfits I
wanted them all to be very different
styles so this first one is boho you
guys know this is my favorite starting
out and wearing a white maxi dress from
mango white is probably one of my
favorite things to wear with my kids I
just think it looks so good
but a maxi dress in general is perfect
for a first day of school look because
it's very breathable usually it's still
warm you don't have to worry about
violating a leg dress code because
they're long but if your school has a
spaghetti strap strap dress code
like-minded a tip for you is to wear
something over it like a jacket or a
vest I found this really cool one from
H&amp;amp;M for only $10 on sale
I love that it's suede and orange I
think it adds a really cool layering
element I added a fun beaded necklace
from ASOS and then of course you'd wear
your school backpack but my backpack is
from forever 21
this next look is definitely a preppy er
or girl your style of outfit I
absolutely love it I think it's super
comfortable it's very feminine and
flirty um and I think it's just perfect
for school especially if you want to
dress a little bit nicer so first day of
school this would be an awesome look so
starting off with a denim skirt
I know these are a huge trend right now
I found one from H&amp;amp;M that meets the
dress code lengths of the bottom of your
fingertips at least that's what we had
so it's long enough goes to mid thigh
and I think it looks really awesome
paired with a white lace shirt I think
the lace part of it is very feminine it
looks awesome with the kids I think both
of the colors tie in the colors of the
shoes really well and nothing overpowers
it so I just think this outfit is super
cute in general and I would definitely
wear this on a day where I'm trying to
look a little bit nicer for school
moving on to outfit number three this is
definitely a little bit more comfortable
a little bit edgier than the other two
looks it's perfect for those of you who
just like to rock a t-shirt and jeans
but still like to throw in your personal
style I think by adding pattern shoes
and statement jewelry it really helps
you kind of modify it to your style
without compromising being comfortable
so I really love this look basically all
I did was wear some distressed jeans
from Express they're a little bit baggy
I think my style is the girlfriend and I
wore those with the calves again I think
the blue looks awesome I wore a graphic
tee mine's from brandy melville but any
graphic tee will work you can really
make this you which I love and then over
it I'm wearing a statement necklace mine
is from Urban Outfitters I love the kind
of spikes on it I definitely think it
gives off a different vibe and then of
course you would use your school
backpack but my backpack is from ASOS
this fourth and final outfit is for
those of you like to keep it casual keep
it simple I totally know where you're
coming from the first day of school back
to school in general you just want to be
comfortable so I understand what it's
like to just want to wear t-shirt and
jeans so starting out I'm just wearing
some jeans four-page denim and a white
simple top from Express but I think a
t-shirt and jeans you can really stylize
it a different way and make it a little
bit more fun without compromising your
comfort ability so I just wore some
simple bangle bracelets from forever 21
a hat if you're in college one of my
favorites are floppy hats from Regan
bone and then of course my pattern qez I
think they look really good with this
outfit you can change it up a bunch of
different ways but just adding some
simple sneakers or simple accessories
you can really jazz up a t-shirt and
jeans and still be super comfortable but
that's my video for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video
