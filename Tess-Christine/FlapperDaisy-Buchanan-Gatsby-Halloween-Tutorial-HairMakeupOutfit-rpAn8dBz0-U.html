hey guys today's video is another
Halloween tutorial this year my costume
is Daisy Buchanan and my boyfriend
Patrick is going as Jay Gatsby so I
decided to show you his outfit too in
case any you guys are looking to make
this a couple costumes so I hope you
guys enjoy instead of going for daisies
more natural look in the movie I decided
to go for more of the traditional
flapper look which is definitely on the
darker side so I wanted to do something
smoky but with some sparkle because
Gatsby's all about the sparkles so for
our base I'm using Maybelline Color
tattoo and bad to the bronze and then to
set it I'm going over with a shimmery
shadow that's similar in color but just
a bit lighter for some definition in the
crease I'm using a dark plum shade this
also adds a really cool gradient to the
look as well which helps it fade into
the darker color and to deepen the look
even more I'm taking a flat top a shadow
brush and tracing an outer V shape with
a matte black shadow then I'm going to
lightly build it into the rest of the
colors smudging it as I go for a subtle
transition for some highlight I'm taking
a beige color and then placing that onto
my brow bone and into my inner corner
next I'm going to drag that same dark
plum shade onto my lower lash line and
then putting the leftover black on the
outer half of my lower lash line as well
now I'm going to line my eyes with a gel
eyeliner keeping it faint by smudging it
in to make sure it's not too noticeable
I want the liner to be a little bit
noticeable but not the main point of the
eye look just to define my eyes and of
course I'm going to add mascara before I
apply some false lashes the false lashes
that I'm using are from ardell they're a
natural the natural set that they have
but I went what I liked about them was
that they were fluttery so they gave the
exact look that I wanted to make them
full big and fluttery which is perfect
for this look
for my face I made sure I applied
Foundation and concealer because women
always appeared to have flawless skin
back then so I made sure to achieve that
as best as I could so for my blush I
applied a subtle highlighting blush from
benefit that gave me some color to my
cheeks but nothing crazy because the
focus is the lips so to achieve my dark
lips I used a maroon lip liner from NYX
making sure to make clean lines around
my lips and create very pointed Cupid's
bow you want to make your lips almost
look kind of like a heart shape so I'm
filling in those with the liner and then
applying a dark matte lipstick from Mac
over the liner and that completes the
makeup I seriously love this it's so
pretty and fun and I just love it so now
let's move on to the hair I'm working
the second two hair because it's the
easiest for me to curl and it's going up
so it doesn't matter too much so working
with the bottom section of my hair first
I'm just taking a one-inch curling iron
and I'm curling the hair from the bottom
to the top now what's important about
this is I catch the curl before it lands
basically and wrapping it back up to my
head and pinning it the reason why I'm
doing this is because I want my hair to
completely cool in the curl form because
that way gravity doesn't take the curl
down because what's super important
about this look is you get those bouncy
curls at the bottom of your head so once
you've had that completely pinned you're
going to wait about ten minutes or till
your hair is completely cooled and
you're going to take all the bobby pins
out again working with the bottom of
your hair first how I'm pinning up these
sections is I'm taking a chunk of the
hair and twisting it around each other
and then around my finger you're pretty
much winding the hair back up to your
head pinning as you go if you have hair
that's longer like mine you can leave
the end sections out and pin them in
gaps you find later it really helps that
use a mirror to look at the mirror
behind you because this will help make
sure that all of your hair is pinned up
and it's kind of giving the loops and
evenness that you want
now I'm taking this headband that I made
from the craft store and placing it on
my head the reason why I'm doing this
now is to cover up the elastic with the
rest of my hair later how I made this
elastic band or this headband was really
simple I just took a sequined elastic
band that you can find at the craft
store they have all different types of
colors and I just sewed a simple elastic
band at the end of it after measuring it
around my head and then glued some
little rhinestones on it so again you
want to just place that on top of the
curls you just pinned and then you're
going to pin your bangs is what I did
next I just left this one chunk out and
pin the rest back into the curls that I
pinned before now taking the rest of
your hair down you're going to get this
kind of weird look which I thought was
really funny and you're going to begin
pinning this up now this is no really
precise way that I'm doing this I'm kind
of just doing it random until I feel
like it looks good so as you can see it
kind of just took a section and wrapped
it under and around my finger and pinned
it and because I have longer hair I left
sections out that I'm going to pin later
so as you can see there again I just
wrapped it around my hand and then
pinned it and with the sections that I
left down before I'm just going to kind
of gather the ends and kind of pin it up
where there are gaps or where it needs
more loops all you're really doing it
looks very hard but all you're really
doing is creating loops and pinning it
and loops and pinning it until your hair
is completely pinned up and you can kind
of play with this and mess around until
you're satisfied with how it looks and
like I said using a mirror to look at
the mirror behind you is really helpful
to make sure that the look of the updo
is exactly how you wanted so that's it
for the actual hair part of it I think
it's cool it kind of looks like a mini
bob but like has curl to it I don't know
I thought it worked and then I'm taking
this feather that I also made from the
craft store I just picked up the feather
from the craft store and then this
little beaded hairpiece and how glued it
on and then I'm just simply taking a
bobby pin and securing that onto my head
underneath the headband now for some
more gatsby glamour I'm adding these
rhinestone earrings that I got on sale
at Macy's
and that's it for the hair makeup I was
so happy it turned out but now let's
move on to the outfits now since I
picked Daisy for my dress I wanted to do
something with glitz and sparkle instead
of just a traditional flapper dress you
might recognize this if you're pretty
tires fan Aria wore this last year for
Halloween I loved it and I was on the
hunt for it ever since
it's from unique vintage which is very
very pricey but I use my resources and
found it on eBay for a lot cheaper the
shoes that I found are from shoes.com
I thought they fit the era and match the
dress perfectly and then the beads that
I'm wearing are from Windsor for Patrick
is Jay Gatsby we wanted to go for
something more traditional Gatsby
instead of the black tux so we found
this ivory linen tux from Macy's super
super markdown we were so excited about
it the vest is from Topshop the shirt
from Macy's and the tie from JCPenney so
that's it for my Gatsby couple costume
or Daisy tutorial I hope you guys
enjoyed it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
