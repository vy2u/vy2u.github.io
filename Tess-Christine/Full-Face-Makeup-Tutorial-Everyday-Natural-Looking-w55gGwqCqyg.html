a bold face makeup routine now I haven't
done one of these in a really long time
and I've been getting a lot of requests
on my Instagram photos and as well as a
few YouTube comments to do just a good
old-fashioned makeup tutorial I've kind
of been going a little crazy with the
fashion videos that I thought it would
bring it back a little bit and do just a
good old fashioned makeup tutorial
because I know that that can be helpful
for a lot of you guys even more so than
and get ready with me video because they
actually talked about it a little bit
more also if you've been following me
for a while now you know that about a
year ago Patrick and I flew up to New
York which is funny because now we're
living here um because I teamed up with
Maybelline to create a look for the
Maybelline nudes palette well I'm doing
the same thing this year for the blushed
nudes palette which I really like a lot
so I wanted to do that because I figured
it's really helpful to incorporate a
drugstore brand into a full face makeup
tutorial because I know a lot of you
guys request that and the products are
way more accessible another thing is
that I am featured in Maybelline and
style house new series called vanity I'm
featured in one of the episodes very
small little cameo that I have so if you
guys want to check that out I will have
that linked below because you definitely
should anyways if you are interested in
watching this makeup tutorial then just
keep on watching after my morning
skincare I'm going to go ahead and apply
my foundation so the foundation that
I've been using and loving is the
hourglass Immaculate Foundation and what
I like about this is it's a liquid to
powder foundation so it's super light
but it also keeps me matte throughout
the day which is awesome because I have
oily skin for concealer I'm just using
the maybelline superstay better skin
concealer in light and I'm basically
placing that underneath my eyes in the
big triangle shape that everyone says to
do but it really does make a difference
so I'm doing that and also is really
good for adding blemishes too so I
really like it and then with a Beauty
Blender I'm just patting that into my
skin making sure I'm not rubbing it
because I want the concealer to stay
there and kind of blend into my skin
now for bronzer i'm using the balm
cosmetics Bahama Mama bronzer and I'm
just taking an angled brush and I'm
basically placing that in the contours
of my face how I like to apply my
bronzers they basically just suck in my
cheeks like a fish and put the bronzer
where your cheeks kind of cave in and
then I blend upwards so it's just kind
of been the most flattering way for me
to do it and then I also put that a
little bit on my forehead underneath my
jawline and then if I want to nose
contour I will but lately I haven't been
moving on to blush I'm using the
Maybelline fit me blush in medium nude
and I'm placing that on the apples of my
cheeks I love how it just gives me a
flush of color and nothing too intense
then for a highlight I'm using the
hourglass highlight trio I really like
this a lot I'm just using a big fan
brush for it I'm placing that on the
tops of my cheekbones the bridge of my
nose Cupid's bow and brow bone now
moving on to the brows I'm using my
favorite Anastasia brow pomade in soft
brown how I like to apply my brows or
bow it apply how I fill them in is
basically I just take the end of that
spoolie brush and I basically fill it in
but I like to stay on the bottom side of
the brow and work upwards so most of the
product is underneath the brow and then
I kind of push it upwards with the
spoolie I just found it's the most
flattering way for me to deal with my
crazy wild brows so I'm going to show
you a little bit closer here how I'm
doing it as you can see I'm working the
product starting on the bottom and then
I kind of work upwards and then the
spoolie brush is like my best friend
because then it just kind of evenly
distributes the product really well
for my eyeshadow I'm going to be using
the Maybelline the blushed nudes palette
and I'm going to be taking this white
shimmery color and placing that on my
lids with just an eyeshadow brush as a
base for the rest of my colors when you
put a light color like this underneath
it really helps the other shapes pop out
for my next color I'm taking this light
pink champagne shimmery color I'm
blazing that all over my lids I'm just
focusing on my lids I love using colors
like this because it really opens up my
eyes then I'm taking this coppery
shimmery color which is a darker shade
and placing that into my crease with a
fluffy brush and I'm also going to focus
this on the outer half of my eyes
extending it upwards towards the end of
my eyebrow because it helps really lift
the eye then I'm going to wet that same
brush and pick up a little bit more of
that product and place that on the outer
half of my lid just for a stronger
pigmented color and it's kind of deepen
that outer area I'm also going to bring
that same color on my lower lash line
just to balance out the look a little
bit more then for even more dimension to
the eyes I'm going to be taking this
chocolate brown color and I'm going to
take with a black shot flat top
eyeshadow brush I want to place that on
my top lash line and extend it a little
bit on into my crease focusing it on
that outer corner I'm creating like a V
like shape this is just going to help
lift my eye it's probably one of my
favorite ways to do my eyeshadow I've
actually been doing it like this for so
long
um so the key to this is basically just
blend blend blend you can always start
with less product and add more if you
need to but it just depends on how
dramatic you want it this is how I ended
up doing it and then I just took a
fluffy brush a clean one and blended
that out to prevent any harsh lines and
then I'm also going to take that
chocolate brown color and place that on
my lower lash line
just for a little bit more of a balance
of the colors I'm also going to be
taking the Maybelline waterproof gel
pencil which is just an eyeliner in
black and I'm basically going to put
that on the top lash line focusing on
the outer half and then with the flat
top I shadow brush again I'm going to
smudge that into my lash line giving it
a deeper black look now on some mascara
as you can see one side totally makes a
difference I'm going to be using the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara and
how I like to do this is I basically
comb on the back side of my lash
don't get it on your face like I didn't
and then I'm going to come up words
flicking the lash word lashes up I think
this just really helps lengthen them a
lot more I just started doing this whole
back lash technique and I really like it
and then I'm basically going to use the
tip of the wand to kind of fan out my
bottom lashes
for my lips this is just then my go-to
and pretty much every day my favorite
lip liner which is Urban Decay Naked 2
basically I just fill in my lips with
the lip liner it's self-explanatory just
watching me but I like to kind of over
line just a little bit and fill that in
as kind of a base color and then my
all-time favourite maybelline shade
right now is the Maybelline lipstick
color sensational lipstick in the color
mauve mania I just really like it it
adds like a nice pink color to the lip
liner that I already have but it's
nothing too overpowering so it looks
very natural and I've been wearing this
actually a lot since I got this lipstick
which was recent but I just think it's
super pretty and that is it for my
makeup I think it's super fresh and
natural but so easy to do so you guys
have to try it because it's definitely
been my go-to look the Maybelline pellit
that I used has a campaign called dare
to go nude and my dare was dare to take
a chance as you guys know Patrick and I
moved suddenly from Minnesota to New
York which was definitely something
completely new and intimidating but so
exciting and well worth it so I dare you
to take a chance yourself in your life
talk to a crush make a new friend or
pick up and move somewhere new like I
did I really encourage you guys to do
something spontaneous in your life even
though I love that you've watched my
videos go get outside and do something
crazy awesome if you do I definitely
want to hear about it but that's it for
my video today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it be sure to check out my
vanity
um cameo below and let me know what
videos you want to see next and I will
see you guys in my next video
