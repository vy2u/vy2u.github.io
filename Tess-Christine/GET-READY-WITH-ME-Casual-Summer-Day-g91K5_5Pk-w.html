channel today's video is get ready with
me video and it's been a minute since
I've done one of these I thought I would
share with you guys a very casual easy
kind of like my everyday go to summer
look plus looks really awesome hairstyle
that I do occasionally especially when
it's really hot out and you don't want
to do much to your hair want to get it
out of your face a little bit so I
teamed up with Garnier to show you guys
this totally cute hairstyle and of
course the makeup and outfit are
included so I really hope you guys enjoy
and let's get started okay so after
getting out of the shower I have a fresh
face and my hair is somewhat damp so
before putting on my makeup I'm going to
begin using the beach chic texturizing
spray by Garnier and I'm going to spread
that all over my hair so it can kind of
settle in my damp hair while I do my
makeup so then all for my makeup I'm
going to be using a new foundation that
I'm trying out it's the bare minerals
made to fit foundation and I'm basically
just you know doing the usual UV hit
beauty blender to blend that into my
face I like this one because it's not as
heavy as some of the other foundations I
was using and in the summer that's kind
of e but for concealer I'm going to use
the Tarte shape tape concealer and now
this is more heavy duty I would rather
have more in my concealer than my
foundation just because I can cover up
any problem areas and underneath my eyes
you know the usual and then I blend that
into my skin so then sometimes I will
use a cream contour because in the
summer it's so hot and I sweat a lot you
kind of want to avoid a lot of cream but
for me what I found is that this tends
to last longer throughout the day than
just a powder so if I have to have my
makeup on for a long amount of time I
will probably use a cream contour just
cuz I know it's going to last even
through the heat so I'm just using a
foundation stick that's a little bit
darker than my skin tone and I'm
blending that in with an elf foundation
brush for like contour brush this brush
is awesome and it's super cheap so love
that and then I just go over with a
Beauty Blender just to make sure there's
no harsh lines and it all blends
seamlessly
so like usual I'm just going over with a
translucent powder I have a pressed one
from Make Up For Ever and then I'm going
to go over the areas that I cream
contoured with just a little bit of
benefit hoola bronzer and I like using
all my notes too as you can see but then
usually in the summer I just go right
for highlighter so I'm using the back of
cosmetic champagne pop and including
that on the highlight points of my face
and then moving on to those eyebrows
girl I know you've been staring at them
being like six those but they're always
crazy it's just what I have to live with
so I'm brushing that out with a spoolie
brush and then I'm just taking this on
it's a via brow pencil I will have all
the products I'm using listed below just
to make it easier but I'm filling in my
brows I tried a few other brow jewels
but this I just find helps tame my crazy
brow hairs better than a lot of them so
after brushing it out again I'm just
going to go on with some eye shadow I'm
just using this Too Faced natural eyes
palette and I'm literally just using the
two light matte shades which is like a
cream and a brown of mixing them
together and then putting that on my
lids and then underneath my eyes and
that's it for eye shadow I don't usually
mess around anything else just because
it's kind of my least favorite part and
I just don't do a lot and then I go into
my inner corners with a Marc Jacobs like
eyeshadow stick and I place that on my
inner corners and brow under my brow
bone and then sometimes on occasion if I
want to deal with it I will do a winged
liner sometimes I can't be bothered with
it but somedays if I want a little extra
on my eyes I will do that
now I use two mascaras the first one is
the Maybelline lash sensational love
this stuff and I you do a little
different technique I brush down on my
lashes first and then I brush upwards I
don't know I just feel like it helps it
lift up my eyelashes and it always seems
to make them appear fuller and longer so
I really like that and I do that
obviously on my top and bottom lashes
and then I go in with the benefit
they're real mascara love this stuff and
I just coat those at one more time for
my list I'm using a Mac lip liner in the
color stripped down I love this lip
liner I think it's replaced naked 2 for
me I just absolutely love it in the
summer I don't even really mess with the
liquid lipstick I just kind of do liner
and I'm good to go so this is a new
product that I've been using and a C
Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream and
basically is just a skin protectant and
kind of is like Vaseline but basically
what I do is they put a little on the
back of my hand and I basically put it
on the high points of my face like where
you would put a highlighter and I just
find that it gives a really nice glow my
skin has been kind of drying out lately
with me trying out new skin products and
this just makes it shine and look really
nice but not in like a greasy way in a
really cute way so I love it and of
course the last thing I do is finish
with the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray and then that is it for my makeup
I love this like I said I do this almost
every day I just think it's so natural
and so pretty and it's kind of been my
go-to now let's move on to my hair
flash-forward to the beginning of the
video when I put in the garden age
texturize right into my damp hair this
is what it looks like dry it definitely
brought out my natural texture and wave
it's very messy very beachy but what I
like to do is just grab a regular
curling wand and I just basically take
random pieces and I wrap it around the
barrel some away from my face them
towards my face this kind of just helps
out my hair and help define the curls a
little bit more the texturizing spray
did most of the work for me and kind of
brought out that natural texture in my
hair but this just kind of helps it out
a little bit but I love it I love using
more of my natural texture in the summer
because
the humidity will kill any hot tools or
heat that you put on your hair for me in
a second so I like to use a lot of my
natural ways so after that I will go in
again with the texturising spray just to
kind of lock everything in and make sure
it's held and then on most days I will
just go out like this and I will just
keep it very messy very beachy and I
love it but on days I want to pull it
away from my face and get it out of my
face or what I just want to change it up
I will just grab this front section and
twist it around itself and then
basically create a bun I'm sure you guys
all created top knots before but
basically you just wrap it around itself
grab a ponytail and secure it it's so
easy it takes like two seconds so it's
one of my go-to especially if I have
second day hair or anything like that
and then lastly just to secure it I'm
taking the Garnier a frizz guard anti
frizz dry spray and it pretty much does
what it says it instantly helps
eliminate frizz and flyaways which is
what I need it helps with that texture
and I absolutely love it so this is the
completed look I think it's so cute and
perfect for the summer and then lastly
for a little outfit of the day this is
something I would for sure grab on a hot
summer day so for my dress that is from
privacy please I just wore a simple gold
necklace from Maria Pascal and then
paired it with some white sneakers from
the two purpose
what that is it for metal yesterday I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did be sure to give it a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments below what
video you want to see next so I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
