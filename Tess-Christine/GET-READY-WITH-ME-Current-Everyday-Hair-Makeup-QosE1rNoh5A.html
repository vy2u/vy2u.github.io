channel today's video as you can tell is
to get ready with me this is the hair
and makeup that I've been wearing a lot
recently so I hope you guys enjoy okay
so here's a quick overview of my morning
skincare after cleansing I apply the
fresh rose water toner and then I go in
with the skin suit of clothes renewal b3
on my face and neck and then I go in
with the MZ skin lift and luster for an
extra glow this is definitely a pamper
product and then I used the Renee rule o
daily protection SPF 30 to protect my
skin from the Sun okay so now moving on
to makeup this is what I do at pretty
much every single day at least for right
now I start off with the Urban Decay
Naked skin concealer to cover up my
blemishes I find that using this under
the foundation has worked the best for
me and then instead of foundation lately
I've been using the Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer this has a great coverage
for being a tinted moisturizer and I
love the way it feels on my skin I used
to use it a while ago and I'm kind of
back on using it and absolutely love it
so then to conceal under my eyes and
kind of highlight those areas you want
to I'm using the Tarte shape tape to
conceal and I love it so much I feel
like everyone talks about it and then of
course I'm using a Beauty Blender to
blend everything in the next step I'm
using the Fenty Beauty contour stick to
sculpt my face I've been really loving
cream contour as you guys have probably
noticed this over the past year but I
just think it looks really nice and
natural which I love so after blending
that all in don't forget your neck I'm
going to use the Make Up For Ever
setting a pressed powder to kind of make
sure everything is set into my face and
to help eliminate shine because I do
have oily or skin
then I'm going in with the benefit hoola
bronzer to basically set the cranberry
base and use it kind of as a blush also
because I don't really use blush then
I'm using the benefit what what's up
Thank You highlight my face I like this
I use my finger to kind of warm up the
product I think it applies really nicely
moving on to brows I've always been a
huge fan of the Anastasia brow tools
this one is the brow definer I love this
so I start off by brushing out my eye
brows first and then I go in with small
strokes to fill in my brows I always
like them to look very very natural I
don't go for that super defined look but
I definitely want them to look full and
more bold so I always try to brush them
out afterwards because that helps them
look a little bit more natural so I'm
moving on to eye shadow I've been loving
the urban decay and naked heat palette
so I just go in with those two first
like brown colors blend them on the same
brush and place those all over my
eyelids I really don't do anything crazy
with my eyeshadow so then I'm going in
with cayenne which is like this burnt
orange color which I've been loving for
this time of year I just think it looks
really good on my eyes and then I mix
all of those colors in and put it on my
lower lashline and then lastly I use
that darker more of like a plum color
and I place that on my lashline just
with a flat top I shadow brush just to
kind of smoke out my lashline and make
them more defined so then of course I
got to highlight my eyes so I use just
the same highlighter that benefit what's
up and I place that in to my inner
corners and on my brow bone I love using
the cream I just think it stands out a
little bit more then I've been loving
this L'Oreal lash paradise mascara you
guys know I was like stuck on one
mascara for a while but this one is
amazing you have to try it so I place
that on my lashes and I'm good to go
so then after applying some lip balm
because I needed it I'm gonna use a lip
liner I hey I'm such a lip liner girl I
use them way more than lipsticks so I'm
using the Mac lip liner in world my two
favorites are rural and stripped down
I'm lost for makeup I use the Urban
Decay setting spray to help make my
makeup last and that's it pretty easy so
now I'm moving on to my hair so after
showering I brush through with a wet
brush by now my hair is not fully dry
but it's definitely damp and then I use
the geese you honey hair oil to
basically moisturize it I love this
stuff and then I go in with of course a
heat protectant spray this one is again
by V sue I love how it smells if I don't
have time to let my hair air dry which
is most days I use the Dyson supersonic
hair dryer to speed up the process I
absolutely love this I love how it gives
you air control and heat settings plus
the magnetic attachments are really cool
and convenient so I'm using that to dry
my hair I absolutely love it this thing
works so well and does it so quick which
I need because I'm always out shooting
or filming videos so I just need this
whole getting ready process to be very
quick so big thank you to Dyson for
sponsoring this video I absolutely loved
it and if you guys are interested in
this hair dryer I will have a link in
the description box below you guys know
that I love my hair to be wavy so you
have seen this a million times before
but I go in with a curling wand and I
basically wrap my hair around the barrel
every other direction to give it this
kind of messy tousled wave look which is
my favorite so then going with the
garden a texture tease to give movement
and volume throughout my hair I always
go in with the texturizing spray I just
love what it does to my hair and then of
course you have to finish with hairspray
so I'm using the Garnier sleek and shine
hairspray to do so and after that I'm
finished I really hope you guys enjoyed
it it's a very easy everyday look so
yeah thank you guys for watching and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
