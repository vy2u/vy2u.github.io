of course I'm going to begin with my
eyes so I'm just taking an eyeshadow
primer and placing that like so then I'm
taking the Revlon all-over shadow brush
and I'm picking up a matte cream and a
matte brown color light brown and I'm
placing that all over my lids I mix them
together in the palette and this kind of
acts as my base so then I'm going to
take the crease brush and I'm picking up
kind of a chestnut darker brown color
and placing that into my crease using
windshield wiper motions to act as a
transition color I do this pretty much
every day but the only difference with
my eye shadow is I'm gonna smoke it out
instead of using like more of a bold
liner just because I'd like to do that
for a night look so I'm taking the
Revlon smokey eye brush which is a dual
ended brush one is angled and one is
kind of flat top and what's awesome
about this is that I can really get in
close to my lash line which is what I'm
doing so I'm picking up a black shadow
and then kind of toning that down with a
dark brown and placing that closest to
my lash line as possible and then using
both sides to kind of smoke it out and
make no harsh lines visible and then to
add a little pop of color I'm just
taking a gold shimmery color and placing
that above my eyes and kind of in the
center of my eyelids
then I'm just taking what's left on my
crease brush and I'm basically just
running that over again into my crease
to make sure none of that color got lost
with the gold moving on to my face I'm
taking the benefit Porefessional primer
and I'm basically priming my face and
then I'm going in with a foundation and
the Kevin of Kwan skin enhancer mixing
that on my hand and using my Beauty
Blender to blend that and press that
into my skin of course blending it down
to my neck as you can see my face is a
lot paler then my neck so this matches
perfectly once it's all blended then I'm
just taking the cosmetics by by under
eye concealer placing that underneath my
eye and then I'm going in with the naked
concealer and kind of doing the whole
triangle effect and placing it basically
on my t-zone is where I want my
concealer to be and any blemishes of
course that I have and then again
pressing that into my skin
using my Beauty Blender sponge now
moving on to cream contour which is
something I love to do especially for a
night look or when I'm wanting more of a
dramatic look so I'm just using a
foundation stick that's darker than my
natural skin cup skin tone and placing
that on the contours of my face and then
I'm taking this new Revlon brush which
is called the Revlon professional
blending brush it has a sponge tip which
is so cool this thing is so easy to hold
I love it it gives you a flawless streak
free finish
and it makes it perfect for blending
this type of stuff like cream contour
concealer foundation whatever you want
to use it for and what's awesome about
it is it has interchangeable sponge tips
which is so cool it makes your life so
much easier so be sure to check this out
it's available starting this new year at
your local store then to set all of the
cream makeup I'm just testing a
translucent powder over my face and I
skip the whole baking thing just because
I wasn't feeling it and this works for
me just as well so now I'm going in for
my eyebrows and I'm using the Anastasia
eyebrow - all have the exact name in the
description box but basically this is
the after and the other ones before so I
basically just make it a little bit more
bold and I don't do anything crazy to it
I like it to look as natural as possible
so I just kind of used small strokes and
kind of really help define the brow and
then shape any kind of stray hairs that
I have I like this product because it
kind of has a waxy finish to it which
helps keep my crazy brows in place
I never go crazy with blush so I'm just
basically putting a light mauve color on
the apples of my cheeks and then I'm
going to use a clean Revlon brush and
I'm going to place highlighter on the
top of that basically on my cheekbones
so I love the becca highlighter in
Champagne pop then I'm just going to
take some matte Brown shadow and place
that on my lower lash line and then
finish it off with some bottom mascara
the benefit they're real mascara is
amazing but on my top lashes I have lash
extensions so don't get confused then
I'm going to go in with more of a bold
lip now I would normally pick up my Kat
Von D bow-and-arrow which is like a
mauve color you've seen it so much in my
fall makeup and everything
but for the holidays it's kind of fun to
experiment with experiment with darker
lips so I like a very red color so I
just used kind of a berry lip liner and
then went over it with a bright red eye
liquid lipstick and then I put some
highlighter on the center of my lips
just to make them pop but I love the
kind of ombre effect that it gives and I
just think it's perfect for the holidays
this whole makeup look like always is
always super natural but it's something
that I love to do so I thought I would
share with you guys for my hair I stick
to the usual and I just curl it using a
barrel curler and just kind of have
these loose waves I love to spray
texturizing spray in it the one that I'm
using I think is called a rebei I don't
know how to pronounce it but it's
amazing it gives you that messy texture
and it's just kind of my go-to no matter
what especially for a night out I like
the sultry kind of sexy look it's look
it gives or if I'm not feeling down and
I want to put it up let's say I have
second day hair something like that I
will just kind of throw it into a messy
ponytail leaving strands out in the
front of my face just to kind of frame
them but I think it looks really good
with some of the outfits that I'm going
to show you in the next clips um with
certain outfits
I think ponytails look amazing and you
can add earrings to them and I just
really like it and plus it kind of saves
you if you don't want your hair down and
in your face this is awesome
for this first outfit this one it's
definitely a little bit more casual
laid-back from your stereotypical
holiday party glam outfit but I wanted
to include it because it's definitely
true to me it's how I dress when I go to
parties because it's definitely more
chill but it's still put together looks
awesome and you can get your dancing
shoes on because this is super comfy so
starting off with the shorts those are
from Etsy they're just like some vintage
leather high-waisted shorts I belted it
with a belt from Urban Outfitters and
then I added some tights for some warmth
and then I just wore my booties because
they're super comfortable easy and those
are from Steve Madden my satin top I
love the color it's very wintery to me
that is from Lulu's and then over it I
wore this fluffy gray cardigan coat type
of thing from Tularosa I got it off of
RuPaul
okay so this is probably the holiday
outfit you are expecting and this one is
definitely very festive it screams New
Year's and mainly because of the
bodysuit I love it it's from Windsor the
dangly sequins on it are amazing
specifically I love the gold color just
because gold is my jam so that's amazing
but I wanted to keep it really chilled
by wearing just some high-waisted black
denim jeans from Mott and bow and then
kind of edge it up with my same black
booties and then of course I picked the
red lipstick and the ponytail to pair
with this look
ok so I think this one actually is my
favorite I just really like how it
turned out it was very easy and simple
and just really comfortable to wear so
starting off with my red slip dress that
is from Lulu's the red color of it just
kind of screams Christmas for obvious
reasons um but I love it and how I
styled it was with a t-shirt underneath
it and I just wore a white one but I
also think it would look really good
with like a black turtleneck I think the
fat could look awesome as well so
there's so many possibilities with this
and then for my boots I just wore the
same ones from Steve Madden kept it
simple and then how I dressed it up a
little bit is I added a black a choker
from Target and then a sparkly one from
ASOS velvet seems to be a huge trend
this year and I think holidays are
perfect for it so I'm wearing this blue
velvet jumpsuit from Lulu's I think this
is amazing I think it looks so put
together and sophisticated I just think
it looks so good I think it also looked
very good belted but how I chose to
style it is I wore a lace Navy choker
that is also from Lou's by the brand
Vanessa Mooney I love it I love how that
kind of style looks with the chokers and
then I just wore some up like Stuart
Weitzman heels you can't really see them
because I need these hemmed but very
simple you can wear a really cool jacket
over it and I just think it looks really
put together an awesome
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
