channel today's video is going to be a
get to look or a look for less type of
video you guys love these videos as do i
and as always i asked you guys on
Twitter to send me some of your
favorites and you all agreed with me
that the next one or this one should be
Haley Baldwin so I always talk her
Instagram because every time she comes
to New York I'm just like obsessed with
her outfit I think they're great and
they're also perfect for the weather
right now most of them at least in New
York so you might have to modify it a
little bit but I always encourage that
anyways with these type of videos so
yeah I really hope you guys liked the
outfit and let's get started
okay so starting off with look number
one at this one I picked because I feel
like this is very Haley this is stuff
that you're always used to seeing her in
it's very chill very easy and I thought
it would be super easy to recreate
because as you can see these are her
items very expensive the sweatshirt
alone is crazy so I knew I could
recreate it for you guys
so this is what I came up with very
simple so starting off with a sweatshirt
I found one that is almost identical to
hers like style and everything and it is
from Windsor and it is only twenty six
dollars which is awesome compared to
hers and then for my bomber jacket I
already owns that I did go ahead and try
to find some lace up versions of bomber
jackets and it was really difficult so I
just scrapped that and just said look in
your closet you can find something or of
course I have something linked that's
similar to mine from Windsor that's like
$36 which i think is really good for a
bomber jacket
um and then moving on to my leggings I
found some leather leggings which I love
for the season just in general so I
already had to own those but those are
from Zara and still available and
they're only at 29 and 90 and then last
but not least the booties those are from
Windsor they look almost identical to
hers and those are only 34 dollars and
then I just threw on a black beanie that
I already had own you guys can get that
from Target pretty much anywhere like
they're so simple
ASOS I think has a bunch so yeah like I
said super simple outfit I love this one
perfect for kind of an everyday look
look number two I absolutely love I
think it's perfect for fall and
incorporates a bunch of neutral colors
which i think is so pretty it was
definitely one of my favorites when
looking up her style
as you can see it's very expensive the
coat is insane um but they involve such
simple pieces like I said with the last
one I wanted to pick outfits that you
can reuse a bunch of this stuff and
style it a bunch of different ways so
they're not like a crazy celebrity
outfit or anything um so that's kind of
what I did so starting off with the
sweater dress now thinking about it I
probably would have gone for a beige one
just to match hers a little bit more but
this grey one was only 26 dollars from
Windsor and I think it gives off a
similar look just in general and then
moving on to the coat that one is from a
Lulu's and I think it matches really
well you can find coasts like this all
over this time of year they range in
crisis but I've been able to find pretty
much all of them for under $100 which is
awesome and then for my booties I
actually Hardy it on these these are
like chestnut brown colors just match
hers they're from forever 21 there's 35
bucks they're so easy you can go for the
over the knee boots like she has they
with those are available at forever 21
as well super affordable um but I just
wanted to style these because I already
had them and that's it
moving on to outfit number three this
one I absolutely love and a lot of you
guys dipped - when I tweeted it out I
think it was a lot of your guys's
favorites which I understand why because
it's really cute and really simple and
perfect for every day however this was
the only one that I couldn't find her
exact pieces so I can't really do a
price comparison for you but I can
guarantee you it's really expensive so
starting off with the jacket which was
the steal for me to find I wish I could
find it more in a coat form this is
definitely a jacket so if you live in a
colder climate this is gonna get chilly
so you're gonna have to layer but I was
able to find one that was similar color
similar cut style everything from
forever21 for only $27 I know I love it
and then underneath it I wore a white
t-shirt which is just from Windsor
that's like 20 bucks very simple
actually like that it has distress in it
because I feel like that's another thing
that's very Haley and then I just wore
some black jeans I already owned and
then for my over the knee boots yes
those are Stuart Weitzman ones I've had
them for years but of course unsub
spiration
I will link similar ones which they have
all over the place as well as everything
in this video
I'm moving on to outfit number four this
one was definitely a challenge but I
couldn't go without challenging myself
this is from Paris Fashion Week so a lot
of this stuff is super unique so I kind
of put my own spin on it
as you can see crazy expensive even even
the choker alone is almost $200 so I
definitely wanted to take a whack at it
so this is my outfit recreation I'm
really happy with how it turned out I
think my biggest struggle was finding a
similar houndstooth printed coke which
was a complete fail I could not find it
so I decided to switch it for the skirt
because I couldn't find a similar skirt
either so I went for this like dark
olive colored jacket which is from
Lulu's I will link a similar one that's
actually a little bit more green that'll
match a little bit better and then for
the print I decided to go for a printed
skirt to kind of throw that print in
there and I was able to find a
houndstooth skirt from Zara which is $50
a little bit expensive but it's a little
bit thicker so you can put tights
underneath it and rewear it a bunch for
the holidays which i think would look
really awesome and then i just wore a
black shirt which I already had and then
for my choker hers was kind of like this
gray sparkly choker I was able to find
one from forever 21 for super cheap
which I was so excited about and then I
just want the same over the knee boots
that I already had owned but of course I
will link more for you on celeb spray
ssin but yeah I really like this one
this one is perfect for anything that
you kind of have to dress up a little
bit more for I definitely wouldn't wear
this on a day-to-day basis but I do
think it's casual enough that you could
wear it if you had somewhere nice to go
at the end of the evening or something
like that
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did be sure to give it a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments below whose
outfit or style I should recreate next
but that's it so thank you guys for
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video
