what's up guys welcome back to my
channel today's video is going to be a
get the look video yay I asked you guys
on Twitter like I always do to let me
know who I should do next
and surprisingly enough a lot of you
guys were requesting various different
models these girls that I'm about to
show you they kind of dress like how I
do on a day-to-day basis if you follow
me on Instagram so I was really excited
to do recreate these outfits for you
guys I decided to pick four of the most
requested and kind of group them into a
video that way I can have you guys vote
in the comments below if there's
somebody that you like in particular and
more so I can do a whole video on them
later I have an idea of who I want to do
but I want to hear from you guys and one
more thing before we get into the video
I wanted to let you guys know that this
is the week that I'm on style Co live
which is awesome I show you guys how to
style fashion sneakers so that's gonna
be live tonight which I'm really excited
about I'll have a direct link in the
description box below so you can watch
me but anyways that's it so let's go
ahead and get into the video to begin
I'm starting with a Taylor Hill and I
absolutely love this girl's style I
follow her on Instagram she's awesome so
when I was googling some street style
images of her I found this one that I
thought was perfect for the summer super
casual and easy to wear so all you're
going to need are some converse I found
these black on black converse from Urban
Outfitters but of course you go to a
converse store and they'll have them for
my skirt I found a pink structured skirt
kind of similar to what she was wearing
from Zara for super affordable price and
then for my t-shirt I just found this
one from Urban Outfitters but all you
need to look for is a white t-shirt with
some sort of a black graphic on it so it
really could be anything look in your
closet you might have something or you
can kind of put your own twist on it
which I definitely recommend
next up Karlie Kloss I found this image
and it was kind of all over the place
when I googled her Street style and I
thought it was very girly and cute so I
definitely wanted to recreate it so it's
a white on white ensemble that she had
going on so starting off I just found a
white skater skirt from Windsor which
was super affordable and then the top
that was a little bit of a challenge to
find a long-sleeve one like hers but I
figured since it's summer it's gonna be
warm anyways I might as well show you
one that looks pretty similar is
affordable but a short sleeve version or
a tank top version and that is also from
Windsor and then for my shoes I just
wore some nude ones that I already have
those are from Steve Madden but I will
go ahead and link not only all the
clothing pieces from the video but some
similar sandals to hers on celeb
spiration then I decided to add my own
twist to things and add a denim jacket
because it's very something that I would
use so I threw on one from a Topshop to
just kind of give it some edge and a
little bit more of a grungy appearance
since it's already super girly moving on
to Emily Ratajkowski
she is my ultimate favorite I stalk her
Instagram pretty much daily because I
love her outfits this one was by far my
favorite that I saw online I just think
it's really awesome it definitely has
like an edgy look to it but the glasses
I love them
so I'm gonna start off with the pants
because those are my favorite I've
already worn this outfit a bajillion
times but those are from ASOS they're
not as green as hers but I thought they
matched it pretty closely and I like how
slim and tailored they are they're just
like the best pant ever and then
starting off with the cropped white
shirt that is also from ASOS and it's
sleeveless I didn't show you in the
video but it is sleeveless like hers and
then I wore a leather jacket which I had
already owned but that is from Urban
Outfitters and then instead of her like
clunky platform shoes I decided to go
for some lace-up ones from forever 21
that I already owned and then the
glasses of course you can't forget them
and those are from ASOS
you
and lastly is there some pie oh I hope I
said her name right but I saw that she
posted this on Instagram a couple weeks
ago and I thought it was super cute very
casual it has a lot of trendy pieces for
summer so I definitely wanted to include
it so starting up with the pink t-shirt
I bought mine from splendid which
actually I bought it on amazon.com but
that's the brand and then I wore a white
bra like hers I didn't wear hers was
front but I just found one on amazon.com
as well and then I decided to go with
some white denim shorts from Nasty Gal
but you can go ahead and wear white
jeans if you want to to match hers I
just thought is a little bit easier
because it was super warm out for my
shoes I just wore some nude sandals
because I'm not really a nude pumps type
of girl during the day um but those are
from Steve Madden and then for my choker
that is from Topshop and then my
sunglasses are the key Shay Mitchell
ones
but that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it please give it
a thumbs up if you liked might get the
look videos and keep wanting them and
let me know the comments below who I
should even get to look for next and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
