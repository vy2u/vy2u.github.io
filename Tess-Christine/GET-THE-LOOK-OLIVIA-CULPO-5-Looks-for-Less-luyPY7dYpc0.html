channel today's video is going to be to
get the lip video and Patel vise inside
all it is for Olivia culpo I love her
style I think she's amazing I follow her
on Instagram and I thought it was only
perfect timing since I just recently cut
my hair I'm like who has similar
hairstyles like I'm gonna do a get the
look plus a lot of you guys voted on my
Instagram and for like who I should do a
video for next and she won so I'm really
excited I picked some really fun outfits
they're all very wearable very easy for
everyday and they want to pick any of
her crazy red carpet looks or anything
like that because you guys know I like
to make it wearable for you guys so if
you want to see how I cut herself for
less then just keep on watching okay so
for outfit number one this one I spotted
on her Instagram and loved because I
thought it was very simple but still
stood out so for the sweater crop top
I'm pretty sure I found the exact one
she has and I got it because it's
surprisingly super affordable my only
complaint about it is that it's super
any bitty tiny cropped like I'm wearing
a size medium for reference so yeah the
tanks up underneath is definitely needed
that is from H&amp;amp;M but I like how the
whole sweater layering looks in general
so I would do this even with a longer
sweater and then wear my jeans the one
she's wearing are these like fold-over
style that so far only one designer has
made they're really distinct so I
decided to go off of a similar wash so I
picked these at light wash denim jeans
from ASOS I like how they have the seam
down the front because it still kind of
stood out as something different than a
normal gene which is kind of what she
had and then for my shoes I just wore
some beige ones from tony bianco that I
already had owned I definitely recommend
having just one pair of black and one
pair of beige in your closet so you can
just pull from your own wardrobe but if
you're looking for ones I definitely
would recommend the tony bianco ones
now I know how much you guys like price
comparison so I thought I would lay it
all out for you here as you can see
you're gonna be saving a lot of money if
you go more my route but if you are
interested in any of her exact pieces
you can look on the left okay I chose
outfit number two because it looked so
cozy issues so cute in it and you guys
know I love my comfortable outfits so
for this one this one is actually a kind
of a challenge because the sweater was
so unique like the way it was printed so
I kind of just searched keywords of the
colors and then up coming across this
one from Urban Outfitters it has the red
the black the beige or like the tan
color so I thought it gave off a very
similar look now for her full outfit
which you guys will see at the end of
the price comparison she's wearing over
the knee boots
I think she's worn this sweater a couple
times so she might have done it a couple
different ways but I decided to switch
it up you guys know and might get the
look videos I always tell you guys to
put your own spin on it and wear stuff
that you feel comfortable in
I don't wear over-the-knee boots too
often so I decided to wear at these
leather leggings from Zara and then my
tony bianco black booties you know I
love them and then for the Hat these
things are everywhere especially in
black so I just wore one that I've had
for a few years now but they sell these
everywhere for super cheap I have one
recommended in the price comparison
coming up next so I had to guess on her
shoes by what she's previously worn but
if you want her look it's gonna cost you
around $3,000 whereas mine depending on
if you have some of the key items it
should only cost you less than 100 this
next look I thought would be perfect for
the springtime I love how cute and
casual it is it involves bear legs so
you know your gross free sit outside in
New York filming this but I think it's
really cute for the upcoming season so
in the caption she said that she's
actually wearing her boyfriend's shirt
so I thought I would give you guys an
option that's actually a sweater dress -
from Lulu's I love it I love the ties on
the sleeves you could also wear this
with tights I think would be really cute
so she had it belted I just used a black
belt that I already had owned that one's
from mango and then for her purse hers
is a designer bag but I found this one
from Lulu's that has
similar shape and color to it so I
thought it was really cute especially if
you don't feel like sliding down a bag
and then for my shoes these were the
spendy or items I really wanted to get
something that were it was as close to
hers as I could get with the studs so
mine are from senso so this one was hard
to get an exact price comparison because
I didn't know her dress or shirt or
whatever um but between the bag and the
shoes it's pretty pricy so as you can
see you'll save some money if you go the
Lulu's route okay I knew I wanted to do
outfit number four because I love love
love pops of red and this one I thought
was really fun to kind of add my own
spin on it because her outfit definitely
was a little bit more holiday focused a
little bit fancier so I kind of wanted
to tone it down and make it a little bit
more wearable so that's what I did but
first I was so excited that I found this
sweater her sweater is a designer one
and it's crazy expensive so when I found
this on mango I was freaking out because
I'm not even kidding you and it even has
the same details on the shoulder it's
like the little gold buttons it's crazy
how exact it is so instead of wearing
that with tights and over-the-knee boots
like she did I took decided to tone it
down a little bit and wear it with some
denim jeans because that's what I would
normally wear taking the day those are
from girlfriend denim and then for my
shoes I just wore some black booties to
kind of go with the vibe that she was
going for but I think overall the top
half especially is almost identical to
hers so for my earrings those were
actually super easy to find those are
from Kohl's
and then for my hat her hat is from lack
of color you guys know I love their hats
but I wanted to find something cheaper
for you guys so I found this one from
Topshop that looks pretty darn similar
and that's it so this is the price
comparison as you can see even if you
just wanted to buy the sweater alone to
look like hers you would be saving a ton
of money so
and last but not least outfit number
five I love this one because it's super
simple and probably the most wearable
day today in fact I've already worn this
outfit a few times because I love it
that much it's pretty simple as you can
see she was just wearing a white like
t-shirt quarter length the same t-shirt
but I had this white frilly top that I
thought kind of added a different twist
to it and I really like it so if you
have something a little bit nicer to go
you could wear this or just stick to a
plain white t-shirt and you would still
get the look so my half is from ASOS my
jeans are from girlfriend denim as are
hers so I really didn't save much money
there but denim jeans you can get pretty
much anywhere and then again with my
tony bianco beige booties
ci tells you you need them you'll use
them a ton and then my hat is from
Lulu's so here's the price comparison
this is one of those outfits that you
might only need one piece for so this is
where both of our things are from and
it's about is it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did be sure to give it a thumbs up
especially if you like me I get the lip
videos and you want me to keep doing
them also let me know in the comments
below if you guys had a favorite outfit
or who I should do a gift to look for
next so yeah I'll see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
