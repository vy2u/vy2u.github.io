channel today's video as you can tell is
going to be a Selena Gomez get the look
video and I'm really excited I love
these videos you guys love these videos
they're kind of like one of my LG series
on this channel and I'm really come to
do this one because Lena's kind of been
changing up her style she's a little bit
more retro it's been a year since I've
done one for her and I thought it would
be a perfect opportunity with
alternative music coming out and all of
the new like cover art and it's just
very different so I was really excited I
also thought it would be a great
opportunity to kind of change up the way
I do to get to love so what normally I
would go for like her everyday style or
like stuff she posts on Instagram or
like Candice of her which I am doing to
outfit for that but the rest of them I
decided to show you guys how to take
some of her new cover art or photo
shoots or stuff for her music videos and
show you guys how to make it more
wearable still achieve that style while
putting your own twist on it
so I noticed a lot of my comments on my
fall lookbook you I felt that the
voiceover was a little too rushed and
the video was like a little bit too to
the point if that makes sense so I'm
just talked through at the time try
something new so I'm going to begin with
what I normally do forget the looks and
do her kind of like everyday style or
stuff that she's been seen in the
paparazzi year on her Instagram and I'm
going to start off with this look and I
love this I think it's awesome she's
wearing a wrap dress it's a very simple
look very easy kind of very summery but
what I think is awesome about it you
could totally make it wearable for fall
by adding a jacket or maybe some
over-the-knee boots or anything like
that I even wear it to school University
probably since dress clothes are still
crazy now but anyway I think it's
awesome so how I found a dress that was
somewhat similar I decided to stick with
three elements the wrap dress Laurel and
I decided to stick with salute with some
fairy dress kind of at a blue tone to it
so the one I found is from
it looks like this it's a wrap dress
obviously and it's awesome it was super
super affordable and I thought it
matched the style of hers really well
obviously it had the wrap style the
floral is definitely different but I
hate have the same type of like cap
sleeves and just the style of it felt
very similar to me and hers was actually
vintage so it's not like I can even find
it on a website for you guys to give you
the exact one for the shoes I went on
boohoo such a great site it's super
affordable and they have a ton of style
and I found shoes that were very very
similar I went for a lower heel or more
of like level platform hers are very
high and I thought that making it a
little bit more level what made it more
wearable alright this looks number two
so this outfit you guys sent me a bunch
on Twitter and I absolutely love it it's
perfect to kind of transition into fall
so whether it's not as hot because it
involves denim jeans or high-waisted
girlfriend jeans whatever you want to
call them it's my favorite thing to wear
setting off with a main kind of event of
this outfit and that is the striped top
so I looked everywhere for her I will
have all of her exact outfit pieces
listed right here very expensive very
hard to recreate as far as getting it
exact so I just really stuck with the
kind of sleeveless striped top and I
found this one is from Urban Outfitters
I love it I think the colors are bright
and fun like hers it definitely does
have a texture material it's like knit
and hers is kind of a mohair it's very
fuzzy so sticking with that kind of
texture and stripes is going to give you
a very similar look and color so
obviously how I styled it was with some
high-waisted denim jeans that I already
have I bet you guys have these in your
closet whether you really only need one
pair of these but I just worked out that
I had from Reformation did some
high-waisted girlfriend denim jeans and
then for my shoes she was wearing mules
they were colored like orange cross
mules but iris had mules in my closet so
I have these ones from tony bianco
they're like just a tan color they're
not crazy colored because I felt lift at
my top was really bright whereas a lot
of her colors were more muted
and then forged sunglasses she was
wearing bright colored ones I just have
any like this so I just set this one of
my go-to sunglasses for the summer and
there's these cat eye ones from Urban
Outfitters I love them in gets a lot
videos but one of my main things I tell
you guys is to wear stuff that's your
style if you want to draw inspiration
from celebrities and other bloggers and
stuff that's amazing I even do that but
it's definitely important to stay true
to you and what you like and for me and
that was sticking to some of my pieces I
already had in my closet ok so now
moving on to one of my favorite photo
shoots she's ever done and that is the
vogue photo shoot she looked so stunning
in this I was obsessed with all the
pictures they were amazing and I knew
when I was going to do I get the look
video for her I wanted to recreate at
least one look so none of the looks
she's wearing a matte are wearable for
everyday at all so it was definitely a
challenge but I think my favorite look
was the one of her in the swimsuit and
that one for sure was hard I was going
to stick with a swimsuit style you guys
saw my week in my life where I was
talking about when I was hunting for it
I was going to stick with a swimsuit but
then I decided since and that's the end
of summer let's do something that's a
little bit even more wearable than a
swimsuit so I looked for a dress or a
romper so I got lucky and I found this
one from ASOS the brand is boohoo I
believe yep super affordable I think it
was like $30
but what really stuck out to me is the
mixed floral print they're similar
florals but the colors are different
which is the key thing in her swimsuit
photo that she was wearing she's wearing
a Tommy Hilfiger one it's sold out
already it sold out like immediately
after the shoot was posted so I wanted
to do something very similar that gave
off a similar look so I found this dress
I think it matches so well it's so comfy
and flowy perfect for kind of those
really hot summer days like I said you
could even dress this up for fall like a
brown jacket over this look amazing so
yeah I kind of stuck with that instead
of doing her like slicked back
photoshoot hair I just would for it
slick back bun with some hoop earrings
that I are showing from
not sinners you can go for the thicker
style if you really really want to go
exact but any coups will do and it will
give you a very similar similar look and
then for my choose in the photo shoot
she was wearing these like crazy
embroidered peep toe sandals which were
awesome obviously you would wear those
of the swimsuit it's a photo shoot so
obviously it's a little different so I
decided to just stick with what I know
and just do some white sneakers I
thought it would school it definitely
pulled inspiration from the shoot and it
looks very similar but it's a little bit
more toned down and more wearable which
is exactly what I want is going for now
let's talk about her music videos
because lately she's been killing it I
love the new style that she's doing it's
like very retro
so the first music video that I'm going
to talk about is bad liar because I
absolutely love that music video it was
so fun again I knew I wanted to pull
inspiration from that video to recreate
a look so I was trying to think of
something the school look that she did
was I could have done that it would have
been easy but I was like you know what
no we're going to go for the nightgown
because I love the nightgown I thought
it was a really fun dress
so obviously hers were pulled from
vintage I don't even know where it's
from and pretty sure it's like pulled
from a costume archive so I found one
from Topshop now Topshop can be kind of
expensive and you guys know forget the
local videos I try to keep it very
affordable
this one was but in specific I thought
it matched perfectly the cap please and
the way that is cut around the bust is
almost identical for her she has like a
tie here but the way it is it has a very
kind of throwback feel and style to it
so I knew instantly when I thought I was
a yes have these old kind of vintage
printed flowers all over it like daisies
mixed colors which is what she had the
only thing is that this is more a little
bit more pastel which is hers had more
of like a mustardy darker toned color to
it if that makes sense but overall I
thought it matched really well and
what's awesome about this is it's an
actual dress it's not a nightgown
so because like you wouldn't wear this
to bed right so you could just throw on
some I just wore the same mules from
before which or just can very simple and
one of my straw bags and I thought it
looked super cute very easy again
pouring the whole
transpiration but it's something you can
take out of your house okay and then
last but not least is the fetish music
video and it's one of the most recent I
think it's awesome I think she killed it
it was definitely very different for her
so I knew I wanted to recreate the two
looks from there because they were a
challenge so starting off with her
yellow dress
which is kind of eggs they're both
yellow but the one was a shopping bag so
kind of like promo photos for it that
one was so hard for me to find because
it definitely is like a vintage complete
style and with the cap sleeves the
buttons like you can't find a dress
anywhere like that unless it's like I'm
a messy vintage site which would not be
helpful for you guys at all so I thought
I would switch it up and I went on boo
boo and I was looking for just like
yellow light yellow dresses and I found
one which is what you see in the video
here I think it's awesome it has sleeves
which were which was a huge time because
finding dress dresses with sleeves like
that was really hard it's definitely
more low-cut but it has a similar cut
and style to it I work with some
platform shoes which are just from
superga already if onlys so the whole
outfit itself was really easy I thought
it gave off a very similar look but in
my opinion it's still not wearable
enough for me like I would not wear that
outfit out and I'm sure a lot of you
guys are kind of agreeing with me right
now
so that dress ended up selling out as
soon as I bought it which is actually
kind of good because I found another one
that looks like this from ASOS that's
more of a short shorter cut and it just
kind of has a more relaxed look to it
that you could wear a day to day wear it
was the same platform white sneakers and
you'd be good to go but on the other
yellow dress is so awesome I think it
was my favorite even more so than your
other look in the music video it has new
kind of like 3d flowers or embroidery it
just looks very couture very awesome so
I new look doing a stretch trying to
recreate that look or make it more
wearable but I ended up finding this
romper from NBD you can buy it off of
Lulu and Nordstrom it's very I think it
looks very similar it has kind of the
cutouts on the sleeves it has like a 3d
almost look to it like four is dead it
is a little bit more low-cut but that's
because it is a romper it's kind of
going for a very some summery feel
to it but I definitely think it works
for the love it gives a similar vibe it
is a little bit more on the pricey side
it's over a hundred dollars but it was
probably the best I could do to recreate
that look so yeah but anyways that is my
video for today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did be sure to give it
a thumbs up and let me know in the
comments below
