channel today's video is going to be my
first Halloween video and you guys know
I love Halloween videos they're just
really fun for me it's an excuse to
dress up I get my friends involved and
it's just it's just different from my
normal videos so it's fun for me so I
really hope you guys enjoy it but
today's video is going to be group
costumes I didn't do group costumes last
year so I thought it'd be a perfect
perfect excuse to do so plus I think
group costumes are just more fun because
you get to dress up with your friends
and yeah so let's get started okay so if
you've been watching my week in my life
you know that Pat and I are obsessed
with the walking dead and it's coming
back soon so I thought it would be a
perfect opportunity to show you guys a
great costume that I think is so badass
I love it and most of the stuff you can
find in your own closet besides a few
simple pieces so if you feel like going
all out with your friend group this year
this is a really good costume for you so
starting off with Rick we kind of chose
the main characters the only thing you
really need to get is officer style
shirt or like a utility shirt he's a
sheriff in the show so or was so that
kind of is his distinct look I know he's
kind of straight away from that but this
one will definitely be recognizable and
then we added some spray blood just for
dramatic effect that's obviously
optional so then for Carl this is
actually played by Julia which is so
funny but Carl in the show has long hair
and Julia looked perfect for it so she
decided to do Carl and what you need for
this the main pieces are a blue flannel
that's kind of his a signature look with
a hat and then lately in these last
seasons he has an eyepatch so that will
definitely make you stand out and be
pretty recognizable as Carl so then
moving on to Daryl this one is played by
Pat and I think he looks like such a
good Daryl this one is super easy as
well in fact all of the stuff Pat had in
his own closet except for the vest which
I got off of Amazon in the show Daryl
wears a vest it's kind of like his
signature so it's definitely something
that'll make them stand out and then of
course if you have long hair to put that
in front of an eye that will pretty
Sealand Darrell besides the crossbow
which we bought a fake one obviously
from Amazon that we spray-painted black
and I think he looks awesome
okay so for my character I chose Rosita
there's a lot of girl characters on the
show so you kind of have a lot to choose
from I chose this one because I feel
like it's very walking dead looking like
she's a very recognizable character with
her pigtails and her hatched so that's
like the main thing I would wear if you
were being Rosita everything else I
found in my own closet so I had a shirt
of everything that they wear in the show
is pretty neutral always wear like some
sort of combat boots remember you're
fighting zombies so I think it just
looks cute in general you don't have to
go over the top with it and then I cut
off some fingers of gloves to make them
fingerless and then rubbed eyeshadow all
over myself to make it look like dirt
and lastly at the villain of all
villains Meighan his costume is super
recognizable and a really popular one
this year because that's where we found
the bat was at a Halloween costume shop
they have them all over the place it's
obviously not real it's like a foam bat
but that's Lucy oh that's like your most
recognizable piece for this costume
along with that of the leather jacket
pants and boots which most likely can be
found in your own closet and then the
red scarf we bought from Amazon and her
usual we will have or I will have all of
these linked in the description box
below so that's it you'll have yourself
an epic walking dead group costume
there's no limit to how many people can
be in this you can even add zombies I
did a zombie tutorial a while back that
would work perfect for this and I think
you guys would look epic
okay so let's talk about Riverdale
because everyone's talking about
Riverdale and excited for it to come
back on so I thought it would be a
perfect opportunity to show you guys the
group costume or just outfits inspired
by it but I think it would look a pick
if you and your friends dressed up like
this
for Halloween plus you can keep the
clothes when you're done with it so
let's start off with Cheryl this is
really easy she wears a lot of dark
colors but definitely has a lot of red
in her wardrobe so I decided to go with
a red skirt
pretty much the whole outfit except for
the boots is from Lulu's I will have as
much as I can it linked below so then
for the top I went for a lacy top I
thought that that was very Cheryl if you
wanted to go all out you could get a
cherry pin from Amazon and pin that on
and I think you'd be super recognizable
and then of course I just wore some over
the knee boots okay so now let's talk
about Archie this one is really awesome
because it only involves one key piece
and that is the varsity jacket I will
have the exact one listed below with
some other options I think you could
totally make this co-ed meaning like
guys and girls in the group costume I
just had me when I was shooting this so
I did it for all girls but of course you
can modify it accordingly so then for
the rest of my outfit I just wore a
black bodysuit underneath it you can
change this color as many times as you
want and then I just wore some jeans
with some basic white sneakers okay so
for Veronica she has definitely a dark
color palette when it comes to her
wardrobe so I kind of stuck stuck with
the whole plaid skirt high neck top I
feel like she always wears stuff like
that and then the key thing is the pearl
necklace so I had that already in my
closet but I will link some other ones
below for my top and my skirt those are
both from ASOS I feel like having this
type of look for Veronica will
definitely set you apart from a lot of
her other looks besides maybe her peter
pan collar looks I think that that would
be a good option as well like I said
before if you have people that look like
the characters this is gonna be much
more recognizable or you can just draw
inspiration for your everyday wear for
Betty the main things you need are a
cardigan and your hair up in a ponytail
so that's exactly what I did for my
light pink cardigan that is from ASOS it
has some ruffles on the side I thought
it was very Betty and then
for my hair I just put it up in a
ponytail and curled the ends my short
hair now would have worked way better
but when I film this I hadn't cut it yet
so whatever but for the rest of the
outfit I just wore a silk camisole she
also wears like polka dots something
that's very retro is very Betty so then
I would just wore some high-waisted dark
denim jeans and then some white sneakers
and last but not least we have Jughead
and I think this one is my favorite
costume or outfit because it's something
that I would probably wear but I love it
so for his outfit obviously you need a
gray be me some sort of hat that looks
like his and then for the jacket I got
that from ASOS it has like a shearling
type of collar which is exactly what he
has and then some plaid shirts
underneath it any type of cloud would
work he kind of sticks to the darker
colors like grays and blacks I just wore
some black jeans I already own and then
some combat boots peal things to make it
a little bit more girly but obviously if
you want it to not be heels you totally
have that option so after that that's
done you have a full Riverdale look if
you want to just do it for your own
closet that's totally cool or you can
have all of your friends dress up as it
and then you would look like the cast
which would be really awesome
okay yes cheetah girls I am so excited
for this I watched this growing up for
so long and I choose one of my favorite
movies I can't believe I haven't
recreated it yet so you guys know these
are my best friends you see them in all
my vlogs and all of that so I thought
it'd be a really fun excuse to get
together and dress up as the Cheetah
Girls for this video it's super easy all
you need are these velour tracksuits in
the colors purple pink blue and yellow
to make up the Cheetah Girls and then
for our cheetah headbands we got those
from Amazon again I will have all of our
outfits linked below but this one is so
fun I think you guys are old enough now
or you don't go trick-or-treating but if
you do this is a really good option it's
also school appropriate but more
importantly it's just a comfy costume
that's super easy so even if you are
going to a Halloween party you guys will
be super recognizable and you'll be
comfy which is awesome so yeah I love
this costume I think it is a really fun
and actually kind of underrated
okay spacejam loves this movie it's
definitely a popular costume but why I
wanted to include it is because I think
it would be an epic costume for college
kids any type of person can obviously do
this but when I was in college I would
have done something like this with my
girlfriends because there's no limit to
how many you can obviously do the
characters of toon squad if you wants
you but or you could just be the toon
squad with all the same jerseys and add
like fun accessories and I think you
guys would look super cute it's very
easy it's a DIY and I remember being in
college and wanting to just have
something super simple with my
girlfriends so this I think would be
perfect for it instead of buying the
expensive jerseys idi wide mine instead
of showing you the DIY I'm going to link
Jay Bundy's video she's amazing and does
awesome transformations she actually
showed me how to do the like transfer
sheets of this toon squad logo so
instead of showing you I'm gonna force
you to watch her ease because she
definitely deserves it but yeah I love
this one and I definitely think you and
your friends should do it because I
think it's super cute but that is it for
my group costume video I really hope you
guys enjoy it and got some new ideas for
you and your squad to like do something
for
that would be cool let me know in the
comments below which one was your
favorite or which one you would most
likely do and stay tuned I have a few
more Halloween videos coming up so be on
the lookout for that and I will see you
guys in my next video
