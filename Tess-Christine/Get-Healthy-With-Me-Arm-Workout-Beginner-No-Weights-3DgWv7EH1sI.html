another get healthy with me video now
don't think I forgot about this series
because I definitely did not I was just
getting a ton of requests for other type
of videos so I kind of took a little
break and now I'm back to doing them if
you are new to this series I basically
just do a get healthy with me food and
workout type videos super casual super
beginner and nothing too drastic or
crazy I've already done it at home but
abs and leg workout and I was looking at
all those videos on other requests for
an at-home workout and a ton of you guys
were saying arms now arms this is a very
very emphasis on the get healthy with me
because arms is never something that I
chose to really work on and focus on I
was more of like oh I really want to
tone my legs and my butt and my abs and
that's what I want to focus on and so I
would mainly do that kind of stuff at
home or at the gym but arms is really
important so I found a routine on
Pinterest awhile ago that I really like
it's very very beginner now if you're
somebody that's looking for an at-home
workout that's intense
really really toning your arms this
video is not for you it's perfect for
those of you who are just starting out
in your arms like I am and just want
some quick and easy steps to get your
arms kind of like ready for more of an
intense workout later on when you're
getting more into your workout routine I
think it's effective and I think you
guys will all really enjoy it so before
I keep talking let's just get right into
the video so the first exercise I'm
going to start with our arm swings
basically you're going to do 20 of them
total 10 towards the front and 10
towards the back they're pretty
self-explanatory once you see me do that
but basically this is just gonna warm up
your entire my arm muscles
while also working your back muscles and
your shoulder so it's just going to kind
of get your arms ready for the workout
while still doing something in the
meantime
this next exercise is called arm circles
you're going to do a 10 towards the
front and 10 towards the back again all
you're going to do for this exercise is
you're basically creating a little tiny
air circles with your arms or your
fingers so some are going to be going
clockwise and some counter clockwise for
the rotation but you're just going to
make sure your
arms are really tight and for him to
really feel this exercise and trust me
guys this burns for this next one I'm
just getting on to my hands and knees
and I'm going to do 10 at kneeling
push-ups this is just a modified push-up
from the regular one it's a little bit
easier but man do you feel it I promise
if you're not used to doing this you
definitely will you want to make sure
your back is as straight as you can get
it and you're not pushing your butt down
using all of your muscles in your arms
to really push yourself up and down
what's up hey it's almost a change okay
so for this next exercise you're going
to do five chair dips so all you're
going to do is get a stable chair like
so place your hands on the end of the
chair and then with your feet together
and your knees together you're just
going to use your arms to push yourself
up and down trying to get as close to
the floor as you can this really is
going to work your triceps moving on
you're now going to do a 15-second plank
now I absolutely hate planks so this is
my least favorite part but you're going
to get into a position like so hold for
15 seconds and this is also going to
work your abs so it's a bonus now it's
time to repeat some of the exercises
that we did earlier so now you're going
to get back down and you're going to do
10 kneeling push-ups again same form
same way you did them before
now I'm grabbing the chair again and I'm
going to do another five chair dips you
also can add a leg up if you want to to
make it a little bit more challenging
but I'm going to stick to the original
ones now back to the arm swings you're
going to do the same thing as we did in
the beginning of the workout you're
going to do a ten towards the front and
then a ten reversed towards the back
to finish off this routine you're going
to finish with 20 arm circles again
you're just going to do 10 rotating
clockwise and 10 rotating a
counterclockwise and that's it you guys
seriously this workout is perfect for
beginners because it really helps your
muscles get introduced the idea of
working out and toning and prepped for a
more advanced workout later on in your
workout routine so of course you're
going to want to finish by stretching
out your muscles because it's always
good to finish with that but that is my
video for today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and I will see you guys next
time
