another get healthy with me video I know
you guys love these videos so I'm trying
to do them more frequently but I still
want to keep my beauty videos mixed in
there so I'm trying to go on like a
little schedule type thing I don't know
it's kind of working I kind of like it
as you guys can tell by the title
today's video is all about breakfast
foods I absolutely love breakfast it's
my favorite meal of the day so I thought
I would share with you guys some things
that I eat for breakfast that are a
little bit more on the healthier side
versus some things that are a little bit
more fatty and greasy breakfast foods
this is a little bit more nutritious and
delicious if you are interested on this
video then just keep on watching so to
begin I'm going to share with you guys
some things that I like to eat when I'm
on the go and don't have time to sit
down for breakfast so today I'm going to
share with you one of my favorite muffin
recipes which are banana and peanut
butter this recipe is super easy because
there's only a few ingredients all
you're going to need is 1/4 of a cup of
uncooked oatmeal then you're going to
use 1 teaspoon of baking powder and then
you're going to mash up one banana
moving on to the peanut butter I'm going
to put in two tablespoons of peanut
butter you can also use almond butter or
Sun butter if you're allergic to nuts
next I'm putting in one egg and then
half of a cup of egg whites now after
you've combined all of that into a bowl
and now this is optional but I'm going
to put in some protein powder just one
scoop of just a nutritional powder mix
just for added protein next all you're
going to do is blend that all together
with a mixer until you get kind of like
a creamy consistency the oatmeal still
is good still going to show but it's
going to be more like a batter like
consistency so now after you filled your
muffin cups and a huge thing is to
grease your muffin cups you're going to
fill them all the way almost to the top
with batter and then I'm going to crunch
up the banana chips and put them on to
the top for some added crunch this is
obviously optional but I just think it
taste so yummy this way now all you're
going to do is put it into a 350 degree
oven for about 12 minutes and you're
going to get these you're going to see
if they're golden brown on top and then
they will be perfect now if I'm grabbing
breakfast out the door one muffin is not
going to fill me up so I like to have a
juice if I don't have time to blend my
own juice I really love naked juices
they're just really really delicious so
these three flavors are my favorite this
one is kind of like the smoothie that I
already make it has a bunch of greens in
it
this tastes identical to chocolate milk
and then this is just like a regular
fruit smoothie it's perfect just to grab
and go when you're walking out the door
moving on to some quick and easy
breakfast meals that are just perfect if
you want to sit down and have something
quick to eat my go-to thing is oatmeal I
love these two I get them in specific I
mainly get the weight control kind
because it has the banana bread flavor
which is my favorite and I haven't seen
other ones have that flavor another
thing that I like to do is add water it
just cuts down the calories a little bit
and instead of milk it's a little bit
better for you um but oatmeal is really
great it helps lower cholesterol it's
high in fiber and it helps you keep
fuller longer which is perfect if you
are trying to lose weight another thing
I like to do is add blueberries
blueberries are really great for you and
they also help make the oatmeal not so
bland and add a little bit of flavor to
it moving on to another one of my
favorites which is Greek yogurt Greek
yogurt is really great for you because
it contains a lot of probiotic cultures
and a lot of calcium and vitamins it
also has a lot more protein than regular
yogurt which is perfect if you're trying
to lose weight because it'll help you
keep fuller longer I purchased my Greek
yogurt in the organic section of the
grocery store along with this granola
it's just a natural vanilla almond
granola it tastes so good in my yogurt
and adds a nice crunch I also like to
add blueberries and raspberries to
sweeten it up and make it taste
delicious
these next two are for when I have a
little bit longer to cook and eat
breakfast this one is by far my favorite
it's just an egg white pita pocket thing
basically all I'm doing is heating up
some coconut oil this is much better for
you than butter and I'm just going to
melt that and then I'm going to begin
cooking my egg whites how I like cooking
the egg whites is I just kind of sift
the two eggs or the yolk through the
shells it just makes it easier to get
the egg whites out it might take some
practice but it works and egg whites are
fat-free and they're a little bit better
for you than the yolk I also like to add
pepper for some flavor and then since a
little bit of my egg white got away from
me I flipped it on top and then flip the
egg white over now I'm going to add some
spinach not only do I like how it tastes
but it's actually really good for you
it's an anti-inflammatory and it's full
of vitamins and minerals that are just
really good for you so I just put that
in the bottom of the pan to wilt it a
little bit and then placed it on top of
the egg whites and now I'm going to
begin cutting my avocado
avocados are packed with nutrients that
are super healthy for you and really
great for your skin how I like to do
this is I usually just take a spoon and
scoop it into the skin of the avocado
and it pops right out it's always been
super easy for me if avocados ripe
enough and then I just slice it avocados
are also really great if you're a
vegetarian because it contains a lot of
healthy fats that is great for a meat
substitute I also really like to add
cherry tomatoes cherry tomatoes just
taste so yummy tomatoes in itself are
really great for you but I think they
add just such a great flavor to the pita
so it's not so bland so basically all
I'm doing is I'm taking the egg white
and spinach that I made earlier and I'm
just going to pop that into the pita
pocket along with the avocado and then
of course the tomatoes this takes
literally seconds to make it's so easy
and so quick and it's super handy
because it's all in like this pita
pocket so all you have to do is pick it
up and enjoy it super yummy definitely
one of my favorites lastly for a
breakfast classic which is pancakes I'm
going to show you guys how to make
banana chocolate chip pancakes that are
much healthier all you're going to need
is 1/2 a cup of oats and then half a
banana you can also use applesauce and
cinnamon for a completely different
flavor 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla and
then 2 egg whites this is super easy to
make you can also double the recipe
which is what I did and it'll give you
about three to four pancakes versus one
to two with just the normal survey so
now all I'm going to do is put it on a
magic bullet or this in this case a
nutribullet but you can totally use a
blender and you're just going to blend
it all up for I don't know about two to
three minutes until it's blended and you
get this kind of batter like consistency
that's very similar to pancake batter
now it's time to get the griddle or you
can use a pan - whichever works and
you're just going to pour the batter
directly onto the griddle or the pan and
two circles I would have made mine
thinner I don't know why I made them
this thick but I did so there's that and
now I'm going to add some dark chocolate
chips and you're probably thinking what
the heck that's not healthy but actually
dark chocolate is full of vitamins and
minerals and antioxidants and I don't
believe in depriving yourself just in
moderation because who doesn't love
chocolate especially chocolate chip
pancakes so once they're done cooking
and you get kind of a golden brown color
right now I just put them on a plate and
added some oats this was kind of for
decoration but a tasted really yummy and
then I love to add blueberries to just
about anything and then of course some
low-fat syrup these are so so delicious
and there's so much better view than
regular pancakes because they don't have
all that flour and sugar that those have
it's just a much healthier alternative
but yeah that's it for this get healthy
with me breakfast edition I really hope
you guys enjoyed it if you try out any
of these foods be sure to send me a
photo and as always I'll see you guys
next time
