get healthy with me video as you guys
know my last get healthy with me video
was my leg workout so now it's time for
a food video since I alternate them food
workout food work out I asked you guys
on my last food get healthy with me
video which was lunch salads what you
guys wanted me to do next as far as food
goes and I got a ton of requests for
dessert so I was all about that because
I love desserts at the biggest sweet
tooth you guys ever I was super excited
to do this video for you guys because I
totally believe that you should deprive
yourself of things like desserts I think
you should just have them in moderation
because no one wants to give up
chocolate right or sweets so today's
video I'm going to show you guys four
desserts that are definitely more on the
healthier side I know some of you health
experts out there might disagree with me
and say that some of them are not that
healthy but I think that they are
healthier than a lot of the other
desserts out there that you could
possibly eat or get so I don't feel
guilty eating them and I don't think you
guys should feel guilty about it either
so if you are interested at all in this
video then of course just keep on
watching
okay so first I'm gonna show you guys
how to make chocolate chip cookie
popsicles because they're perfect for
the summer a little bit about them
they're vegan gluten free and refined
sugar for you for those that are
interested so first I'm going to take
one and a half cups of coconut milk and
put that into a saucepan and then I'm
also going to take 3/4 cup almond milk
or any type of non-dairy milk and place
that into a saucepan as well now I'm
taking 1/2 cup unrefined coconut sugar
and putting that into the mixture as
well along with 1 tablespoon of vanilla
extract and then I'm going to turn my
stove on to low and I'm just going to
basically continue stirring the mixture
until all of the sugar is dissolved
now I'm just going to take my popsicle
molds and I'm going to fill them with
chocolate chips I'm just using these
mini chips which are dairy nut and soy
free but any chocolate chips will really
work so I'm just going to fill them
about 1/4 of the way on the bottom just
so the bottoms are covered and totally
go crazy with chocolate chips or you can
just leave them to the bottom and now I
put the mixture that I had from the
saucepan into this cup just to make
pouring easier but basically you're
going to fill the popsicle molds till
almost to the top not fully to the top
but pretty close to the top now this
mixture made about 8 popsicles so I'm
going to do is put them into the freezer
for about an hour until they're kind of
semi frozen and then you're gonna pull
them out and while they're still kind of
liquidy you're going to place some more
chocolate chips in there and then of
course put the tops on and then put them
back into the freezer to freeze even
more until they are completely solid
then you're going to take them out and
they are going to be perfect and
delicious so yummy I loved these now I'm
going to show you guys how to make a
berry sorbet or kind of like a sherbert
type thing so all you're going to need
is a blender some frozen fruit Greek
yogurt and some berries so all I'm going
to do is take the frozen fruit and place
that into my mixer and what's great
about this is it's totally customizable
so you can use whatever type of frozen
fruit you want and now I'm taking a
couple scoops of Greek yogurt I have
honey in mine but if you don't add some
honey because it eliminates the tartness
of it and then I'm also going to put a
little bit of water in it and then place
it on my blender making sure to shake it
up in intervals because it is going to
be thicker so once you're happy with the
thick consistency that you have you're
just going to scoop it out into a bowl
and pretty much enjoy mine was a little
bit runny err that I liked but it was
still delicious it tastes the same
nonetheless so I like to add a few other
berries on to it and while it's done and
it's so yummy now I'm going to show you
guys how to make chocolate peanut butter
banana bites and these were definitely
the popular one amongst my friends so
you have to try them they're so good but
all I'm gonna do is take a banana and
I'm basically just going to cut it into
slices now you might recognize this from
my healthy with me snack video but this
time I'm adding chocolate because it's
desserts and it is so good so I'm doing
is
placing them into pairs I believe I use
two bananas for the amount that I had
and now I'm going to use powdered peanut
butter this time because last time I use
almond butter but this is actually
really really good for you so I thought
I'd give it a try it's way less fat and
way less calories so basically I'm going
to do is add some water to the powder
and it turns into peanut butter
consistency is actually really awesome
so now all I'm doing is placing peanut
butter on one half of the banana pairs
and then I'm just flipping them over
creating these little banana sandwiches
so once you have them all hooked over
and prepared you're going to place them
into the freezer like so for a couple
hours you really want them firm before
you dip them in chocolate now I only
filmed apparently two bananas being
dipped in chocolate but it's pretty
self-explanatory so all you're going to
do is put them back into the freezer
until they're hard and voila they're
done they're so delicious these are
definitely my favorite moving on to the
last one which is fruit pizza this is
another one of my favorites all you're
going to do is start with 3/4 cup oats
and you're going to place that into a
blender and all you're going to do is
grind that up really really finely in
turn until it turns into a flower light
consistency now into the bowl I'm just
putting a 1/3 cup almond flour and then
I'm also going to put 1/4 TSP of
cinnamon and 1/4 TSP of stevia or Truvia
sweetener then I'm going to take 1
tablespoon of coconut oil and place that
in there as well and then 3 tablespoons
of almond milk now all I'm gonna do is
take a fork and mix that up really
really well it would have been way
easier if I would have just put this
into a bowl and mixed it but I was being
difficult and I made it difficult on
myself but once it's all mixed you're
just going to grease a cookie sheet or
put it on to a pie pan and you're just
going to spread it out I doubled the
crust recipe to make the size that I
have right now and I'm just spreading it
out thinly and then I'm going to put it
into a 350 degree oven for 12 to 15
minutes and then after that I'm going to
take it out and let it cool and now work
on the frosting now for this
quote-unquote frosting I just eyeball
this completely so I just do a probably
two or three scoops of this plain a
Greek yogurt and then I'm
a little bit of vanilla a couple dashes
of cinnamon and I'm just going to stir
that up and it makes a really really
good frosting that's actually pretty
good for you now I just cut up some of
my favorite fruits I wish I would have
had Kiwi but I didn't and I just
transfer it at the crust onto a separate
plate once it was completely cooled and
now I'm just going to spread that
frosting that I made all over it up
until the edges because it's so good
with the fruit and then you can just
pretty much get creative with it I just
started with the strawberries first
because strawberries are my favorite and
then I went with bananas and then
blueberries and raspberries but like I
said totally customizable you can use
whatever fruit you so please
it's just good regardless and that's it
for my fruit pizza or pie whatever you
want to call it now all you have to do
is cut yourself a slice put it onto a
plate and enjoy it I love it because you
get a little bit of fruit in each bite
so yummy and I just love this one but
that's the video for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it be sure to give me a
thumbs up if you enjoy my healthy
