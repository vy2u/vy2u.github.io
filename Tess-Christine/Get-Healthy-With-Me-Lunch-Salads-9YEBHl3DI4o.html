get healthy with me video if you haven't
figured it out by now I get healthy with
me videos kind of alternate so I do like
food then workout food then workout so
today's video is going to be a food
video and I was looking at my last one
which was breakfast I believe and a lot
of you guys are requesting lunch ideas
so I was thinking about what I like to
eat for lunch and salads kept popping
into my head because I'm always eating
salads so I picked about three different
ones that I think I make the most
frequently and that are my favorites
that I keep coming back to and I want to
show you guys how I make those today so
if you want to try them at home you can
I do want to add something a little
blurb I guess so as you guys know this
series is called get healthy with with
me I think the emphasis on the width
really needs to be there because I've
been getting a lot of comments like well
not a lot just a few like I'm my butt
workout like oh she doesn't even have a
butt which is totally cool I probably
don't the series isn't like I have a god
gift body and I'm going to show you guys
how I get it no I don't I'm working into
a healthier lifestyle because if I could
right now I would dive into the biggest
cheeseburger I can find um so this is
new for me as well we're going to get
all bootylicious and abolition together
so just keep that in mind now let's get
on to the salad video which I'm super
excited about okay so starting out I'm
going to show you guys how to make a
zesty quinoa salad I love this so much
it's so delicious all you're gonna need
is quinoa I love using red quinoa quinoa
is really really great for you it's full
of protein it's gluten free high in
amino acids and it's really low in
calorie too so it's good for weight
control so all you're going to do is
take 1 cup of quinoa with 2 cups of
water bring it to a boil and then turn
the heat down cover and let it simmer
until all the water is pretty much gone
so while that's doing that I like to
work on the dressing so all you're going
to need is olive oil ground cumin lime
juice sea salt and red pepper
so starting out I'm going to add 1/4 cup
extra virgin olive oil into just a small
bowl and then I'm going to add 1
teaspoon of salt and then I'm going to
add 2 teaspoons of ground cumin next I
like to just eyeball some lime juice but
it's pretty much equivalent to 2 limes
juiced and then I'm going to add half a
teaspoon of red pepper flakes or more to
taste and then with a fork I'm just
going to kind of mix that all together
and then set aside and work on the rest
of the ingredients so now I'm going to
check on my quinoa so I'm just going to
lift it up and stir it around and as you
can see there's still some water in
there so obviously it's not ready yet so
I'm going to cover again and now work on
the rest of the ingredients
so our going to be is cherry tomatoes
green onions black beans and cilantro
for the cherry tomatoes all you're going
to do is slice them in half and it's
going to be equivalent to about one and
a half cups you can always add more to
taste I love cherry tomatoes so I always
add a few more shout-out to my roommate
Alex for doing this quinoa salad while I
filmed just so it was easier in case
you're wondering whose hands those were
but now I am or alex is just chopping up
five green onions finely chopping them
and then just setting the side in a bowl
so after that I'm going to check on my
quinoa and once I see that all the water
has pretty much been evaporated that
means it's good to go and now I'm going
to place that into a large bowl and this
makes a huge serving so you can save it
for later but once it's been completely
pretty much cooled off I'm going to
start adding the ingredients so I'm
going to add the tomatoes mix that up
and then I'm going to add black beans
which have been drained and rinsed so
don't forget that part and now of course
adding the green onions now for the
cilantro you're just going to finely
chop some cilantro equivalent to about
1/4 cup we just picked them off the
stems because it was easier but you can
finely chop them if you so please all
are going to do that is add to the salad
mix up and now it's time to grab the
dressing that we made earlier and
drizzle that all over the salad and mix
and once you've completed that it's done
it's so delicious it looks kind of
deceiving and a little weird but I
promise you it's so good and it lasts
about two to three days in the
refrigerator
this next salad is kind of an easy one
it's just a basic garden salad but I
find myself making this quite a lot it's
just really great for you because of all
the fresh ingredients that it does have
so all I'm doing is I'm adding some
iceberg lettuce this is just the lettuce
I prefer to use especially when
I'm making a garden salad so I'm just
chopping that up and putting that onto a
plate next I'm adding a cucumber and
cucumbers are really great for
rehydrating your body and replenishing
daily vitamins and they're also a great
aid in digestion so their overall just
really great for you so I'm just
chopping that up finely and adding that
to my salad to make it easier to eat
next I'm adding my cherry tomatoes
because I absolutely love these so I'm
just cutting these into force and then
putting those onto my salad next to make
some protein into my salad I'm going to
add a hard-boiled egg hard-boiled eggs
are full of good fats to keep you heart
healthy and they're also full of
vitamins to help protect your eyes and
keep your bones really strong next I
love to add an avocado I just think they
taste really really yummy and they also
are very good for you they're full of
protein vitamins and minerals and a lot
of dietary fiber which is great
especially for weight management so I
just like to like to add that to the
side and then of course I'm gonna add
some carrots just a little bit to the
side there as well and then now I'm
going to add some sunflower seeds and I
don't know I just like the way they
taste and they give a nice crunch and I
couldn't give up my croutons so I just
found some organic seasoned croutons and
I just placed a few of those on top and
now for dressing French dressing has
always been my favorite so I just picked
up some organic French dressing with all
natural ingredients and I'm just gonna
drizzle a little bit of that on top and
that's it I love it I think it's so
yummy and it's perfect for lunch moving
on to the last salad this is a berry
salad it's so yummy and I definitely
reminds me of summer every time I eat it
these are the ingredients that you're
going to need there's not too many but I
am going to show you guys how to make
the lime basil vinaigrette first so to
make this dressing you are going to need
a food processor blender or a
nutribullet if you have it to make the
dressings that's I'll blend it up nicely
so first I'm just adding a half a cup of
extra virgin olive oil next I'm adding a
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil and now I'm
going to add a 1 tbsp of a lime zest
next you're going to need 1/4 cup lime
juice but I just eyeballed this and just
squeezed both of the limes in there
lastly you're just going to add one
tablespoon honey and I'm just using raw
local honey now I'm just going to put it
on the nutribullet and blend until it's
nice and smooth the same goes for if
you're using a blender as well it's
going to be this really bright vibrant
and green color but I promise you it
tastes delicious and you can keep it in
the fridge so I'm just putting a lid on
it and I'm going to store it in there
while I make the rest of my salad the
base of the salad is going to be spinach
and spinach is just really great for
your health overall but it's also really
great for your skin and your hair so now
I'm going to add some strawberries that
I just thinly sliced to the top of the
salad and now I'm going to add some
blueberries as well and then of course
raspberries it's full of my favorite
fruits I love this so much
next and adding some crumbled goat
cheese and goat cheese is relatively low
in calorie and fat in comparison to
cheese made out of cow's milk and it's
also really great for helping to boost
metabolism so bonus now I am gonna add
some grilled chicken because this salad
wasn't hardy enough for lunch and I like
to eat a little bit more during the
lunch because you have more time to burn
it off throughout the day I was making
two because my roommate wanted one as
well but I just quickly grilled up some
chicken and I'm just going to slice that
up and cut that into pieces so it's
easier to eat on my salad it just makes
the salad a little bit harder and a
little bit more suitable to last you
throughout the day now it's time to add
the dressing so I'm just going to take
that out of the fridge unscrew it and
drizzle a little bit on there you really
don't need much to cover this salad so
it's definitely usable for a second day
or a third day even it's so yummy don't
mind the color it blends in you won't
even see it but it tastes so delicious
and I don't know I think this is
definitely one of my favorite salads and
I eat it so much during the summer but
that is it for the video today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you try out
any of these salads be sure to let me
know and also give me a thumbs up if you
enjoyed these healthy cooking videos
that I'm doing and yeah I will see you
guys in my next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
