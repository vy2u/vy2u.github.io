video is going to be a get healthy with
me video this was very highly requested
and as you guys can tell by the title
it's my ab workout like I said in a lot
of my get healthy with me videos I'm not
a fitness professional so this routine
was not just magically created by my
brain I would not know where to start in
making an ab workout I would just do
basic crunches and be like yes I went on
the YouTube and I found myself a great
ab workout a while back so I have to
give credit where credit is due and the
lovely ladies of tone it up aka Katrina
and Kareena they have great workout
videos so if you're looking for like at
home DVDs they make great ones so check
that out but I'm not going to waste any
more of your time and I'm going to get
directly into the video so if you are
interested at all in my ab routine then
just keep on watching so the first thing
I'm doing is warming up my waist by
putting my arms out like so and then
stretching over slightly this is really
just gonna stretch out your waist and
get it ready for the main workout plus
you're going to look like a funny robot
the next thing I'm doing is me raise and
twist all I'm doing is putting my arms
like this in an upside-down V and I'm
just twisting over raising my knee
accordingly um this isn't like a full-on
like sweat burn ab workout it just kind
of gets it ready it stretches out your
waist and you can really feel it in your
sides and like love-handle areas which
is perfect because the ground exercises
you don't feel it there as much the next
thing I'm doing our dips and I'm going
to do this 20 times and all you're going
to do is get into the crab-like position
and then all you're going to do is dip
down and lift your leg as you dip down
so you're going to obviously as you can
see switch legs as you do so and you're
really going to feel this in your abs
because you really need it to like bring
your body back up you're also going to
feel this in your arms which is a bonus
workout the next exercise that I'm doing
is called tummy tucks and basically all
you're going to do is get up into the
push-up like position and you're going
to bend your knee and twist in I mean
this exercise is pretty self-explanatory
once you see me do it but all you're
going to do is bend a knee every other
leg obviously and you're going to twist
in you're really going to feel this in
your abs especially in the side so it's
going to really help sculpt it and
you do this 20 times the next exercise
I'm doing are called v6 and all you're
going to do is put your hands by your
bum get into a V leg pose and then
extend your legs and your upper body out
and bring it back in it's kind of like a
sitting up crunch and you really want to
make sure that you keep your core really
strong because that's what's going to
bring you up and down and remember the
farther you lean back with your legs and
upper body the stronger and more hard
the exercise is going to be the next
exercise is called rock the boat and all
I'm doing is getting the same feel like
position and twisting my body from right
to left you really want to make sure
that your legs stay in the V position
and don't move around too much with your
body I'm not very good at this one but
it really helps sculpt the sides of your
abs moving on to crunches I'm pretty
sure a lot of you are familiar with what
they are but you're just going to
basically lay like so I put my hands
behind my head and I lift up my upper
body making sure to keep my core really
really strong because that's the area
you want to focus you don't want to use
your arms to pull up your upper body you
really really want to use your core and
I'm going to repeat this motion 20 times
now for bicycle crunches all I'm doing
is the same crunching motion but this
time I'm lifting up a leg and twisting
my body so I'm just going to connect my
opposite elbow with my opposite knee and
I'm just going to keep doing this 20
times as with pretty much all the
exercises so far now it's time to work
those pesky lower abs so this first
exercise is called tornado this is
really challenging I'm not going to lie
to you guys I really kind of suck at it
but basically all you're doing is
putting your legs up and then with your
feet or I guess your legs you're just
going to go in circular motions until
you reach the ground not touching the
ground once you get there you're just
going to reverse the circle and then
bring it all the way back up this is
really hard you guys I'm not going to
lie to you but it really really works
the lower abs you're only going to
repeat this twice um but however it is
really hard and it's hard to make sure
you're doing it right so what we used to
do in dance we didn't do those we just
basically went up and down like so this
is just a little bit easier to do but if
you want the same results you're going
to have to do more of them instead of
just two times this last one is called a
reverse crunch all I'm doing with my
legs up in the air is I'm just going to
use my core to lift up my butt towards
me as you can see my legs are kind of
swinging a little bit but this is good
because it's going
really help contract your muscles to
bring your legs back up to you along
with your bum so to really help work
your lower abs and your abs in general
now it's time to stretch so my favorite
thing to stretch out my core is to
stretch really really tall like this
point my toes and squeeze everything
together and it's gonna really help
stretch out your abs but that's it for
my at-home ab workout when I'm finished
with this at home I'm so tired my abs
feel like jello and I want to pass out
but in the end it's so worth it I do it
about every other day and I'm really
starting to see results so I really hope
you guys give this a try thank you guys
so much for watching and I will see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
