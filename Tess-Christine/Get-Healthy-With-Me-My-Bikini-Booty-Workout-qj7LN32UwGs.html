be another get healthy with me video as
you guys can tell by the title this
video is all gonna be centered around
your booty so this is kind of an at-home
workout that I like to do like I said in
my disclaimer when I first started this
series I am NOT a fitness professional
so this is just workout stuff that I
found like on Pinterest and other
workout sites that I found that I've
just been doing for the past few months
so I figured I would share it with you
guys since you guys are all asking so
I'm going to show you some things that
help lift and tone your butt to make it
perky and big cuz we all want that now
don't we
sorry my voice sounds like a man I have
a terrible cold and cough and it's just
like the worst timing ever for this to
happen
how I film this workout video is beyond
me but I did and I really hope you guys
like it um because I was like wheezing
through it thumbs up for another workout
video like this I think I'm gonna do ABS
next I don't know tell me in the
comments below I hope you guys enjoy the
video and let's get started okay so the
first thing that you're gonna want to do
is put your hair up I really like
putting my hair up into a ponytail and
then next I'm going to lay down a yoga
mat obviously if you have carpet you
don't necessarily have to but wooden
floors they are great for it and now I'm
lacing up my Nikes and before anyone
asks my sports bra is from Victoria's
Secret it's super super comfy and my
pants are from Target so the first thing
that you're going to want to do is
definitely warm up you can either jog in
place or run around your neighborhood if
it's nice out but you really want to get
the blood flowing and get your heart
rate up to make the exercise a little
bit easier and more effective you can
also do about 50 jumping jacks and you
should be good to go the next step is
activation I have about three different
exercises that I do to activate my
muscles and get them ready for the main
exercise plus they really help tone the
area that I'm focusing on okay so this
first one is called the glute bridge
basically all you're going to do is lay
down onto your back and with your feet
underneath your knees all you're going
to do is push your hips up to the
ceiling what you want to make sure that
you really keep in mind with this
exercise is that you want to keep your
hips really really high every time you
push up and that you want to squeeze
your butt cheeks together because that's
where the toning is going to come from
so all I'm doing is continuing this
motion 20 times and then I'm going to
rest and then
peed it two more times making it three
sets of 20 this next one is called The
Lying side clam basically all you're
going to do is lie on to one side bend
your knees and all you're going to do is
open and close the top leg you want to
keep it slightly elevated but you want
to keep your back feet together so you
don't want to like kind of make it fly
all over the place and you're just going
to open and close them in a clam like
motion you're really going to feel this
in your but I felt it almost instantly
but another way to do the clam is to do
the knee to heel method where you're
basically just going to put your legs in
me heal me heal you're just going to
connect them that way it's just a
different way to do it so all you have
to do is count heel to me heel to me 20
times and you're only going to do it two
separate times of course resting in
between sets
so once you've completed one leg then
I'm just going to slide over to the
other side and do the exact same thing
on the other leg like I said you can
either just do the traditional clam or
you could do the heel to knee method to
be honest I prefer the heel to me I just
think it's a little bit more fun and I
can definitely feel it more um so I'm
just doing the same amount of
repetitions and sets on that side as
well this next one is called the lying
hip abduction it's very similar to the
side clam but the top leg is straight so
all you're going to do is take that top
leg and lift it high into the sky
keeping your leg very straight squeezing
your butt because you really want to
feel those muscles burn you also want to
make sure that your foot isn't touching
the ground when you go down you really
want to feel the contraction of your
muscle going up and down and really
forcing it instead of hitting the ground
or using it as a force so like I said
before all you're going to do is go 20
times and then you're going to rest and
go another 20 times super easy you're
only doing it twice so but you
definitely will feel the burn so I'm
doing that exact same thing on the other
leg lifting it high into the sky making
sure everything feels tight you really
really want to use your muscles to lift
that up and down and like I said you're
going to do 20 on this leg rest and then
do another 20 and then you're good to go
so now that you have activated your
muscles and they began the toning
process now it's time for the main
exercise so I've been doing about three
different exercises that are considered
main exercises to tight and
to my but this first one is just a basic
squat so all you're going to do is squat
down 20 times and then times that by 3
now when you are squatting you want to
make sure that a huge part of it is that
your knees aren't going over your toes
because then you're not doing it right
so what you kind of want to imagine is
that there's an invisible chair and
you're sitting in it that's super low to
the ground so just imagine sitting into
a chair and I'll probably figure it out
just as long as you make sure that your
knees don't go over your toes also if
you're a little bit more advanced you
can definitely hang on to wait this next
one is wide squats and it's basically
identical to a regular squat except
you're just going to widen your stance a
little bit so it's going to be a little
bit farther than your shoulder length
apart and all you're going to do is the
same squat down motion remember don't
let your knees go over your toes imagine
sitting in a chair this one feels a
little bit more stable in my opinion so
it's easier to squat down and you can
definitely feel the burn so this one
again you're gonna do 20 squats and
times that by 3 and yeah you're
definitely gonna feel it by now also
don't forget to rest in between your
sets it really helps this last one is
called the Bulgarian split squats all
you're gonna need is a chair or some
sort of elevated surface and I just put
my back foot on it like so and then all
you're gonna do is squat down putting
your hands on your hips really does help
make sure you balance okay um but like I
said before all I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna go to up and down 20 times and I'm
going to repeat that on each leg three
times and after this whole workout since
this is the last exercise this one's
gonna be the hardest and you're gonna
feel it like crazy now the last but very
important part is to stretch you really
want to stretch out those muscles that
you've been working so I'm just going to
do a few stretches here and that will
complete my butt workout that I do
pretty much like every other day when I
go to the gym or I'm at home I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and yeah thank
you guys so much for watching and let me
know the next workout video that you
want to see on my channel and I will see
you guys in my next video bye
