get healthy with me video you can tell
by the title that today's video is going
to be an exercise video and I've already
done a butt workout in an ab workout on
my channel so be sure to check those out
if you haven't already
but today's video is going to be all
about your legs because I was getting a
lot of comments on those exercise videos
to do a leg workout routine so that's
exactly what I'm going to show you guys
today I found this routine on Pinterest
a while ago and I really like it I think
it's great for beginners because the
moves aren't super challenging like
obviously they're hard to do but they're
not super complicated or weird so
basically this video I just show you
them show you how many to do and then
your routine set and you're pretty much
good to go but basically it's just going
to help tone and sculpt your legs and
you know get them ready for whatever you
want your legs toned for so if you are
interested at all in this video then of
course just keep on watching to the end
we're going to start with squats and
you're gonna do 20 of these and squats
I've shown you guys how to do these
before if you watch my butt workout
routine but in case you missed that all
you're basically doing is pretending
like you're sitting an imaginary chair
keeping your arms out forward like this
really helps balance you but you're
gonna stand shoulder-width apart and
basically just sit down into that chair
making sure your knees never go over
your toes next up I'm going to do some
lunges and I'm going to do thirty of
these and lunges are pretty
self-explanatory once you see me do them
as you can see here I'm just
interchanging legs and I'm just lunging
forward so bending both of my knees
stepping a little bit farther past my
shoulders making sure to really push in
to that front leg that you're lunging
into you're really going to start
feeling it in your thighs it's one of
those workouts that you don't feel right
away so it feels super easy but once you
keep doing it you're really really going
to feel the burn another thing I like to
do is stop once I'm in the lunge and I
basically just pulse up and down I
really like doing this it's just a
really great way to feel a little extra
burn in case you're a little bit more
advanced moving on the next thing I'm
going to do our calf raises and I'm
going to do 40 of these all you're going
to do is start with your feet together
like so and all you're going to do is go
up onto your tippy toes and back down
and you're just going to keep repeating
this process once you've completed it 40
times
another great way
to do this is to go on stairs on the
edge of stairs and go up and down it
just works it a little bit more but as
you can see if you look at my calf you
can really really see the muscle working
and yeah you really really start to feel
it towards the end of your set
now it's time to do a 50-second wall sit
so all you're going to do is find a wall
like so and you're going to put your
back up against it and sit down into
that invisible chair again that dreaded
chair and all you're going to do is with
your feet shoulder width apart you're
just going to hold it there for 50
seconds now I'm going to do some jumping
jacks this is really just going to help
keep my heart rate up it's going to keep
my muscles warm and I'm going to bring
some extra calories in the process so
I'm going to do about 50 of these more
or less to how you're feeling now I'm
going to do another 50 second wall sit
so right after my jumping jacks I'm
going to head over to that wall and I'm
going to sit my back against that wall
and hold it there this is the worst part
you guys I hate it at least for me it is
but it is really effective so it's
important all right guys we're halfway
there so now I'm going to do some sumo
squats I'm going to do 30 of these
basically all they are is I'm just going
to widen my stance a little bit and I'm
just going to squat down the exact way
that I did regular squats like I said
you're going to do 30 of these keeping
your arms out for balance and making
sure your knees don't go over your toes
now we're moving on to the floor so I'm
going to do 30 leg raises and basically
all these ARS you're going to lay flat
on your back one knee is bent and the
other one is straight and all you're
going to do is lift it up high into the
sky and bring it back down not touching
your heel to the floor once you do
because you don't want to use that as a
force to bring your leg back up you want
to use all the muscles in your legs that
you can you also are going to feel this
in your core and your butt so this whole
workout in general is just a bonus
because your whole body works together
anyways now it's time to work those
pesky inner thighs so we're going to do
some sideways scissors and we're going
to do 20 of these all you're going to do
is start with your legs open like so
stretch it a little bit to stretch out
the inner parts of your thighs and all
you're going to do is bring them up
criss crossing them as you do so
interchanging which leg goes on top and
bottom and you're like I said going to
do these 20 times alright guys don't
kill me this is the last one you're just
gonna finish with 20 squats the same as
you did in the beginning you're just
going to do again basic just squat down
into that invisible chair it's super
easy it's going to burn but you want to
finish strong
and with that the leg workout is done I
didn't put this in the video but don't
forget to stretch when you're done but
that's the video for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it be sure to let me
know in the comments below another
exercise video that you guys want me to
do stay tuned for my next get healthy

food video I've already done breakfast
snacks and lunch salads so now it's time

sweet tooth like me you can't leave them

course I will see you guys in my next
