healthy with me video plus a back to
school of chess video because on my last
get healthy with me food video you guys
were requesting packed lunches and I
thought that was a great idea and so I
decided to do it now because it's
perfect for back-to-school I really hope
you guys enjoy it and if you're
interested then just keep on watching
first I'm going to show you guys how to
make cranberry cashew chicken salad
wraps so first you're gonna start out by
starting to cook your chicken and while
that's cooking I'm gonna begin chopping
up celery I just use two celery sticks I
guess you wouldn't call them and I'm
finely chopping those and then I'm just
taking a handful of cashews and just
lightly chopping those they don't need
to be fine just kind of like in half so
they're not like whole cashews placing
them over there and then I'm taking a
handful of dried cranberries and just
lightly chopping them as well and then
lastly I'm just gonna take some basil
leaves and this time I'm going to finely
chop them so you don't get like chunks
of basil in your chicken salad and these
measurements are totally not exact you
can take like handfuls of each or more
of each if you like one over the other
so it's just a chicken salad so you
don't need to make them too precise so
now I'm just cutting some cherry
tomatoes in half and this is gonna go on
the wrap later not actually in the
chicken salad so you're gonna place all
of those ingredients into a bowl - the
tomatoes and then after you have them in
a bowl you're going to begin chopping up
your chicken or just cutting them into
fairly good chunks I wouldn't say like
huge but just enough to place in a wrap
so I kind of just finely chopped them up
like so and then once they're a little
bit more cooled off you're going to add
that into the mixture now I'm adding a
spoonful of raw honey and then a couple
scoops of nonfat Greek yogurt and then
one small scoop of light Mayo and I'm
just gonna begin mixing that up
normally chicken salads are made with
pretty much fully Mayo but adding the
yogurt really doesn't taste much
different and it's a little bit better
for you now I'm just adding salt and
pepper to taste and I'm going to
continue mixing that up until everything
is fully coated and that's pretty much
it
now you're gonna take your rap and I
couldn't for the life of me find spinner
drops anywhere where I lived so I got a
tomato-basil one but normally I would
probably use spinach but anyways I'm
just putting some lettuce down and then
the cherry tomatoes that we cut in half
earlier and I'm just taking a few good
spoonfuls of that chicken salad and
placing that into the wrap and as you
can see it left a lot of leftovers so
this isn't a one serving dish you can
keep this in the fridge for a couple
days and make it like two or three
lunches at least now I'm taking this
container that I purchased at Walmart
super handy and I'm placing the wrap in
one of the sides which it fits perfectly
and then for the sides I'm just taking
some red grapes because I love red
grapes and placing that in one side and
then putting this Pirate's Booty aged
white cheddar popcorn this stuff I'm
addicted to it's really actually not
that bad for you compared to like other
crunchy snacks and I'm the type of
person that needs crunchy so this is a
lot better than some of the other
options and then of course I'm a dessert
girl so I threw in a piece of dark
chocolate or the end of my meal and
that's it I really like this a lot it's
definitely a changeup from most of the
normal wraps that there usually are next
I'm going to show you guys how to make a
turkey avocado sandwich you're going to
start by taking an avocado and spooning
that into a bowl because we're going to
mash it up so how I like to do this is
just take the back of a spoon or just a
spoon in general and scoop out the part
of the avocado and then with a fork I'm
just gonna begin mashing that up until
it's kind of like guacamole they look
like that at the end of this now I'm
just adding a few shakes of sea salt and
then a squeeze of lemon juice to keep it
from turning brown the acidity of it
will keep it lasting a little bit longer
now I'm just taking some bread and I
just use some whole-wheat bread and I'm
placing that on to the counter and I'm
gonna begin assembling my sandwich so I
just took a few slices of turkey some
lettuce and then tomato and I'm placing
that on one side and then with the
avocado make sure I'm placing that on
the other side it really helps with
keeping this sandwich like moist I hate
that word but like it's better than
using Mayo or anything like that
definitely healthier for you so now I'm
just assembling the sandwich cutting it
in half
it's done this is one of those things
you can make in the morning or if you
want to at night but for the side I'm
gonna make these little like caprese
salad is that how you say it I don't
know but they're like on a little
toothpick so they're like really easy to
like just eat and go so it's just a
cherry tomato a little piece of basil
leaf and some fresh mozzarella and
they're definitely like a different side
dish and I love them or my other side
I'm taking these oven roasted almonds
and placing them in about 3/4 of this
container and then I'm taking some dark
chocolate acai berries and placing a few
of those into the other side like I said
before if your dessert girl like me
these are awesome because you only need
a few of them to satisfy your dessert
craving and they're not the worst type
of dessert you could have so yay to that
now I'm just assembling my sandwich into
the to go heat container and this one
that I got at Walmart came with an ice
pack so it keeps everything nice and
cold it like divides everything super
awesome next I'm gonna show you guys how
to make chicken lettuce wraps because I
wanted to show you guys something
different with very different flavors so
I'm just taking some oil and placing
that into a pan and then I chopped up 4
cloves of garlic and cubed a to chicken
breasts and I'm gonna begin cooking that
like so in a separate bowl you're gonna
take a 1/2 cup finely shredded cabbage
and then you're also going to add 1
carrot shredded and then I'm just going
to chop up 3 green onions and I'm going
to place that in there as well so now
I'm just adding a few shakes out salt
and pepper to the chicken to flavor it a
little bit more and now I'm adding the
cabbage carrots and the green onions to
let that cook in with the chicken after
the chicken is pretty much fully cooked
so the vegetables can cook down and get
soft moving on to the sauce I'm taking
1/3 cup sweet chili sauce which can be
found in the Asian section of your
grocery store then I'm taking one
heaping a tablespoon of crunchy peanut
butter and placing that in there as well
I'm taking a 1/4 teaspoon freshly
chopped ginger and 2 teaspoons of soy
sauce now I'm just adding a few shakes
of red pepper flakes to taste and then
with a fork I'm going to begin mixing up
that sauce until it looks like this
really weird color but I promise it
tastes delicious
after your vegetables have been cooked
you're going to add that into the
mixture along with 1/4 cup cilantro
finely chopped and you're gonna mix it
like so and voila it's done for the
sides I'm just adding some blueberries
and some strawberries and then a few
carrot sticks and I cannot forget
dessert so I'm adding some dark
chocolate covered almonds which I have
to say look kind of funny next to the
carrots but we're just gonna ignore that
now I'm just adding some romaine lettuce
leaves to my to go container and then
you're gonna place everything into a
Tupperware because you're going to spoon
it on to the lettuce leaves like so it
makes a ton of leftovers and it's so
delicious and easy to make the night
before I cannot forget my childhood
favorite which were peanut butter banana
sandwiches I seriously lived off of
these you guys have no idea so all
you're gonna do is take 2 slices of
bread and add either regular peanut
butter or this powdered stuff which is a
lot better for you and it has less
calories just personal preference and
I'm just going to cut one side of the
bread with peanut butter and then I'm
going to add some local organic honey to
one side to sweeten it up a little bit
because this tastes so good on it next
I'm just slicing up a banana and placing
the slices on top of the peanut butter
placing the other half of the bread on
top cutting it in half and voila it's
done you can make this super easy in the
morning and you guys it's my favorite
like simple and just so delicious so for
the sides I just added some blueberries
and some strawberries some pretzels and
some carrot sticks and don't forget the
dark chocolate so I'm adding that on top
of my little to-go container putting the
cover on and voila it's done so good
definitely probably my favorite to be
honest alright guys that's it and if
that wasn't enough ideas for you I
already made a lunch salads video which
I will have linked down below they're
all salads so they're perfect to bring
to school also social media
don't forget over here I'm always
chatting at you guys and yeah I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
