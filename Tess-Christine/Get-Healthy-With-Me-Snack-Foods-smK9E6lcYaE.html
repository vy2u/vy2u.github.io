the first video of my get healthy with
me series since it's the first video I
thought I would keep it very short quick
and easy and just talk about snacks
because who doesn't love to snack
whether I'm watching a movie watching TV
bored editing a video snacking is just
there this video is going to be perfect
for you guys who are on the go or need a
quick snack there nothing that takes too
long it's very very quick and easy to do
so I thought it would be perfect for the
first video so if you're interested at
all then just keep on watching
starting out I'm going to be talking
about hummus because it's one of my
favorite things to snack on for those of
you who don't know hummus is just
basically pureed chickpeas which is a
bean and they are super rich in fiber
and protein and contain various amounts
of vitamins and minerals including folic
acid which is a B vitamin that helps the
body make new healthy cells and prevent
various diseases I like to eat hummus
with pita chips to satisfy my crunchy
craving these are the townhouse pita
chips in Mediterranean herb they are so
delicious but definitely not the best
for you so my recommendation is to eat
it with carrots now hummus does have a
lot of health benefits but it can be
high in calories so a way to cut this
back is by obviously eating it with some
sort of vegetable and scooping some of
it into a bowl for some portion control
either way it's super yummy next I have
found a new love for almond butter as
you can see it's very similar to peanut
butter but almond butter is just a tad
bit better for you plus it's a great
protein alternative for those who have a
peanut allergy it also has slightly less
saturated fat and and is a bit more
nutritionally dense versus peanut butter
it's also full of vitamins and it's a
great source of fiber and protein which
makes for a great source of energy I
like to eat it with either apples celery
or bananas celery is the quickest of all
because all I do is spread a little bit
of the almond butter on the inside of
the celery and I'm pretty much good to
go you can also add raisins to the top
and make ants on a log do you guys
remember that when you were kid he's to
make them at school and be like ants on
a log
I totally do but anyways it's really
good in general and celery is a great
detoxifying agent for your body so you
can either eat it plain or
with peanut butter to make it not so
bland moving on bananas and peanut
butter is a classic and so delicious but
trust me when I say that almond butter
tastes just as yummy all I do to make
these is just cut the banana into slices
and I basically just make sure they're
even and have even amounts to you want
to make sure you have even Ramon's
banana because you're going to smush
them together so all I'm doing now is
I'm just taking a small amount of almond
butter and placing them on half of the
pieces and then tap the bear pieces on
top to make little banana sandwiches
they're so yummy and they look so good -
plus I've also seen people dip these
into dark chocolate for a yummy dessert
and you dip them into dark chocolate and
then you let them sit and put in the
freezer and I've heard that that's
really good for a dessert but just for a
snack these are really good all you need
is a fork and YUM don't they look so
good they were good they were actually
one of my favorites but if you really
are in too much of a hurry or you don't
have the patience for this all you
really need to do is open up the banana
and place the amount of almond butter on
top as you eat it it works the same it's
just I guess not as cute and not as
shareable lastly apples instead of just
slicing apples and eating them you can
get more creative by making these little
Apple sandwiches all I did was I
basically just cored the apple with this
little tool be very careful because this
is kind of hard so if you need help just
ask your parents or a friend because the
thicker the Apple the harder this is
going to be so it took me a little bit
but you just kind of take the core out
and push the rest of it out super super
easy so now all I'm going to do is slice
the Apple in slightly thick sections and
you're going to have these really cool
apple rings then after grabbing a plate
I'm just going to take one half of the
Apple or one of the Rings and I'm just
going to spread a thin amount of almond
butter on it not too much because you
don't want to go crazy on the calories
just a thin amount and then I'm going to
take some natural granola and sprinkle
that over the almond butter and then
lastly with the other end of the ring or
another ring I'm just going to spread an
even thinner amount just so it sticks to
the granola and that's it so now I'm
just going to repeat that until I'm
satisfied with how many Apple sandwiches
I had you can have as much or as little
as you want just depending on how hungry
you are or if you're sharing these are
so easy and really switch up just
grabbing an apple for a snack this is
probably one of my favorites they are
seriously so delicious
as I ate all of these like right when I
was filming it I was laughing at my
footage because I seriously all um on
camera ridiculous now it's time to show
you how I make my super smoothie this is
full of good things for you and it makes
for a snack that fills your belly for a
lot longer than you probably think
starting out with the ingredients the
first is kale kale is definitely a super
green it's low in calorie and high in
fiber and calcium it's filled with
powerful antioxidants is
anti-inflammatory and contains vitamins
A and C which are all things great for
healthy skin next is spinach which is
loaded with vitamins and is a great
source of fatty acids
it contains anti-cancer and
anti-inflammatory antioxidants and it
also nourishes eyes and strengthens
bones next is ginger and this is great
for your skin because it helps even skin
tone and clear dark spots and it helps
if you're feeling nauseous or sick next
is lemon and this helps draw out toxins
from the body energize it and helps with
digestion I add frozen berries for taste
and to keep it cold and I also add a
banana to make the smoothie a little bit
creamier lastly for a liquid base I use
mostly coconut water and a little bit of
orange juice so how I'm going to mix my
smoothie is I just got the nutribullet
for Christmas and I'm absolutely in love
with it super easy to use so that's how
I'm going to mix it today
so all I'm basically doing now is just
filling it I like to usually fill it
with the greens first just because those
take a little bit longer to mix and I
don't know it's just kind of the process
that I do for the lemon I'm just going
to basically cut it in half and squeeze
the lemon juice into the cup next I'm
just going to break the banana and throw
that in there as well and then for the
ginger this is a little bit challenging
but I'm basically just going to peel the
skin from the ginger until I get this
kind of white looking which is what the
actual ginger looks like and that's what
you want to put in your smoothie so I'm
just going to grate that in there I
don't usually use a lot of it because
ginger is very very powerful but I do
enough just to taste and then lastly I'm
going to add the frozen berries i atill
it I like to add a lot because I love
fruit and then lastly I'm going to add a
bunch of coconut water and then some
orange juice now lastly all I'm going to
do is attach the blade to it so I'm just
going to screw it on and then
I'm going to put it on to the
nutribullet and it's going to mix away
so now when it's mixing it usually mixes
pretty well because the nutribullet is
very very strong and is kind of meant
for vegetables and fruits and things
like that but you might have to take it
off and shake it a little bit but once
it's all mixed to your liking I'm just
going to take that off and then screw on
the little handle that they give you in
the nutribullet kit but you can pour it
into a glass too it doesn't really
matter and then voila that's what it
turns out I mean it's really kind of a
nasty color it's actually really gross
looking but I promise you it tastes so
delicious and you can't even taste the
Greens lastly I wanted to show you guys
grapes and grapes are such a great snack
but what you may have not have already
thought of is putting them into the
freezer frozen grapes are so good and
they really change up the kind of like
not flavor of grapes just kind of like
how you eat them they're just so
different and sometimes when you're
snacking you're not even really hungry
so this is a great way to kind of make
sure you're not overeating and you're
just eating frozen grapes because they
really taste different and you can suck
on them and I don't know they're just so
good I thought I would share with you
guys but that's it for my get healthy
with me snacks edition I really hope you
guys liked it it was a very quick and
easy video if you try out any of my
snacks that I've shown you guys today be
