with me again
so as you guys can tell today's video is
going to be a get healthy with me video
and I know it's been a while since I've
done one of these videos hopefully some
of you are better than I and didn't
snack as much and eat pizza do you guys
watch my blog meds
yikes today's video is going to be a
what I ate today a video and you're
probably thinking test get over yourself
no one cares that you ate today but
actually this is very helpful for this
reason it's actually very beneficial to
see a full meal a very full day of
healthy meals and make a lot of videos
where it's like lunch breakfast snacks
all sectioned but it's cool to just see
a whole day and I got requested for it
and I think they're helpful I like
watching them so hopefully you guys find
this helpful and yeah let's get started
and go okay so of course starting off
with breakfast which is my favorite meal
of the day starting off with coffee and
today I had oatmeal and berries so
starting off with a coffee this is the
first thing that I do when I wake up in
the morning I should be drinking water
about coffee is my favorite thing to
wake up to so I just use a Keurig and
then I sweeten it with some agave nectar
instead of sugar which works really well
and then for my creamer I use coconut
milk French Vanilla creamer it tastes
pretty much the same it just is without
the dairy so then for my actual
breakfast I decided to go with oatmeal I
just use the Quaker Oatmeal packets this
one is maple brown sugar and then I use
water instead of milk because it's
better for you but milk obviously tastes
really good too
so after microwaving that for about a
minute in half then I like to add some
berries just because it sweetens it and
makes it taste a little bit better so I
love raspberries and blueberries they're
like my favorite
moving on to lunch one of my favorite
things to make for lunch are salads
because they're easy and they don't take
up a lot of time which is perfect for
the middle of the day for me since I'm
usually filming so what I add is romaine
and spinach lettuce cherry tomatoes
avocado goat cheese crumbles of course
salad dressing and croutons so starting
off with the cherry tomatoes this is by
far my favorite thing to add to my salad
like I can't really have a salad without
these they're just so good and cherry
tomatoes are good for you they're filled
with a bunch of vitamins and minerals so
they're just good overall after adding a
generous amount of cherry tomatoes to my
salad another ingredient that I like to
add our avocados avocados are full of
healthy fats so it's actually a great
meat substitute since I didn't want to
take the time to grill chicken because
it's in the middle of my day and I'm
usually the busiest an avocado is a
great option plus it's really good for
your skin it's full of protein and
dietary fiber so it's delicious and as
you guys can see I'm just kind of
cutting it up inside the avocado and
then I just squeeze it out doesn't look
the best but it's the most efficient the
next two ingredients are not necessary
goat cheese crumbles and croutons but
they are really delicious and I'm being
honest with you guys I love this on my
salad so I just use it sparingly
moving on to dressings my all-time
favorite is French dressing although
it's not as good for you as an olive oil
or lemon juice based dressing so if I'm
feeling a little bit healthier I'll go
for a classic balsamic vinaigrette or
I'll just go for a French and use it in
moderation for a beverage my go-to is
definitely water and a lemon
now since I like to eat throughout the
day and I'm definitely going to be
hungry after that salad after an hour so
I'm gonna start with a snack a number
one so for this I'm making a smoothie so
I just use a bunch of frozen fruit my
favorite are strawberries blackberries I
also add spinach and a banana for the
liquid part I'm using some almond milk
and then some water so I just mix the
two and then I'm using a nutribullet to
mix it all up but of course any type of
blender to blend up your smoothie will
work just as well after it's all nice
and blended I will go ahead and pour it
into glasses I usually am able to make
more than one so I'll let Patrick have
one or something but I'll just take it
in and go edit it's actually a perfect
midday snack because you can take it
anywhere an hour so later it's time for
snack number two one of my go-to snacks
is definitely carrots and celery but I
love to dip it in something because it's
just boring otherwise so I'll go ahead
and just use some red pepper hummus it's
definitely one of my favorites it's now
dinnertime and I wanted to show you guys
this one because it's by far one of my
go-to s and it's so easy so all you're
going to need is chicken breasts coconut
flour seasoning zucchini asparagus lemon
and a sweet potato starting with the
chicken you're just going to take a
chicken breast or however many you want
and you're just going to basically coat
it into the coconut flour coconut flour
is much better for you than just regular
all-purpose flour basically what this is
going to do is act as kind of like a
slight crust or something on the chicken
it makes it taste really good so I'm
placing that into a medium skillet like
medium-high heat skill it with some
olive oil at the bottom of it and then
I'm taking that lover lemon pepper
seasoning and sprinkling that all over
the chicken in the pan on both sides
moving on to the asparagus I'm just
taking a handful of that and I'm kind of
cutting it up and then I'm going to go
ahead and do the same thing with
zucchini these are two of my favorite
vegetables to kind of saute in the pan
so delicious
and I love the flavor of all of this
it's very lemon light and fresh and it's
just really easy to do then I'm taking a
lemon and I'm just cutting about two or
three slices of lemon for the sweet
potato I'm just stabbing it with a fork
and then in an oven preheated to 425
degrees you're going to put that in for
45 minutes to an hour
depending on the size of your potato so
make sure you do this before you start
cooking the chicken and the vegetables
so it's timed right once the chicken is
fully cooked I'm just taking that off
the skillet and transferring it to a
plate and then I'm going to go ahead and
put my vegetables that I cut up in there
along with the lemon this is basically
just going to pick up the flavor that's
left on the pan from the chicken while
also cooking it a little bit faster
because the pan is already super hot and
I'm just cooking it to how I like it so
until the vegetables are all tender or
kind of like golden brown then I'm
transferring it to a plate along with a
sweet potato that I dash with a little
bit of cinnamon and that's it it's so
easy it's so delicious all of it is so
good really you have to try it and the
best part about it it's all good for you
now I guess you could call this snack
number 3 or dessert an hour so later
after dinner I usually want to snack
again because like I said I eat a lot um
but I'm just using apples and peanut
butter it's my default so I'm just
cutting up an apple like so I wish I had
one of those really cool like Apple
contraptions that does it like in one
cut but I don't so I'm just using a
knife the old-fashioned way um but it
works for the peanut butter I'm just
using pv2 it's much better for you than
actual peanut butter all you have to do
is just put the powder in a bowl and
then stir it in equal parts water and it
turns into peanut butter and look you
guys it's amazing and it tastes really
good too so that's it that's easy
but that's it that's all wait I really
