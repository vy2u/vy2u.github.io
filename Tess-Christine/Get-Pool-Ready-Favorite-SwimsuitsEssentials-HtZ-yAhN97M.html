this place is back with people but your
face is all I see hey guys today's video
is going to be a get pool ready video
basically all that means is I'm just
going to show you guys how I get ready
for the pool or the beach which ever you
have near you so it's just going to be
me showing you guys some makeup ideas
hair and then some of my favourite
swimsuits and also some things that I
love to bring with me when I do go to
the pool I was going to make a swimsuit
collection video since a lot of you guys
were asking me for that but I decided to
combine it with this one because I feel
like it's a little bit more useful
content for those of you watching at
home and you can get more out of the
video so I thought it would be fun to
kind of combine them and make you know
just like a pool swimsuit video all in
one the so I really hope you guys enjoy
this and yeah let's get started
as always I'm beginning with the makeup
and hair and now for the makeup the
biggest thing you want to make sure you
do is somehow protect your face whether
it's just a face sunscreen or some sort
of foundation with sunscreen in it now
my biggest recommendation to you is this
1 by 8 cosmetics because it has SPF 50
in it which is just a crazy high amount
more than I've seen with normal like
foundations so it's perfect because it
protects your skin while still giving
you coverage for all those spots that
you don't really want maybe your friends
to see your show up in photos so it
still protects your skin from premature
aging and wrinkles but it also gives you
the coverage that you want now moving on
to the lips now I recommend a sunscreen
chapstick but I really like using this
one by Vaseline and has cocoa butter in
it and it's just very moisturizing in
general ok so now that I have my
sunscreen on my face and my lips
moisturized I would honestly just throw
in a swimsuit and go to the pool as is
and my hair would just be a second hair
second day hair just gross because it's
gonna be you know wet or sweaty anyways
so I would either just leave it like
down like this
or you know I throw it up in the classic
lazy bun that everybody knows how to do
these things you guys know these these
are awesome and I would just throw my
shades on swimsuit and I'd be good to go
however I
that some of you guys were requesting
more of a tutorial for getting pool
ready as far as like a pool party or
something where you just want to look a
little bit nicer for and you know you
just want to look good sometimes
especially if you're going to a pool
party with people you don't really know
you want to take pictures I get it I get
it
so I'm just going to show you a few
extra steps that you can take if you
want to get a little bit more ready for
the pool the first extra step that I
would take is definitely adding a
concealer because I think it brightens
up your face a ton and if you're at
parties and taking your sunglasses off a
concealer is always good to have on
another thing is just dusting a little
bronzer on the contours of your face I'm
using this one by benefit it just adds a
nice glow and already kind of a
sunkissed look to your things now of
course I'm going to add a little bit of
blush this blush has kind of bronzy
undertones so it's perfect if you're
going to be out in the Sun it just adds
a little bit of already color to your
face and then of course adding a
highlighter just gives you a nice glow
for the eyes the only thing I would do
extra is add some waterproof mascara of
course the one that I'm using is a lash
blast by covergirl it's my favorite I
love it so much and I just got the brown
black to give a very natural look to it
now for the hair if I'm not letting it
natural or putting up in a bun and I
want it to look a little bit more nice
and polished what I love to do is do
with the half-up half-down
look I just think it gets the main parts
of my hair away from my face especially
when I'm sweating
it just keeps my hair looking nice
throughout the entire time that I'm at
the pool because you can jump in the
water get out and it's really gonna stay
the exact same way
now it's time for some poolside
essentials that are very basic and just
things that I like to have with me when
I'm at the pool the first of course
being sunscreen I usually use 15 to 20
SPF next being deodorant in case you're
sweating and you start to smell a little
bit it's just a good thing to have with
you and then of course some sort of
towel and then something to entertain
yourself so I like to bring music or a
good book last but not least it's
important to hydrate yourself and one of
my favorite drinks to bring besides
water is cucumber lemonade to make this
all you're going to need is a lemonade
and I took the easy way out and bought
frozen lemonade concentrate but you can
totally make your own by using water and
lemons and a little bit of sugar for a
healthier option you're going to need
peeled and sliced cucumbers and you're
going to place that to taste at the
bottom of your blender and then of
course add the lemonade and then all
you're going to do is blend that up
until smooth now once that's done I'm
going to add some water to it to water
down the whole mixture just because my
lemonade was super tart and super sweet
and the mixture calls for it anyways so
I'm adding that and then blending it up
again and then that's it it's super easy
all I'm doing is pouring over ice and
putting it in a mason jar
even though normally I would put it in a
tumbler if I was taking it to the pool
but yep super delicious and super
refreshing
but that's the video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it thank you guys
so much for watching stay tuned because
I have a ton of videos coming up and I'm
super excited about them my Blake Lively
fourth of July I'll pass of the week I
forgot made but I didn't forget June so
be on the lookout for that and I will
see you guys next time
