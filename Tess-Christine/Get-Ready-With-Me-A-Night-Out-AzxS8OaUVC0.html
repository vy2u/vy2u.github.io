get ready with me video for a night out
and I never do nighttime look so please
let me know in the comments below if you
liked it also I was super excited when
Maybelline let me try out their new at
the nudes palette super gorgeous colors
and I have been getting a lot of
requests to do a drugstore brand
tutorial so I thought this was a perfect
opportunity to do so so I really hope
you guys enjoy it to begin I'm going to
be using the maybelline baby skin
instant pore eraser as a primer to make
my skin feel smooth before I apply my
makeup movin on to foundation I'm using
the Maybelline Dream liquid mousse
foundation and the color I'm in is sandy
beige for those that are interested but
I love it it just gives a very nice
airbrush effect now for concealer I'm
using the maybelline instant age rewind
a research dark circle concealer I've
used this stuff for years you guys seen
it plenty of times before but I bought
it in the shade lighter so it gives
light two of the areas that I want it to
so underneath my eyes on the bridge of
my nose my chin and on my forehead now
moving on to contour I have been loving
using cream bronzers lately so for this
I bought the Maybelline fit me
foundation in the shade taki caramel
because that shade is a bronzer for me
but basically all I'm doing is putting
that on the contours of my face like I
would with a bronzer and then I'm just
taking a brush and blending it in using
small circular motion blending it
upwards when it comes to my cheekbones I
love using cream bronzers I just think
for me it's just a lot easier for me to
contour the right places and it just
looks more natural on my face I guess I
don't know bronzers would be more
natural but I just like cream I think it
just overall has a nice finish
now of course I'm just setting all of
the cream products with a powder now I'm
just using this Maybelline master
highlight highlighting bronzer to not
only set my bronzer but add some color
to my cheeks and of course highlight
now we cannot forget the brows
especially if you have brows like me
which are crazy is so I'm just brushing
them out with a spoolie brush and then
filling them in with just a basic brown
shadow move it onto the eyes from the
new Maybelline nudes palette I'm just
taking this light beige color and I'm
placing that all over my lids as a base
and then also I'm going to take this
kind of shimmery pinkish beige color and
place that right over it just for some
shimmers since this is a night look next
I'm taking this kind of taupey brown
color and with a large fluffy brush I'm
just placing that into the crease as a
transition color and just to really give
your eyes more dimension now I'm taking
the shimmery kind of toffee brown color
and I'm placing that onto my crease as
well focusing it on the inner corner
because I'm kind of doing a different
smoky eye look and doing more of a
reverse smoky new look which I think is
a little bit more fun and different now
to make sure I didn't lose any of the
lighter colors from earlier I'm just
going to pick those up again and place
those on the outer corner because I'm
doing something completely different and
I'm focusing my smoky eye on the inner
corner this time so I'm taking that
matte black shape that's in the palette
and with a flat top I shadow brush I'm
just placing that onto the inner corner
building it as I go now to make sure
that the line is more of a gradient I'm
picking up that same brown color that we
used before and I'm just placing that
next to the black as kind of a gradient
into the lighter color so total reverse
ombre on this look and I think it's so
different and fun so now I'm just taking
that same large fluffy brush and I'm
just blending out any harsh lines to
make sure nothing's too harsh or too
drastic now again I'm taking those
lighter shades and placing them on the
outer corner just to make sure the
emphasis is on the inner corner lastly
I'm just taking this lightest shimmery
shade in the palette and placing that on
my brow bone for a highlight now we
can't forget to balance out the look
with the bottom lash line so I'm just
picking that darkest brown color that we
used before and placing that on my lower
lash line and that's it for the eye
shadow I love that the emphasis is on
the inner corner versus at the outer V
but now of course I'm going to add a gel
liner so I'm just using this one by
Maybelline to create a slight wing for a
little bit more of a dramatic effect and
then
course aligning my eyes with just a gel
liner and then lastly I'm going to apply
my favorite mascara which is the
Maybelline colossal mascara now I did go
ahead and add some false lashes just for
a little bit more emphasis on my lashes
and just to really make the eyes pop for
the lips that kept it very natural by
using a nude lipstick in the color
blushing beige and I just blended it in
with my ring finger for a very natural
effect now you guys I'm super excited
because Maybelline was kind enough to
name this the test look from their new
palette and I love it I love the dark
and the nude colors mixed together they
just really make anybody's eyes stand
out for the hair I didn't do anything
you haven't seen before I just took a
one-inch curling iron and I basically
just wrapped my hair randomly in
sections leaving the end piece of my
hair out to create a very natural and
wavy effect because I didn't want to
anything too overdone since my eye
makeup was a little bit more heavy than
I'm used to so I kept the hair very
natural and flowy and just kind of messy
which I love
lastly of course you got to finish with
hairspray since this is a night out look
and you want it to last although I love
messy hair especially with looks like
this because I think it's just very
flirty and fun and the whole look just I
don't know is very going out it's
perfect for a date night or a night out
with your friends I just love it now I'm
going to show you guys what I wore so
for my outfit you guys know I love my
crop top so I wore this one from Planet
blue along with a brandy melville circle
skirt some sandals from Kohl's and a
Rebecca Minkoff purse this is so comfy
to me I wear these type of looks all the
time when I go out but that's the video
for today I really hope you guys enjoyed
it thank you guys so much for watching
and I will see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
