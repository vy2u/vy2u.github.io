be a get ready with me video basically
I'm just going to show you a typical
skincare makeup and hair routine that
I've been doing a lot this summer this
isn't a morning routine so if you want a
morning routine and please let me know
in the comments below and yeah if you're
interested then just keep on watching
in my last get ready with me video I was
using the try rollerball under-eye
Awakening cream and I really like using
that and I'm still using that but I
wanted to show you guys these cloths
because I've been using these a lot in
the summer they're the Olay fresh
effects see spot swipe oil reducing wet
cloths I sweat a lot in the summer so
these are really good because they have
exfoliating beads on them that wipe away
dirt oil and stuff that can clog your
pores
I usually just rinse my face with water
in the morning and then go over with
these instead of using a face wash so
I'm not over washing my face which was
causing me to break out before next up
you probably could have called this one
because I use this all the time and
talked about it a lot but it's the Olay
fresh effects world mattifier this is
definitely one of my favorites from the
fresh effects line I just really like it
basically I just spread it all over my
face it helps get rid of the redness
moves out my skin evens my skin tone
which is awesome and it basically just
preps it for makeup which is why I like
using it for a makeup primer moving on
to makeup my favorite for the summer is
the hourglass immaculate liquid to
powder foundation and I'm in the color
light beige I apply this with a Beauty
Blender sponge and what I love about it
is basically it just feels really light
which is a key for me in the summer
because I'm always sweating so it feels
super light and it doesn't get oily
throughout the day which I love next up
it cosmetics bye bye under eye concealer
I've been using this for years now I
absolutely love it it basically gets rid
of my bags under my eyes so nicely and I
would definitely recommend it
now since it's summer and if I'm not
quite tan yet I like to give myself a
little bit of a bronzed glow so I'm
using my Anastasia contour kit and I'm
using the center bronze color as you can
see there it's almost gone and I
basically just doing lightly the
contours of my face and a little bit
down my nose for a bronzy glow but
nothing too crazy or over-the-top
now for a flush of color on my face I'm
just going to be taking the cabana boy
blush by the balm cosmetics and placing
that on the apples of my cheeks I've
been using this pretty much winter
spring and summer I love it now for a
highlight I'm just taking the hourglass
highlight trio and placing that on the
highlights of my face and then for my
brows and taking my all-time favorite on
sassy a dip brow and I'm in the color
soft brown and basically filling in my
brows how I like to do this is basically
brush upwards starting with the product
at the bottom of my brow moving onto my
eyelids I'm using the NARS eyeshadow
primer and I like this one a lot I have
an oily skin base and this is the only
primary found that really doesn't allow
my eyeshadows to crease throughout the
day so I really love it
for the eyeshadow I keep it very simple
in the summer because I don't want to
waste time with a lot on my eyes so I'm
just taking a champagne shimmery color
placing that on my crease or on my lids
and then I'm taking a brownish shimmery
color and placing that on my crease and
on the outer corner for some dimension I
skip eyeliner completely because I don't
waste time with it in the summer and I
basically just curl my lashes and apply
some mascara how I find my mascara now
is they basically comb downwards on the
lashes and then I come up wordsö on the
backs and then the front of the lashes I
just found that this really lifts the
lashes and gives them a full long effect
and I've just really been loving doing
it plus I skip eyeliner so I think this
just really helps make my eyes pop more
and of course apply it on the bottom
lashes as well then I just go in with a
q-tip and clean up any mascara fallout
that might have happened on the lids or
on the lower
before I do my lipliner I brush my teeth
just so I don't obviously from any
product so I'm basically just brushing
my teeth of the crest 3d white
toothpaste and then I go over it quickly
with the leftover on my Beauty Blender
or like a matte palette and then I go in
with my urban decay and they get to lip
liner which you guys know is my favorite
and I haven't really strayed from it
since like the winter and then I go over
it with Mac's world just for kind of a
deeper look and I focus this on the
outer half of my lips now that my makeup
is done I'm basically going to brush out
my hair I use I'm using the wet brush if
you guys haven't tried it you definitely
should I just bought mine at Target it
was super expensive but I actually
really love this brush I use it for when
my hair is obviously wet and when it's
dry it just combs it really nicely and
then if I did wash my hair in the shower
because I don't wash my hair everyday I
just spray it with a little dry shampoo
especially in the roots because that's
where my hair gets the greasiest and
then basically I'm just sectioning off
to curl my hair I have been curling my
hair a lot in the summer I leave it kind
of piece like messy beachy waves that's
like my favorite way to do it if you
guys live in New York City you know or
even just around it you know that the
humidity is crazy so I don't even bother
with straightening my hair anymore I
always embrace the curl or even embrace
my natural like wavy texture of my hair
because for me it's just not worth it my
hair will just poop out like crazy so I
just embrace the curls and go for these
kind of messy waves and I'm just using
the new me five-in-one curl styler
basically just wrap the hair around the
barrel really quick it's so easy for me
to do so I just do that mostly every
morning or if I have it second day I'll
just leave it so I wait a little bit for
my curls to kind of cool off and then I
go in with a teasing brush and kind of
tease the tops of my hair especially if
it's second day hair it needs a little
extra volume then I'll go in with a
little bit of texturizing spray just
like I said to add a little bit more
volume to my second in hair and then of
course finished with hairspray because
my hair needs it with this humidity
but that is it for my get ready
processed but I thought I'd show you
guys my outfit this is a very typical
outfit of mine that I'd wear in the
summer you guys know I love my
high-waisted shorts and my crop tops so
I thought I would show you this one so
starting off with my shorts those are
just some distressed high-waisted denim
shorts from forever 21 I bought them for
a video and I've loved them ever since
they're like wanna become one of my
favorite for my top that is just a crop
top from revolve clothing I love the
knot in the front it gets awesome my
layer necklace is from Nasty Gal and my
shoes are from dr. Scholl's I bought
them for the Shay Mitchell get the loop
video and I've been wearing them ever
since cuz they're so comfortable but
that is it for my get ready with me
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
