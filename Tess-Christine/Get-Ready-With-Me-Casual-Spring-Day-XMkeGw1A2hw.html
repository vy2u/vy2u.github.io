get ready with me video I haven't done
one of these in so long so I thought it
was about time that I uploaded one plus
I started shopping at this new online
store called thredUP
it's probably one that some of you
haven't heard of so I thought I'd put it
in this video to tell you guys about it
so if you're interested in seeing how I
got ready for a casual April day then
just keep on watching
to begin I'm applying Dermalogica oil
control lotion to my face just to help
control the shine throughout the day and
then now I'm applying my foundation my
Holy Grail foundation is the Make Up For
Ever HD I always come back to the stuff
after trying different foundations it's
just one that works the best for me and
how I'm applying it is with a Beauty
Blender sponge if you don't already know
this I love Beauty Blender sponges I
just think they help blend the
foundation so nicely
moving on to concealer one that I just
started using again that I've used
before and I love is the maybelline age
rewind concealer I get it in light so it
gives a nice glow to the right points of
my face but I just really love this
stuff it really does the job pretty well
in my opinion
now of course I'm just setting
everything with a translucent powder and
then now moving on to bronzer since I'm
not tan at all I'm just using the
benefit hoola bronzer just to give some
color to my face and contour the right
pipe points but without getting crazy
contour because it's just a day look and
then now applying some blush to my face
nothing too drastic and then of course a
highlighter for a nice glow there just
kind of my face basics even just like on
a daily basis and lastly for my face of
course I'm going to apply some chapstick
just to moisturize and then now I'm
brushing out my eye brows and I'm going
to fill them in pretty lightly unless
I'm going out or have somewhere nice to
be I don't spend too much time I don't
really know I just think filling them in
briefly works for me especially on an
everyday basis now I'm applying some eye
primer to of my lids to apply eyeshadow
on a day to day basis I actually would
rather just not wear any eye makeup but
my eyes are quite big and I find that I
look a little bit funny with nothing on
there so I just applied a base shadow
and then a brown in the crease both
matte and then just for a little bit of
shimmer and glow to the inner corners I
just applied a gold shade with my finger
just to pick up the pigment easier and
I'm just putting that into my inner
corners and a little bit onto my lid
moving on to eyeliner one of my favorite
things to do recently is gel eyeliner I
love the L'Oreal gel eyeliner it works
so great so I just use the brush that it
comes with and I just do a slight wing
nothing too drastic or crazy but I just
do this almost every day so I really
kind of practiced and mastered it so
it's really really quick for me
and lastly I'm curling and applying
mascara to my eyelashes my favorite
all-time favorite mascara at the moment
is the Maybelline colossal mascara if
you haven't tried this already
definitely do because it's awesome
moving onto my hair I showered and then
let it air-dry law is eating breakfast
and filming the makeup portion of this
video so now that it's dry I'm just
brushing it out and I'm gonna begin
curling it for the day I usually like to
curl it's kind of my favorite thing to
do but I have been getting into
straightening it more which is much
quicker but for this curling process I
do this all the time I just like to use
a clipless curling iron like this one
and I just basically wrap pieces of hair
around the barrel not too thick of
pieces and you just get these kind of
loose waves it's like one of my go-to
looks it's super easy and it's really
great for second day hair so tomorrow
when I wake up it's really really easy
to work with so like I said I'm just
curling my hair randomly random pieces
I'm picking up wrapping it around the
barrel holding it for only a couple
seconds releasing and like I said you
get these loose waves and I have baby
curls like I have little waves on the
sides of my head so I like to take a
clamp curling iron now and just smooth
those out a little bit because as you
can see on the side of my face they do
kind of wave a little bit and I don't
really like those so I like to smooth
those out just to give more of a
polished look
so now to relax the curls a little bit
I'm just running my fingers through them
to make them just a little bit more wavy
and loose and then of course finishing
with some hairspray I'm using the
Garnier 40 selects will hold hairspray
love this stuff so much and yeah that's
my hair so now let's get into my outfit
so like I said in the beginning of the
video I was recently introduced to a new
online store called thredUP
and you guys know me and online shopping
I absolutely love it but what I thought
was super unique and why I even wanted
to share with you guys in the first
place
was that it's an online consignment
store so all the clothes are gently used
so they're carefully inspected and then
resold at a discounted price but why I
went shopping was because they hold
designer brands now called thredUP X so
they have brands like three people Marc
Jacobs BCBG all of those brands in my
opinion are so expensive and I hate
paying full price for them so it's super
cool that this site now offers clothes
that are gently used for way way cheaper
so for my outfit if you know anything
about me you know that Free People is
one of my favorite stores I just love
that style of clothing so much but it is
crazy expensive so when I saw this free
people dress unthread up I jumped on it
so quick you have no idea that I loved
it so much it was only $40 comparable to
over a hundred at original price the
style of this dress is awesome it has
floral it has studs it has lace it has
everything I want in a dress I just
loved it so much but since it is spring
still and I'm in Minnesota I had to pick
up a jacket as well so I picked up this
BCBG jacket it's like a cotton e
material super comfy and I thought it
matched the dress really really well so
since I scored and got this awesome
outfit for so much cheaper I did not
want to leave you guys hanging so I have
a 25% off coupon in the description box
below if you are interested
lastly I'm just gonna spray on some
Lancome perfume to smell all nice and
then I'm gonna grab my recommending can
see were wondering what it was and throw
on my Ray Ban sunglasses which are my
favorite and I'm good to go but that's
it for this video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it stay tuned for my next video
which is gonna be a prom one and yeah
thank you guys for watching and I love
you guys so much bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
