get ready with me video you guys know
how these things work so let's get
started
starting out I'm going to using the Olay
fresh effects bright on schedule I
awakening cream and what I love about
this it has a try rollerball applicator
so it really massages underneath your
eyes to get rid of the puffiness plus it
just goes on so smoothly and feels so
good I could seriously do this for so
long and also it hydrates underneath
your eyes so I really like it next up
I'm going to be using my favorite Olay
fresh effects clear skin swirled
mattifier this is kind of like an
all-in-one product for me it's a primer
for my makeup but it also helps diminish
oil reduce the look of redness and
minimizes my pores plus it just smooths
out my skin so I really like using it
before I apply my makeup
moving on to foundation I'm going to be
using my favorite Make Up For Ever HD
foundation and I'm applying that with a
Beauty Blender sponge how I like to
apply this is I basically just start
with the product in the center of my
face because that's where I find I have
the most imperfections and then I blend
outwards I like using a Beauty Blender
sponge because I think you use a less
product with this it blends it really
nicely and I don't know I find that it
helps with breakouts too because I'm not
using a brush that can hold bacteria
because I kind of wash out my sponge
every single time
moving onto under-eye concealer I'm
using the it cosmetics bye bye under eye
and the color neutral medium I strictly
use this underneath my eyes because it's
a very thick consistency so between this
and the deep of eye roller I think my
bags are underneath my eyes really
diminish and then I will use a NARS
creamy concealer for any breakouts that
I have to set my under eye concealer I'm
using from the Anastasia contour kit I'm
using the color banana which is my
favorite and I'm basically placing that
on my t-zone or any highlights on my
face just to kind of set that lighter
color then I'm going in with an angled
contour brush and I'm picking out the
center bronzer shade in that palette and
basically just going to put that in the
contours of my face my cheekbones on the
top of my forehead
on my jawline and on my neck a little
bit and then I also like to take a
different brush which has more of a
straight edge and I like to contour my
nose very minimal I don't do this crazy
I just kind of do it lightly and blend
it out with my finger
for highlight I'm using the josie maran
argan oil
illuminizer and I'm basically just
putting this on the back of my hand and
then blending it out with my finger on
the top of my cheekbones for a blush I'm
using this muted pink shade by the balm
cosmetics in the color cabana boy now
after I applied all my face makeup I'm
going to wash my hands I don't know why
I included in this video but I thought
it was necessary and then now I'm going
to be doing my brows now my favorite
thing to use for my brows is the
Anastasia dip brow and so I just bought
the brush that comes with it has a brush
on one side and then a spoolie on the
other and I basically just start filling
in my brows my brows will and have never
been perfect but this is just kind of
how I found I really like it I like to
keep them fairly thick um and so yeah
it's pretty self-explanatory just
watching me do it moving on my go-to
eyeshadow primer is the NARS eyeshadow
primer or eyeshadow base I really like
it because I have oily lids so this
really helps for my eyeshadow I'm just
taking a color from an estate water
palette I will have it the name of it
below um it is just basically like a
light pink champagne color I'm placing
that on my lids and then with a fluffy
brush I'm just taking the bronzer that I
used to contour my face and placing that
in the crease of my eyelids this is my
go-to look for just like a casual day
something super easy to just kind of
throw together
so that's really all I do for my
eyeshadow for my eyeliner I like to use
a wing or do a winged liner that's kind
of been my go-to so I'm just using the
Smashbox gel liner and I'm basically
just creating a wing I really like using
this eyeliner pencil because it's not a
liquid consistency and I cannot for the
life of me two liquid eyeliner very well
um so I really like the gel liner and
then over it because I kind of wanted to
smoke your look or I've been doing this
a lot recently is I'm taking a flat
eyeshadow brush and I'm basically just
picking up a matte black color and going
over the liner kind of
get out a little bit just to give it a
smokier look towards my lashline moving
on to my lashes I am of course going to
curl my lashes and then apply mascara
this is when I go to mascara for so long
now and I'm actually going to repurchase
it I always switch up mascaras but I
really like this one it's the Lancome
Hypnose doll lashes I love it so much
and what you can kind of see I basically
coated on both sides of my lashes I just
think it gives me I don't know the best
outcome in the longest look
now before I apply my lip color I'm
going to brush my teeth because I don't
know what to get ready with me video so
I thought I should show you that so I'm
just brushing my teeth and then once I'm
done with that I'm going to apply my
all-time favorite lip pencil which we
talked about way too often and you guys
know I love it it's the Urban Decay 24
hour glide on lip pencil in the color
Naked 2 I've been obsessed with this
this color and Mac's world for a really
long time now I'm gonna try to switch it
up but it's kind of been my go-to
so I'm just applying that on my lips
clearly my lip pencil needs to be
sharpened but I have a tip for you um if
you want to get a fuller appearance I'm
just taking a highlighter and I'm
basically dabbing that on the center of
my top and bottom lip it just gives you
a fuller appearance without doing a
crazy Kylie Jenner challenge for my hair
it's second day hair and usually I like
to either wear a hat or put it up on the
second day I don't wash it two days in a
row just cuz it's healthy or not two for
me at least so I'm just basically
putting up into a ponytail and wearing a
jacket today so I thought it would look
good in a ponytail so I'm just basically
securing it up like so kind of loosening
the edges and kind of taking out pieces
for more of a casual look and then I'm
kind of just scrunching up the back of
my ponytail for a fuller appearance and
that's it for my get ready process so I
guess I should show you guys my outfit
now for my outfit I just wore something
that was super comfortable and easy to
walk around in it was probably like
sixty degrees today so it was like the
perfect temperature for this for my top
that is from Topshop and is just a
floral printed top and I wore a black
leather jacket from All Saints for my
boyfriend jeans those are from gaps and
then I wore some just basic white
champion cads and then my purse is
Rebecca Minkoff along with my ray-ban
club master sunglasses
but that's it for this get ready with me
