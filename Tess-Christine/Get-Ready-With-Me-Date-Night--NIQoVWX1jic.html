with me video I decided to put a
voiceover on it this time so I really
hope you guys enjoy it
to begin I'm applying my favorite
foundation at the moment which is the
Bourjois healthy mix foundation and I
ordered this off of ASOS in case you
guys are wondering how I get it and to
apply it I use a Beauty Blender sponge I
love using these I kind of forgot about
it but now I started using it again and
I absolutely love it next I'm applying a
concealer I just started using the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer to kind of see
what all the buzz was about and I can
tell you that I absolutely love it as
you can see I went a few shades lighter
than my natural skin color um you have
to be really careful when you do this
and make sure you blend blend blend um
to make sure it looks really nice so I
kind of went over it with the Beauty
Blender sponge afterwards to make sure
it's all blended in next I am applying a
translucent powder this doesn't add any
color or makeup to your face it just
kind of eliminates the shine which is
perfect for me next I need to brawn
since it's winter and I'm losing all of
my tan so I'm using NARS Laguna bronzer
to kind of do the 3 be contouring
bronzing on my face
moving on to blush I'm using NARS deep
throat I really really love this it's
like the perfect pink color for my
cheeks and then lastly for my lips I'm
just going to moisturize because it's
really important so I'm just using a
Burt's Bees chapstick now for my
eyebrows I'm just going to brush them
out I was being kind of lazy and didn't
want to fill them in today so I just
brushed Chum and then now I'm applying a
Urban Decay's primer potion before I put
on my eyeshadow for my eyes I'm keeping
it very natural and very simple because
from my experience with guys and going
on dates they don't like to see you
caked on with makeup so I'm keeping it
very very natural all I did was apply
two colors one is a matte brown shade
and then what is a light pink shimmery
shade and I'm just kind of blending that
in all over my lids and then for some
definition in the eyes I'm just using a
gel eyeliner this one is from L'Oreal I
absolutely love this stuff this is the
second one that I bought um it's really
really good and it's inexpensive which
is a bonus but all I'm doing is I'm
drawing a thin line on my eyes and then
kind of flicking it out at the end for a
little bit of drama nothing too dramatic
by any means though
you
now for this next part sometimes I do it
sometimes I don't but I decided to
tightline my eyes with a pencil eyeliner
and then line the bottom half of my
water lashline now to make my eyes pop
and give me a little bit of highlight
I'm just going to be taking a nude
eyeliner by Rimmel and I'm just going to
put that into my inner corner and on the
rest of my bottom water lashline
of course the next step is to curl my
lashes so this is my favorite part of
entire makeup look sometimes I'll even
just wear mascara and for my eyes and
that's it just because I love what it
does to my eyelashes so I'm just using
Clinique slash doubling mascara and then
Maybelline colossal volume mascara I'm
just kind of coating that on my lashes
to make my eyes just appear brighter and
wider lastly for my lips I'm applying
this lip gloss by NARS it's just a light
pink color it's just really pretty and
very natural-looking moving on to my
crazy natural hair I'm going to take
that down and I'm just going to
basically curl my hair all I really
wanted to achieve for this look is just
kind of soft loose waves nothing too
overdone just very simple very
natural-looking so all I'm doing is
taking a one-inch curling iron by Conair
and just wrapping the pieces around the
barrel away from my face it just gives a
very nice soft texture once it's all
done and like I said it looks very
natural and very effortless which i
think is super super pretty
once I finished curling my hair I'm just
going to spray a texturizing spray
throughout my entire head this kind of
just helps loosen up the curls a little
bit and make it a little bit Messier and
not so uniform which I really love
plus it also adds volume which is always
a bonus in my opinion so now I'm just
kind of combing through the curls just
to give a more natural texture to them
and kind of mesh them together and then
lastly I'm just going to finish with
some flexible hold hairspray so it lasts
throughout the night so that's all I
decided to do with my hair it's very
natural very easy I'm just kind of
simple but that's kind of all I wanted
for this look anyways I'm in the firm a
makeup I kept it very natural again and
just kind of romantic and pretty now
it's time to find something to wear
which is always actually really easy
because Patrick and I keep it very
simple and very casual so finding
something to wear is always just kind of
casual and easy so all I decided to wear
was this white top from Topshop what I
really liked about it is that it was
textured and it kind of has a different
material to it so you can kind of get
away with the whole t-shirt look which i
think is really cute and then lastly for
the pants I decided to wear these
checked or plaid printed pants from
Topshop as well they're super cute
they're kind of like trousers like a mix
between trousers and leggings so they're
super comfy and then for shoes I decided
to throw on these wedge sneakers from
PacSun to kind of complete the whole
look and they're super super comfy and
of course we have to smell good because
we're going on a date so I'm gonna have
the perfume that I sprayed in the
downbar but now it's time for me to go
on my date so thank you guys for
watching and I will see you guys next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
