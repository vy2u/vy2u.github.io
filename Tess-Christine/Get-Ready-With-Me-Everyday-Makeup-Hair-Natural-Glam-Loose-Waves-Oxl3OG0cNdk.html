going to be a get ready with me video I
already have a morning routine on my
channel so basically this video is just
kind of more of a slow down detailed
version of how I do my hair and makeup
pretty much almost every day um this
one's super highly requested so I really
hope you guys enjoy it and let's get
started okay so starting off a fresh
face of course the thing that I like to
moisturize my face with is definitely
coconut oil I just take a little bit of
this warm it up in my hands and rub it
all over my face it feels so good and
then while that's kind of sitting I work
on my eyes I've been doing my eye makeup
first before my face makeup recently I
don't know why I just prefer it now so I
start off with an eye primer the one I'm
using is NARS and then I go in with just
kind of like a shimmery champagne or a
shimmery gold color it really doesn't
matter I always kind of stick with like
a shimmery like light beige color though
and then I always go in with a big
fluffy brush and kind of like a matte
soft brown color into my crease for a
little bit of dimension I'm going to be
listing all the products I use by the
way in the description box and then for
eyeliner it only tight line my top
waterline I don't really do on top
eyeliner anymore I just found I like it
this way plus it's a lot quicker and
then I go in and curl my lashes and then
I start mascara so you guys know my
favorite is the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara and if you guys saw
this in my beauty hacks video but I
always comb downwards on my lashes first
and then upwards I just found it gives
me the most length and I just like what
it does so after that I go in with more
of a dense brush this one is by Lancome
and I go in and just kind of make sure
they're nice and full and thick because
I like my lashes to stand out in my eye
makeup look and then it's time for brows
so I go in with a spoolie brush and I
basically just brush out my brows I
brush them upwards and then down my
browser really crazy so the thing that I
found that I love using is the Anastasia
a brow duo kit I like the wax part of it
because it just kind of like sets my
brows down and doesn't make them stray
all over the place so that's what I like
using and I always calm them out
afterwards for more of a natural look
now moving on to the face makeup I start
off by priming my face with the benefit
Porefessional primer been using this
stuff for years and I love it
so I rub that all over my face focusing
on my t-zone and then you guys know my
holy grail foundation is the Make Up For
Ever HD and I go in that with a Beauty
Blender sponge because it's like the
best way to apply foundation you can
control how much product goes on your
face and I just think it always looks
super airbrushed and nice so I just go
in there and I just kind of like you
know how this stuff works for my
under-eye concealer I love that
cosmetics bye bye under-eye again I've
been using this stuff for so long the
best technique to apply it since it is a
thicker concealer is to put a little bit
on the back of your hand first then use
your Beauty Blender to kind of blend
that into your eyes or underneath your
eyes and then my new favorite like spot
concealer is the Urban Decay Naked
concealer so I kind of put that where
you would normally put concealer kind of
on my t-zone but then any blemishes I
have I really like it it blends
awesomely and then I go in of course
with the Beauty Blender and I you just
kind of blend that all together so it
kind of you know looks super nice I
don't know but it's my favorite combo so
far so I definitely wanted to share a
few guys now I found that it's super
important to set your concealer so what
I'm using is the Laura Mercier
illuminizer powder it's something like
that um and I basically just take the
Beauty Blender and I place that where I
put the concealer so underneath my eyes
and on my t-zone and then all over my
face to set everything else I just go in
with the translucent pressed powder and
it just kind of mattifies everything and
then for a bronzer my favorite is a
becca duo it's like a bronzer and
highlighter but I fix lasted me so long
and I love it so I do the typical 3b
where you do the kissy face and put it
underneath your cheekbones on the top of
your hairline underneath your jawbone
and a little bit on my nose just kind of
gives you that bronzy glow but I found
that it looks super natural and not like
a really harsh contour so I love that
and then of course I just go in with
like a smaller brush and pick up the
highlighter in that duo Becca duo thing
and I put that on the top of my
cheekbones my brow bone a little bit on
the bridge of my nose
and my Cupid's bow for blush i always
use maybelline just because they have a
lot of colors so I'm just taking this
Mavi pink color and I'm placing that of
course on the cheekbones now I can't
forget to balance out my eye makeup look
so I just go in with a pencil brush and
I pick up a little bit of that matte
Brown and place it underneath my lower
lash line and then of course I go in and
put mascara on my bottom lashes
for my lips I always go in for a lip
liner I just think it lasts a lot longer
and I love what it looks like and it's
done so this one I'm going in with a war
yell a lip liner I just started using it
I kind of found it as a dupe for my
Urban Decay Naked 2 I always run out of
that thing so I'm loving that I'm
finding like drugstore dupes and this
one is one of my favorites okay so now
I'm moving on to my hair I always get
questions about it so here it goes
the first thing that I like to do is put
in some sort of leave-in conditioner or
heat protectant aka both um so I just
use the new me white truffle leave-in
conditioner and I put it in my hands and
spread it all over my hair and then I go
in with a brush and brush it out just to
make sure it evenly distributes but it
also makes curling my hair a lot easier
so you guys know that my favorite way to
curl my hair is these kind of loose wavy
beachy waves so how I achieve that is
always through a curling wand I've been
using new me for years but I just
started using this new me Titan it's a
three-in-one curling wand and it has a
bunch of different barrels which is
super cool because you can get a bunch
of different hairstyles from it my
favorite is the middle one which I
believe is the 25 millimeter it just
gives the perfect curl to kind of have
those like loose waves at the end when
you comb it out which you guys will see
but I love it because this thing heats
up super fast and curls really quick
which is awesome because I hate spending
time on my hair that day you know when
it takes too long you just want it to be
done so this one is super efficient I
love it so if you are at all interested
in the curling iron there'll be a link
in the description box below and I also
have a coupon code for over 60% off and
that is test 2016 so yeah pretty cool so
like I said I just kind of take a
sections of hair and I wrap it around
the barrel if I'm in a hurry or need a
little bit I don't have enough time I
will just kind of let it fall but if I
want it to be a little bit more full I
will catch the curl but this curling
iron is awesome on hard to curl hair it
just depends on like the hairstyle you
want you can go for a looser more chill
waves are you go like Victoria's Secret
full waves that just kind of depends and
this one is in this clip is in real time
motion so you can see how long I hold it
on the barrel it's only for like 4
seconds grab the curl and kind of let it
fall and
pretty much it so once I've curls my
whole head I wait for it to cool off and
then I use my handy-dandy fingers and I
comb through the waves just to kind of
like wave it together make it a little
bit more casual not so uniformed but you
really want to make sure that you do
this when your hair is cooled off
because otherwise all the curls will
just kind of come out so you want to let
them set a little bit so I do that on
both sides and then I go in with a
texturizing spray and I spray all over
because I like it super messy and yeah
you guys know that about me so I go in
with the texturizing spray and the hair
spray and it turns out just the way I
want it and I love it
so that is my entire get ready with me
processed from makeup to hair and really
hope you guys found this helpful thank
you guys so much for watching be sure to
give it a thumbs up if you liked it and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
