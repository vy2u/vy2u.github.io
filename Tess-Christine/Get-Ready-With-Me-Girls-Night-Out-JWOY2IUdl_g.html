be a get ready with me for a girls night
out so it's definitely a full face of
makeup but this time I focus on the lips
since it's almost fall time I also am
super excited to be partnering up with
Smashbox for their shape matters
campaign so I have a giveaway for you
guys at the end of this video so stay
tuned but I really hope you guys enjoy
it and yeah let's get started
okay so with a fresh face of course I'm
just going to apply my foundation using
a Beauty Blender sponge which is my
favorite way to apply my foundation
because it looks very unnatural and
airbrushed then for concealer I'm just
taking a lighter color concealer and I'm
placing that underneath my eyes only
because for those pesky blemishes that I
have I'm going to use a darker concealer
so ah this is a trick I learned from a
makeup artist recently and if you put
lighter color concealer on it it's only
going to highlight it so if you use one
that's closer to your skin tone it'll
help conceal it a little bit better next
when going out I love to contour my face
and in specific I love to use cream
bronzers just because I feel like they
give a more natural effect once you
blend them in and I love to focus
underneath my cheekbones because that's
my favorite place to contour but also
lately I've been contouring my nose
which I know is pretty crazy but I think
it's actually kind of fun so I'm just
drawing two lines like so and it makes
me look super scary like a tiger
but then I'm taking a lighter color
concealer and covering the bottom half
of my nose like so and then of course on
the bridge or down the front of my nose
it just lightens those areas and then
darkens the size sides where you want it
to slim down so with my handy dandy
fingers I'm just blending that in until
it looks nicely and everything looks
super natural I also go over it with my
Beauty Blender sponge just to top off
everything now I'm taking my translucent
powder and I'm just setting all of those
areas to make sure I don't get shiny
especially in my t-zone now for the
highlight I'm taking this argan oil
illuminizer which I will have the brand
of in the description box and I'm
placing that on the highlights of my
face it just gives a really a pretty
natural glow I love this stuff I've been
using it a ton lately for the cheeks I'm
not doing anything over the top I'm just
dusting a little pinkish bronze color
onto my cheekbones now onto my brows
which this product has been a lifesaver
and it's a brow pomade it's amazing I
love it so I'm just filling in my brows
like so and combing it out using a clear
brow gel at the end of everything to
make sure my crazy little eyebrow hairs
don't go anywhere now before I move on
to my eyes I'm just going to quickly
moisturize my lips before I you put on
my lip product late
moving on to the eyes I'm not going to
do anything drastic since in the fall
time I love to focus on big bold
colorful lips as do a lot of people so
all I'm doing is priming my eyes with an
eyeshadow primer and then I'm just
mixing a brown color and a gold color to
give this kind of like bronzy shade and
I'm just going to sweep that all over my
lids for just a really fun shimmery
flush of color that kind of matches my
skin tone really well with a bunch of
shimmer and then I'm just going to take
this fluffy brush and kind of blend out
any harsh lines so it's kind of a one
color and done and then I'm just going
to take a beige color and place that on
my brow bone for a little bit of highway
and then I love my gel eyeliner so I'm
just doing some winged eyeliner here
because it's my favorite eyeliner to
wear recently so I'm doing that and then
I'm tight lining with just an eyeliner
pencil now I'm just curling my lashes
and adding a couple coats of mascara and
usually when I go out I like to add
false lashes so I'm adding a set of
individual lashes
moving on to the fun part the lips I'm
just going to start by taking a q-tip
and wiping off any excess foundation or
chapstick just for a clean palate okay
so when choosing a lip liner to go out
I'll either go superlight
like this one which is just a light pink
color or like a nude on this one is the
Smashbox Oh a sharp lip liner I really
like using a lip liner first especially
this one because it's long wearing and
water-resistant which is perfect for
going out and having drinks with your
friends so I'm just starting by lining
my lips like this and then I'm going to
follow up with the Smashbox a long-wear
lip lacquer over top of it for just a
really pretty like bright pink color
another color I would go for is kind of
a middle-of-the-road color so a bright
fuchsia pink or like a red color in this
case this is kind of a mix of the two so
it's awesome so I'm lining my lips with
the always sharp lip liner by Smashbox I
love using a lip liner because it really
gives you a lot of control and helps you
enhance your lips plus this one stays
true to color so you know it's not going
to budge and then over it I'm putting
the long-wear lip lacquer again and this
is awesome because it lasts up to eight
hours so just this lip combo in general
is not going to budge when you're going
out and having fun and lastly I would go
for a dark purple color or a really deep
wine or cranberry color it's my favorite
thing to wear in the fall time in this
case I'm lining my lips with kind of a
violet color
and since purple seems to be all the
rage I thought this would be a lot of
fun but then over it I'm going over with
the be legendary long-wear lip lacquer
which is more of a cranberry color so
the two together blend seamlessly and if
I haven't told you enough about this
product it is a weightless so it feels
awesome so those are the three general
lip colors that I would choose from
before going out or while getting ready
but I want to hear from you guys so let
me know which of the three is your
favorite I think mine is the berry or
purpley one I don't know let me know
but since this is a girls night out
video I thought it was only fitting that
I put some clips of my friends getting
ready before going out and they were so
nervous to be on camera I was so cute so
be sure to give them a thumbs up moving
on for my hair i've been loving
straightening my hair lately so that's
how i had my hair from earlier so i just
left it down and now for my outfit i
decided to go for something comfy but
super cute in my opinion so i just wore
this top from Topshop with a peplum
style and some really cool checked pants
from forever 21 and then white heels
from Ted Baker but that's the video for
today thank you guys so much for
watching you guys seriously mean the
world to me and since I was talking
about big bold colorful lips in this
video I want to see yours so send me a
photo of your favorite fall lip colour
on Twitter using the hashtag
shapematters and tell me why shape
matters to you and you could win one of
the lip duels that I featured it in the
video shape matters to me because it
enhances your lips and makes you stand
out in the crowd but that's it thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video
