be a get ready with me video this time
when I hit the snooze button a little
too long so I'm going to show you guys
how I get ready when I am running late
let's get started most of the makeup
products that I'm using come in this
super awesome bag I really like using
bags like these because they're easy and
compact and I can just grab them and go
especially when I'm in a hurry and I
wanted to tell you guys about it today
because today only on QVC this bag is
significantly marked down so if you're
interested I will have a link below when
I'm running late I don't have time to
put on a full face of foundation so I
either grab a mineral powder or a BB
cream this time I'm using a BB cream by
Tarte I really really like this stuff it
could be worn alone as a primer for your
foundation or it can be worn just as a
BB cream which because I'm late I'm
obviously going to do that I really do
like this one it covers up any redness
that I do have and evens up my skin tone
and feels really really light and to
apply it and using this Tarte
double-ended brush I'm using the flat
side to buffer it into my skin next
using the other end of my double sided
tart brush I'm going to apply a BB
tinted under-eye corrector this is
basically just like a BB concealer so
I'm going to put it underneath my eyes
around my nose and on my chin in any
areas that I want a little extra
coverage even though I don't have time
to contour or highlight I do want to add
something to my cheek so I'm just
lightly dusting a light pink blush to
the apples of my cheeks
now I'm combing through my eyebrows and
applying a little bit of eyeshadow this
only takes a second because the
eyeshadow that I'm using is a duo so all
I'm doing is taking this brush and I'm
applying a light pink color or a light
pink shimmery color and then a darker
color into the crease it takes literally
seconds and it kind of makes you look
like you took a little bit longer and
it's super easy for me to do even when
I'm in a rush
now I'm adding some lights camera
flashes waterproof eyeliner from Tarte I
like applying eyeliner even when I'm in
a hurry because I do have larger eyes so
it just helps me to find them a little
bit more so I'm applying that to both my
water lines and then the top of my
eyelash line now I'm curling my
eyelashes and applying tarts lights
camera flashes statement mascara to both
of my eye lashes mascara is super
important for me even when I'm running
late it just opens up my eyes and makes
me just look more awake and put together
and it's just really important for me to
always put this on and I really really
like this mascara a lot grabs your
lashes pulls them up and away from you
and I just think it opens up your eyes
really nicely I love it
moving on to lips I would either grab a
chapstick on the go or I would want to
apply some color so I usually go for a
light pink color this one is great I
feel like it goes on really really
smooth and it stays on and looks super
nice with my skin tone so I really like
applying this one moving on to hair if
I'm feeling super lazy I honestly will
just go out with that bun and throw a
sweatshirt on and go to school and I'll
be like totally okay with it but
otherwise if I have to look a little bit
nicer I'm going to take my hair down
obviously and comb it out I'm using
second to hair because I don't have time
to shower so with my second to hair I'm
just going to tease it because usually
my hair gets pretty matted down when I
sleep so I liked using it to get it'll
give it a little extra volume now I'm
just gathering my hair and putting it
into a ponytail this is one of my
favorite ways to wear my hair when I'm
running late just because I think it
looks super cute and you can make it
look a little bit more polished by
taking a section and wrapping it around
the ponytail and it still looks really
really nice another thing I'll do is
sometimes I'll take the hair and I'll
wrap it around itself and then tuck the
ends into the ponytail and it turns into
like this really really cute bun I think
it looks really polished and nice and if
you have somewhere nice to be this way
it looks perfect for it so I really like
doing that as well the next thing I like
doing is braids and if I have time I
would prefer to do a fishtail braid just
because I like those and I think they
look cooler
if I don't have time which is usually I
will just do a side braid and I like
these I think these look polished and
nice and I can pull it out make it a
little messy and casual if I want to so
that's another thing that I really
really like doing when I'm late another
one of my favorite things to do is when
it gets a little bit colder out which it
is here now where I live I love hats so
I'm going to wear a beanie it's like one
of my favorite things to wear when it
gets colder out
this one's from Urban Outfitters it's
kind of slouchy so it's not super fancy
or anything but if I have nowhere to go
I love doing this for the outfits like I
said I love just throwing on a
sweatshirt and just going to class but
if I have to look a little bit nicer or
just want to another one of my favorites
is just throwing on a simple tank and
throwing on some sort of jacket I love
leather that's like my favorite so I'll
just throw in one of those with the
beanie that I showed you guys before and
if I have to look nice for a class a
presentation or something like that I
will just use a t-shirt throw on a
blazer and a nice statement necklace and
it looks super put together so thank you
guys for watching me get ready when I'm
running late in the morning
I hope you guys enjoyed this crazy
awesome transformation and I will see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
