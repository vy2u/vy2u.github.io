be to get ready with me for Valentine's
Day Patrick and I keep it pretty chill
so it's nothing too fancy or crazy so
it's actually a perfect kind of like
everyday makeup look I absolutely love
it it is also the same makeup
besides the lip that I wore in my
previous ask test video and a lot of you
guys said you loved it so this is the
full from what I wash my face with to
what I end with
so you guys get the whole spiel and my
hair a lot of you guys like that too
it's one of my go-to looks recently so I
figured it would help you guys out so
yeah I really hope you guys enjoy and
let's get started alright hey guys I'm
starting off with a fresh face normally
if I was going out on a date I would
just touch up my makeup from throughout
the day or like when I was already
wearing but that would be a very fun
video for you guys to watch hence get
ready with me so I thought I would just
start from the beginning and it would
just be more beneficial for all of you
guys the first thing that I do before I
apply my makeup is wash my face what
I've been loving using recently is the
Olay fresh effects clear skin acne hater
deep scrub what I love about this is to
exfoliate my skin in the morning which
is nice it also gets rid of excess oil
that builds up over night you guys know
I have a Whaley skin so this is super
awesome leaves it really really soft
next up is a primer like I said I have
oily skin so I like to mattify so I'll
either use for minimizing some sort of
primer or I'll reach for this just
started using this and it is the Olay
fresh effects clear skin swirled matte
fire and what I love about this stuff is
it keeps you shine free so it's perfect
for a makeup primary because I do not
like my skin looking oily now moving on
to makeup I am going to start with my
eyes first cuz I've been trying that out
recently and I actually kind of like
doing that so for my eyes the first
thing I like to do is a Pratt apply some
eye primer this is the one that I like
the most it's the NARS eyeshadow primer
it just I've noticed the most difference
with it not creasing so for the actual
eyeshadows what I love to do is just
start out by taking a bronzer I'm just
using this one from the contour kit by
anastasiya and I'm just taking on large
4fe brush like this just swirling that
in and placing that in my
next up I'm just taking a flat eyeshadow
brush like this and I'm picking up um
this kind of shimmery color from the
lorac Pro palette this one and this one
I like to mix
okay so I zoomed in a little bit more
but I'm just going to add a couple more
colors of the one being this like kind
of mommy pink color right here and I'm
just gonna place that in my crease over
the bronzy color next I'm just picking
up this matte kind of pinky cream color
it's actually named cream and I'm
placing that on my brow bone for a
highlight next up for eyes I'm going to
be taking a liquid eyeliner like this
one from BH Cosmetics and I'm gonna be
creating a slight wing at the end only
kind of focusing on the outer half next
up I'm just going to curl my lashes and
apply mascara the mascara I'm using is
the Lancome Hypnose drama doll lashes
and I really like it but because I
haven't done my foundation and concealer
yet I'm just gonna go ahead and apply
that on my top lashes okay so that's
pretty much it for my eyes I like to
keep it pretty natural especially for
date night so moving on to foundation my
Holy Grail foundation is the Make Up For
Ever HD foundation I'm in the shade 120
in case you guys were wondering so I'm
just going to apply that to my face with
a Beauty Blender sponge
now that I finished applying my
foundation it's time for concealer my
go-to under-eye concealer that I
recommend to all of you is the cosmetics
bye-bye under-eye concealer I love this
stuff okay so not to set everything I'm
just taking my Make Up For Ever HD
powder and I'm just taking a large
powder brush swirl it around and just
kind of put it all over my face
also I like to set my under eyes with
just a little bit extra I'm just taking
the middle one right here with like kind
of a smaller brush and I'm just going to
place that underneath my eyes next up
for bronzer I'm just of course from the
Anasazi I can't bisque it is really
awesome I'm taking just an angled
contour brush and I'm using the center
shade just because that matches my skin
tone really well and I'm just going to
do that on the contours of my face
I'm holding on to blush I'm just taking
this a rocket or blush from benefit it's
just kind of like a shimmery bronzy pink
color and I'm placing that on the apples
of my cheeks and now I can't forget
eyebrows so my favorite thing to use is
the Anastasia dip brow pomade so I'm
using that with a matching brush it has
like a spoolie and then like a straight
edge type of thing and I'm just gonna
fill in my brows
now that my brows are filled in I can't
forget to put mascara on my bottom
lashes and lastly since it's a
Valentine's Day look I thought for lips
I would do like a red or like a
cranberry color so I'm combining my two
favorite or one a one my favorite lip
liner by Mac which is well and then diva
and I'm just gonna kind of layer the two
what you guys will see here so yeah
that's it for the makeup now let's do
something with this hair so have my hair
parted down the middle and I just kind
of brush it through grab my fingers and
just kind of like gather it up towards
the back now I'm just going to kind of
gather it like I'm gonna put it in a
ponytail grab the hair kind of and like
shove it into a fist like so and then
I'm just going to take the ponytail and
start wrapping it around and then once I
have it all in there I'm just going to
begin kind of like pulling it out and
then pulling up here as well
then what I'll do if like pieces of the
bun kind of like start coming out or
whatever I'll just take some bobby pins
and I'll just start pinning them in
place kind of like enough to but like I
said more of an organized messy bun so
like over there is fine but like see how
this one's kind of like falling out so
I'll just take like a bobby pin and I'll
just kind of like put it into the
ponytail like so kind of like taking my
fingers and going like this kind of
gives it that messy look - that's what
you're going for and boil out that is it
it looks like this like I said kind of
organized messiness I like pull strands
out from the front here this look can
also be really dressed up with like
earrings and you can totally make it
your own so I'm just gonna leave strands
out like this if I want to get fancy
with it I can curl them and they'll look
nice too so ya know I'm sure you guys
know a little bit comfort is key for me
so I just wore some tan suede booties
some leather look pants from Topshop and
a gray sweater from brandy melville this
is kind of a perfect date night look for
me because we never really go anywhere
fancy especially for today we just went
out to eat and then came back in watch
Netflix
and that is it for this get ready with
me video I really hope you guys found it
helpful one way or another I hope you
guys had a really awesome day no matter
who you spent it with Patrick and I are
sending all of our love to you guys
thank you guys for watching and I will
see you guys in my next video bye
