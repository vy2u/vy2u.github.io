type of video for the new Transformers
movie if you guys haven't seen it yet it
comes out July 1st but my brother saw it
already for some reason that they had
like midnight showings starting
yesterday so they have a ton so if you
have seen it this is the look from it
but you can also see this look and the
preview and pictures and stills and all
that sort of thing so I did the look
from the girl obviously her name is
Carly she's played by a Victoria's
Secret model Rosie her name is if you
guys aren't familiar with my get the
look type videos I titled them get the
look because it's like the whole look
the hair the makeup and the outfit the
get the look video that I did before was
nina dobrev from Seventeen magazine so
if you haven't seen that one I'll link
that in below so you guys can go check
that up to kind of see what my style is
forget the look but I decided to do
another one and since transformers just
is coming up tomorrow or coming out it
has come out I don't even know I thought
it would be so much fun to do it and I
think you guys would be really
interested in it because um who doesn't
want to look like the girl from
Transformers I feel like everybody loves
the girl fun pants for murrs I really
hope you guys like this video and yeah
I'm gonna stop library and get right
into it because I'm like sweatin bullets
but I really hope you guys enjoy it and
yeah let's get into it
all right so first I'm going to prime my
eyes like usual using Mac's painterly
paint-pot
and I'm just going to put that all over
the lid next I'm going to be taking this
Maybelline quad and I found this
recently and it's just so pretty and it
has such amazing colors in it and
they're very pigmented colors too and
basically they are all bronzes and you
can see kind of gives you a guide for
those of you guys who aren't as
comfortable using makeup it has it'll
say base lid crease and liner which i
think is really nice and handy in case
you're just learning makeup and you're
not sure which color to put where these
quads are perfect for it because they
tell you exactly where you're supposed
to put it and I thought this one was
especially perfect because her look is
not smoked out where you would normally
smoke out an eye it's smoked out towards
the lash line which is kind of what this
look is supposed to be because the
darkest color is supposed to go where
the liner is I'm going to be taking this
color as the base and I'm just going to
put that on my lid and a little bit on
my crease so with a fluffy shadow brush
I'm just gonna get that all over I'm
going to be taking the backside of the
shader brush and picking up that gold
color and I'm going to Pat that just on
my lid next with a crease brush like
this and all the brushes I'm using well
these two are from Sonia Kashuk brushes
you can get these at Target so with this
crease brush I'm going to be picking up
that amber gold color and with
windshield wiper motions I'm just going
to focus that in my crease next I am
going to line my eyes first before I use
that liner color so I'm going to be
taking a pencil liner I'm not using a
liquid liner because liquid liner gives
your when you line your eyes it'll give
you a
very sharp clean line and for this look
you want it to be smoky towards your
lash line so that's why we're going to
be using a pencil liner and this will
give you the ability to smoke it out
towards your lash line
once you've lined that top lash line you
are going to tightline and so I'm just
going to bring it up and for those of
you who aren't familiar tight lining
just gives your eyes a bit more of a
definition when it comes to lining your
eyes it's kind of like invisible
eyeliner but it'll give your lashes and
your liner a bit more of a fuller effect
which is what you especially want for
this look and then I'm just going to
bring that down and line my waterline
I'm going to be taking this liner brush
and I'm going to be picking up that dark
brown color this one and I'm just going
to be smudging that over the liner in my
lash line when you're smudging it don't
go in to the corner of your eye you
don't want it to be smoky necessarily in
there you just want to smoke it on the
outer half of your lash line
you're just going to smoke it on the
outer half of your lower lashline as
well
high mascara I'm using the voluminous
millions of lashes mascara by L'Oreal
but you can pick your favorite doesn't
matter alright and then as for her face
makeup she doesn't have a lot going on
because the scene is just crazy so if
she has anything on her face it's like
dirt and you know what I mean if you've
ever seen transformers
it's very bronzy and very it has a
little bit of a pink sheen to it so what
I think would be perfect for this as a
cream blush and the color is so sweet so
easy so sweet so easy yeah that's what
it's called
and I like applying this with my three
fingers and she is very defined
cheekbones as do all Victoria's Secret
models so um what I like to do to create
that is kind of suck in my cheese and
then focus the blush right where you can
see a you know a defined cheekbone so
that's what I'm going to be doing very
lightly because we're gonna be playing a
powder blush over it now to define our
cheeks a little bit more and set that
cream blush I'm going to be using kind
of a neutral color but I'm gonna be
mixing them this one is a light baby
pink color and then this one is kind of
a peachy bronze color and then this one
is a very neutral almost my skin color
color so I'm going to be taking up blush
brush and I'm going to be mixing all
three of those again I'm going to be
focusing it on the lower half of my
cheekbone
her lips in the movie are very natural
looking lips so they don't have a gloss
to them or anything so but they are a
shot like a mafia paint color so we're
going to use that so this is what we're
going to be using and we're going to
line our lips and then fill them in and
then after we're done lining our lips
we're going to be taking a lipstick the
color I'm using is by Rimmel London and
if the color is airy-fairy
alright and then that is it for the
makeup now into hair alright hey guys
sorry about the voiceover I would
normally talk to you during the video
but my brother insisted on watching a
movie so I had no choice
so hopefully this words but to start out
with this hairstyle you're gonna part
your hair a little bit off from the
center her hair is not directly parted
in the center so that's what I chose to
do and I'm going to section my hair off
like usual you guys don't have to if you
don't want to or you don't usually do
that but as for curling my hair I'm
going to take it my one inch Conair
curling iron and wrap my hair wrap
pieces of my hair around the barrel and
you guys know I like doing this a lot
more because it allows my hair to be not
so uniformed when it's curled as you can
see it kind of gives it a nest curl and
it makes the curls a lot looser and a
little bit more natural looking which is
what you want because her hair is very
natural-looking in this in the scene of
the movie plus it's very messy because
it's where she's like running around
saving the world with Shia LaBeouf so of
course it's gonna be very messy but um
yeah I think this look is very wearable
for everyday so umm I really liked it a
lot but I'm going to do is repeat this
throughout each layer it's fairly simple
and it doesn't take a lot of time at all
so even though this video is sped up it
probably only took me like 10 15 minutes
if that so it's very easy I am using
second day hair so I found that this is
a very easy look to do for a second day
so I kind of like it
but yeah so for each layer bangs nothing
special just wrap it around same old
same old
all right and to make your hair a little
bit more full you're just going to take
a cheese and calm and backcomb pieces
around the crown of your head and the
pieces around the front of your head
just to give it more of a full effect
and then with the Guardian forty serve
hair styling cream I'm just going to get
a little bit of that on my fingers and
rub it in between my palms and work that
through my hair this is just going to
give my hair a nice texture and make it
very PC and messy which is what you want
for this look because that's how our
hair looks in the scene alright and then
all you're gonna do is finish with some
hairspray and the look is complete I
think this hairstyle is very cute for
even an everyday look a fun summer look
and I think it looks very similar to her
hair in the movie and I really hope you
guys liked it and can try it yourself
now on to the outfit and for that this
part of the movie it's like the biggest
part of the movie when all the action
sequence takes place and I chose that
outfit because I thought it was the most
wearable because a lot of her other
outfits were a lot of white dresses and
fancy things so I chose this one because
I thought it was most wearable and easy
to recreate and find a look for less for
you guys she's wearing some sort of a
white jacket I'm not sure if it's a
leather jacket I'm not sure what kind of
jacket it is but um to get this look it
could be really any sort of white jacket
so um this is the white jacket I have I
just hauled this in my last video I got
it from a local store here but the brand
is Jack by V V Dakota and it is a mock
leather jacket and it's white it's like
a white cream color and I think it
looked perfect for this look but
otherwise I have linked because I
figured if I'm gonna show a jacket that
is like the main part of this outfit I
should probably give you as other
options so in the end the bottom bar
below I linked link to forever 21 and
H&amp;amp;M they both have some sort of a white
jacket that you could achieve this look
just as nicely as hers or mine or
anything like that so you should
definitely go check out those links
they're fairly inexpensive
that's why I linked them and then
underneath she's wearing just a plain
tank top and it's dirty and whatever cuz
she's rolling around and all that star
stuff
fighting transformers but anyways so I
tried to make it mine a little bit more
cute and wearable for everyday so I'm
wearing this
ruffle white tank-top from Target I
believe and I got this um say a couple
months ago you can find stuff like this
at Target a lot this is through the
converse line I think it is but yeah so
I just do a plain white roughly tank top
I weren't underneath because she is
wearing a white tank top underneath so I
thought I would stay with her color
coordination and do that so it does peek
out in the ends which is what she had
and it hers is just kind of messy
looking and whatever her pants are kind
of faded bluish gray so um I couldn't
find obviously her exact jeans I'm not
even sure the brand of it but um I did
find ones that looked fairly similar
similar and they're from Target alright
this is what the jeans look like they
are grey skinny jeans and the butt looks
like this they're kind of cool because
they have these studs which is kind of
the same feel as what she's wearing in
the movie believe these were like $34 I
want to say and they're really really
cute and super comfortable they are kind
of a stretchy material so they feel
really really comfortable they're not
super Jean like you know what I'm saying
they're kind of jeggings almost but
they're not
there's skinny jeans and that's what
they look like I rolled them cuz I'm a
shorty well I'm not that short I'm 5'4
but they're a little bit long for me so
that's what they look like I feel like
they look very similar to what she's
wearing in the movie with the whole
white and kind of faded Jean look and
then for her shoes she is wearing black
flats and I don't have just regular
black flats the black let's I have are
these ones they have like chains kind of
on them I still think they look cute
with the outfit but like to get her
ideal look for this they're her exact
look I guess you would just go for just
plain black flats and you can get those
pretty much anywhere if you just find
like a big silver ring she had it on her
pointer finger so if you want to go for
that whole look that's where she had it
and then she had earrings that were just
slightly a slight dangle earring they
weren't super dangly they were just like
little circles that she was wearing I
don't have those I don't even know where
to find those but you could probably get
those anywhere like Target I check her
forever 21 something like that just
simple plain earrings that's all she was
wearing
it's super cute and super wearable but I
think it looks super similar to what she
is wearing in the video so I had to show
you guys but yeah that is it for this
video I really hope you guys liked these
type of videos this is my second in the
look video so um if you liked it leave
me a comment below on any requests
forget the look if you want to see me do
we get the look for a certain celebrity
someone from a TV show and magazine
anything like that let me know and I'll
definitely look into it and try to do it
for you guys but yeah give me a thumbs
up if you like transformers and liked
this video and always until my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
