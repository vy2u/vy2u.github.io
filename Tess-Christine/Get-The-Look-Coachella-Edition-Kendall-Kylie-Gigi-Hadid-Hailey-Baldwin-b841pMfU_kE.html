be to get the look video and as you can
tell it's another edition and you're
probably need to test what stopped it
the last time I did an edition video was
for Halloween and a lot of you guys
liked it basically I just group a bunch
of up the same topic into one video and
do a bunch of different ones instead of
just one specific celebrity so I thought
of another event that involved
celebrities Coachella
yay picked four of my favorite looks
from last year and I recreated them for
you guys for a lot less again I will
have all of the clothing items linked on
slopes duration which will be a link
down below so makes your life a lot
easier oh and one more thing you're
probably thinking Vanessa Hudgens isn't
in this video it's irrelevant if it has
to do with Coachella and I feel you she
just didn't go last year's hopefully she
goes this year and gives us some new
fashion inspiration for all of us boho
lovers because she's clean so anyways I
still hope you guys enjoyed this video
and find some fun new spring or summer
outfits from it or festival concert
outfits whatever you so please take away
from this that would be awesome and yeah
let's get started okay so starting off
with this first outfit I thought I would
pick this one that Haley Baldwin wore
last year because it's probably the most
mellow at Coachella outfit I've seen
it's perfect for those of you who aren't
even going to a festival or Coachella
because it just involves a few simple
pieces and it's actually perfect for the
spring and summer so the first thing
you're going to need are over-the-knee
boots these are awesome they're from
windsor and they go with a lot of
different things then denim shorts
they're our staple from you and it
starts getting warm out as I'm sure they
are for a lot of people mine are from
ASOS and then a high neckline crop top
you can go for a t-shirt version like
hers or you can go for more of a flowy
version like mine I purchased mine from
ASOS along with my heart-shaped
sunglasses
moving on to miss Kendall Jenner now
she's one of my favorite people to
recreate because she wears such
expensive things so it's always a
challenge for me to find a look for less
but I love it so this was probably my
favorite outfit that she wore last year
I just think it's really fun and
different and what's cool about it is
you just remove the statement pieces and
can totally be something more wearable
and wear a top obviously instead of a
swimsuit
you can totally change it up and make it
your own but I love it so starting off
with the cut-offs that is from those are
from ASOS along with my drop coin waist
belt and then for the swimsuit I found
one from Mellie Beach somewhere that has
a similar print and color pattern as
hers for my brown suede vest that I
already had in my closet but they have a
bunch out now especially with fringe so
you can always change it up for my
statement necklace that is from Windsor
and then I wore some mirrored aviators
from forever 21 for my shoes I wore some
tan sweet ones that I had from urban but
you can go for Python a printed booties
to match hers a little bit more if you
want now I couldn't do Kendall without
doing Kylie and I've never actually done
a look for less or get the look for
Kylie so this is probably my first one
and it's really fun so I picked this one
from Coachella I think it was just kind
of very her and it just kind of stands
out as this is a kindly look so starting
off with the shoes I just wear the same
ones from urban but you can go ahead and
buy timberlands if you want to for my
little two-piece that I bought them
separately from forever 21 so I found
the shorts in the top both this kind of
like neutral suede color and then for my
long duster cape that is from forever 21
as well again I will have this all
listed on celeb spiration for you in
case you're interested in any of it
and then for my hat the bat is from
Windsor along with my gold choker
necklace
and last but not least a gigi hadid
she's one of my favorite people to
recreate also because I just love her
style so I picked this outfit mostly
because it's very very Coachella but I
also think it would look super good at
like some sort of a summer concert it's
pretty mellow it's not too colorful or
anything like that so I love it so
starting up with the shorts those are
just some black high-waisted shorts from
Urban Outfitters and then I wore the
same belt that she had actually and
that's from ASOS still available and
then my black crochet top that's from
forever 21 along with my fringe vest
which I absolutely love also would look
good with the Kendall outfit and then I
wore the same suede boot ease because
they matched little long with some
layered necklaces from Nasty Gal
so which outfit was your favorite let me
know in the comments below thank you
guys so much for watching give it a
thumbs up if you liked it or like make
it the lick videos and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
