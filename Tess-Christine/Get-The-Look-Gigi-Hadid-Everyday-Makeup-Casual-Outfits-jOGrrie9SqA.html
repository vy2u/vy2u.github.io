be a get the look video for a gigi hadid
and i'm super excited about this one
because i absolutely love her style and
i know i say that in all my get the look
videos but this girl's probably top 3
for me because i think of everything
she's worn I'd be like I'd wear that
also I'm doing the makeup this time I
know the past if you get the look videos
I haven't been but I thought it was
perfect because you know I do look for
less and if you didn't know Gigi is
actually a Maybelline spokesperson so I
thought it was perfect to do a makeup
tutorial all using drugstore products
specifically Maybelline so I teamed up
with them to show you some of her
favorite Maybelline products because
they're super accessible super
affordable and to showcase a new trend
called athleisure which is not only
perfect for Gigi but it's perfect for
back-to-school
which i think is more important because
this look is very natural-looking
perfect for a back-to-school look that I
think you guys will really like I'm
grassley for the outfits I'm doing six
of them and I also did price comparisons
for you guys because I know you wanted
that last time I got some comments so I
listened and I put that in there as well
so if you are interested then just keep
on watching to begin that I already
applied my maybelline superstay better
skin foundation with the Beauty Blender
sponge and then I also use the super
stay concealer like Gigi does underneath
my eyes and to conceal any blemishes
next step is to contour so I'm just
taking a flat top brush and picking up
some Maybelline fit me bronzer and I'm
basically placing that in the contours
of my face so underneath my cheekbones
on the top of my forehead it knows if
you want to and on my jaw line this
isn't the final step this flat top part
is basically where you're placing the
product it gives you a lot of control
but after I'm done with this I'm going
to blend it out so basically what what
she kind of recommended and her tip
there what she likes to do is basically
kind of define those areas first and
then blend so I'm blending upwards on my
cheekbones and then again all the places
where I put the bronzer just to make
sure there aren't any
lines for blush I'm using the Maybelline
fit me blush in medium coral and then
for highlight I'm using the Maybelline
master highlight in the color light noon
now it's time to tame my crazy bro
so I'm starting out by brushing them
through with just a spoolie brush and
then how I'm going to fill them in is
I'm going to be taking the brow to find
and fill do all by eye studio by
Maybelline and I'm basically going to
just make small strokes in my eyebrow so
this is kind of how I found the easiest
for me to do this and basically start
underneath the brow and then work your
way upwards using very small strokes and
then I like to brush them through with
the spoolie again to evenly distribute
the product so now time for eyes Gigi
made it easy on me and said that her
favorite is the Maybelline nudes palette
so that's exactly what I used she
doesn't have anything too crazy on her
lids on the day to day basis so I just
took the simple matte beige color and
place that on my lids for a base and
then to basically brighten up the eye
and give it a little bit of shimmer I
took this gold color and placed on the
inner corner and the inner half of my
eyelid then I'm taking this matte brown
color and very lightly I'm just going to
basically place that in my crease
focusing on the outer corner just for a
bit of dimension
now you could skip eyeliner altogether
but I decided to tightline to basically
help define my lashes and give a little
bit of an invisible eyeliner look so all
you have to do is line the waterline
underneath your lashes then of course
curl them and I'm applying the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara how
I apply this is I comb down on my lashes
and then work my way upwards I actually
really like this mascara I've been using
it a lot I think it just spreads my
eyelashes really nicely makes them super
full and I definitely think if you're
recreating a Gigi look lashes are really
important because she doesn't so much
focus on the eyeliner as she does having
these kind of like big lashes so if
you're recreating her look definitely
focus on that
lastly for loads of keeping it simple so
I'm starting out with the Maybelline
Color sensational lipstick in the color
mauve mania I really like it it's a nice
blush of pink color and when I blend it
in with my finger it just looks very
natural over it I'm using a gloss I'm
using the Baby Lips lip gloss in the
color taupe with me and I really like
this lip gloss it's not sticky it's
awesome they do have 12 different shades
and three finishes the shimmers of the
creams and the jellies so you have to
try it out and if you do use the hashtag
Baby Lips gloss and that is it for my
makeup look I love it I think it is so
natural and fresh it feels really good
on your face too it's definitely been my
go-to since I finished filming this
video okay so starting off with this
first outfit I had to recreate one of
her Coachella looks this year because I
absolutely loved what she was wearing
this one was one of my favorites and a
lot of you guys sent it to me on Twitter
and her outfit itself was actually
pretty affordable but it's all sold out
so I recreated it and this is what I
came up with I found a side slit dress
from forever 21 that I think matches it
pretty well and then I went to ASOS for
all the accessories kind of like she did
I found a brown suede belt that matched
it pretty perfectly and then I went for
some eated accessories so an arm cuff
and a necklace both from ASOS for my
backpack I found a white one that's much
cheaper from Paris and that's from
forever 21 and then of course I wore a
headscarf from Topshop and then she was
barefoot so I just wore some booties
that I had already had but overall I
think if you tone down some of the
accessories you could definitely wear
this on more of an everyday look then
just Coachella
okay so this next outfit a lot of you
guys sent me on Twitter and I absolutely
love it however it was the hardest to
recreate I seriously couldn't find her
exact dress anywhere let alone a similar
one so I modified it a bit and this is
kind of what I came up with so starting
out I found a white and blue striped
shirt dress from forever 21 and these
style dresses seem to be kind of popping
up everywhere but they do kind of sell
out quickly so I would keep your eye out
and you might find one that's a little
bit more similar to hers so to match her
look a little bit more I belted it with
a white belt from H&amp;amp;M and then instead
of a Chanel bag I made it more casual
with a black backpack from ASOS and then
just wore some simple black booties from
my closet lastly I found an animal
printed sunglasses from key and that's
pretty much it now since I don't know
where some of her pieces are from I
can't do an exact price comparison but
if you want my look it would cost you
$90
okay so this next look I thought was
super cute I put it on it's definitely
one of my favorites it's perfect for
back-to-school honestly I felt like I
was going to school in it but her outfit
is actually pretty pricey and I knew
with such simple pieces I could recreate
it for a lot less
so starting off with my charcoal shirt
dress I found that from forever 21 and
it was much cheaper than going for a
skirt and shirt combo so I did that and
then of course I paired it with just
some classic white Adidas because it
would be a GG hotted look if you didn't
have those for my bag I found one that
was really similar to her Marc Jacobs
one from ASOS and it even I even bought
a pom pom to go with it and then of
course I just picked up a jean jacket
from my closet and then this last one is
optional but you can wear some purple
frame glasses which I found from a cells
that were like half the price moving on
this next one is awesome because of the
jacket I mean come on
and I love her jacket itself but it's
just too expensive so I made it my
mission to find a similar one so this is
my recreation and I absolutely love it
I've worn this in a short spurgeon like
twice already so starting off with the
jacket I found Wanda from revolt
clothing that matches her print for way
less money and I paired it with my
express distressed jeans which are just
like boyfriend jeans and then some
classic white Adidas of pours I wore a
simple black shirt underneath it and
then the same black ASOS backpack from
before and lastly I found some similar
colored mirrored lenses or sunglasses
from Urban Outfitters
okay moving on this was another one that
was sent to me quite a lot on Twitter I
definitely loved it but it has such
simple pieces and as you see a lot of
name brand so I knew I could recreate
this for a lot less and to be honest I
had a lot of this outfit already in my
closet because like I said such simple
pieces so you never know so be sure to
check yours so starting out I wore the
same distressed jeans from before and
those are from Express of course my
white Adidas essential I had this stripe
top actually from a previous couple of
video from like over a year ago but
there are so many of them on like
forever 21 and 8 cells I wore a black
leather jacket from Urban Outfitters and
then the same brown bag from before from
ASOS and then some key thick frame to
sunglasses
now I save the simple one for last and
this one is actually by far my favorite
I'm saying that for all of them but this
one I've actually worn multiple times
after filming this video and even before
I just love it so her outfit is actually
all from ASOS except of course for Prada
bag but unfortunately it's all sold out
so luckily these pants are super
on-trend right now so I found some from
forever 21 for under $20 awesome and all
I had to do was pair it with a simple
white top I already own from Zara and
some black sandals and I had the look
super easy and it only cost me a little
over $30 but that's my video for today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it you
should head over to Maybelline's Channel
and subscribe if you'll want to and let
me know in the comments below who I
should do would get the look for next
and I will see you guys in my next video
