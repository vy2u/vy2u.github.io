another Halloween costume video and this
one I think is my favorite I really do
I have a few more up my sleeve but so
far this one I was like yes when I was
editing it I was like this one is so
cool
so I really hope some of you guys
recreate this for Halloween because I'm
on love with it anyways you will notice
in the video that I filmed it with some
other girls they all conveniently enough
have YouTube channels so you should
definitely go check them out because
they are awesome and tell them that I
sent you but yeah you guys should
subscribe for more videos because I have
a few more Halloween videos coming out
and of course more fall videos and just
videos in general it's just great as a
great time and yeah I think that's it so
I'm gonna stop talking so you guys can
see these awesome intros because I made
them different for each costume I'm
getting so excited ok anyways go video
okay so for the scream queens group
costume I went off of the promo photos
which is why everyone's in pink
obviously they were a lot of colors in
the show but I thought this would be the
most recognizable for my outfit I was
Chanel so I went off of her pink crop
top and found this pink 2-piece set from
Lulu since I already didn't own anything
pink in my wardrobe but however I did
have some accessories that matched hers
I wore some pearl bracelets and a
rhinestone pearl necklace which you can
find at forever 21 or Windsor for shoes
I wore some lace-up heels with some pink
ruffled socks and then carried a butcher
knife from Party City moving on to
Holly's costume she was Chanel number
two a big clothing piece factor for this
costume is faux fur all the girls wear
it in the show but ariana grande you've
got to have faux fur so I found some
super affordable ones on forever 21
which I will have linked on celeb
spiration for you guys of course wear
some white pumps or some white shoes and
then everything else pink is from
Windsor and then she also carries a
butcher knife for Julia's costume she
was Chanel number three now a key a
piece of clothing for this character is
pink fuzzy earmuffs or a pink shawl or
scarf type of thing which is what Julie
is wearing now remember guys I'm just
telling you guys key pieces that will
help you stand out or be recognizable as
the character the rest of the stuff you
can find in your own closet or at thrift
stores just make a pink
lastly Keenan is Chanel number five this
character is always wearing textured
pink or patterned pink things so Keaton
is just wearing a lace pink dress from
forever 21 with some pearls around her
neck and then of course socks and heels
that such a scream queens thing that if
you're going to do this group costume I
definitely recommend doing that and then
in the promo photos this Chanel was
carrying a coffee cup so I would do that
as well for a final touch dip your hands
into some fake blood and you'll match
the promo photos and it'll really help
you stand out plus the stuff dries and
looks awesome and after that you guys
have yourself a scream queens group
costume that I think looks so good
got a secret can key it swear this one
you'll save better lock it and you
pocket taking this one I said the seeker
is one of them is dead so for the Pretty
Little Liars costume this is by far the
easiest because all you're really going
to need our black dresses which you
might already own so I was aria and for
aria the biggest thing is to make sure
you have an edgy ER dress so this kind
of means like a black lace detail or
maybe some cutouts so mine is from
Windsor and then after that I wore some
dark lips because Aria messed up my hair
and put on some bronzer to make it look
like I was digging in the dirt holly was
Emily so for her outfit she actually
wore a dress she already owned but
remember Emily style is very simple so
you could even wear just like a black
t-shirt dress Kim was Hanna and Hanna
style is very girly but it also has an
edgy or vibe to it so I thought this
leather dress was perfect because it has
a fit-and-flare cut but the leather part
makes it a little bit edgier
lastly Julia with Spencer Spencer has a
very classic style so the cut of this
dress is perfect and that is from
Windsor for final touches make sure
everyone messes up their hair puts dark
bronzer all over their face or some dark
eyeshadow to make it look like you just
buried someone and then you have
yourself a pretty little liars costume I
think it's awesome you can even add
Alison now since the season is much
later it's up to you but I think this
costume is totally cool and you can
reuse the dresses which is awesome
for the bad blood group costume this is
super easy
I was Taylor and the main things you're
going to need for her is a cutout crop
top some high-waisted shorts and some
over the knee boots she was also wearing
some fingerless gloves so I got mine at
Party City but those can easily be made
but I'm going to show you guys how to
get her silver harness that she was
wearing which is just made out of duct
tape well my version is so you're going
to have some silver duct tape and you're
going to basically fold that in half
this is going to go around your waist so
make sure you measure accordingly you're
going to do that three times and then
you're going to take some sticky back
velcro and basically start assembling it
so right now I am just assembling the
waistband and the sticky velcro can be
found at craft stores super inexpensive
so I'm assembling it like so it's pretty
self-explanatory but then I am going to
start doing the shoulder straps now all
this is a lot easier when you do it on
yourself because you can measure it
perfectly and make it shirt it fits
really snug on the shoulders and on the
waist and you can try it on with your
costume and all that stuff but you can
also do this with your friends and they
can help you but I think it looks really
good it kind of gives off that armor
appearance because it's a shiny duct
tape but since it's Halloween it's way
less expensive and I think it looks
pretty good so there you have your
harness I wore it like so you can also
use some blacks update and make some leg
gun straps I think that would look
really cool too so moving on to Keaton's
costume she was GG so how she matched
this was she wore a deep v bodysuit
which was from Windsor with a black band
Oh some high-waisted jeans and some
gloves with the fingers cut off but she
was also wearing a harness so this is
how you make this it was out of ribbon
because I think it matched Gigi's print
of her harness a little bit more it had
more of a caged like appearance which I
just found at a craft store so I'm doing
the same thing is how I made the harness
from the Taylor Swift one so I'm
basically just cutting out velcro and
measuring it to my waist and shoulders
and then you can also get super creative
and do ribbon for all of them if you
want it to look like super intense but I
think this gives a really cool effect to
your costume instead of just wearing
black you can really kind of tell what
you are this way
I don't know I just think it looks
really good moving on to Julia's costume
this is what she wore the best part
about this costume is that you can
really draw inspiration from the
original girls in the music video but it
doesn't have to be exact so we went in
our own closets for a lot of the stuff
like Julia wore her own leather jacket
leather shorts and then added a few
pieces to make it look a little bit more
intense but you don't even have to do a
DIY like for Holly's sundae a costume we
wanted to get the look without actually
DIY anything so she wore a black t-shirt
which is really simple and then a black
skirt and then we accessorized it to
make it look a little bit more intense
so she wore gold thick belt around her
waist and then a gold necklace that had
chain details to give it kind of an
armor feel and then of course a Bullitt
sash or whatever those things are called
which you can find at like Halloween
stores or anything like that for super
inexpensive so by adding those simple
pieces you have yourself a bad blood
costume that I think looks super awesome
and it's really easy and you can even
reuse the stuff if you do buy go out and
buy stuff but I also think what looks
super cool is if you wore band-aids and
wrote on it don't fix bullet holes I
think it would make you guys a little
bit more recognizable and it'd be really
funny but that's my video for today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it be sure
to give it a thumbs up if you did and
send me a photo if you guys do this with
your friends send me a photo on Twitter
Instagram I love looking at them and I
think that's bad so I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
