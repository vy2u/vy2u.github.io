here you have no idea you are do but way
like a banshee
so you already obviously know who this
gift alook video is for and I can't even
tell you guys how many times I got
requested for Teen Wolf videos ever
since I started doing vampire diaries
everyone's like do Teen Wolf do Teen
Wolf so I spent a lot of time on YouTube
googling like clips from the show to
understand Lydia's character I kind of
do very on the surface but I love her
style which is essentially what this
video is about and her style is amazing
like I would wear all these outfits like
exactly how they are again and again and
again also if you're familiar with my
kid look videos you know that I usually
do a hair and makeup and outfits however
I decided to skip the makeup portion on
this one because her makeup is very
natural it's fresh I've already done so
many tutorials on this for other TV
shows similar Vampire Diaries Pretty
Little Liars so I will link below some
of the most similar makeup looks to hers
in the show so I don't bore you guys
with stuff I've already taught you and
stuff that's pretty self-explanatory
once you see it um but yeah enough of me
talking I really hope you guys enjoy it
and let's get started so all you have to
do for this it's so easy starting out
just have your hair parted in the middle
because that's how she wears it and then
all you're going to do is split your
hair in half so you have two even
sections right here and then all you're
going to do is begin braiding
once you get to the end of your braid
you're just going to take a small
elastic that you can get at like Target
Walmart wherever and you're just gonna
secure the end of your braid with the
elastic next you're just going to take
your handy-dandy fingers and you're
basically just gonna like pull apart at
the braid just gonna make the very braid
appear bigger and fuller and it won't be
so tight which is perfect when you're
going to wrap it on your head
this is just gonna look better okay so
now that I have these crazy braids next
to my face right here all you're gonna
do is take one of the braids and you're
going to pull up and now make sure that
the back doesn't like fly up too much
cuz if you just do that it'll go like
that which doesn't look good so what I
do is I kind of just hold on to the back
section and go like this and then once
you get over here you're just going to
secure it with a bobby pin
now with this braid all you're going to
do is place it right over top of the
other one making sure you cover this
like rubber band and the end of this
braid because you don't really want that
showing
also make sure that you pull some pieces
by your face like here because that's
how Lydia always kind of has it when you
see your in this hairstyle it's really
messy and you can curl them you can
straighten them whatever you want this
hairstyle is super cute it's completely
heatless and it takes like a minute to
do so it's awesome perfect for school so
if you try it out be sure to send me a
photo but yeah let's get on to the
outfits which is always my favorite part
for this first outfit I was able to find
the exact dress that she's wearing and
that's from hmmm I bought it recently so
you should be able to find it in store
but it's just a basic floral dress and
then for her jacket she was wearing a
peach bomber jacket but I was able to
find this one from Windsor that's much
cheaper has a similar color and is a
little bit lighter and then for my shoes
I just wore some brown boots that I
already have and those are from DSW
moving on to this next one which is my
favorite starting out with the green
coat which I absolutely love her exact
one is from j.crew and I was able to
find a mine from j.crew just the factory
store I'll have a link below it's a
little bit different but it's definitely
more inexpensive and it's so cute and
then for her dress she was wearing a
blue long t-shirt dress I believe hers
was from Ralph Lauren but I found this
one from Delia's for so cheap and then
my booties are from Target and then my
red bag is from t.j.maxx her real one is
a saline bag so this is much cheaper
next up this is another fairly simple
one she loves her floral dresses so I'm
just wearing this one from ASOS but any
floral dress will work it'll literally
give off the same look no matter what
type of floral dress you wear
and then for my sweater that's just a
basic black cardigan sweater from Target
super inexpensive this whole outfit
really can be done from your own closet
which is awesome my shoes are just basic
lace-up booties a from Target as well
are my sheer tights those are from
Target as well my necklace is from Urban
Outfitters and my gloves are from Target
as well moving on I thought I would
change up this one a little bit to cater
to my own style since I always like to
encourage that in my poke videos but
starting out the lace dress I found this
one at JCPenney on sale yay
and then for the jacket I found this
maroon leather one a JCPenney also for
super cheap I wasn't really feeling the
red but if you are then go ahead and
wear that I just wanted to change it up
a little bit and then my red belt and
booties are from Target next we have
this one which I love starting off with
the sweatshirt I found the exact one
that she's wearing and that's from H&amp;amp;M
her stylist or for the stylist for the
show always shops there so keep that in
mind for upcoming seasons my skirt
that's from forever 21 it doesn't look
very similar to the one she was wearing
she was wearing more a circle skirt but
in other outfits she wears a leather
skirt so I wanted to show you that
option in case you were interested and
then my bag is also from TJ Maxx and my
booties are target again now onto the
last outfit recreation I chose this one
because when you type in her name on
Google it shows up everywhere so
starting off with the dress I found this
one from forever 21 that looks so
similar as for the jacket her original
jacket is from gasps so kind of pricey
but I found this one at Delius that
looks pretty darn similar and then just
the same Brown booties as before Brown
booties are a staple if you want Lydia
style
but that's the video for today I really
hope you guys liked it be sure to give
me a thumbs up if you enjoy my get the
look videos and I will see you guys in
my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
