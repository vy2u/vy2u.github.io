Agatha look video and as you can tell it
is for Shane Michelle I was so excited
that so many of you guys wanted me to do
what get the look video for her because
she has some of the best style in my
opinion I follow her on Instagram and I
love her outfits so I was so excited
that so many of you wanted to see this
this video is going to be I get the look
for last video like usual however I did
incorporate some of her original output
pieces that she was wearing are actually
wearing but most of it is look for less
because I think that that's a little bit
more helpful for you guys so I really
hope you guys enjoy this and let's get
started
starting off with Shea's first outfit
she's wearing a romper from Mara Hoffman
a denim shirt from rails shoes from dr.
Scholl's and of course key sunglasses
now her outfit in total is very
expensive so now I'm going to show you
guys how I got the look for less now to
get the look for slightly cheaper I
decided to go for a shorts and tank top
version instead of a romper
Maura Hoffman's designs are very unique
actually so it's kind of hard to find a
similar romper to hers but I found this
tank top at forever 21 for super
inexpensive and it has similar colors
and design to it and I just paired it
with some white shorts from Nasty Gal to
give it that brown fur look and then for
my denim shirt I just wore one from
Topshop but any denim shirt will give
you the appearance of hers and then for
the shoes I decided to get the exact dr.
Scholl's shoes just because I thought
that they were super comfortable and
they looked awesome but I will have
smaller ones listed and then for my
sunglasses I just wore some key Shay
Mitchell collaboration sunglasses for
this next look I think she looks amazing
but her top jeans and her bag alone are
too pricy for me so I'm going to show
you guys how to get this very simple
everyday casual look for a lot cheaper
since distress denim is a huge trend
right now you can find these jeans
pretty much anywhere you go I even had
some in my own closet so I just wore
those and they are from denim and supply
and then for my top I just wore a simple
white flowy tank top from Zara for my
boots I just wore some simple black
boots from Target hers are for fur from
forever 21 so if you want as a more
similar look you can keep your eye out
for those and then for my choker that is
from Topshop and then I just wore my
all-time favorite Rebecca Minkoff
egg since I already owned it but any
black bag with a gold chain will give
you the same look this next one I can't
really call a look for less since I
purchased the exact mink pink romper
that she has it is on sale now so that's
a bonus but finding a similar Aztec
printed romper to this one was very hard
but I will have a few other cheaper
versions listed on celeb spiration
but since I genuinely liked this one I
wanted to get it plus it's super
comfortable so like I said any Aztec
romper will give you a very similar look
I did go for cheaper sunglasses and
purchase just some simple round ones
from forever 21 when I saw this outfit
on Instagram I kind of had to do some
digging because I didn't know where her
exact pieces were from but I decided
that I could definitely get it for
cheaper so instead of going for a short
and crop top combo I decided to go for a
white romper just because I think you
get more for your money in that sense
and you don't have to spend this much so
my white romper is from ASOS I thought
it was really pretty with the lace
detailing on the front a little bit
different from hers but I think it's
always fun to add your own spin on get
the look videos and then for my
sunglasses I got these key ones they
aren't her Shay Mitchell ones but I
thought these were pretty cool and then
instead of going for pumps like she did
I wanted to make it more everyday casual
so I found these sandals from Topshop
since I'd like to think that Shay and I
have very similar styles I actually
already own two of the pieces from this
outfit which was posted a while ago so I
figured I would still recreate it but of
course incorporate some cheaper pieces
of the outfits like the short and the
flannel
so starting off with the boots those are
Stuart Weitzman Highland boots they are
very pricey so I'll have some other over
the knee boots listed on celeb spiration
comm for you guys but those are the ones
I'm wearing and then for my top that's
from for love and lemons just a simple
lace crop top but then for the shorts I
went for a cheaper high-waisted
distressed denim short and I got those
from forever 21
and then a red 800 black flannel from
H&amp;amp;M this next one I love and I knew no
matter what I could recreate it for
cheaper since it incorporates very
simple pieces and I just think this
outfit in general is just perfect for
like an everyday casual look but
definitely a little bit more put
together with the shoes so starting off
with the shoes since mules are kind of
coming back now I found mine from Urban
Outfitters that have a similar brown
color to hers and they're super
comfortable for my boyfriend jeans those
are from American Eagle they're just
some simple distressed dark wash denim
jeans and then for my sweater that is
from forever 21 and is just a
loose-fitting sweater that I tucked in
slightly and that's it now for the last
outfit her top and her shorts are both
from lovers and friends which is a
pricier brand could v find at revolve
clothing her bag is Louboutin and her
shoes are Tory Burch so very expensive
overall and I new for this one I could
definitely get it for cheaper so this is
a my outfit that I recreated and I
definitely think it's my favorite from
this entire video I've already worn it
like twice I think since I bought it or
put it together so starting off with my
top that is just a crop top with a
deeper V from Urban Outfitters my shorts
are my nude favorite a high-waisted
shorts from forever 21 my flannel is
just from PacSun and then my saddle bag
which is kind of a similar brown color
to her Louboutin one that is from ASOS
along with my metallic gold flats for my
accessories I just went for some gold
framed sunglasses from key instead of
her white framed ones just because I had
already owned mine and then just a
simple gold bangle from Target
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it be sure
to give it a thumbs up if you did and
let me know in the comments below who
you want to get the look for next also
