filming a collab video and as you can
tell it's a Vanessa Hudgens video and
you don't if you're not coming from her
channel you wouldn't know that she's
like a major Vanessa Hudgens and as my
Shay night my mom so I decided to do a
look for less for her but we decided to
split it up so she's gonna do your head
and makeup and then I'm gonna do the
outfits taking the best clap I'm gonna
say mmm hello I started so for the first
outfit vanessa is wearing a top and
skirt from flint sky shoes from seoul
sana a designer bag and a fairly
expensive hat from Free People so now
I'm going to show you guys how I
incorporated some of her original pieces
and made it my own and a little bit more
affordable so this is my outfit
recreation I absolutely love it I've
already worn it a few times after I
filmed the video which makes sense
because I actually already owned the
Flyn sky skirt that she had so I really
liked it but I did look for you guys so
I'll have a few other pinstripe skirts
linked on celeb spiration for you but if
you do want to go ahead and buy the
skirt pair it with a cheaper top like I
did this one's from revolve clothing can
also buy it at Planet Blue and then I
paired it with of course and layered
necklaces which I already own from Nasty
Gal and then for my hat that's from
Urban Outfitters much cheaper than hers
and then I did go ahead and buy the
exact shoes that she was wearing the
sole sonna ones I bought mine at nasty
al but the metallic sandal is a huge
trend right now so of course I'll link
some more for the bag I found a cheaper
one from her designer from H&amp;amp;M and
that's it this next outfit I really
wanted to recreate because I think it's
perfect for everyday it's simple pieces
that you can recreate with a lot of
things you might already own as you can
tell her stuff is very expensive so now
I'm going to show you guys how I got the
look for less
this outfit was super comfy and it was
really easy for me to recreate so I
definitely wanted to show you guys so
starting off with my shorts those are
from Topshop they're a green color not
exact to hers of course but I thought
they gave off a similar look the belt
that I paired it with to match hers is
one just from ASOS but any black belt
will work and then my tank top is just a
simple black one
from forever 21 and then for my necklace
it's just kind of I don't even know it's
like cloth almost I bought that at Nasty
Gal it's very similar to hers my lace-up
flats those are from Topshop as well as
my fringe bag she had a fringe backpack
so whenever you find first but that's
what I really liked and then my round
sunglasses are from forever 21 this is
one of the first outfits that pops up
when you google her New York City
outfits this summer and I absolutely
love it but the skirt itself is crazy
expensive and the top that she's wearing
is affordable but it's sold out so now
I'm going to show you guys how I kind of
modified it to my own and made it a lot
cheaper so as you can tell I went for
the Sailor style pant instead of a skirt
because to be honest finding a similar
skirt to hers was pretty much next to
impossible but I found these Sailor
style pants pretty much everywhere these
are from H&amp;amp;M super affordable they're
way comfortable and I feel like they're
easier to wear throughout the day than a
big heavy skirt for my top I found a
similar black and white embroidered 4:01
from forever 21 I can get matches really
well to her three people one I wear the
same layered necklaces from Nasty Gal
for the shoes I just stuck with the sole
sano ones that I had already purchased
but like I said I will link other
metallic ones for you guys the same H&amp;amp;M
cream bag to match her designer one and
that's it
when I saw this finesse outfit I knew I
wanted to recreate it because I
absolutely loved it her dress is super
expensive as you can tell actually all
the items that she's wearing our over a
hundred dollars and I knew I could get
this look for less so as you can see
this is my recreation it's super flowy
and light perfect for summer I really
like it it's probably the most
comfortable that I've worn out of this
whole video I really like it so starting
off with a dress that is from mango it's
very similar to hers in the sense that
has kind of a sheer panel at the bottom
somewhat but most importantly I think it
was like $30 so huge score you can
correct me if I'm wrong on substation
but such a steal for the sweater I found
the exact one and I wanted to buy the
exact one from American Apparel because
it's super comfy the same layered
necklaces from Nasty Gal on the same hmm
bag and then I just wore some Brown
mules from Urban Outfitters and then of
course the same around sunglasses from
forever 21 this nice outfit that she's
wearing is definitely the most expensive
outfit of hers I think in this entire
video full of designers it's super cute
though and I absolutely love it so I
really wanted to recreate it especially
for summer so this is my recreation I
think it's really fun the floral dress
really really matches hers and it's very
different it's not even from flynn's guy
at all but I think the ruffle sleeves
and the tied front of it and then the
slit at the bottom really matches the
style of hers even though it's not exact
and I got that from Ravel clothing for
the jacket I just wore that over my
shoulders like her and that's just a
jacket that I owned you can find mother
jackets everywhere for my necklace that
is one I found on sale at H&amp;amp;M for like
$2 and then for my shoes I got those at
Topshop which I think matched pretty
well to her Saint Laurent ones they're a
bit of a different style but I think
they give off a similar look and then of
course the same bag from H&amp;amp;M
this next outfit kept popping up on my
Twitter feed and I knew I had to
recreate it because I think it's one of
my favorites it's the closest to my
style um that I've seen so far in this
video so I really like it so this is my
recreation I think I did a pretty good
job but I do have to say though that
it's probably because of the Stuart
Weitzman boots that I had already owned
so of course I wanted to put them in
this video
but luckily since these boots are
amazing stores are starting to come out
with similar versions to the
so of course I will have it linked and
even though minor grinders are kind of a
beige style I have ones that I think
match hers even a little bit more so
check out the links for those for the
dress I found mine from Reformation it's
the same navy color but it's not a
romper like hers but I think it really
matches with the way that the neck is
cut and the length of the dress
I obviously paired it with the same H&amp;amp;M
bag and then for my sunglasses I didn't
know where hers were from but I had some
key ones that had a very similar kind of
rim to them if that makes sense
um so I wore those this outfit I
absolutely love I'm obsessed with the
romper but when I saw the price I was
like hey don't want to do it so I knew I
could recreate it just because it was
only a couple pieces that I had to
really find so I found my look for a lot
less I was really excited about it this
is obviously my outfit recreation the
main key piece to this was definitely
the dress that I found from Zara it has
similar kind of print to it it's not the
exact color that she had but I
definitely think it matches hers fairly
well and it was like $30 again so it was
not that bad i belted it to give it kind
of a romper look my belts from H&amp;amp;M
I just paired it with some Brown mules
from Urban Outfitters and then for the
necklace I found this kind of crescent
moon necklace which I thought was very
Vanessa Hudgens so I paired it with that
and then a blazer from Zara as well
that's kind of an oversized one to match
hers okay now time for the last look I
absolutely love this one but when I
found out her jumpsuit was sold out and
her bag was that expensive I was like no
but I really love it and I thought I
could recreate it myself so this is my
recreation I thought it turned out so
well I'm in love with it
so if I have anywhere nice to go I'm
definitely going to rock this so for my
jumpsuit that is from Topshop I think
it's really actually similar to hers it
has that deep v it's not as intense as
hers but as that neckline I think really
matches it um obviously it's white but
my pant suit is actually cropped which
at the time I was bummed but it actually
looked really awesome with the shoes
that I had already owned from Nasty Gal
bought them about a year ago but you can
find really any white shoe and it'll
look great for my blazer that's the same
oversized one from Mazzara my bag that's
from Nasty Gal I thought it looked very
similar to her Chloe one
was much more affordable and then lastly
for my necklace I thought it was very
Vanessa Hudgens with the stones in it
and had that drop style that her
necklace did and that is from Planet
Blue
well that's it for the video really hope
