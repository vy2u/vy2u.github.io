everywhere i go play you everywhere i go
but you will repeat play you everywhere
i go up and everywhere I go I see you
everywhere I go
as you guys can tell today's video is
going to be a zendaya get the look video
and before I blabber anymore in this
intro if you don't follow me on Twitter
you won't have seen this happen um I'm
so like on cloud nine about that I'm
like up here living because that rarely
ever happens to me when I do get the
live video where the actual person even
sees it let alone acknowledges it
approves it so I'm stoked on that
anyways I show you guys six alpha tree
creations that you guys sent me on
Twitter that were your favorite Sunday
looks and I linked all the outfit pieces
on sub spray-shun so I did all the work
for you don't just gather the web for
anything you may like it's all over
there which will there will be a link in
the description box so yeah I really
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started
okay so starting off with outfit number
one you guys sent this to me a ton on
Twitter and I think it's because of the
fact that it's super simple but Sunday
it puts her own kind of twist on it to
make it a little bit edgier and I knew I
could recreate this for a lot less
because of its simple pieces and I love
it because you can modify it a bunch of
different ways so starting off with a
sweater dress I found mine from booboo
calm they have a bunch of different
colors and styles of a sweater dress
super affordable I think mine was like
$35 so I thought that matched her is
pretty well then I got some bangle sets
from Windsor and those were super
inexpensive as well and then of course
some nude pumps which you might already
have in your closet but if not I found
some from Steve Madden now every time I
do get the look videos I always I'm
asked for price comparisons so here you
go if you wanted her look it would cost
you seven hundred and seventy dollars
and mine would just cost you a little
over a hundred moving on to outfit
number two this again was another super
popular one that you guys sent to me I
think it's very cute I think it's kind
of like schoolgirl chic I don't know I
love it umm very simple pieces and
actually the dress was probably the
hardest for me to find something similar
there's not a lot of stores that make
polo dresses or colored dresses that
look like that so the closest I could
find was this grey one from Urban
Outfitters I think the main thing is
that it has a collar and it'll totally
give off the same look then for my
jacket or kind of duster coat whatever
you want to call this thing I got that
from boohoo calm as well I'm super
affordable and then for my over-the-knee
black boots that look very similar to
hers those are from Windsor it's kind of
like that patent leather um not super
shiny but definitely the same kind of
style cut boot if that makes sense
so if you wanted Sunday as exact pieces
it would cost you about $3,000 where a
mine depending on what you already own
would cost you about a hundred and sixty
pull me on to outfit number three I
loved this one because of its simple
look simple pieces but it also has a
super edgy vibe very different from me
so I wanted to recreate it you can find
this these outfit pieces at a lot of
different places I went to H&amp;amp;M and got
the Harlem pants or jogger pants for
every want to call them I think they
were like under $20 I'm almost positive
they're like 12 to 16 they were super
affordable and they're the material that
you can kind of dress up to which I love
or my t-shirt that is also from H&amp;amp;M I
think it was like five dollars just a
simple black t-shirt and then my vest
overcoat thing is from Windsor and then
I paired it with just some strappy
sandals that I had but if you want to
match Sunday as I would go ahead and
wear black pumps so for Sunday's exact
look it would cost you almost $2,000 per
mine only 70
okay so you guys sent me this outfit a
lot and it's from her at the Star Wars
premiere this is definitely a challenge
because finding something similar
especially the skirt was almost
impossible so I decided to look for
instead of a beaded or embellished
spirit I looked for a sequin skirt
because most of the time those are a
little bit more affordable as well
so I find found mine from forever 21 and
then over it I just paired a greater
ttle neck I kept it a little bit more
casual by leaving it untucked and kind
of having like a looser feel to the
outfit but you can totally match hers
and tuck yours in if you so pleased for
my shoes I just want some basic black
strappy sandals but on celeb spiration I
have ones that are linked that look more
like hers from the premiere if that's
more your thing and then for my earrings
I got some really simple kind of
bejeweled earrings from Windsor that are
super affordable and look awesome for
the price comparison some of Sunday's
are estimated since your clothing hasn't
come out yet but it's estimated around
5000 whereas mine is just a little over
a hundred
okay oh my gosh this one I love this one
I think it's so cute a few of you guys
sent this to me on Twitter and it stood
out to me because I loved it so much um
very casual I definitely wanted to do
more of her street style a lot of you
guys sent me some of her fancier looks
but this one's definitely perfect for
like a day to day thing whatever you
want to wear for so starting off with
the blue sneakers I found mine from Puma
um they look super good almost exact to
hers
I just wore some basic boyfriend jeans I
had already owned but you can get them
out like Urban Outfitters forever21 all
those sorts of places or my gray
t-shirts t-shirt that is from boohoo as
blah as well as my navy bomber jacket
super affordable on that site so awesome
oh and my glasses Urban Outfitters now
for this one I couldn't find it Sunday's
exact pieces but mine depending on what
you re own will cost you a little under
200
and last but not least outfit number six
is definitely inspired by this image you
see here but also a few other black
two-piece sets that she owns it's all
kind of looks very similar
zendaya always kind of rocks like a
separate or like a two-piece set so the
animal got for that if you want anything
I found some great ones on like River
Island um ASOS and boohoo which is where
this two-piece jumpsuit set is from I
think the top almost matches hers
perfectly in that image and I'm pretty
sure yeah I'll show you guys at the end
but it's like $35 for this complete set
which is amazing so you can totally add
accessories and earrings like she did it
just depends on what your style is but I
definitely wanted to include that since
two-piece sets are kind of like her
thing right now so if you wanted to rock
her look it would cost you almost $2,000
where mine is only 35 but that's my
video for today I really hope you guys
liked it be sure to give it a thumbs up
if you did and let me know in the
comments below who I should do it get
the look for next and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
