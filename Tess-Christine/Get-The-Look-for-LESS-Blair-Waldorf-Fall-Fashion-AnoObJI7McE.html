those last season's tour bus flies I her
face at the end of that makes me laugh
so hard
every time I just love that clip I had
to put it in here and it's perfect for
this type of video because if Flair was
a real person she would most definitely
not approve of me doing a get the look
for Less video on her she would actually
hate it but since she's just a character
and her style is amazing I'm gonna do it
anyways because who wants to spend two
grand on an outfit not me no thanks
so as you guys can tell this is I get
the look for Less video for the amazing
and sassy Blair Waldorf and I've been
getting so many requests for her for so
long now and since it's almost fall time
or just kind of getting into fall time I
thought I would do fall outfits just cuz
it would make more sense to go with the
seasons so I asked you guys on Twitter
like I always do to send me some of your
favorite Blair Waldorf fall looks and
you guys did exactly that and I did
about seven outfits and it took me so
long to find these outfits for much
cheaper but it was so worth it I was so
happy with how it came out and all the
outfits are amazing I love them so I
really hope you guys do too
and yeah let's just go ahead and get
right into the video I'm just going to
begin with my everyday makeup and I'm
going to start with my cheeks and a
Blair always has these super rosy pink
cheeks so I'm using a cream blush and
placing that on the apples of my cheeks
just to give me a very dewy look moving
on to the eyes I'm going to be taking a
shadow stick and kind of a pink shimmery
color and placing that on my lids and
blending it with my finger and then over
it I'm going over with a similar color
shadow just to set everything and
brighten it up a bit for the crease I'm
just taking my bronzer I'm using the
benefit hoola bronzer and I'm using a
fluffy brush to place that into my
crease for some natural dimension then
I'm going to be taking a black shadow
and I'm going to be smudging that along
my lash line for a net very natural look
but it still defines your eyes which is
perfect for
Blair because she always has that kind
of smudged look towards her lashline and
then for the bottom lashline I'm just
taking a brown eyeliner and placing it
like so then I'm curling my eyelashes
and applying mascara as you normally
would her eye makeup is always very
natural nothing too over-the-top so I
love this look perfect for every day and
then for her lips she always has a very
mob in color and I'm placing that on my
lips using a matte lipstick and then I'm
going over it with a gloss for a nice
shine the classic Blair Waldorf
hairstyle is so easy to achieve all
you're going to need is a one-inch
curling iron like I have here and you're
basically just gonna take your hair and
curl it upwards keeping the ends wrapped
inside because you want the bounciness
to be on the ends of the curls then I'm
going to be taking a teasing brush and
I'm just going to be teasing at the top
of my head just for a little bit of
volume since my hair it seemed to be a
little bit flat that day but nothing too
over the top because Blair just has
these really bouncy loose curls which is
so awesome and so girly and then you
cannot forget her classic headband so
I'm adding one that I got at Target
placing it in my hair fluffing it up and
it's good to go this makeup and hair is
so easy this combo is perfect for school
seriously it takes hardly any time
moving on to the best part which is the
outfits this first one was sent me a ton
and I love it it's a very classic fall
look that can be worn a ton of different
ways and it can still be Blair inspired
if that's what you like so first I'm
going to start off with the tights the
tights I purchased at ModCloth are just
basic fishnet tights for her shoes she
was wearing nude and black cap toe heels
but I decided to opt for flats from
Kohl's just because it was a little bit
more wearable for my coat that is from
Miss Selfridge it has the same kind of
style of her as hers mine's a little bit
more white but it definitely gives off a
similar feel my black leather gloves are
from River Island my blouse is from
forever 21 it has a similar houndstooth
design not exact but definitely gives
off a similar look and then my hat is
from Target and this is the best hat I
could find for a cheap price with this
kind of style because they're really
hard to find but yeah that's it like I
did with the Blake Lively get the look
for Less I'm going to do a price
comparison so hers would set you back
8130 where mine would only set you back
179 dollars
this next one was another super popular
one and I understand why because it's
seriously so cute
however the hardest thing for me to find
was a similar brown caplet coat that she
was wearing I found this one off of ebay
I think it would also look really good
with like a brown pea coat or a brown
cropped jacket so it's up to you what
you want to style it with I was really
excited that I was able to find a
similar dress this one is from ModCloth
it has the similar gold designs with the
similar ruffles at the bottom I just
love it and then for my shoes she was
just wearing a basic black shoes so mine
are from Kohl's and then my pattern
tights are from ModCloth also the
headband and the necklace that I'm
wearing are both from Target as well for
the price comparison I only did the coat
and the dress since that is all I could
find of hers so hers would set you back
600 and mine would only set you back $98
colored tights and a bow tie could not
scream more Blair Waldorf in this outfit
so it's pretty crazy but the maroon coat
I'm wearing I had already so I'm wearing
that but I'll link a similar one below
the blouse that I'm wearing is from
JCPenney my bow tie is from American
Apparel my headband that is from
JCPenney my bag is from forever 21 my
tights are from ModCloth as well as my
socks and my flats are from t.j.maxx her
exact outfit would cost you two thousand
one hundred and forty nine dollars where
is my outfit depending on the coat you'd
get would cost you two hundred and
twenty one dollars this nice outfit is
definitely one of my favorites I think
it is so cute it reminds me of Paris for
some reason I don't know I just really
love it so for my Cape coat that is from
H&amp;amp;M I was so pumped I found this because
Cape coats are so hard to find for cheap
the leggings wear pant trousers are from
ASOS as well as the neck bow tie that
I'm wearing my hat and my maroon shoes
are both from ModCloth now for the price
comparison hers cost one thousand four
hundred and seventy dollars where mine
was only one hundred and fifty one
dollars
now when I think of Blair Waldorf this
is one of the outfits that immediately
pops into my head so I knew I just had
to recreate it so starting with the
bright yellow jacket I found mine at a
so-so it's more of a lemony color so
it's not as intense but it definitely
gives off a similar style so for my
shoes those are just black flats from TJ
Maxx my tights are from Target as well
as my brown bag my dress that I'm
wearing is from JC Penney's she was
wearing a sweater skirt type of combo
but I decided to just go for all-in-one
and do a dress my blouse is also from
JCPenney and my bow tie is from ASOS
this is another huge style steal as in
hers would cost you two thousand two
hundred and eighty six dollars where
mine would only cost you one hundred and
fifty three this one is more of a
reserved look for Blair because the
color scheme is pretty bland for her so
I love it I think it's great I think
it's a very classic look so starting off
with my skirt I purchased that one at
forever 21 it's very similar to hers
although it doesn't have the knot on the
side of it or whatever but I still think
the colors are similar my shoes are from
Kohl's my tights are from at Target my
different color black and white colored
blouse is from ASOS and then my checked
blazer or jacket type of DL is from H&amp;amp;M
okay if you want to wear her exact
outfit it would cost you one thousand
nine hundred and thirty-four dollars
where mine would only cost you one
hundred and forty-seven dollars all
right guys it's now time for the last
outfit this was my reference photo that
you guys sent to me the blouse was by
far the hardest for me to find but I was
able to find a similar one on Miss
Selfridge but any type of beaded blouse
will give you the same look this one
just has a similar lace and beaded
design to it my pearl and gold bracelet
is from Target my tights are from
ModCloth my midi skirt is just a basic
black midi skirt from ASOS it doesn't
have like a jacquard print on it but it
definitely looks similar and then my
shoes are from 6:00 p.m. Calm I opted
for flats with a similar buckle versus
her heels as you can see her total was
two thousand three hundred and nineteen
dollars for mine was only a hundred and
seventy dollars but that's the video for
today thank you guys so much for
watching be sure to give me a huge
thumbs up if you enjoy my look for less
videos and don't forget to let me know
