I'll never tell
gossiper
hey guys today's video is going to be
Agatha look video and this time is for
Blake Lively and I'm super excited about
this because I have been meaning to do a
Blake Lively slash Serina
from grass of girl get the look video
for so long now I attempted like a year
ago maybe more than that and that show
and those girls personal style is just
out of this world like the stuff that
they wear is so hard to find for cheaper
so I would just get so frustrated with
it and just like move on to a different
celebrity and be like I'll come back to
it so now I finally got around to doing
it all so I did of course the hair and
the makeup which i think is so beautiful
I posted an Instagram like selfie I
guess and a lot of you guys were like do
a makeup tutorial and I was like it's
secretly from this video so anyways I'm
excited to show you guys so I really
hope you guys enjoy it and yeah let's
get started starting out with the makeup
I'm going to begin by priming my eyes
using the NARS eyeshadow primer I love
this it does not budge it makes your
eyeshadow stay on 10 times longer in my
opinion next from the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette I'm going to
picking up this pink shimmery color and
placing that all over my lid as the base
I always see Blake Lively and especially
Serena on Gossip Girl having this
shimmery smoky look to her eye makeup so
that's exactly what I'm going to do next
I'm taking this shimmery brown color and
focusing that on the outer half of my
eyelid extending it a little bit up
towards my brow bone only on the outer
corner though then I'm going to be
taking this even darker brown shade and
placing that on the outer corner for our
deeper more sultry look to give it kind
of that smoky effect and then with this
beige color and placing that on my brow
bone and a little into my inner corner
for a highlight and then taking that
first brown shade I'm going to place
that on my lower lash line to balance
out the look next with the lightest
shimmery color that I have in the
palette I'm going to place that onto my
inner corner because Blake Lively this
is like her signature look when I looked
up her makeup she always has a super
shimmery inner corner tear duct so
that's exactly what I did
next I'm taking an eyeliner and I'm
smudging that into my lash line to give
a very smoky effect and nothing to kind
of precise or uniform she always has a
smoky eyelid in my opinion but it's done
in a very natural way so as you saw
before I lined both my waterlines and
now I'm curling my lashes and applying a
bunch of coats of mascara because her
lashes always look super good but not
overdramatic which is why I'm not going
to add false lashes because I think you
can achieve her look just by applying
mascara for the blush I'm just using a
subtle pink color and placing that onto
the apples of my cheeks just for a flush
of color nothing too overpowering
now her lips I always see her with pink
lips so I'm using this one by Rimmel
London and it's the color airy-fairy
placing that all over my lips and I'm
just taking this light pink gloss and
placing it on the center of my lips to
make them appear fuller and more pouty
which is perfect for Blake Lively and
that's it for the makeup it's super easy
it's fresh and definitely makes your
eyes stand out in my opinion but now
let's move on to the hair so Blake
Lively of course always has these kind
of loose beachy full waves so how I'm
going to achieve this you guys have seen
this plenty of times before but I'm just
taking a one-inch curling iron and I'm
going to interchange curling some
wrapping around the barrel and then some
with the clamp leaving the end piece out
so you get that wavy texture and your
hair doesn't curl under so you can do it
either way if depending on your hair
type and how your hair takes curls mine
can be curled either way but if you need
more of a tight curl to get it to last
all day definitely use the clamp because
I do think it lasts longer but otherwise
you can go ahead and just wrap it around
the barrel and get that very loose
textured soft wave look that Blake
always has now I'm just taking some hair
oil and I'm placing that throughout my
hair to give it kind of that shine and
match the curls together and make them
look really messy and then I'm going to
take a dry texturising spray like this
one and it's just going to give the
curls volume it's gonna make your hair
even Messier and it's just gonna give a
soft texture to the waves so you can
kind of fluff it up and make it a little
bit more of the lump schewe switch her
hair is so thick and long I'm so jealous
of it but this is a way you can kind of
achieve it
now moving on to the outfits I picked
the most commonly sent to me on Twitter
like always so for this first outfit
this one is super flowy and fun and very
different for me this is the photo that
you guys sent to me it's obviously from
Gossip Girl but how I recreated this
look was I found these pink pants from
Nasty Gal and then I paired it with a
brown belt from Target and then a top
from Windsor my necklaces are from
JCPenney she had turquoise and gold
necklaces so I just recreated by giving
all in one and then for my shoes I wore
these Oxford's from Lulu's she was
wearing high-heeled Oxford's but I
thought these were a little bit more
wearable for everyday and of course more
affordable so at the end of each outfit
I'm going to do a price comparison so as
you can see I spent one hundred and
thirteen dollars on mine and hers was
seven hundred and ninety two this next
outfit was definitely more challenging
than the rest for the skirt that was by
far the hardest I decided to go with the
pleated skirt look instead of the floral
because I thought it matched hers a
little bit more the one that I'm wearing
is from Wet Seal as far as the tank chap
goes I found a similar striped tank top
from Kohl's with similar colors I opted
for a sweater instead of a blazer and
mine's from JCPenney and then lastly my
shoes I found wedges that were similar
color to hers and those are from Target
now for the price comparison hers would
set you back 1535 where mine would only
set you back 67 okay so this outfit I'm
in love with especially this umbrella
even though it's not even raining when
I'm filming this so I just look like a
dork but that's from Target and I think
it is so cute
but this is the photo that I was
referring to I love this one it's
definitely one of my favorites let's
start with the skirt because that one
was definitely the hardest to find hers
is definitely sold out so I found one at
JCPenney for super inexpensive that had
kind of a similar color design to it and
then the blue top that I'm wearing
that's from Windsor my cardigan is from
JCPenney and I just chopped the sleeves
off of it to make it a vest
and then my bag that is from Windsor as
well and then for my shoes those are
from Lulu's that they have a similar
cage designed to them but overall I
think this outfit is just super cute for
the price comparison hers would set you
back three thousand nine hundred
thirty-four dollars where mine would
only set you back one hundred and eighty
dollars this next outfit is a little bit
more dressed up compared to the previous
ones but I got last minute got a ton of
tweets requesting this this is my
reference photo that you guys sent to me
it's so cute I found a dress at
Bloomingdale's that had a similar color
and a little bit of a similar style and
then my shoes are from Charlotte Russe
and my statement earrings are from
forever 21 now this was a huge style
steal because I loved her dress and I
found the exact one that she was wearing
of course it was sold out but her total
was 1198 whereas mine was only $99.50
this outfit that you guys sent to me is
super cute and super summery so I
understand why I thought this would be a
lot easier to find but it actually was a
little challenging mostly because of the
best the red skirt I got is from
Charlotte Russe my top is from Windsor
and then the vest I found at Nordstrom
is the most expensive thing in this
outfit but finding beaded bests are very
hard the price comparison on this was
hers was 1215 and mine was 96 dollars
and 30 cents this outfit is one of my
favorites because it has a floral in it
which is one of my favorite prints that
you guys sent me this photo and I loved
it I wanted to find her actual skirt but
of course it was sold out so I found
this one at PAX on with a similar floral
print and similar colors my top is from
Express and then the shoes she was
wearing were Christian Louboutins but I
found mine for much cheaper at Charlotte
Russe
this outfit was probably the biggest
style steal and not her outfit cost 1993
dollars where's mine only cost fifty
five dollars and 47 cents now this
outfit I feel like I should be on a red
carpet or in some photo shoot or
something because it is intense but I
absolutely love it I'm so glad you guys
sent me it the jacket that I'm wearing
is from Express the skirt is from ASOS
my black t-shirt is from Target my shoes
which I'm super excited I found are from
Amazon I click find ones with zips on
them but I found these for a super great
price but definitely have a similar
style to the one she was wearing and
then lastly my mirrored aviator
sunglasses are from Target super
inexpensive now are you guys ready for
this if you want her exact outfit it'll
set you back a whopping four thousand
four hundred eighteen dollars where mine
will only set you back three hundred and
four this last outfit is another one of
my favorites this is the photo that I
was referring to I absolutely love this
I remember watching this episode and
loving her skirt unfortunately it is
sold out but starting with the top I
found a similar beaded top with kind of
a similar design to it at Express and
then for the skirt I found one with
similar colors a little bit of a similar
design to it with the kind of like the
falling print and that is from Kohl's
for the purse I decided to do this one
from Nasty Gal
it's just a lime-green color similar
color just not a similar style bag and
then for my shoes I opted for the flats
that she was seen in and minor from
Windsor now for the actual outfit she
was seen in very high heels they were
like snake print so her total would have
been 2165 her mine was only 137 but
that's the video for today I really hope

thumbs up because I worked extra hard on
it to try to find these outfits as close
