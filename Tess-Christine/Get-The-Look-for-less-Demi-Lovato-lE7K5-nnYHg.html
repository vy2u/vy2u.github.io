another get to look video and I've been
meaning to do
Demi Lovato for so long she's just
awesome I love her and I've been getting
requests for her for so long so I'm
super excited that I finally got around
to doing it I asked you guys on Twitter
to send me some of your favorite Demi
Lovato outfits and you guys did exactly
that and I picked the most common sent
to me and the ones that I think are the
most wearable and I feel like you guys
would like them they're super easy to
recreate so if you are at all interested
in this get the look video then of
course just keep on watching like always
I'm going to begin by priming my eyes
with an eyeshadow primer and then I'm
going to be picking up a matte beige
color placing that all over my lids
along with a shimmery pink color into my
inner corners next I may be taking this
taupe gray color and placing that on the
outer half of my lid and then I'm going
to be covering that with a matte gray
shoutout to deepen the look and then
lastly to top it all off I'm going to be
doing a matte black shadow placing that
on to the outer corner focusing on the
lid swinging it out slightly this is
really going to give you that smoky
effect that demi lovato always has then
I'm going to be taking a fluffy brush
and blending out any harsh lines and
then with a white shimmery color I'm
going to be using that as a highlight on
my brow bone and inner corner again then
I'm gonna be taking that gray color and
placing that onto my lower lash line for
a smoky look and then now it's time to
do a winged eyeliner so I'm just taking
a gel eyeliner and doing precisely that
and then I'm going to align my eyes with
just an eye pencil lastly for the eyes I
bet you guys could guess I'm curling my
lashes and applying a couple coats of
mascara and then I am going to add some
false lashes since Demi always has a
super intense eye makeup look for the
cheeks I'm not doing anything intense
and I'm just adding a pinkish bronzer to
my cheekbones and then for the lips she
has been always seen in like a fuchsia
pink color so I'm just adding some
lipliner and lipstick and then blending
it in
with my finger to give it a very natural
look while also keeping it intense which
is kind of what she goes for moving on
to the hair I thought this photo was a
perfect for the hairstyle that I was
going to show you guys so all I did was
take a one-inch curling iron and wrap
sections of hair around the barrel and
then after I finished doing that I'm
just taking a teasing brush to the crown
and sides of my head and then spraying
with some texturizing spray
Demi has half of her head shaved so I'm
going to show you guys how to get that
look without actually shaving your head
so all you're going to do is it take one
section of your hair the one that has
the least amount of hair of how you
parted it and you're basically going to
just twist sections of your hair back
take a bobby pin and push the bobby pin
forward towards your face this is not
only going to conceal the bobby pin but
is also going to help the twist last
longer and give you that kind of side
shaved head look without actually making
the commitment now we all know Demi
loves her colored hair so I just dyed
some old blonde extensions and I put
them in my hair
like so to give that kind of appearance
without committing to the purple hair
okay so now it's time for the outfits
which is my favorite part afford this
first outfit this is the photo that you
guys sent me I was able to find the
exact kimono that she's wearing and
that's from Urban Outfitters it isn't
too pricy I will have it linked below it
kind of ranges in the same price most
moniz would cost my shoes are from
pepper mayo and they're just black
chunky heels my jewelry is from a
windsor and it's just kind of acrosses
coins just a bunch of chunky necklaces
and then my dress is from windsor as
well moving on to this next outfit you
guys send me I thought this was perfect
for summer or back-to-school I wasn't
able to find an a similar romper but I
was able to find a similar dress from
Urban Outfitters my jacket is from
PacSun and it's just a basic army jacket
and then my sunglasses are from forever
21
okay so this next outfit you guys sent
to me I love I feel like so badass in it
it just makes me feel like a rockstar I
love it
but for my outfit I'm just wearing this
white blazer from Windsor somewhat look
jeans from Topshop a bra from Nasty Gal
shoes from forever 21 and then the same
necklace from Windsor this next one is
another signature Demi look I just think
it's so comfy and cozy but edgy I just
love it so much so starting out with the
bag I found this one from forever 21
that's much cheaper than a saline bag I
found the exact dress from Urban
Outfitters and kimono from Windsor
moving on to this next one I was able to
find a similar cream dress at PacSun
with a corset style top and of course
the lace print my jacket is from Windsor
and you can totally add studs to the
shoulders to give a more exact look to
her Topshop one my round sunglasses are
from PacSun and my headband is from
forever 21 alright guys so it's now time
for this last one which i think is
definitely one of my favorites now
starting out with her studded tab I was
so pumped when I found this one from
forever 21 along with my skirt which is
also from their purse kind of had a
silver sheen to it but I thought this
matched it pretty well my belt is from
Target and my shoes are from Windsor but
that's the video for today I really hope

hard on these get Bullock videos for you
