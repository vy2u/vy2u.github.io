tripping me out hey guys that today's
video is going to be a get the look
video I'm super excited about this one
because I had asked you guys on my last
gift love video which was for Selena
Gomez who you wanted me to do next and a
lot of you voted for Kendall and Kylie
Jenner if you are familiar with my good
look videos you know that I really
really try to get the exact pieces that
they're wearing find out exactly where
they shop
however Kendall and Kylie shop at very
very expensive places designer brands
just out-of-this-world expensive so I
didn't want to come on here and try to
like do that for you guys I wanted to
make it very accessible and affordable
for everyone so I basically just um did
a look for last video it's very easy
it's very easy to recreate Kendall and
Kylie dress very chill they don't even
dress really crazy so they don't even
really need to be buying all the
designer stuff that they do because a
lot of it you can find at like forever
21 brandy melville nonetheless that's
exactly what I did for you guys today I
also decided to put Kendall and Kylie in
the same video just because their hair
and makeup is very similar
I know Kylie just kind of like chopped
your hair off but um the straight or
semi wavy hairstyle with the bronzy
smoky makeup just very natural and glowy
contour they both kind of do that so I
figured for the sake of a whole new
video with a similar hair and makeup I
thought I'd cram it into one and then do
three outfits for Kendall and three
outfits for Kylie at the end of this
video so I really hope you guys enjoy it
and I'm not going to say bye because I'm
not going anywhere yet so let's get into
the video
to begin I applied foundation and
concealer to give myself a very flawless
finish just like Kendall and Kylie seem
to always have next this is super
important and that's to contour all of
the Jenner sisters and Kardashian
I guess contour heavily so I'm using a
cream bronzer but you can go ahead and
use a bronzer for a softer look but the
cream bronzer really helps give you that
exact contoured look so all I'm doing is
I'm taking a small
and I'm just kind of doing the contours
of my face so underneath my cheekbones
on the sides of my nose on the top of my
forehead and on my jawline this is just
where the shadows are going to hit and
it's exactly where you want a contour to
get they're kind of similar structured
face now to blend everything out I'm
just taking an angled brush this one's
from Sephora and I'm just going in small
circular motions on the lines that I
placed on my face this is just going to
make sure everything is blended out and
it's just going to look very natural and
pretty um this does take some practice I
don't like to contour very heavily so I
just kind of did it lightly but you can
go ahead and do it to your face shape
and how you feel comfortable with it now
of course I'm going to highlight so I'm
using the other end of that which is
just a cream highlighter and
highlighting the top of my cheekbones
for that glowy look very very Kardashian
or Jenner sister I guess you'd like to
say now I'm going to add some pink blush
right on top of the bronzer a little bit
above and it's going to give you a very
structured look just like they have
moving on to eyebrows this is very
important Kendall and Kylie always have
very pretty structured eyebrows I'm not
blessed with great eyebrows like they
are so I'm filling them in to make sure
I can get them as structured as I like
obviously you're not trying to look like
anybody but yourself so fill them in to
where you feel comfortable
I don't like super heavy brows so I'm
just doing it like that um and I like it
now of course I'm priming my eyes and
applying eyeshadow I kept this look very
simple for you guys so all I did was
take a beige color and place that onto
my lids and then I just mixed two Brown
colors just very matte and placed that
into my crease Kendall and Kylie never
have super intense eye shadow looks on a
day to day basis they just kind of do
this very simple brown in the crease and
then just like a natural beige on the
lids but of course they always seem to
have a winged eyeliner nowadays so I'm
just taking this L'Oreal gel eyeliner
which is my absolute favorite and I'm
creating a winged eyeliner look now to
get that doe I look that they always
seem to have I'm putting a nude eyeliner
into my inner corner and on a little bit
of my waterline
next I'm curling my lashes and applying
mascara making sure to use the tip of
the mascara to really separate the
lashes and make them look big wide and
the eyelashes really fluttery for my
lips I'm using this pinky nude lip liner
to line my lips and make them look very
full and pouty which is something I
always notice with Kendall and Kylie and
that's it for the makeup I absolutely
love this look it's just so fresh pretty
and natural and really defines your
features moving on to hair when I think
of those two especially Kendall I think
of a middle part and very straight hair
so all I did was straighten my hair and
then added some hair oil for some shine
to me this look screams Kendall and
Kylie but of course if you want some of
their other looks which are the just
these loose waves especially Kylie with
her short hair all you have to do is
take a barrel like this and wrap the
ends of your hair around it for a couple
seconds and you'll get these loose waves
that Kylie seems to have nowadays but
yeah that's it for the hair and makeup I
just love this it takes hardly any time
and it's just so pretty
moving on to the outfits I'm going to
start with Kendall first and I picked
three outfits that were the most
commonly sent to me on Twitter this
first outfit is my absolute favorite I
love the color combo so much for the
skirt I found this one at Zara for only
about $30 the print is not exact but
it's definitely close so you're still
going to get a similar style for much
cheaper and then for my sweater I'm
wearing this yellow one from Topshop
it's not a turtleneck but hers was from
the row at Barneys for about $700 so
this outfit in general is just such a
steal plus it's perfect for spring this
next outfit is so relaxed and chill I
absolutely love it it's super easy to
recreate I just wore this jean jacket
from Urban Outfitters I'm not exactly
sure where hers is from but that's where
mine is from for the top I just picked
up this crop top from brandy melville
and for my jeans those are from American
Eagle and were only about fifty dollars
whereas hers were about two hundred
dollars because they were J Brand Jeans
she was also wearing Chanel black flats
but I picked up these ones from Target
this last outfit is actually really
affordable because it's from her line at
PacSun however when I went to go check
all of it was sold out so there wasn't
anything left so I know sward these
basic acid wash jeans from forever 21
and then this crop top from JA breaking
and then for shoes I wore these lace-up
wedges from PacSun because she was seen
wearing black sneakers
it's really easy to recreate on your own
moving on to Kiley I did the same thing
with Kendall and picked the most
commonly sent to me on Twitter this
first elephant for Kiley is so
incredibly cute but after finding the
exact pieces it's very expensive for a
pretty chill outfit so for her shoes she
wore black high-top converse but I had
white ones so I just wore those for her
boyfriend jeans those were from gold
sign and were upwards of $300 but I
found some for a very similar at
American Eagle for about 50 and then for
my top I bought that at forever 21 and
her real one is from Alexander Wang so
total price difference and then lastly I
found these really cool Kylie style
glasses from Urban Outfitters this next
outfit was sent to me quite a lot and
that's because I think it's a signature
Kylie look she's very relaxed and she'll
which is perfect for every day which is
perfect for a video like this so all I
really wore was just this white t-shirt
from brandy melville I did decide to tie
it at the side just to make myself you
know have more of a figure since the
outfit is a little bit more on the
frontier side for my jeans I wore the
same boyfriend jeans from before and
those are from American Eagle and then
my flannel is from Urban Outfitters but
any flannel will do to achieve this look
and then these black booties are from
Windsor both Kendall and Kylie are seen
wearing similar booties to this but
these are much more affordable this last
outfit is when Kylie was on hello Ross
recently I really like this outfit it's
very edgy which is perfect for Kylie
my biggest accomplishment for this
outfit was finding similar shoes because
she was wearing designer snakeskin
lace-up shoes but I found ones that
looked almost exact from Windsor so
total style steel on that and then for
the rest of the outfit I wore this gold
chain necklace from H&amp;amp;M and then for my
pants I wore these from Topshop very
similar to the one she was wearing and
then for her black top I just wore this
crop top from Windsor but you can go
ahead and wear whatever black top you
have she really wasn't showing any
midriff so keep that in mind if you're
recreating it but that's it for my
Kendall and Kylie Jenner and get the
look video I really hope you guys
enjoyed this give me a thumbs up if you
enjoy my get the look videos and let me
know in the comments below if you're
