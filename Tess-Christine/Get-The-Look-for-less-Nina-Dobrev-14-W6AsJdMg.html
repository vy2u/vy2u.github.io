another get the look video and as you
guys can tell by the title today's video
is for Nina Dobrev I did a ton of
outfits for her mostly because her
outfits are very chill they're very you
know relaxed they're easy to recreate at
home with just like basic stuff you have
but I did go ahead and buy some things
that are more current so if you guys
like any of the outfits you there they
all should still be available in stores
but like always I asked you guys on
Twitter to send me some of your favorite
Nina Dobrev looks and I was flooded with
a bunch of them and a lot of them were
super super common so it was super easy
for me to narrow down outfits I also did
something a little bit different for
this gift look video and I did a little
bit more research into the makeup so I
actually bought some exact products that
she uses and that she talks about in
different interviews and things like
that just so you guys have a better
understanding of the makeup besides just
the outfits and the hair and all that
stuff so if you are at all interested in
this video then of course just keep on
watching starting out with the makeup I
read in an interview recently that she's
loving the it cosmetics CC cream it's
basically just a CC cream and it has a
ton of sunscreen in it so she loves it
for the summer season so I decided to
buy that because I thought it would be
appropriate for a Nina Dobrev tutorial
so I applied that with a Beauty Blender
all over my face and then now I'm
applying a concealer now this stuff she
swears by again by in cosmetics by my
under-eye she says that when she's
filming Vampire Diaries she doesn't get
much sleep so this really really helps
and it completely eliminates the dark
circles for her so I've tried it out and
I absolutely love it I think it's great
it's a very thick consistency but I
think it does the job really really well
now moving on to the contour and
highlight part nina keeps her makeup
very natural on a day to day basis but I
was reading in an article with an
interview with her talking about her
favorite makeup product and she
mentioned this Tom Ford sculpt an
illuminating kit I love it basically all
it is is just a cream bronzer that you
use to do the contours of your face and
then of course the highlight so I have
this I've had it for a while I actually
bought it long time ago when I was doing
vampire dyers tutorials because I had
read the makeup artist use this on Nina
Dobrev for the show so that's why I
purchased in the first place I love it
think it's great it is on the pricier
side so I do think you can find dupes
for it but I wanted to put it in this
video in case any of you guys were
interested in the exact makeup that she
was using and loving so after I finished
applying that to the contours of my face
I'm going to do the highlight part now
so basically I'm gonna put that on the
top of my cheekbones my brow bone the
bridge of my nose and on my Cupid's bow
which she had said in that exact
interview that's one of her favorite
beauty tricks now I'm using a cream
blush and kind of a coral pinky tone to
keep it a very natural and subtle flush
to the cheeks I'm using a brush to apply
this to make sure it's very even and
very subtle and then lastly I'm going to
set everything with a translucent powder
another one of Nina's favorites is the
NARS eyeshadow primer she says she loves
it for red carpets because it does not
allow your eyeshadow to budge so I'm
using that to prime my eyelids now for
the eyeshadow you rarely see her without
a brown smokey eye so all I'm doing is
I'm just taking a beige color right now
and placing that onto my lids for a
flush of color and now I'm just taking
this matte brown color which is just a
light brown I'm placing that all over to
my lid as the main color of this look
now I'm taking them even deeper Brown
and I'm placing that into my crease
using a large fluffy brush now one thing
I've noticed about Nina is she has a
very depth defined crease so I'm taking
a small brush like this picking up a
slightly darker matte brown color and
placing that into my crease like so and
then of course blending it out with a
fluffy brush now to deepen the look even
more I'm taking almost a black color
with a smaller brush and really
detailing my crease to get that defined
crease line that she always has and this
also really helps smoke out your eyes in
a very natural way
lastly for the eyeshadow I'm just taking
that medium brown color and placing that
onto my lower lash line to balance out
the look now moving on to eyeliner I
just took a liquid eyeliner and I
basically drew a small line on my top
lashline and now I'm taking a flat top i
shadow brush and I'm just picked up a
matte black color and I'm placing that
over the eyeliner this is not only going
to mattify the liquid eyeliner but it's
going to help smoke it out in a very
natural and subtle way which Nina always
seems to have especially towards her
lashline
for mascara I had read that Nina's
favorite trick is to layer on brown and
black mascara so she starts with Brown
and then puts on black it's one of her
favorite beauty secrets and she never
leaves the house without mascara so she
says she loves it and her favorite
mascara is the lash blast now I did go
ahead and look up the false lashes that
the makeup artist use when she goes on
red carpets and one in specific was the
velour lashes in those real they just
add some extra volume to the lashes and
a little bit of length very
natural-looking and then for the lips
I'm just using this pink gloss nothing
special it just adds a little bit of
color and then of course some gloss to
the lips and that's it for the makeup I
think it's very natural and glowing and
super fresh perfect for a Nina Dobrev
look so now moving on to the hair and
now of course Nina always has her
straight hair but straight hair is
pretty easy to achieve yourself so I
wanted to show you guys how she curls
her hair ever since she kind of started
dyeing it lighter she has these kind of
bouncy curls at the end very loose and
wavy so all you're going to need is a
one-inch curling iron and that's my best
recommendation for you so I'm using this
one by Hot Tools and all I'm doing is
curling my hair every other direction so
some of the curls are going away from my
face and some of them are going towards
my face this is just going to prevent
the curls from sticking together it's
going to keep it very bouncy and fun and
very loose and messy which is kind of
what Nina's going for so it's very
simple I'm just completing this whole
process throughout my whole head until
all of my hair is curled
now after we finish curling my hair Nina
always has perfect smooth hair so I'm
using a hair oil to make it super shiny
at the ends very smooth and looks like I
have perfect healthy hair like she does
now of course I'm going to finish with
hairspray and that's it for the hair
it's super easy and is perfect for kind
of an everyday look because it's nothing
too done up or crazy I just love it okay
so for this first outfit this was when
she was at comic-con and her whole
outfit is designer so it's a little bit
hard finding similar patterns for a lot
cheaper but basically all I did was look
for a pair of shorts that had similar
colors with a course of floral pattern
so I found these from PacSun and then my
shoes those are from Nasty Gal and
they're just basic Brown booties so any
Brown booties will achieve the look and
then my striped top that's from PacSun
as well this next outfit is a little bit
more on the professional side but I
absolutely love it I think my biggest
accomplishment was finding similar shoes
because the one she's wearing are from
Sophia Webster and they're super
expensive and they're definitely the
highlight of her outfit so I found these
ones from Steve Madden that were way way
cheaper and they gift off a similar
style with a similar color and style of
shoe and then for my blazer that is a
cropped blazer from Topshop my blouse
that is from Target and then my skirt is
from brandy melville this next outfit is
perfect for summer because it's a maxi
dress so it's super comfy and cozy I
couldn't find the exact maxi dress that
she was wearing I'm assuming it's a
fairly old photo so I found this one at
swell that has similar colors and a
similar kind of design to it my belt is
from forever 21 and then my jacket or
sweater type thing is from express this
next outfit was sent to me a ton and I
think that's because it's a very classic
nina dobrev look the Hat and she's just
very casual with their outfits in
general basically this whole outfit is
from Target the shorts the sweater and
the tank top is from Victoria's Secret
and then my booties are from Target as
well she was wearing rag-and-bone
booties which are so expensive but these
were so inexpensive and they give off
style and then my hat is from Urban
Outfitters this next outfit was another
popular one and I see this photo all
over the place so I understand why it's
such a cute outfit and is perfect for
kind of spring and summer basically all
she's wearing is just a gray t-shirt
mine is from ASOS and then the chambray
shirt that I'm wearing is from Windsor
and then the colorful necklace that I'm
wearing is from forever 21
for my jeans those are from American
Eagle but of course any white jeans will
work and then I was able to find her
exact Sam Edelman booties and they are
the Louie boot so if you type that in
you'll find them all over the place
this next outfit was when Nina was at
Coachella this year and I kind of last
minute got all these bunch of photos of
this photo actually to recreate this
look so I was able to find her exact
overalls that she was wearing at
Coachella and those I purchased at
revolve clothing I'll have the brand of
the overalls below the basic black shirt
that I'm wearing is just from Target and
then my shoes that I'm wearing are from
Windsor she's wearing some sort of black
shoe so those are the boots that I chose
this next look is a very classic put
together Nina look and a ton of you guys
sent it to me so I was super excited to
recreate it although it was kind of
challenging the best I could do was find
this similar lace printed skirt from
PacSun that was much more affordable
than hers and then of course this
black-and-white printed blouse from
JCPenney overall it's a similar style to
hers is not exact obviously but it's as
close as I could get this next outfit is
honestly my favorite she posted this
photo of her in New York on Instagram
recently and the exact dress that she's
wearing is by a designer that I will
have blogs I cannot pronounce it super
expensive so I phone this one from H&amp;amp;M
that was much more affordable with kind
of a similar watercolor design to it not
very similar colors but similar style I
would say for my hat I wore this hat by
Bailey and it is just a basic Fedora so
any black fedora will work and then my
black and tan sandals are from Kohl's
now for this last outfit this one is
definitely more of her dressed up event
night thing I thought it was very kind
of different from the rest of her looks
she was wearing all rock and Republic
but of course it was an older photo so
everything was kind of sold out so I
wore this dress from Nasty Gal
she was wearing a clutch but she loves
Rebecca Minkoff is one of her favorites
so I just have this mini Mac purse by
Rebecca Minkoff that I paired with it
and then my sandals those are from
Kohl's
