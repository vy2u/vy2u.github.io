get the look video I asked you guys on
my last get the look video which was
Kendall and Kylie Jenner who you guys
wanted me to recreate next and a ton of
you guys said Vanessa Hudgens so as you
can tell that's exactly what I'm gonna
do for you guys today
I'm super super excited about this video
because Nessa Hudgens style is amazing
it's a little bit outrageous and a
little bit crazier than I'm used to
dressing so this was totally fun to like
go out and find looks um to recreate the
photos that you guys sent me because I
asked you guys on Twitter to send me
some of your favorite Vanessa Hudgens
looks and you guys did exactly that and
I picked the most common sent to me I
did go ahead and choose to do another
get the look for Less video because a
lot of the stuff that she's wearing is
crazy expensive and who wants to buy
that stuff anyways so I figure let's
just go get stuff for Less that still
gives you kind of the same style and fun
bohemian vibe that she gives off but you
can get it for a lot cheaper
before I blabber anymore let's go ahead
and get into the video okay so for the
makeup I didn't really know where to go
with this because there's never really a
clear picture of how she wears her
makeup so I kind of just guessed by the
photos you sent me and I just kept it
very simple by adding a white gold color
to my lids as a base and then with a
darker Brown gold color I placed that
into my crease focusing on the outer
corner then with a matte black shade I
placed that on the outer corner to smoke
it out a little bit because she always
seemed to have a very smoky sultry look
and then with a base shadow and a fluffy
brush and placing that on my brow bone
to blend out any harsh lines and then
with that same dark brown gold color and
placing that onto my lower lash line
and then of course lining my eyes with a
black eye pencil
every time I see Vanessa and photos it
always seems like she has a very smoked
out look so I'm just taking a flat tab
eyes shadow brush and blending out that
top eyeliner and then one of the
coachella pictures I noticed she had a
very strong inner tear-duct white base
so I'm just taking a white eyeliner and
placing that into my inner corner and
with the back of it with this which is
just like a sponge I'm blending out any
harsh lines and then with a light silver
shadow I'm placing that over the white
just to make sure it's very light and
pigmented and then of course I'm curling
my lashes and applying a couple coats of
my favorite mascara so that's what I
decided to do with the makeup I think
it's very Vanessa Hudgens it's smoky and
sultry has the black and the golds in it
which I think just scream her style and
then for the lips I did notice in a few
Coachella pictures she had a pink color
on so I just used a lip liner and filled
in my lips very lightly blending it out
with my finger to give a matte very
natural effect moving on to the hair
Vanessa always has these kind of loose
wavy curls which I think are so pretty
she also has very long hair at Coachella
so I added some blonde extensions that
look a little pink because I dyed them
the day before for the outfits because I
filmed earlier regardless so you're
going to need is a curling iron like
this one that I have from nume but you
can also use the Conner infinity wand
it's just a curling one that gets
skinnier towards the end because you
want the curls to be focused on the
bottom parts of your hair and the top
parts straight so all I'm doing is just
holding my hair on there for a few
seconds and then I'm going to release
you don't want them to be too tight
because what you're going to do is while
the curls are still hot you're going to
take your fingers and you're going to
comb through them because you want them
to kind of fall out almost not your hair
but the curls fall out because you want
them to be kind of straight and wavy
very messy not uniform at all so it's
going to look like this and it'll fall
out over time however if your hair
doesn't do that and you want it to look
even more straight right away
this is a technique that I used in my
get the look Selena Gomez video but it
works for this one as well all you're
going to do is take a clamp curling iron
and just straighten the end parts to get
that kind of straight loose messy wavy
hair that she has I think this look
overall is definitely Vanessa Hudgens
but for the Coachella pictures that you
guys sent me she had it tucked behind
her ears and parted down the middle so
that's exactly what I did
and then for the sake of this video I
decided to add some little silver
sequins with some eyelash glue to the
top of my eyebrows to match the look
even more moving on to the outfits which
is my favorite part this first outfit
was sent to me quite a lot and I
understand why because it is beautiful
however it was the most challenging for
me to recreate because what she's
wearing is a caftan and it was over 600
dollars to buy the exact one that she's
wearing which is just crazy so I went
out and I found a dress with similar
print similar style but it was only $30
and it's a little bit more wearable for
everyday however I did buy it at a local
boutique where I'm from the brand is ex
Turin which is a brand that sells to
wholesalers so I would check local
boutiques in your area like Francesca's
to see if they have a print similar to
this which I predict will be all over
the summer for earrings I wore these
from Urban Outfitters and then I wore
some bangles and rings from forever 21
moving on to this next look which I'm
super excited about because I love it so
much and I recreated it for so much
cheaper you guys are going to be so
shocked her actual romper dress type
things that she's wearing was almost
$200 but I got this one for $22 at
forever 21 it's a similar style similar
color and it even has the tassels on it
so I thought it matched perfectly for
her sunglasses those were from wild fox
but I found these ones for like 10 bucks
at forever 21 and they even have like a
similar mirrored reflection so awesome
and then for her bracelet she was
wearing a turquoise silver bangle thing
so I found these at forever 21 as well
as the ring and the bangle and the beads
on the other side my collar necklace
that's from Urban Outfitters and then my
layered necklaces those are from Free
People my hat I purchased at swell and
the brand is Brixton and then for my
shoes she was wearing just basic black
booties and I bought these at Windsor
and I thought they were so cute and they
even had the straps on the side that
kind of matched hers and then underneath
I'm just wearing a basic black bikini
top from Victoria's Secret but you can
also just wear a black bra to get the
same look moving on this next look is
definitely my favorite I love it so much
as you can see she is wearing a swimsuit
top her exact swimsuit top is by Mara
Hoffman but I figure you wouldn't be
wearing a swimsuit top every day so I
found this one from Topshop that
similar print a similar style to it and
it was even cheaper than her swimsuit
top so bonus on that for her skirt I as
you can see I bought the exact one that
she was wearing it's by for love and
lemons it was really hard to find a
skirt with similar detailing at the
bottom but if you just wore a basic
black maxi skirt you would still get a
similar look for the jewelry I wore this
hand chain from Nasty Gal and then for
the necklace I wore this really cool
necklace from Windsor love it with all
the coins on it so fun for my ring
that's from forever 21 and my cool pink
hair that's temporary pink hair dye from
Ulta this next look is super simple and
easy she was wearing another Mara
Hoffman swimsuit top so I decided to
incorporate one as well for those that
were interested so the one that I'm
wearing is from Target it was so much
cheaper and it has similar colors in a
similar style my high-waisted shorts
those are from Urban Outfitters as well
as my shoes and those are the exact ones
she was wearing she was also seen
wearing heart-shaped wild fox sunglasses
but I found these ones for like 10 bucks
at a local store but this kind of style
is everywhere this time of year and then
my head chain I made that myself because
hers was like $200 so I decided to make
one and it only cost me about 20 this
next look is from her last year at
Coachella I think this one is so cute I
found a similar white top for super
cheap at PacSun my round sunglasses
those are from Urban Outfitters and then
my bottoms are just basic white jean
shorts from Target which were super
super inexpensive for my flower crown I
couldn't find one that looked like her
so I made my own so let me know if you
want a DIY on the flower crown and the
head chain from the previous outfit for
the jewelry I found a turquoise necklace
from JCPenney and then the long chains
are from forever 21 this next outfit is
one of her everyday or kind of normal
outfit looks that you guys sent to me a
ton so I decided to recreate it starting
out with the shoes I found these similar
wedges from forever 21 and then for the
top I found this lace or crocheted type
top from PacSun that was very similar to
hers and then for the sweater I'm just
wearing this cream sweater from brandy
melville but any kind of cream sweater
will work and help you achieve the same
look and then for my pants those are
from forever 21 they're just floral
trousers that I thought gives off a same
look with a similar style pant and then
for my necklace she was just seen
wearing
Gold Necklace so I found this chain gold
one from forever21 now for this last
look I thought this was just very simple
and easy and just perfect for every day
so I wanted to make it the last look for
the white dress that she's wearing it's
just a basic white dress with some lace
trim at the bottom this one is from
Windsor super inexpensive and it's so
comfy for her headband I found this one
from Nasty Elle it's not leather but it
definitely gives off a similar look
