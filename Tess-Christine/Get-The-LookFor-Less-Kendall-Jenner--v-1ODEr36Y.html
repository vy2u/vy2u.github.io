going to be a get the look for Kendall
Jenner and if you guys have been
watching my videos for a while now you
know that about a year ago I already did
a look for last for Kendall and Kylie
and like a combined video but by popular
request and I mean popular requests
Kendall everybody wants to see another
look for less for her totally get it I
love her style and in the past year it's
definitely evolved and changed plus I
really like doing look for less for
these girls because they always wear
head-to-toe designers and super
expensive outfits so it's a huge
challenge for me to do a look for less
video and I just love how it turns out
so I'm nearly stoked on that also the
hair is straight like she always has it
so there's not much new there but the
makeup I show you guys some winged liner
tips and also some lip color dupes for
cheaper versions in outfits the outfits
are awesome I'm super excited for you
guys to see those as well I'm just gonna
keep blabbering so let's just go ahead
and get into the video okay so starting
out I have my foundation concealer
contour blush highlight and eyebrows
filled in so if you want to know how I
do that I will have a video linked below
on a day to day basis Kendall usually
keeps your eyeshadow a pretty neutral
and really focuses on the lashes and the
eyeliner so for the shadow I'm just
going to go ahead and put a matte brown
color into my crease using a large
fluffy brush and then I'm also going to
take a beige and pink shimmery color
place that on my brow bone and a little
bit on my lids and inner corner I'm also
going to place a little bit of that
matte brown under my lower lash line
moving on to liner I'm going to be using
the Smashbox photo angle pure pigment
gel liner in the color jet black and
what I love about this is it's a gel
liner consistency but it feels more like
a marker which gives me a lot of control
plus it's 36 hour non-stop wear which is
perfect for winged liner so how I found
that the easiest way for me to make a
winged liner is I basically just draw a
line extending from the out corner of my
eye extending it up towards the end of
my eyebrow depending on how long I want
the wing then I basically just drag the
product inwards and as you can see it's
my lines are very faint
I only push a little product up through
that tip because I like to work with
little and then add more as I go because
it's easier to add more product it's not
is easy to take it away that's another
great thing about this eyeliner is
because of the way that tip is angled it
really gives you a lot of control and
you can make a super-intense thick wing
or you can make it very thin like we're
doing here for this candle look so I'm
going to repeat the exact same thing on
the other eye and then what I'm going to
do that's a bit different is I'm going
to be taking another one of the Smashbox
gel liner this time in the color plum
and I'm basically going to go over that
wing slightly above that black part so
you can see some of the purple it just
gives it kind of a purpley pigment to it
I like doing this because when I add
purple to my eyes my brown eyes really
stand out and to me Kendall's makeup
always really makes your eyes pop
another great thing about these liners
is that they are high-impact
supersaturated colors so they're really
going to stand out plus they're
waterproof which is awesome lastly for
the eyes I'm just going to be curling my
lashes and applying a couple coats of
mascara to my top and bottom lashes and
then I'm also going to be adding a few
individual lashes to match Kendall's a
little bit more because she always has
very bold lashes for the lips of course
I'm going to define them using a lip
liner because it wouldn't be a Jenner
tutorial without it I found a drugstore
dupe to one of my favorite lip liners
and this is just a Sonia Kashuk in the
color nude love this lip liner so I'm
just lining my lips and then with some
beige shimmery shadow I'm just going to
place that on the bottom the center of
my lip and on my Cupid's bow to give it
a fuller appearance this has definitely
become one of my go-to looks recently I
just absolutely love it
now for the hair all you have to do is
part your hair down the center and of
course straighten it and you have
yourself a kendall Jenner inspired look
that I think is a very natural looking
and perfect for everyday now I'm going
to show you guys how I recreated some of
Kendall's outfits that you guys sent me
on Twitter all of the links to the
outfit pieces and more of the outfit
details will be on my new look for less
website celeb spiration comm so i'll
have that link in the description box
below starting off with outfit number
one I absolutely love this all-black
look especially because of the black
fringe skirt but as you can see the
skirt itself is just way too expensive
so I'm going to show you guys how I got
the entire outfit look or even cheaper
than just one clothing piece of hers now
I couldn't find a leather fringe skirt
but I could find a black suede one from
ASOS for a little bit over $100 so I
thought it was a steal
it looks really really similar to hers
in comparison to her saline bag I found
a similar style bag at forever 21 for
only 12 2790 I found a black crop top
sweater at forever 21 for only $15 and
lastly some over-the-knee boots for a
little under 100 blowing onto outfit
number two unfortunately I couldn't find
the exact top and short she was wearing
but I did find her shoes which were
Saint Laurent rock python booties and of
course her saline bag so overall it's
just going to be crazy expensive
so this look was actually probably the
easiest for me to recreate for less it's
actually perfect spring look so I'm
super excited that you guys sent me this
photo I couldn't find affordable snake
print booties but I did have these in my
closet and they are from Windsor and
they're just taupe French booties and I
thought they matched the color of hers
pretty well and they are only $30 for my
shorts those are from PacSun and those
were $40 my top which looks very similar
to hers is from forever 21 and that was
only $22 and then I wore the same black
bag from forever 21
moving on to outfit number three I
really like this look a lot it's
actually super-unique to which I was
super excited to recreate I really liked
her top it was a crazy expensive and
that was also the hardest for me to find
and duplicate I was able to find a mesh
striped top from forever 21 for only
about $22 it does have sleeves but I
think it gives off a similar look for
the joggers I found some green joggers
from ASOS for about $32 mine are a
little bit more of a cargo style and
hers are marva sweatpants style for
those who are curious and then the same
black bag and then black pumps from
Kohl's
now on to outfit number four absolutely
love this look it's perfect for spring
and it's awesome that she's wearing a
denim top because I think that's going
to be a huge trend although right now
it's pretty much next to impossible to
find affordable version of what she's
wearing so the best I could do is I
found one at Nordstrom on sale for $100
I really like it super cute so let's
hope they come out with more in the
future for my white pants those are from
forever 21 there were only $22 but I
also think this would look really good
with some white skinny jeans for my
sunglasses those are from forever 21 and
my shoes are from DSW
now on to the last outfit I definitely
love this one I think this is probably
one of my favorites and as you can see
it's also the most expensive one pretty
much I think but this one is perfect for
like an everyday casual look I think
it's super cute instead of going for tan
heels like Kendall did I decided to wear
some fringe booties because they are
just way more comfortable and I don't
have fringe on my jacket like she does
so I think this ties it in pretty well
for my boyfriend jeans I have some
distressed ones that I already owned
from guess and then moving on to the
brown jacket that is from forever 21 it
was only 37 dollars and it matches the
colors of hers pretty perfectly my white
top that is from brandy melville and my
gray beanie that was only three dollars
from forever 21 but that's my video for
today I really hope you guys enjoyed it
