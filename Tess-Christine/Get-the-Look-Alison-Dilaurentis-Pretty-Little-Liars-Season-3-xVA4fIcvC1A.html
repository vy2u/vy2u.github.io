this one you'll save better lock it and
you pocket taking this one to the grave
guys today's video is the last of my
Pretty Little Liars series and today's
video is Alison DiLaurentis now I was
kind of skeptical to do her at first
just because she's not in series that
much so as for like makeup wise
especially I kind of had to wing it and
just kind of go off of what I think she
would wear just because you can't really
get a good look at her um when she's in
the show she kind of just makes like
flash appearances so I kind of just did
the makeup kind of my own way and how I
thought that maybe she would wear it and
then the hair obviously I did it very
curly and then I did choose one outfit I
could find one outfit a lot of you guys
are asking me how I'm finding their
exact pieces and it's all online um when
I first started I use SHOP style it's
shot I'll have it output shaft style
down below and you kind of just search
in the search bar what you're looking
for and then I also used cool spotters
but I got sent a bunch of tumblers by
you guys
so those work really well too so just
kind of search online for yourself but
cool cool spotters is a really good site
to use so if you want to kind of do this
yourself definitely check out that site
so yes I really hope you guys enjoyed
this series it was a lot of fun for me
to do and kind of recreate the looks and
kind of search online and I know you
guys really enjoyed I'm judging by the
comments that I've been getting on all
the videos I was very pleasantly
pleasantly surprised that a lot of you
guys really liked them as much as you
did so I'm super happy about that I'll
definitely consider doing another TV
show um
series like this instead of pretty
little liars I know I really enjoyed
Vampire Diaries I've been getting a lot
of requests for Gossip Girl Teen Wolf
those two shows I don't watch anymore
but I can definitely look into it and
maybe do that sometime in the near
future
they're definitely time consuming so
it's going to be a little bit into it
until I do another series like this but
anyways if you are interested in seeing
this um kind of short and sweet get the
look video for Alison DiLaurentis please
keep on watching give it a thumbs up if
you liked it let me know if you think in
the comments below and I will see you
guys in my next video bye guys as always
I'm priming my eyes using Mac's
painterly paint-pot
now taking a gold brown shimmery color
I'm just going to place that onto my
lids and extend it a little bit into my
crease to brighten up the look and
highlight my eyes I'm just going to take
a white shimmery color and place that on
my brow bone now taking just a basic
black eye liner I'm just going to begin
lining my top eyelid now once I finish
doing that I'm just going to be taking a
flat tap eyeshadow brush and smudging
the eyeliner into my lashline and as you
guys can tell this is like my favorite
thing to do because I think it gives the
look a little bit more of a smokey kind
of effect to it to deepen the look a
little bit more I'm just going to be
taking a matte black color and kind of
smudging that into my eye liner and
bringing it up onto my eyelid to give a
little bit more of a gradient effect and
make it look a little bit more smoky and
dark I'm also going to be sweeping that
same black color onto my lower lash line
to balance out the look now to deepen
the look even more I'm going to begin
tight lining and also lining my
waterline with just a basic black pencil
liner next I'm going to curl my
eyelashes and apply mascara my two
favorite mascaras right now are the
Maybelline falsies mascara and the
Revlon grow luscious mascara is my
favorite mascara combination because I
think it kind of gives like a false
eyelash look without actually applying
them which i think is perfect for this
series for the blush I'm going to keep
it kind of natural and apply just a
light pink cream blush to my cheeks and
then for the lips I noticed that Allison
almost always has some sort of baby pink
lip so I'm just gonna be taking this NYX
up lip liner and applying that onto my
lips and filling them all the way in and
then I'm taking this Revlon lip gloss
and I'm just going to place that right
over the pink
moving on to hair you're going to want
to start by having your hair parted in
the middle I'm also using second day
hair just because I find that it's the
easiest for me to curl my hair this way
now taking my Conair 1 inch curling iron
I'm just going to be getting curling my
hair away from my face now this is the
same technique that I used in my Emily
video except I'm curling it all the way
up and not just from the cheater from
the chin down now Homme curling my hair
is really very simple I've taught you
guys this a few times before but I'm
just going to run through it kind of
quickly all I'm basically doing with the
curling iron is taking the hair piece
bringing it through the clamp and
rotating it up and away from my face
halfway down the hair piece and then
working the rest of the curl through the
barrel and the reason why I'm doing this
is because it'll distribute the heat a
lot higher up your hair instead of just
at the ends Allison's hair is very curly
so when you are curling your hair make
sure that you are really rotating it
towards the top of your hair and not
focusing on the bottom so make sure you
really do use that technique because
it'll help your curls a lot especially
towards the front of your face now in
the meantime if any of your curls happen
to fall out towards the top you can just
go right back in with your curling iron
and curl the sections at the top of it
to make it curly so now all I'm doing is
finishing with hairspray and the look is
complete moving on to the outfit this
outfit was recreated from episode 6
remains of a this is the episode where
she made the longest appearance this
season so that's why I chose this outfit
to recreate now is able to find the
exact dress that she wore and it is from
Free People but I bought it at shop Bob
calm the shoes that I'm wearing are from
Kohl's and they are half the price of
the ones that she wore which were from
Aldo and with that that completes this
video I really hope you guys liked it
and thanks so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
