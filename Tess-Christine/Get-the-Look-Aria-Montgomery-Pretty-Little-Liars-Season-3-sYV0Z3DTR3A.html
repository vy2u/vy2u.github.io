can keep a secret if one of them is dead
hey everyone today's video is the second
part of my get the look Pretty Little
Liars series and today's video is Aria
Montgomery I was super excited to do her
because she has been my highly requested
character from the series from the
beginning you guys constantly asked for
her and her in Hanna at least so super
excited to get this up for you guys
because I know you guys have all been
waiting for it I did hair makeup and
outfits for each character for aria I
did a little bit more outfits just
because it kind of dressed like her a
little bit already so it was a little
bit easier for me to put together the
outfit in one of the last episodes I
believed it's titled stolen kisses she
had her hair kind of like braided to the
side and then was wearing that white
dress so I did a hair an outfit bonus
look at the end so make sure you stay
tuned to the end of the video I try to
make the hair different in every video
that I do obviously I mean people are
curling my hair a lot nowadays so I try
to show you guys different tips and
tricks throughout my hair tutorials
obviously Arya's her hair look is not as
curled as Hannah's it's more straight at
the ends which I think kind of gives
like an edgy vibe and obviously her
makeup is a little bit darker and
smokier and the lips are obviously
darker so if you are interested in this
Aria Montgomery get the look video
please keep on watching and I will see
you in a little bit bye guys
now before we get into the makeup it's
really important that I fill in my brows
because Lucy Hale or I guess you could
say Aria has very thick and defined
brows so I'm taking this eyebrow pencil
by Maybelline in the color light brown
and filling them in and making them look
fuller and bigger to achieve Lucy's look
now to set the eyebrow pencil and make
the look a little bit more full I'm
going to take this Anastasia brow kit
and use the powder to kind of go over
the pencil and then I'm going to set it
with this clear brow gel by Anastasia
next I'm priming my eyes with Mac's
painterly paint-pot in preparation for
eye shadow
now taking a quad by Rimmel London in
the color 0:02 I'm going to take the
lightest shade or the second to lightest
shade which is like a pinky champagne
color and place that on my lid then
right over it with the same brush I'm
going to take the gold shimmery color
and place that on my lid this is going
to be a base for the smoky eye look
because area always keeps her lids very
natural with smokey eyes towards her
lashline next I'm taking the lightest
color in a large fluffy brush and
highlighting and kind of blending it out
now for Arya's signature smoky look I'm
going to be taking the darkest shade in
this color which is kind of a brownish
purpley gray color and with an eye
shadow pencil brush I'm just going to
kind of smudge this into my lash line
and bring it a little bit onto my lid
and you can build this up to however
smoky you want it I'm going to go a
couple layers just to make sure it's
this right amount of smoky that aria has
and I'm also going to drag that onto my
lower lash line to balance out the look
now this part is super important to
achieve Arya's look I'm taking an eye
pencil in just a basic black and I'm
going to put this onto my top eyelash
line now you can be kind of messy with
this because we're going to smudge it
out with this flat top eyes shadow brush
this is super important for Arya's look
because she kind of has a smoky look
going on but it's never as harsh like a
liquid eyeliner would give so this kind
of gives a gradient smoky look towards
the lash line and then still kind of
natural on the lids so with that same
dark color I'm going to place that kind
of over the black and a little bit onto
the lids to give like I said a gradient
effect now taking that same large eye
shadow brush you're going to kind of
brush it over to kind of blend in the
colors a little bit yet still keeping
the black noticeable so now all I'm
going to do is line both of my water
lines to deepen the look a little bit
more and then with that same flat tap
eye shadow brush you're just going to
kind of smudge that onto your lower lash
line to give even a more smoky look now
I'm curling my eyelashes and applying
mascara so instead of applying false
eyelashes I'm going to be using three
different mascaras this is just going to
build your eyelashes up and kind of give
you that false eyelash look without
actually applying them so the three
mascaras I'm using our benefits BADgal
lash Maybelline falsies and Revlon's
grow luscious now time for the blush I'm
taking this powder blush by Sony
Kashuk in the color melon and placing
this on my cheeks now for the lips aria
always kind of has like a dark red or
like maroon color on her lips it's never
super pink but it is kind of
natural-looking so that's why I'm taking
this Revlon lip stain in the color crush
which is just like a dark maroon color
now moving on to hair now it's really
important that you have your hair parted
on the side it doesn't really matter
what side just as long as on the side
because that's where Aria usually parts
her hair so now to begin this hair from
the bottom and working to the top this
is just going to make it easier for me
to make sure I'm curling all the
sections of hair now the curling one
that I'm using for this look is the
Conner infinity wand and I really like
this wand for this look because the wand
or the curling rod gets skinnier at the
end which gives you kind of a different
shaped curl and is perfect for leaving
the ends out which is what you want for
arias look Arya's hair in this is pretty
messy it's not it's curly and it still
looks really nice but it kind of has
like a messy vibe going on and with the
straight ends it kind of is a little bit
edgier
so whereas Hannah's the curls kind of
curled underneath hers go straight at
the end which kind of you know suits
Aria because it's kind of messy and
doesn't really look super uniform so how
I'm curling this is very simple as you
see here I'm basically just wrapping
them around the barrel and then leaving
about an inch off the ends so don't wrap
the entire piece of hair around the
barrel leave a lot about an inch off of
the barrel to make sure that it stays
straight now you can be super random
with this because the point of it is to
look messy and kind of onion ofor me can
go every other direction with it you
don't have to go all the same direction
which is what I'm doing but make sure
you curl the front pieces away from your
face just because it'll frame your face
a little bit better and give you Arya's
exact look now if you notice in the show
Arya's hair is kind of straight at the
top and kind of curls towards the bottom
so to make sure that none of my hair got
curled at the top or if you have
naturally curly hair you can just take a
plain curling iron and kind of use the
clamp and smooth it down at the top and
then curl it underneath but make sure
you still leave the ends of the hair out
so you're not curling the ends under
so as you can see I'm just taking random
pieces this can be super random and on
uniform and kind of just like curling
random pieces to make sure the top of my
hair is straight and smooth now all I'm
doing here is smoothing down a few extra
pieces to make sure that the ends are
straight and how I like it now this is
the fun part you can kind of just mess
up your hair run your fingers through it
spray some hairspray and kind of just
like mash the curls and make them kind
of go all which way to give a messy kind
of edgy vibe to your hair and with that
the look is complete now let's move on
to the outfits this first outfit was
inspired by episode 3 kingdom of the
blind now her exact shirt and skirt were
pretty affordable they were actually
from PacSun but since they were both
unavailable and sold out I decided to
recreate it by finding this similar
pattern skirt from Nasty Gal calm the a
similar blue belt from Target and since
I couldn't find a yellow t-shirt I opted
for the same color yellow tank top from
forever 21
now I was able to find the exact shoes
that she was wearing in the episode and
these fun colorful tribal print wedges
are from Steve Madden but I've actually
been seeing these pattern shoes pretty
much everywhere so check Kohl's or
Target if you're on the hunt for them
this next outfit is recreated from the
first episode in the season entitled it
happened that night now as you can see
she's wearing the exact same Steve
Madden wedges as before so I made sure
to include them into the outfit as for
her pants she's wearing some sort of
dark navy jeans so I included these ones
from forever 21 now I wasn't sure of her
exact top but I knew that it was yellow
so to save some money I included the
same yellow tank top from forever 21 as
from before as well as the blue belt
from Target now her exact scarf is from
Anthropologie but I found this one from
forever 21 with similar colors that was
a lot cheaper this next outfit is
recreated from the most recent episode
episode 8 in this episode she's wearing
this really cool peplum style dress and
it has a fun black-and-white print her
exact dress is from Betsey Johnson and
is definitely on the pricier side I was
able to find this black and white style
peplum dress from TJ Maxx for only about
$20 to add a little bit of color I
decided to add this maroon colored belt
from tar
and in the scene she was wearing brown
wedges so I decided to pick these ones
which are my favorite from PacSun now
even though this outfit isn't exact I
think it's very similar and still
embodies Aria and gives you the same
edgy look as she was going for with this
outfit for a lot cheaper now for this
bonus look it is from the last episode
episode 8 stolen kisses now for the hair
all you're going to do is begin
gathering it onto one side of your head
whichever side of your hair has more
hair now all you're going to begin doing
is French braiding this is actually very
simple once you get the hang of it so
with the hair on the side you're going
to split that into three pieces and
begin braiding which with each outside
strand of hair you're going to pick up
more hair from the bottom and from the
top of your hair once you get to the
middle back of your head all you're
going to do is secure this with bobby
pins this just takes a little bit of
practice and you'll I'm sure you'll be
able to master it so I'm taking about
three bobby pins and criss crossing them
in the back to make sure they stay and
now I'm taking that extra hair and
covering the bobby pin so the bobby pins
don't show and it makes it look a little
bit more put together and with that the
look is complete this look is super easy
to dress up or down and then it's very
simple once you get the hang of it
moving on to the outfit the exact dress
that she's wearing is by Rachel Zoe and
it is almost four hundred dollars now
since I don't have money to spend on a
dress like that or a place to wear a
dress like that I found this at t.j.maxx
that is kind of a casual version of it
but still gives you the same look that
she was going for and with that that
concludes my gift a look for Aria
Montgomery I really hope you guys liked
it and thank you all so much for
