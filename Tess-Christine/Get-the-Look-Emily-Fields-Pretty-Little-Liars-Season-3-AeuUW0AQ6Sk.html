can keep a scene if one of them is dead
hey everyone today's video is the fourth
part of my Pretty Little Liars series
and today's video is Emily fields a her
and Spencers look for sure are probably
the most practical looks I guess for
school and for like a back to school
look even as for the outfits go I mean
all four of the girls their hair and
makeup you know you could wear whatever
you prefer feel comfortable in for
school but I would definitely say for
outfits they dress the most practical
and kind of like how I dressed during
high school as your makeup goes her
makeup is very natural and very simple
um it almost looks like she's not even
wearing makeup but I didn't really want
to make a tutorial with not even doing
any makeup so I kind of showed you how
to make a natural-looking face and a
natural-looking um I look for you guys
that kind of looks like Emily and kind
of something that she would wear and
keep it low-key which I also think is
perfect for school or those who are just
starting out makeup for the hair I
decided to go for a curly look because
Emily has worn her hair straight
throughout the season but she's also
worn it curly and I think that straight
hair is kind of easy to achieve everyone
kind of knows how to use a straightener
and get their hair straight but in some
episodes and actually most this season
she's been wearing your hair curly she's
been wearing it kind of wavy towards the
end from like the chin down it's been
kind of these like big waves which i
think is really pretty because she still
keeps it pretty straight on top and then
has these waves that cover the bottom
half of her hair which i think is really
pretty so easy and so quick to achieve
you guys aren't even to believe it so if
you're interested in seeing this get the
look Emily fields video please keep on
watching stay tuned for my last Pretty
Little Liars series video which is going
to be Allyson and hers is going to be
kind of short and sweet I only did one
outfit for her so be on the lookout for
that if you haven't seen my Aria Hanna
or Spencer videos I'll have them all
linked below and yeah again if you are
interested please keep on watching and
I'll see you guys in one second hi guys
as always I'm priming my lids using
Mac's painterly paint-pot
now to give the lid some color and
brighten them up a little bit I'm just
going to be taking this matte beige
color and applying that all over my lids
to define my lids and deepen the eye
look I'm just going to be taking this
matte soft brown color and placing that
into my crease to make my eyes stand out
and deepen the look a little bit more
like emily has I'm just going to be
taking this black eye pencil and lining
my top eyelash line now taking a flat
top eyes shadow brush I'm just going to
be smudging that eyeliner into my
lashline this is going to make the
eyeliner look a lot more natural and
make your eyelashes stand out a lot more
with whatever black is left on the brush
I'm just going to lightly sweep that
onto my lower lash line next I'm curling
my lashes and applying mascara the two
mascaras that I'm using are Maybelline
falsies mascara and Revlon's grow
luscious mascara this just gives the
look a little bit more of a false
eyelash look but still keeping it very
natural by just applying mascara
moving on to cheeks you're going to want
to pick something that's close to your
natural skin tone so I'm picking this
coral blush by benefit for the lips I'm
just applying chapstick but if you want
to add some color you can definitely
take a Revlon lip stain this is just a
light pink color and it'll just give you
a subtle hint of color to your lips
without being too overbearing and still
give that natural look that you want
moving on to hair you're going to want
to have your hair started by parting it
in the middle then working from the back
to the front you're going to split your
hair into two sections
taking my ever so famous Conor one-inch
curling iron I'm going to begin taking
the pieces and wrapping them around the
barrel once I'm finished wrapping them
around the barrel I'm just going to kind
of cup the curl at the end once I
release to kind of let it cool off a
little bit and make sure the curl stays
in place how I'm curling this is really
very simple all I'm doing is making sure
that I'm only really curling the bottom
half of the hair piece so I get the
exact look that Emily has so when I'm
curling I don't want to curl too high up
onto my head I just want to curl on the
bottom half to achieve that giant wave
look that she has make sure that when
you are curling you're curling your
curls away from your face and all in the
same direction so you're able to mash
them together at the end also I've kind
of naturally curly hair so if you can
see I am taking the clamp and smoothing
down my hairpiece first before I wrap
the hair around the barrel if you have
curly hair like me or naturally kind of
wavy hair you can definitely do this
it's kind of a trick I have for you guys
to make it a lot easier and get your
hair kind of smooth on top like she has
so now after lightly finishing with some
flexible hold hairspray you're just
going to take your fingers and kind of
lightly shake them through the curls
this is just going to allow them to kind
of mesh together and give you kind of
that natural looking curl that emily has
now after that the look is complete this
only took me about five minutes so it's
perfect for school now let's move on to
the outfits this first look was
recreated from an earlier episode this
season this outfit is super casual and
comfy which is why I really like it
this really bright fun coral colored
tank top that I'm wearing is from Target
and then the white cami underneath is
from Express the shorts that I'm wearing
are from
American Eagle and then the black shoes
that I'm wearing are from Steve Madden
none of these items are exact but since
Emily style is pretty basic you can
achieve the same look without having the
exact pieces this next look was
recreated from episode 8 stolen kisses
her exact tank that she's wearing is
from Urban Outfitters but I found this
cheaper version at Target that's the
same color pink as for the Hat I found
the same Brown hat not the exact same
that she's wearing but a similar one at
Target and then my shorts are just
American Eagle and then my shoes are
Tom's and with that that concludes my
get the look inspired video of Emily
fields
I really hope you guys liked it let me
know what you think in the comments
below and as always I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
