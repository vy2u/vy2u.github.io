this one you'll save better lock it in
your pocket taking this one to the grave
hey guys today's video is going to be
the start of my get the look Pretty
Little Liars series so as you guys can
tell from the title
today's get the look is going to be
Hanna Marin and I've actually done a
hair tutorial for her already but from
season two so I'll have that linked in
the description box below but as you
guys know I might get the look videos
our hair makeup and outfit and now
outfits very I did two for each of the
girls I think for aria I did three just
because I kind of dress a little bit
more like her anyways so I had more
stuff to pick from for her but for each
of the girls I did two and then for
Alison I did one just because she's not
in it that much and it was kind of hard
to choose from unlike what outfits cuz
she literally makes like cameo
appearances like super fast so if you're
interested in watching this get the look
Hanna Marin inspired video please keep
on watching stay tuned for my next
videos they're all gonna be pretty
little liars and I believe the next
one's gonna be aria so keep on the
lookout for that and I will see you guys
soon bye guys to begin with the makeup
I'm going to begin by priming my eyes
using Mac's painterly paint-pot
next moving on to the eyeshadow I'm
going to be taking this Revlon quad in
the color decadent and I'm going to be
taking the lightest shade with a large
fluffy brush and placing that onto my
brow bone as a base and also as a
highlight next I'm taking the light gold
shimmery color and with an eyeshadow
brush I'm just going to place that onto
my lids the girls this season have been
going super natural with their eyeshadow
and smoking it out more towards their
lashline so this palette is perfect for
it because it gives you the right amount
of neutral colors now to give the eyes a
bit of dimension I'm just going to be
taking this dense crease brush and
picking up the darkest shade in the
palette and placing that into my crease
and very light sweeping motions this is
just going to deepen the look a little
bit more but still stay on the more
natural side which is what you want for
Hannah's look now to balance out the
look I'm going to be taking this eye
pencil brush and I'm going to be taking
the darkest color in that shade and
placing that onto my lower lash line now
like I said before the girls like to
keep the eyes very smoky towards the
lash line but neutral on the lids so
you're going to want to focus on the
lash lines by using dark
towards there so now with the basic
black eyeliner pencil you're going to
begin lining your top eyelash line now
this can be messy because we're going to
smoke it out in just a few seconds so
now with a flat tap a shadow brush
you're just going to begin smoking out
the eyeliner that you just placed and
kind of smudging it into your lash line
this is just going to give your look a
more deep and look towards the eyelash
line but still keeping it natural on the
lids which is what almost all of the
girls have this season so now to blend
the colors and give kind of a gradient
effect we're going to be taking that
same dark eyeshadow from the palette and
placing that over the eyeliner with the
same flat tap eyes shadow brush this is
just going to give the look a little bit
more of a dramatic effect and also smoke
it out a little bit more so now taking
that same black pencil eyeliner we're
going to tightline our waterline and
then line our bottom lash line next I'm
going to curl my eyelashes in
preparation for mascara now I know the
girls in the show do wear false
eyelashes but since I'm going for more
of an everyday wear look I'm just going
to use my real eyelashes so now taking
benefits BADgal lash mascara I'm just
going to coat my top lashes
now she give the eyelashes a bit more of
a dramatic effect I'm going to double up
on mascaras so now I'm taking Revlon's
glow brow luscious mascara and placing
that on to my top and bottom lashes
so Hanna's blush in the series isn't
very noticeable and very dramatic at all
so this is why a cream blush is perfect
for it because it'll give you that nice
subtle hint of color like she has but
not overdoing it so I'm taking this
blush by Sonia Kashuk in the color rosy
and placing that on the apples of my
cheeks I really like this blush a lot
it's super creamy this is actually my
first time trying it and I'm really
really pleasantly surprised with it
moving on to lips Hannah always almost
has some sort of a pink color on her
lips but it's never glossy or really
noticeable so that's why I'm taking this
Revlon just bitten kissable balm stain
which is perfect because it just stains
your lips and it'll give you that nice
natural color of pink which is what she
has the color I'm using is cherish
devotion and with that that completes
the makeup now let's move on to hair
Hannah's hair this season is definitely
curled but it has kind of like a messy
vibe to it so I'm going to show you guys
how to achieve that look by using just a
simple one-inch curling iron the curling
iron I'm using is by Conair but you can
use whatever curling iron works for you
as long as it's near or close to this
size so now I'm doing is working from
the back to the front and I'm going to
take each section of hair and I'm going
to begin curling it now how I curl my
hair is I start about halfway down and
then I begin curling so I don't go all
the way down the hair piece I start
about halfway and then work the hair
through the curl now I'm going to show
you again in real time motion so all I'm
going to do is take the clamp and clamp
it and then I'm going to begin turning
half way down and then release the clamp
and work the rest of the hair through
this is just going to give you a curl
that is curled all the way up the hair
piece instead of just at the ends which
is what you want to achieve Hannah's
look now how I'm curling each section of
hair is I'm curling them every other way
so one way I will do away from my face
and then the other piece of hair I will
do towards my face this is just going to
prevent the curls from sticking together
and it will give you kind of that messy
vibe that hannah has so you don't want
your curls to stick together at the end
and by curling them all in the same
direction you'll kind of eventually
start to form that way so that's why you
want to do every other way but make sure
you curl your hair away from your face
once you get to the pieces that are
closest to your face it'll be able to
frame your face a little bit better and
give you the exact look that hannah has
so now I'm doing is repeating this
process on the other side of my head now
to give my hair some added volume I am
going to tease the crown of my head this
is obviously optional a lot of people
don't like teasing the hair but I'm
going to do it just to make sure that I
can get kind of an exact look that
hannah has so I'm going to begin teasing
my hair and keep it very natural-looking
you don't want to get too crazy when you
tease
so now if any of your curls fall out or
you want to make it a little bit more
messy you can take random sections of
hair and wrap it around the barrel this
is going to give you different types of
curls so it'll make the curls kind of
look Messier in with the curls that you
already curled if that makes any sense
so it'll just kind of keep it messy and
keep it different curls throughout your
head which is what she has because she
doesn't have very uniform curls at all
they still look very nice but they're
definitely still messy so now after
finishing with some hairspray the look
is complete now let's move on to
everyone's favorite part the two outfits
this first outfit is recreated from
Episode six entitled remains of a this
outfit is really colorful and fun so I
was super excited that I was able to
almost get an exact how she wore it in
the episode this mustard yellow color
tank top that I'm wearing is from
forever 21 the pants that I'm wearing
are exact and they are from Nordstrom's
and the brand is Dylan George these
pants are on the pricier side but since
floral jeans are everywhere for this
upcoming fall you can find very similar
versions and many other stores the
earrings that I'm wearing are from
Target and these brown sandals that I'm
wearing are from Kohl's and they're the
brand
Lauren Conrad
this next outfit is recreated from the
same episode remains of a just obviously
in a different scene this dress is the
exact dress that she wore in the episode
and it is from Zara now I believe it is
unable to purchase online but I have
seen it just recently in stores for on
sale actually so definitely check out
your local Zara if you are on the hunt
for it
her exact shoes that she wore were
almost 300 dollars so I opted for these
wedges from PacSun and that completes my
Hanna Marin inspired get the look video
