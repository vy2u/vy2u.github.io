this one you'll save better lock and you
pocket taking this one to the grave hi
guys today's video is the third part of
my Pretty Little Liars get the look
series and today's video is Spencer
Hastings her look is super classic
modern I love her look I think she's
very kind of classic and put together I
did two hair looks because I asked on my
Facebook and Twitter which hair look you
wanted to see her kind of classic wavy
straight hair or her soft you know big
waves that she has totally got a tie I
think the straight hair one just a
little bit but I felt bad for those who
really wanted the wavy hair so I
definitely decided to include the soft
waves in this tutorial I'll put an
annotation in case you want to skip that
part if you're completely not interested
I'll put an annotation to skip the
second hair look if your don't want to
see that one but the main one I did and
focused on was this one because just
using a straightener yay finally not a
curling iron for those of you who get on
me for my curling hair tutorials but
anyways um yeah so her hair is really
fun I used a straightener for it and
kind of showed you a little different
technique to make it kind of textured at
the ends and fun just like Spencer has
so if you're interested in this Spencer
Hastings get the look video please keep
on watching and I will see you guys in a
little bit bye guys first as always I'm
going to begin by priming my eyelids
using Mac's painterly paint-pot now
taking a basic matte soft brown color
I'm just going to place this all over my
lids and a little bit onto my crease now
with a light hand I'm just going to be
taking a dark brown matte color and
placing that into the crease focusing it
on the outer corner this will still give
your eyes the natural look that Spencer
has but still giving your eyes a little
bit of dimension now to lighten up the
look and blend out any harsh lines I'm
going to be taking this matte cream
color and placing that onto my brow bone
to balance out the look I'm just going
to be taking that same dark brown color
and placing that onto my lower lash line
now Spencer definitely has some
definition to her eyes but it's nothing
as harsh as a black eyeliner or a liquid
liner so I'm just gonna be taking this
dark grey pencil liner and lining my top
lids and then using the sponge
application on the back to kind of smoke
it into my lash
line to give that natural sort of look
that Spencer has now I'm curling my
lashes and applying mascara the mascara
that I'm using is the Maybelline falsies
mascara and the Revlon grow luscious
mascara I like combining the two because
it gives your eyes a little bit more of
a pop instead of applying false lashes
moving on to the cheek Spencer doesn't
have anything too dramatic so I'm just
applying this basic coral blush with a
stippling brush as for the lip she keeps
it very natural obviously so I'm just
applying this nude pinky color to my
lips moving on to hair I'm going to
begin by sectioning my hair up working
from the bottom to the top with the
straightener some of you may have
noticed but I did cut my hair so I am
going to have to use extensions to
achieve Spencer's exact look but this is
obviously optional I just chose it to
give a more exact look for you guys so
once my extensions are in place I'm just
going to be taking the straightener and
I'm going to begin curling it under now
how you do this is very simple are you
going to do is take the straightener and
basically rotate the two barrels
underneath and it's going to give you
kind of a flipped out look at the end
which is what Spencer has now just for
this bottom later layer we're just going
to focus curling it under and then once
we get to the top we're going to work on
more of framing your face and curling it
in different ways as for the extensions
I'm only applying two little panels of
them because I want my hair to kind of
look odd fuller towards the end and kind
of keep my layers on the top because
that's exactly what Spencer has so like
I said I'm only applying two and then
the rest is just going to be my natural
hair so now once you get to these pieces
that are closer to your face you're
going to actually flip the barrel
upwards to kind of create a flipped out
look at the end and then you're only
going to do this where the pieces are
closest to your face so you don't really
have to worry about the back pieces
because they're just going to kind of
fall and lay on your hair anyways but
make sure the ones that you curl towards
your face are flipped up and away so
basically I'm just going to complete
that process throughout my head until my
entire hair is kind of flipped away and
you can totally play with this this look
this can be at random it doesn't have to
be too precise it's just kind of however
your head shape is even and like how
your hair falls on your head
is how you're going to flip it upwards
so just do it until you think that it
looks good also be sure to keep in mind
that your hair will fall throughout the
day so even if you flip it up quite a
bit and you're kind of kind of scared at
the intensity of it don't worry because
it will fall and you'll kind of see that
once I get to the fashion part of it my
hair is already fallen and looks a
little bit more straight than this
already which will give you the exact
Spencer look now how I'm pinning my
bangs back is just very simple I've seen
her do this in a couple episodes all I'm
doing is taking my bangs section and
securing it with two bobby pins and then
lastly I'm finishing with some hairspray
moving on to hairstyle number two this
is kind of her soft waves that she has
they're not as intense as Arya's or
Hanna's they're kind of just soft and
very kind of textured and flowy and
that's what I really like about them so
how you achieve this is honestly very
simple and I thought you guys this many
of times especially the curling process
but all I'm going to do is take the
barrel or the curling wand that I'm
using which is the Conair one-inch
curling iron and I'm basically just
going to begin curling my hair away from
my face and how I'm doing this as I'm
starting halfway down and moving the
hair through the barrel and all I'm
doing this is repeating this process
throughout my head making sure that I
keep the curls going away from my face
when you are curling make sure you're
focusing on the front sections of your
hair because that's how Spencer has it
so you can kind of be lazy with the back
sections but make sure the pieces that
are towards the front of your head are
curled to the top and as full as
possible so now once you're finished
curling you're just going to take your
fingers and lightly run them through
your hair now because you've curled your
hair in all the same direction your
curls are going to kind of mesh together
and give you that one big wave-like
effect that Spencer has so in the
meantime if your curls happen to fall
out a little bit you can definitely go
back with a curling iron and kind of fix
up any pieces to frame your face a
little bit better because like I said
Spencer has curls that kind of frame her
face more and the back is a little bit
more straight so how I like doing this
is just taking the same curling iron and
wrapping the pieces around the barrel to
kind of fix the curls a little bit and
give you that s light curl which just
gives you the wave leg
now once you finish forming the curls -
how you like the look is complete now
let's move on to everybody's favorite
the outfits this first outfit was
recreated from episode 4 birds of a
feather
now I was able to find the exact dress
that Spencer was wearing in the episode
and it is from Urban Outfitters this
belt which I made sure he had gold
buckle detailing is from Nasty Gal the
shoes I weren't sure because I couldn't
see in the episode what she was wearing
but I just decided to pick these loafers
from Target and then the cardigan I'm
wearing is from Target as well the
second outfit is recreated from one of
the most recent episodes episode 8
stolen kisses
as for the BLA she was wearing I was
able to find the exact one and is from
Zara it's really cute and has little
parrots all over it and has really cool
stud detailing on the collar the felt
that I'm wearing is from forever 21 as
well as my blue jeans as for the shoes I
decided to stick with the same black
loafers from Target because I've seen
her wear loafers in a couple of episodes
and plus I think they kind of scream
Spencer and with that that concludes my
get the look Spencer Hastings video I
really hope you guys liked it and I will
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
