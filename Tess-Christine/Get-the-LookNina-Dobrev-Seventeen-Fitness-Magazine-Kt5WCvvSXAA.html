to be get the look type of video and I
thought this would be kind of a fun
video to do because I don't know about
you but I love reading magazines and I
always see magazines you know with
celebrities on the cover and their
makeup is always flawless and their hair
looks gorgeous and I always try to
recreate that so I thought I would do
that for you guys because I thought you
guys would be interested in that and let
me know if you like these type of videos
in the comments below because I would be
more than happy to keep doing them but
today I actually decided to do it
because I was at Target the other day
and I was looking through the magazine
and I saw that Seventeen magazine had a
fitness issue and I had no idea that
they even had a fitness issue until like
two days ago and so I saw it and Nina
Dobrev was on the cover and you know me
I'm like a huge Vampire Diaries fan and
so I looked at it because it had you
know like interesting things on the
front plus I love fitness magazines and
I didn't even know Seventeen magazine
had a fitness issue and I loved
Seventeen magazine so I definitely had
to pick it up and I was reading through
in everything and I love Nina Dobrev
this article in it she gives you a lot
of great tips you know for working out
when you when you don't want to go to
the gym she awesome tips you know like
taking the stairs instead of you know
riding the elevator or something like
that she incorporates it into like your
everyday life which I really which I
really loved well this is kind of you
know fun to read when you know you're
wanting to learn things about what to do
in your everyday life and to like make
adjustments to it and what else so it
gives you is awesome food tips you know
like but not too crazy you know like
some fake fitness magazines they give
you like oh in stead of a burger eat the
salad and you know you don't want to
make that huge jump instead of eating a
juicy cheeseburger eat like a grilled
barbecue chicken sandwich because it's
like high in protein and different it's
a like healthier for you so you know it
gives you kind of like different things
that would you know help you out you
know small steps to eating healthier is
what would help me and I know a lot of
you girls would be interested in that
and oh I'm like ranting about this
magazine I'm not being paid or sponsored
by Seventeen magazine at all I just like
was so shocked because I had no idea
Seventeen magazine had a Fitness issue
so and I like love
with this issue but anyways back to the
video nina dobrev is on the cover and
her hair is you know loose waves it's
kind of a beachy kind of feel and then
she's obviously wearing a swimsuit on
the cover being that it is a fitness
magazine so um but yeah her makeup is
very very natural like usual but
actually I watched a video the other day
of her it was her behind the scenes of
this shoot and she they had lots of
close-ups on her face and I noticed that
she actually had purple on her eyelids
which I thought was very unique and
different so I mean not really now
everyone's using color on their eyelids
but for me I never used color so I
thought it looked gorgeous on her so I
wanted to try that out for you guys
today so I'll be showing you this sort
of purple smoked out look it's purple
she had purple more of like as an
eyeliner I guess she still had black
eyeliner but she just had like a purple
accent where her eyeliner is and it
smoked out just on the lash line which I
thought was very unique you know usually
you smoke it out you know in the corners
but it smoked out towards the lash line
and it gives your eyelashes you know a
fuller effect and also her hair is loose
waves so I actually have a trick for you
girls I know I don't know if you guys
have seen my everyday hair tutorial
there's a bug you guys obviously know
that I have naturally curly hair
naturally kind of wavy hair so um I mean
this tutorial was fairly easy for me but
I actually found a trick for all you
girls who have you know naturally
straight hair fine hair that would help
you instead of you know loading your
hair up with mousse and hairspray and
actually and it and this way I actually
found is very effective it's actually
next to Kendall Jenner's picture um she
has you know kind of loose waves and
here is the tip and the tip is to
actually mix boiling water well or just
really hot water with sea salt and you
mix it up and put it into a spray bottle
like this and the reason why you use hot
water is because when you put the salt
in the water the hot water will help
dissolve the salt and you want about two
teaspoons of sea salt mixed in with one
cup of hot water and all you're gonna do
you can get these spray bottles at
Target that's where I got mine they come
bigger size as I believe this is just a
small size and I mix it up and you shake
it up and then just
all you do is just spritz it all over
your hair so I mean I can do it now
that's what I did today for you guys and
I didn't use any gel or any hairspray or
anything like I normally do I just used
this I thought this is a very good idea
with summer coming up you know to throw
in your beach bag or throw in your you
know your pool bag because there I live
we don't have beaches but when we go to
the pool or when we go to the lake or
the river or something like that this is
an awesome idea because after you just
get done swimming you know your hair
gets a gross and if you disperse the
tide spritz this on your hair it'll give
you needle nice waves and make your hair
very soft one thing I would recommend or
not recommend about this is using it
every day you're going for you know
beachy waves every day I would you know
try to just stick to a curling iron
because this with the saltwater dries
out your hair after you do use this I
would recommend a deep conditioning
treatment you know just to kind of
moisturize your hair again because salt
dries it out obviously so what I would
recommend is the macadamia oil treatment
for your hair it's a mask that you put
on your hair you can get it at Alta and
or I would recommend just a deep
conditioner you can find at any
drugstore
I know Pantene has a deep conditioning
treatment and just do it after you use
this on your hair and so that is it for
hair that's all I did honestly I would
was gonna do a hair tutorial on it but I
thought it would just be silly because
all I did was get out of the shower and
with 80% dry hair so you know like a
little bit damp I sprayed this all over
my hair and just let it dry all the way
and this is what I got and then for what
she's wearing in this on the cover and
inside is um the swimsuits brand is Opie
and Opie swimsuits and they sell it at
Walmart and I had no idea and I saw this
and I was like oh my god she's wearing
such a cute swimsuit so I actually
stopped over at Walmart to check it out
and they actually had all of the
swimsuits there which I was very
surprised about so if you are looking
for the swimsuit go to Walmart I
actually picked it up and this is what
it looks like what she's wearing and
then the top looks like this
it's a very cute and fun and bright
swimsuit you know for summer and it's
the colors are very neon they're like a
neon pink and a yellow and a blue and
it's a very fun and colorful swimsuit
and it's unbelievably cheap for someone
like me who buys Victoria's Secret
swimsuits or you know the occasional
target swimsuit it was only eight
dollars eight dollars for the bottom and
eight dollars for the top so this is
swimsuit for you know this was just
unbelievably cheap and it's actually a
very good quality swimsuit it's not
poorly made or anything it's very very
nice and they have tons of swimsuits
there and the second one I picked up was
another one that she was wearing and
it's this one this is also very bright
and I thought it was just a very fun
swimsuit also it's very neon colored a
lot of their swimsuits are very bright
and neon and I also I'm not being
sponsored by opt to say any of this I
just found these some suits and that
were featured throughout the entire
magazine so I had to go check them out
and I really liked them so that's why I
bought them it's got kind of a zebra
pattern and then a cheetah pattern and I
think it's fun you know animal print is
like really in it's been in for like a
while so I mean and I didn't have
anything like that so um I wanted to
pick it up and these are what the
bottoms look like they're really really
fun like colorful swimsuits and again
eight dollars eight dollars really
really cheap and they have tons and tons
of different styles I know like on the
back if you just pick this magazine up
and or I mean just go to the store and
like look for it if you don't have a
Walmart I'm not quite sure if they have
a website you can order off of I know
you can get them off of Walmart comm but
I don't know if they have Opie has like
their own website um if they do and I
find that out I'll link it in the bottom
barb but yes I really really loved this
magazine you should definitely go pick
it up if you haven't already it has a
lot of great tips and stuff for fashion
and for gym fashion even like I didn't
even know there was such a thing but for
gym fashion for eating tips and for
everything so I would definitely go
check this out I really really hope you
guys enjoy the eye makeup tutorial and
can go check out the swimsuits for
yourself but until my next video see ya
alright first I'm going to prime my eyes
using Mac's painterly paint-pot I'm
gonna spread that all over my lid next
with a large eyeshadow brush I'm going
to be taking soft Brown by Mac it is
just a matte light brown color and
placing that all over my lid with the
same brush I'm going to be taking
tempting by Mac this is just a shimmery
light brown color as well and I'm
putting that over the soft brown color
next with NYX jumbo eye pencil in the
color purple velvet I'm going to be
lining my upper lash line don't worry if
it's messy because we're gonna be
blending it out with our finger anyways
just kind of smudge it into your lash
line don't blend it into the lid next
with a flat shader brush from the BH
Cosmetics palette I'm going to be taking
the sort of a purple light purpley
shimmery color and placing that over the
purple color I just placed next with
that large shadow brush again I'm just
gonna kind of go over the purple just to
kind of blend it next with the NYX super
skinny eye marker I'm going to be
landing my eyes again this I look is
kind of nice because you're smudging
everything out so don't worry if you
kind of screw up on your eyeliner next
with an angled brush I'm going to be
taking carbon by Mac this is just a
matte black color and I'm going to kind
of smudge that eyeliner into the purple
next with a large bulky fluffy brush I'm
going to just blend that out don't blend
it too much of the purple will disappear
just friend blend it out a little bit
next with the color texture by Mac I'm
going to be placing that on the brow
bone not on the brow bone I would say
like the crease to the upper brow bone
next with that purple color again I'm
just gonna take that angled brush and
kind of touch up just to make sure the
purple shows through next with that
texture by Mac I'm going to be taking
that on putting that on my lower lash
line now I'm going to curl my lashes and
apply mascara I'm using the Maybelline
