hopefully is a graduation tutorial and
this has been one of my highly requested
videos for a while now so I really
wanted to get it out for you guys I hope
I'm not too late on graduation for some
of you guys I hope I'm not I know my
schools are my towns um high school is
still going so hopefully I'm not too
late for a lot of you guys but basically
I just did obviously the hair and the
makeup the makeup is pretty
straightforward I kept it very natural
using neutral colors I also used a
Maybelline quad so all of the colors you
can go out and obtain yourself and not
very expensive or anything like that as
for the hair the hair you can go pretty
much any way you want to with this I
kind of did how I went about this
tutorial was I did the hair that I would
most likely wear underneath my
graduation cap if I was graduating
because pretty much you can do any of
the tutorial hair tutorials I've ever
shown you and it would look great
underneath this cap I guess my only kind
of suggestion would be not to wear your
hair up or anything like that or even
like low I just think it would look very
silly with the hat because this is a
very goofy hat and a lot of you guys
were commenting me or messaging me
asking me what do I wear underneath that
thing and I was like it just wear your
hair down because if anything just wear
it natural to it really doesn't matter I
will have length of other hair tutorials
that I think would look great underneath
this so if you guys don't want to do
this or something like that you can
definitely go check out one of my other
hair tutorials that I think would look
just as good underneath the cap so if
you are interested in this graduation
tutorial please keep on watching I will
see you guys in my next video
happy graduation if you are graduating
and yeah I will see you guys in my next
video
bye guys first I'm priming my eyes using
a shimmery based eyeprimer next from the
Maybelline quad I'm just going to be
taking this light shimmery beige color
and placing that on my lid I'm also
going to extend this up into my brow
bone as well next taking the second
color which is a gold shimmery color I'm
just going to be taking with the other
side of that brush and I'm going to be
placing that directly onto my lids next
with a crease brush I'm just going to be
taking this copper toned color and
placing that when windshield wiper
motions into my crease as a transition
color
next with an angled crease brush I'm
just going to be picking up that last
color in the quad which is a dark brown
color and focusing that on the outer
half of my lid all these colors
complement each other very well so you
won't have to worry about harsh lines
but I'm going to focus that on the outer
corner of my eye and a little bit into
the crease next with the same color and
a flat type eyes shadow brush I'm just
going to bring that onto my lower lash
line next using an eye shadow pencil in
white I'm just going to place that into
an inner tear duct to highlight the eyes
a little bit more next I'm going to line
my top eyelid with a gel eyeliner I like
using a gel eyeliner because it's a
little bit more intense than a pencil
and since the eye shadows are so neutral
I just think this complements it very
well and intensifies your eyes a lot
more next with just a basic eye pencil
I'm just going to line my waterlines now
I'm just curling my eyelashes in
preparation for mascara now it is up to
you whether or not you want to wear
false eyelashes I chose not to so I'm
just going to apply a couple coats of
mascara to darken my eyelashes and give
it more of an intense look now once
you've completed that that is the
finished eye makeup look so now let's
move onto face or the blush I'm just
taking a very natural pink colored blush
and I'm just going to place that onto my
apples of my cheeks next for the lips
I'm just going to take this Revlon lip
butter and lightly tap that onto my lips
I'm tap it using the tapping motion
because it is a bright color and I want
to just make my look lips look stand out
a little bit more with some color but
not make them too intense to clash with
the purple cap that I'm wearing so I'm
just going to blend that into my lips
I'm using my fingertips and that is the
completed makeup now let's move on to
hair so for the hair I'm just going to
be taking the Conner infinity wand one
of my favorite curling irons ever and
I'm just going to basically curl my hair
all in one direction away from my face
so I'm going to basically just do that
simple process all the way throughout my
head there's no really precise way I'm
doing it I'm holding my hair on the
curling iron for about five to ten
seconds to get the curl that I want
obviously this will be determined by
your hair type and how easy your hair
holds the curl but that's how long I'm
holding it and I'm just basically doing
that throughout my entire head
now to relax the look a little bit more
I'm just going to take my fingers and
kind of run it through the curls this
will make the curls a little bit less
harsh or very intense and they'll just
make them look very soft and natural
which is what I want for this look so I
don't want to look too overdone but this
will definitely make the curls stick
together and just look really pretty and
very nice and I did choose to tease my
hair and now you may think this is silly
because I'm wearing a graduation cap but
when I did graduate high school I
actually took a lot of pictures with the
cap off so I definitely wanted to still
look good in if in case I do take my hat
off now all you're going to do to finish
this look is put on the ever so famous
graduation cap and the look is complete
I really hope you guys like this
graduation hair and makeup tutorial
remember I will have links to other
hairstyles of mine that I think would
look great for this in the description
box below have a happy graduation and I
will see you guys in my next video bye
