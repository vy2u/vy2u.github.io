what's up guys today's video is going to
be another Halloween tutorial and this
one's for all of my Game of Thrones fans
out there because I thought I would show
you guys the mother of dragons a
tutorial and show you guys two costume
ideas and a wig tutorial so I really
hope you enjoy and let's get started for
costume number one I wanted to steer
away from the typical Khaleesi costume
with the gowns I wanted to do something
where she wears kind of this armor
inspired a super badass looking stuff
and it's kind of like the Dothraki
Khaleesi and I just think she looks so
good so I wanted to incorporate those
pieces so I found a bodysuit and a skirt
from ASOS that were super affordable
like always I will have it everything
linked on my blog but was awesome about
it is not only the color palette but the
way that the skirt is draped and the way
you can tie it look super distressed
like hers without actually DIY or
destroying any clothing so you could
totally reuse these items or pull stuff
from your own closet which I love and
then for the choker I went for one that
I already had it was like a studded
choker that's from Lulu's but you can go
ahead and wear a dragon one from Amazon
if you want to and then I just wore some
knee-high boots that I already had owned
so that's perfect I know it's fall times
you probably have some brown boots in
your closet
for costume number two I wanted to
incorporate kind of the later season
Daenerys and kind of her classic blue
teal look that she had always going on
it was this one with the Cape I just
feel like that's like her color palette
in the later season so I wanted to
incorporate because I feel like
everybody's gonna know who you are with
this one so for the dress I found a very
very similar color from Windsor and I
cut up the sides so I made them have
slits and send angles at the bottom but
I think overall the way that the top is
shaped is very very gameofthrones I
thought it worked perfectly I wore the
same boots from the last costume and
then I found a dragon egg necklace from
Amazon and you can add a cape if you
want to but basically that's it it's so
easy
alright friends let's go ahead and talk
about the wig because I feel like this
is very crucial to your costume if
you're going to be Khaleesi Daenerys
whatever because I just feel like it's
her iconic look it's gonna what what's
going to make you stand out as her and
without it I just feel like it won't be
as recognizable so for the wig I wanted
to go all out for you guys go super bum
and get a lace front wig I told you guys
about this in my hardly video but lace
front wigs are they look extremely
natural and they tend to be some more
expensive so it just depends on how
all-out you want to go I'm gonna have
multiple options listed for you guys on
my blog including the exact one that I'm
wearing which is from a wig as fashion
so it's super easy all you're going to
need is a wig cap which usually comes
with the wig and you put that on your
head like so then you go ahead and apply
your wig usually they have clips inside
to grasp on to your natural hair or the
wig cap just to make sure it's super
secure and then they also have little
clasps on the back that you can tighten
it just to make sure it's super good so
you can whip your hair all around and
then also with lace front most of the
time they come with wig tape or you can
get glue so you can glue it down because
on the sides it tends to come up a
little bit so if you glue it down like I
said it depends on how long you're
planning on wearing it it'll make it
super secure and look super natural I'm
pretty sure in the show it takes them
like 2 hours to put on her wig every
time she shoots so props to her but it
looks so good so if you're investing
time into it and you want to look like
super legit do that so I really hope
this was helpful and you got some new
ideas I think she's awesome in fact I
think I actually might be here for
Halloween I'm not sure yet so anyways I
hope you guys enjoyed it don't forget to
check out my Harley Quinn a costume
tutorial that I did before this and I
will see you guys next week for another
Halloween video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
