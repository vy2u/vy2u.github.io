channel today's video is going to be how
I style my short hair short hair
hairstyles I never know what I end up
calling these videos but basically I
ever since I cut my hair I got a lot of
requests for you guys from you guys I
can't speak today I took me a second to
figure out how to style it but I have a
few ways that I absolutely love to
either put my hair up style my hair wear
my hair I show you all of my essentials
and that's pretty much it I didn't
sugarcoat it - these are the ones ours
that are like my goat cheese now when I
cut my hair I kind of just did it on a
whim because I wanted to but I
definitely didn't think about afterwards
my favorite hair style which was wavy
hair how that was going to affect the
way that I curl it I have actual battle
scars it's a bad bad burn that I got
from first trying to cut my hair because
my layers on the bottom like this all
comes out so easily as you can see this
is kind of a hassle but it's the best
way that I found to like hold volume but
I basically start with this wand and
section my hair up and then curl these
like bottom layers and then I move on to
this one for the rest
shake it out do that whole thing but
that was only when I first cut my hair
and I was like whoa but now there's
grown out a little bit more I can just
stick to using one I actually don't even
you can use this I've recently switched
over to using the beach waver and it's
really handy I used it when I had long
hair but I actually weirdly like it more
now that I have short hair so yeah
whatever works they're all the same but
I thought I would just throw out that
little tidbits of information in case
you have it's super short hair this
trick might help you like I said I feel
like you guys have seen me do this to my
hair so many times but my favorite way
and how I've done it for so long is I
basically just section it I've been
doing probably three sections I do this
I do another layer here and then I do
that top bit and kind of decide where I
want my perk to go for that day
so now that it's all sectioned up I have
my pieces that I'm gonna curl here
halfway beach waiver and I'm just gonna
go ahead and wrap it around the barrel
normally I would tell you go to go every
other direction but lately I've just
been going the same away from my face
and it works because I have so many
different layers in my hair also a tips
that I never really did when I had long
hair because I just didn't I didn't
really care as much but when you have
shorter hair I really want my curls to
last a lot longer so I do tend to like
hold it up normally I would just
probably let it go but just like let it
cool for a second because that way it
kind of holds the curl a little bit
better I'm going to usually just take
some hairspray and I usually go on each
layer
it looks a little strange it's a really
PC and weird but just don't touch it if
it feels hot like I usually finish up my
makeup or whatever I'm doing in the
morning but you really want to let the
curls set and cool all right now that
the curls are pretty much set what I
like to do is go in with some sort of a
texturizing spray all right and I'll
either leave it down the middle or
sometimes like I just kind of throw it
over like this if I want to make it a
little bit Messier or I'll like tuck it
behind my ear it's definitely sad but
that's how I keep it kind of like messy
and textured
so lately I've been super into throwback
central scrunchies these are really
great but I also especially with shorter
hair I like the really tiny tiny
elastics which I'll show you in another
hairstyle for this one I'm going to use
the scrunchie to kind of show you how to
make it really really easy this takes
like two seconds so all I do is I
basically take these front sections and
I kind of have it secured right here
like a little pony and basically all I'm
gonna do is take my scrunchie and go
like this and that's it so easy it takes
like two seconds it's a perfect way to
get the hair out of your face especially
if it's a little bit flat from the day
before in case it's like second day hair
it kind of just lifts the root here
pulls it back so it's not like hanging
there and I think it's really cute
this next one is a good way to do a half
up half down I feel like those top knots
are always like a huge thing but with
short hair it's definitely harder to do
so because a lot of the bottom pieces
fall out so my way of doing that if half
of my hair goes up half of it stays down
so all I do is I basically gather the
top bit of my hair and with the head and
I'm using the texture that's already in
it from the curls I don't want to use a
comb because I don't want it to look
super sleek I want it to be still kind
of messy to match all the other curls I
have going down down here are at least
waves now that I have this up and pulled
back I'm going to take a really small
elastic you know what they are they're
really tiny rubber bands especially if
you have short hair you know what they
are and I'm basically just going to make
a ponytail with the hair that I've
gathered okay so now with the pony that
you have all I'm going to do is
basically kind of twist it together to
kind of group the hair I'm going to spin
it around and make a knot like actually
like you're tying a knot but don't pull
all of this through leave it here and
then hold it and get some bobby pins
all right now this uh button is up I'm
gonna go ahead and just take the rest of
my hair and just kind of shake it out
you can also go in back with a curling
iron and just kind of like fix any
pieces or make them a little bit more
defined but I absolutely love this one
this is a great way to kind of pull it
back without having to do the whole
shebang and having to pin a bunch in
those back pieces I also think this is
great if you want to show off any really
cool earrings I love wearing hoop
earrings with this look I just think it
looks really really cute next style I
love to do is sleek and straight which
is what it is right now so I have my
hair sectioned off how I would probably
straighten my hair I'm not pretty
precise as this stuff as you can
probably tell but basically I just
straighten my hair this is pretty
self-explanatory but I wanted to include
it in the video because it's like one of
my favorite ways to wear my new short
hair
I would probably perfect it a little bit
more if I was going for super sleek and
straight and like down the middle but
for day today I usually just like
quickly straighten my hair and then I
put it on this side obviously and I took
this bit behind my ear I don't know what
it is but I just like it a lot with
short hair I never used to do like a
tuck behind my ear with long hair just a
short hair I just think it looks really
really cute and I can show off my
earrings if I want to you know the whole
thing with straight hair one of my
favorite ways to get it out of my face
is too slick it's back again this is
another one of those hairstyles that I
never used to do what when I had long
hair but for some reason I just liked it
with short hair plus it's a great
alternative dips to get the hair out of
the face I go to the gym I'll do that to
make it a little bit easier so it's very
easy one of those that might not even be
worth it tutorial but sometimes I'll
part it down the center or if it's today
I'll keep it on the side I do both and I
basically have my little tiny elastic
but you're gonna need I gather all of
this this also helps if you have a brush
so I'm going to grab one and then just
start flicking this back
by just takin elastic and I basically
create a ponytail
sometimes I'll leave a ponytail just
like this or I will secure it into like
a bun like so I think this is great if
you have to look a little bit more
polished I definitely think it's a
little bit more sleek and good for those
type of events but also if you just want
to get your hair on your face especially
for this upcoming summer season it's
gonna get hot here in New York this is
going to be one of my favorite hair
stuff but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys liked it and found
it helpful if you did please give it a
thumbs up and let me know which
hairstyle was your favorite is comment
below and yeah I will see you guys in my
next video
