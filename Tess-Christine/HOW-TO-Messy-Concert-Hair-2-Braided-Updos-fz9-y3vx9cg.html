be a hair tutorial if you guys have been
following me on social media you know
that I've been going kind of summer
concert crazy and I've gone to a few
concerts this year and particularly on
Instagram I've gotten a lot of requests
to show you guys how I do my hair at
some of them so I teamed up with Garnier
Fructis to show you guys three different
hairstyles that I think are perfect for
concerts you can dance around in them
clearly I like to dance at concerts but
also I think these are perfect for
anything school especially so if you are
interested then just keep on watching to
begin I'm going to prep my hair with the
Garnier Fructis root amp root lifting
spray mousse I'm applying this into damp
hair and I'm spraying it in layer by
layer spraying it directly into the
roots I really like this stuff it
basically just adds a lot of volume and
helps enhance my natural like wavy messy
texture so I've let it air dry and I
also blow-dry it both work really well I
just like that it enhances my natural
curl which I use to my advantage
when it comes to actually styling my
hair so the next thing I do is I take a
curling wand and I basically curl random
sections of my hair I don't curl it full
I just curl certain pieces just to
perfect my natural wavy texture and a
tip for you if you want it to look messy
like a natural hair would is to curl
your hair every other direction with
every piece it just gives it that messy
look and the curls wants to stick
together and look super uniform once my
hair is curl to my liking I'm just
giving it a spray with some volumizing
anti-humidity hairspray by Gagne
Fruities and that basically just holds
it in and you can totally leave it like
this I wore my hair pretty much
identical to this for the One Direction
concert and I loved it however if you
want to jazz it up a bit I'm going to
show you guys how to get this crown
braid looking thing and I wore something
very similar to the iHeartRadio concert
so the first thing you're going to do is
take a top section of your hair randomly
you really don't have to I like leaving
front pieces of my hair out though so
keep that in mind if you want it to look
similar and you're basically just going
to braid it and instead of adding little
ponies at the end I just sprayed it with
some hairspray but you can totally be
more secure and add little tiny elastics
but basically all you're going to do is
basically take random sections of hair
and braid
I did three you can do as many as you
want I kept them close to the front of
my hair and a little bit underneath so
don't do all the top layer do some
underneath because it's going to help
when you gather it back so once you have
those three done you're going to do the
same thing on the other side now once
you have all your braids done you're
going to start gathering them back and
pinning them in the back of your head so
I started with the top one first then I
went to the second layer one pin them on
top of each other and this seems really
confusing but your hands are going to be
your best friends because you're really
going to feel for where to put the braid
your base is going to keep layering them
on top of each other and then the little
ends that poke out your hair will
basically have enough to hide them
underneath each other and you can always
go bobby pin crazy and pin as much as
you want but like you see I can just
layer them over each other and it looks
super cool another technique is to
basically weave them within each other
so it kind of gives it a little bit more
of a tight hold and it helps it look
even cooler so that's basically what I'm
doing and you just repeat this until all
the braids are done like I said it kind
of looks confusing but it's trial and
error use a mirror to look behind you if
you need to or have a friend help you
before the concert this is totally
something you can do together but this
is this does look a lot harder than it
actually is
actually super easy so like you can see
here I'm just weaving it in and out of
the braids that are already placed and
then pinning it to secure it
and lastly of course your hairspray is
gonna be your best friend just to make
sure everything stays I know I whip my
hair around and it stayed for sure but
always to be safe hairspray is awesome I
just love this hairstyle though it's a
really cool unique twist to a half up
half down hairstyle moving on to the
braided updo style I'm going to start by
using the Garnier Fructis sleek and
shine sleek primer basically I'm just
spraying this all over my head it's kind
of like a primer before you blow-dry
your hair this is perfect for those of
you who like to blow dry or need to it
just adds like a nice shine and it helps
eliminate the frizz after you're done
so for this hairstyle you're going to
begin by parting your hair down the
middle and separating your hair into two
even sections and the first side of your
head whichever you prefer
you're going to fishtail so what I like
to do is put a ponytail at the top of it
very loosely it just helps me control
the fishtail braid so it doesn't kind of
fly all over everything if you know
anything about fishtailing it needs to
kind of stay super tight for it to look
really good so all you do for this is
you're basically separating your hair
into two even sections and then you're
taking one section from the outside
strand of hair and bringing that inwards
and you're basically going to repeat
that process on both sides until you get
to the bottom this looks kind of
complicated but it's very easy it's just
a little bit time-consuming than a
normal braid
so now I'm just securing that braid with
an elastic just to keep it out of the
way while I braid the other side so you
could go ahead and fishtail this other
side of your head but I thought I would
just do a regular braid and has switch
it up by having two different braids I
thought that would look really cool on
the top of your head so this is just a
standard braid I feel like a lot of
people know how to do this and then once
that's done you're just going to go
ahead and separate the braids by pulling
up the sides and I decided to pin the
fishtail braid first so that I wanted
that closest to the front of my face and
then of course securing it with a bobby
pin and then on the other side I'm just
flattening it out by pulling on the
sides of that braid laying it over the
top to cover the bobby pin on the other
side and then I'm going to go ahead and
secure that with a bobby pin as well
after messing it up a little bit by
pulling out strands by my face and back
of my neck I'm gonna be taking the
Garnier through teased full control
anti-humidity hairspray and spraying
those braids and the rest of my head to
make sure everything is locked in place
and wallah it's done I think this one is
perfect for if it's really hot out or
when you just want to get your hair out
of your face the best part about it is
super quick and easy but that is it for
my video today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and found it helpful be sure

concert you would love to go to anyways
