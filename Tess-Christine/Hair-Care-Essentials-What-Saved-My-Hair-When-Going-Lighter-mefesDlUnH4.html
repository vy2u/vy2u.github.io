hair video meaning it's going to be a
haircare essentials video of what saved
my hair type of video because I've been
getting so many requests ever since I
started lightening my hair a lot of you
guys were asking me to make a video on
how I'm doing it and the products that
I'm using to keep it healthy so
basically that's what this video is
going to be about today okay so starting
out a lot of you guys were asking me how
I got my hair lighter and like what
products I was using to get it lighter
and simple as this I went to the salon a
lot of you guys kind of assumed that I
was doing it myself which I totally
understand why because I made a video a
while back of me dying my own hair and I
used to dye my hair myself when I was
just like dyeing it darker because it
was so much easier but I had so much
color on my hair that when I thought
about going lighter I was like should I
do this myself and then I was like no
don't risk it you don't want to put your
hair to fall out so I was just like I'm
gonna go to a professional and have her
figure this out later once I found out
that there's all these toning things you
have to do with previous hair color and
stripping and it's just a mess so I'm so
glad I didn't do it myself so if you
want to go lighter and you have a bunch
of hair color on your hair I would
definitely recommend going to a
professional if you can and just getting
some advice or just like a consultation
because it'll really really save you
from having a big mess up with your hair
and it just drying out completely and
just being a mess so as for products go
before I really started like putting a
lot of color and heat on my hair I was
kind of just casual with my haircare and
it do anything special but it wasn't
till probably like after my first or
second salon visit of lightening my hair
that I started noticing my hair probably
from my chin down getting really really
bad between lightening it and doing a
bunch of tutorials for like obviously
you guys my hair was just like not
having it it was like sorry Tess like ah
this isn't working so basically I had to
take some steps to get my hair healthier
because I just knew it was just awful so
I was like okay I need to do something
so I went to Ulta because doesn't
everybody go to also when they need
anything because they have so much stuff
there I was like okay I'm gonna
oh there they have a huge selection of
hair products I'm like I definitely can
find something that will help my hair so
I went there and I picked up a bunch of
products like probably a good amount of
months ago and I've been using them ever
since and they really made a difference
now I'm not saying my hair is perfectly
healthy right now not saying that at all
it's definitely not but as of probably
like four months ago it's significantly
better like significantly so I really
really think these products are helping
the first thing I'm going to start with
the shampoo because that's kind of like
the first thing you do when you shower
right I just got a basic color care
shampoo I wanted something since I was
coloring my hair I wanted a shampoo that
catered to colored hair and it wouldn't
strip the color that I had or you know
tone it a certain way basically this is
just the matrix biological last shampoo
simple as that I mean I don't really
know how to describe shampoos besides
that it doesn't fade the appearance of
my color at all it smells amazing this
is probably my favorite thing about the
shampoo because there's so many color
shampoo is out there that I mean you
could really pick any one but this one
just smells amazing and I just think
it's like the best for my hair so then
of course I had to buy the matching
conditioner so that's exactly what I did
again it's the matrix biologic color
care conditioner these go great together
I love them this is like my basic
everyday conditioner that i'll use well
not everyday because i don't shampoo or
wash my hair everyday
i'm like every other day i do so this
next shampoo i actually have a reason
for getting a different shampoo it's not
just different scents and different
feelings of the shampoo this one
actually makes sense this is the john
frieda sheer blonde color Inu tone
correcting shampoo that that's a
mouthful you're not naturally lighter or
naturally blonde you know that sometimes
you can get a brassy tint to your color
it's just what happens over time and to
avoid that like prolong the color of
your hair
sometimes you need a toning shampoo or
obviously like a color safe shampoo so
as reading reviews on Ulta and everyone
was saying some good things about this
the only drawback to this is that it
dries your hair out which is kind of the
opposite of what I want but it does help
with the
brassiness in my color but the one thing
I recommend that if you use this don't
use it every time you shampoo use it
like once a week or twice a week but
then follow up with like a deep
conditioner afterwards and it should
help your hair a lot at least it does
for me
so speaking of deep conditioners which I
was just talking about with that shampoo
I have two deep conditioners that I
really really like the first one you
guys have seen me talk about this so
much and it is the macadamia natural oil
deep repair mask this is like all over
YouTube but I promise this is one of
those products that are actually worth
the hype I mean you see it all over and
you're like really really but I promise
this actually works I've been using this
for years
it really works more so like after the
shower like it works so good to like
detangle all your tangles but then when
you're out of the shower and you're like
styling your hair you can really notice
a different in your ends they just feel
smoother and silkier I just really
noticed a difference the most with this
one I found another one that I really
enjoy as well it's the living proof
brand and it's the restore mask
treatment it's one of those things you
you use once or twice a week and you
gradually start noticing a difference so
if you've tried the macademia one and
you don't really like that try this one
and this one might give you better
results than the other one did if you
didn't like that one for some reason so
yes this one's awesome as well okay so
now moving on to when I actually get out
of the shower and products I use the
first thing I like to use is like a
leave-in conditioner so the one that I
really enjoy is the macadamia nourishing
leave-in cream I really like this brand
a lot this is where I really notice the
difference this stuff is awesome it kind
of doubles as like a styling cream as
well so you can use it even like on you
know dry hair or wet hair it doesn't
leave your hair greasy at all but like I
said I focus it my mainly on the ends
and I love it it works so great and it
smells so good too
the next thing that I really love to use
is some sort of oil now a while back you
probably saw me tweet about how I
discovered coconut oil and love it it
works wonders on your hair the coconut
oil that I have is like huge it's like
massive so it's not really convenient to
travel with and since you know I live in
my college town too still I'll like go
home to my parents it's just
I'd rather have something small and a
little bit more compact and then use the
coconut oil more as like a deep mask but
what I found actually at Ulta is by Marc
Anthony and it's hydrating coconut oil
plus shea butter what its recommendation
that it says on the bottle is that if
you have a really really dry and damaged
hair to do one to two pumps um and then
spread it through your hair at night so
you go to bed with this on and it's
supposed to really really help
definitely notice the difference I love
doing that at night because if I use all
of this like nourishing cream like in
the morning I don't want to like load
products onto my hair because I don't
really think that's doing anything so I
like to space it out a little bit so
this at night works awesome I just put
it on my dry hair or if I shower at
night I'll put it on my wet hair and I
just go to bed and I definitely am
starting to notice the difference with
it it's also helping with growth too so
if you're looking for ideas to grow your
hair like a little bit thicker and
longer coconut oil has like proven to me
like awesome for that so now moving on
to a products that I use when I'm
styling my hair so the first thing that
I'm really loving is this it's by the
brand it's by the altar brand and it is
volume and strength volume and fusion
primer
um this stuff is awesome it's like
goddess little spray nozzle it looks
like it'd be a cream but it's actually
spray I'll show you
boom basically just spray this into your
roots is what I kind of do it for and if
I like blow-dry my hair or I'm styling
it it helps with volume because if one
thing that I've noticed ever since I've
lightened my hair my hair has gotten a
little bit thinner which sucks but about
using like volume helpers is he makes a
huge difference okay so this next
product is pretty self-explanatory and
that's a heat spray I thought it would
include it because I think it's really
really important for your hair whether
it's colored or not if you're using heat
on your hair you need a heat protectant
so the one I love using is the Tresemme
heat tamer spray it's super inexpensive
and it's comparable to all the other
high-end heap sprays I think it works
just as well and it's definitely
something you should include in your
haircare routine the last thing is a
heat tool and it's this one and it is
just a one-inch curling iron it's
definitely my favorite I love it so much
not particularly because of the brand I
don't know
care about the brand I've used Conair
before but this is hot tools what I like
about it is the barrel size you can use
it for any type of hair styling you want
whether you want ways loose waves tight
curls it's just perfect for an everyday
curling iron and if you're one of those
people that doesn't have one I would
recommend this size because it works
great but that's the video for today I
really hope you guys found it helpful
and child these products if you're
suffering from super dry and damaged
hair or you want to lighten your hair I
really hope this video was helpful
helpful for you guys thank you guys so
much for watching this video stay tuned
for my next video which is going to be a
get the look nina dobrev video and yeah
I will talk to you guys next time
