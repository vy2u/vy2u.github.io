is going to be a hair tutorial on this
hair and I got so many requests because
I had my hair like this in my Vampire
Diaries
Katherine inspired fashion or whatever
and so I got a lot of comments on my
hair because I guess I've never really
showed you how to do hair like this
before and I was thinking about it
because I have so many curling
hairstyles hair tutorials so I was like
do I have one already and then I was
like no I don't I don't have like super
curly hair tutorials so I figured I
might as well show up for you guys plus
it was super highly requested so of
course I was gonna do it I really really
hope you guys enjoy this hair tutorial
let me know what you think in the
comments below I hope you all are having
a wonderful day and until my next video
bye guys okay so the first curling iron
we're using is the Conair one-inch
curling iron you can get this pretty
much anywhere and then the second
curling iron racing is the infamous
connor infinity curling iron so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna section off my hair like usual
obviously this is optional depending on
your hair thickness all that jazz so
what I'm doing with the curling iron is
I am using the clamp and I am starting
at the top and I'm stopping halfway down
and then rolling and then loosening the
clamp as I work my way down the hair
until it gets to the end I just think
this curls your hair higher up on the
hair piece that you have instead of just
at the end so I'm going to repeat that
process that basic process all over my
head
also I just want to know when you're
curling the other side of your hair your
head so this is my right side of my head
if I'm facing like to the camera make
sure you curl your hair away from your
face this makes a huge difference with
the look because if you're curling the
curls in towards your face it's not
going to give you the same look and the
both sides of your head is not gonna
match so make sure you note that when
you are curling
okay and at the top of the piece of the
hair that doesn't curl all the way like
the bottom half we're just going to use
the Connie or infinity one and just curl
that top part this will just make sure
the curls go
so curls all the way up the section of
your head also I'm currently straight
pieces you see and I like to curl those
random sections of my hair just to
prevent the curls from sticking together
and creating that wave look throughout
the day this will keep your curls a
little bit more PC and a little bit more
tighter which is what you want because
the Conor infinity wand creates tighter
curls than the Conor one inch so that'll
definitely help with keeping the curls
separated
alright next we're just going to tease
the crown of our head to give it some
volume and again you don't have to worry
about messing the messin up the curls
you already created because you can
always go back in with that Connor
infinity wand and fix any pieces that
may have straightened out next you're
just gonna finish with hairspray and
again that hairspray that I've been
using is a shape maker hairspray so it's
kind of like a spray in play so you can
kind of be generous with that because
it's not going to make your hair really
really crusty or anything
alright next just finish with your
favorite hairspray and the look is
finished I really hope you guys liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
