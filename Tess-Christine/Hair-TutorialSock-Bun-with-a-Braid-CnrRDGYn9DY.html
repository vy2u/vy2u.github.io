to be a sock bun hair tutorial it's a
very easy hairstyle and I think you guys
will all really enjoy it I've added a
fun little braid around the bun to add a
fun little twist to the hairstyle let's
get started this is a great second day
hair style so that's what I'm starting
out with second day hair and I'm just
going to gather that into a ponytail on
the mid upper part of the back of my
head now taking a sock I would recommend
one that is your same hair color but
since I could only find this bright
polka-dotted one this one will have to
do and all you're going to do is cut the
toe off of it you're just going to cut a
little bit of the toe off of it and as
you can see i am using a footy sock so
it's not a super long sock but it really
doesn't matter and this is actually
preferred if you have shorter hair so
now i'm just going to begin rolling it
around itself until you get this kind of
like doughnut shaped little buns now
taking your little doughnut sock you're
going to slip that right over your
ponytail and run your hair through it
now take that section and pull it all
the way to the end strands of your hair
once you get to the very end all you're
going to do is take the ends and wrap
that around the sock and you're just
going to repeat this process by wrapping
it underneath the sock and you're going
to keep pulling it now as you do this
make sure your hair goes around the
entire band of sock and if you have
shorter head this is going to be really
important that you have a sock the same
color but since my hair is a little bit
longer I know for sure that it will
cover all the stock so I won't have to
worry about it sticking out anywhere so
you're going to keep rolling it until
you get to the base of your ponytail
now once you finish with that you're
going to get this nice big donut bun and
I really like using the stock because
surprisingly it feels very tight onto
your head now if you need to you can
take some bobby pins and secure it into
your hair a little bit more and if you
have longer hair this might be a
necessity and if you have layers because
they your layers might stick out and
your bun might be a little bit big so if
you want to tame it down a little bit
you can go ahead and use bobby pins so
now once you're finished with that that
is simply it for the soft bun tutorial
it's very very easy but I want to add a
little bit of a twist to it since these
are all over YouTube so with my own
personal twist to it i'm just going to
take two sections of hair extensions now
these are just the like one clip hair
extensions that you can get and i'm just
going to secure that into the top or
bottom it doesn't really matter of my
bun because we're going to be covering
it up anyways so I'm taking this first
section and I'm securing that down and
then I'm also going to take another
strand of hair extension and I'm going
to place it right underneath or right
next to the clip that I just placed
now gather both of your strands of extra
hair together and you're just going to
split it into three and all you're going
to do is simply braid it all the way
down the hair piece once you're finished
braiding your hair piece all you're
going to do is simply wrap it around the
bun don't do it too tight keep it loose
because you don't want to like suffocate
the bun and make it look really awkward
so I'm keeping it very light and not too
tight on to my bun and all I'm going to
do is secure that back with a bobby pin
and that is it for this hair tutorial I
really hope you guys liked it thank you
all so much for watching and I'll see
you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
