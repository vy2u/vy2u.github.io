be a haul video and this stuff has been
kind of stuff that I've been
accumulating since my birthday which has
been like three weeks ago I want to say
now
it was June 24th anyways thank you guys
so much who have said happy birthday to
me and all my different social
networking sites oh so sweet of you
thank you guys so much
I had a great birthday but since my
birthday I've been using my birthday
money and things like that to buy
clothing duh so I wanted to share a haul
with you guys most of the stuff I bought
online in fact I think all of it I
bought online so if you guys are
interested at all on the stuff I show
you it should still be available online
to purchase if you're interested so yeah
I guess I'm just gonna get started the
first thing I bought which I wanted for
a really long time because I broke my
old aviator sunglasses
I broke the side of um so they didn't
really fit my head anymore so I was in
desperate need of new sunglasses and I
just really like the brave and aviators
they just like fit my face really well
so I want to come something kind of
different and fun so these are like I
pretty sure these are like the newest
aviators
they're super mirrored so I don't mean
to like blind you guys if I am but
they're basically like this green I
think they're called green on the site
but they kind of look like teal and
green and like different ways you angle
it I love them so this is definitely a
splurge item for me because these men
glasses are so pricey and it's funny
sorry these are really good quality and
I just have to splurge on it and it's my
birthday so I had to buy something like
super nice right the next item is from
TJ Maxx and this actually went into the
store but I was looking for a pair of
sandals that I could wear that are kind
of like a little bit dressier and not
whack because I always have black
sandals but I never have like brown or
like white or something that would go
with something other than black if that
makes sense so I bought these they were
super inexpensive but I like them
because they have like this what is this
like a rose gold like bar thing I'm down
the white strip which i think is cool I
think it just adds like a not a fancier
touch but just a little bit because
I usually wear my like black old navy
foot flops that are just like rubber
like I wear those all the time but like
it's nice to have a pair of sandals that
are kind of dressier that don't look as
casual if that makes any sense
the next two things were from brandy
melville and I know brandy melville blah
but we don't have a store here so I
ordered it online well the first thing
because you guys know if you sound like
cropped up video that I'm like in love
with the circle skirts so these are just
perfect for the summer because they're
so easy like I just wear these with like
a plain top and I'm just like out the
door and it's perfect and it still looks
put together but like not super fancy
it's still casual I don't know I just
love this whole style thing going on for
the summer and it's basically like this
pale pink color like a blush color if I
want to get specific and it has little
white tiny polka dots on it and I love
it
the next thing from brandy melville but
I got was this shirt let's show you oh
it looks like this and I don't know I
thought it was super fun I'm like a big
like in the summer besides like skirts I
just embarr II like when it comes to
styling in the summer I wanted to be
very easy and just like effortless um
so this is super nice for like just
wearing with shorts like jean shorts um
I don't know I just think this stuff is
super cute and I like the design on it
and the whole the whole shebang I just
loved everything about it
the next thing from brandy melville that
I got was what I'm wearing on myself
right now it's a dress looks like this I
saw on the website I was like that'd be
perfect for summer because it's super
like lightweight and like right now it
is so hot in my room like
my room isn't like the way back of our
apartment so like the a/c doesn't get to
it very well but anyways it gets really
hot here in the summer surprisingly
Minnesota it's like cold every other
time except for this summer it's like
ridiculously hot so I needed something
that would be like you know just casual
and like flowy and airy I don't know I
just loved it so the next thing that I
purchased was from Lulu's and it's
another circle skirt I know I know I
know but they're just so easy and I like
wearing these out like when I go out
like where are out is not like super
Club --is-- it's like you can dress
however you want so I don't know I like
wearing this kind of stuff out in the
summer looks like this it's pink and
pink and tan and it has little designs
on it and I thought it was super cute
and like I said this whole style of like
the circle skirt thing is like my
absolute favorite right now so when I
saw it I was like oh this would be
perfect with like my white crop top that
I wear all the time
I don't have a lot of things this color
either so it's like perfect and I really
liked it the next few things that I
bought were from revolve clothing and
revolve clothing is kind of like a shot
bop or I don't know what other store I
can compare it to but basically it's
just like an online store that sells
like a bunch of different brands so I
really like that store when I'm like
looking for a variety although they do
sell kind of pricey things so on that
but the first thing I bought which was
in my Instagram picture and a lot of you
guys are asking me where it is from and
I answered you guys on Instagram but in
case you missed that this is what it
looks like it's white and has flowers on
the straps so cute I love it and it's
like a creamish white color I don't know
it's just really flowy and I wear it
with jean shorts and I just love it and
I'm pretty sure this is on the pricier
side which I'm kind of bummed out about
because this is kind of just like this
is kind of just like a plain tank top um
so it's like almost not worth it but I
just haven't seen anything like this
with the flowers on it so I had to
splurge a little bit on this one the
next thing that I purchased from revolve
clothing was a dress but it wasn't any
dress at least
me I don't have any dress like this it's
actually kind of like a shirt dress or
like a collared dress but what I liked
about it was the ombre and it goes into
like this ombre aqua blue green color it
is so pretty I love it the brand is mink
pink I believe yes
mink pink okay Saban the next clothing
item that I bought was from wild fox I
saw this and I was like oh this is
perfect for summer and it's like totally
my style because as you guys know I'm
such a flower girl like I just love
flower prints any type of flower prints
like they're my absolute favorite so
when I saw this I was like I have to get
it it's kind of like a crop top it is
more crop than usual but not like a
full-on crop top so you could wear this
with just like jean shorts because it
doesn't show off too much of your
midriff area but what I liked about this
I thought it was so cute it was like
cutesy which is like also kind of a
little bit weird for me because I do
like the whole boho feel like more of
like the boho floral is a little bit
more of my style but I thought this was
super fun and girly now the last thing I
got was also us on Instagram because I
took a mirror pic oh my gosh and you saw
my phone case and I got a new phone case
and I really liked it if I took the
phone case off you would see that my
whole back my phone is just smashed this
thing has been through something else I
swear it's like who dropped on the floor
so much and it's just so cracked so now
I need to keep it case on it and of
course then it's floral print I get it I
know I'm obsessed my boyfriend he like
revamp my phone and like bought these
mirror like covers for it like you take
off the actual phone like you have to
take your phone apart and put on this
like shiny thing I don't know it's super
cool but it matches this really well so
I was excited when I found this case
because this is really bright and flashy
and mirrored and it's crazy but I love
it I got it from Free People
I left that out and this you guys are
gonna like comment below like you're
nuts but it was a little bit pricey for
a phone case but this one's like pretty
heavy duty so I'm hoping it'll protect
my phone because even though it was more
of a pricy phone case hopefully it saves
my phone a few times
so I don't have to buy a whole new phone
right that makes sense
like I said if you were interested in
that at all and any of the stuff that I
purchased they all should be available
online still see how stay tuned for a
new video very soon for me promise and I
will talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
