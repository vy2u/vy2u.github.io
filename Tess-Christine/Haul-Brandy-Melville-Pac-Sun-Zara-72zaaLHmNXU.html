be a haul video I haven't done a haul
video in a really long time and I don't
know why because I do a lot of shopping
but I just never think to make haul
videos so some of you guys were tweeting
me when I went to LA and I said I went
shopping that you guys wanted me to do a
haul video because you haven't seen one
in a while so I figured why not short
disclaimer I am getting over a cold so
my voice sounds a little raspy and I
sound a little nasally and that's
because I've been having a cold this
whole week if you follow me on Twitter
you guys know that but so hopefully you
guys can bear with me through this video
I know I sound a little bit different
and that's why to start out I went to
pax on 1st the reason why in particular
I really like PacSun but the reason why
I went there is because I knew that the
Kendall + Kylie collection was coming
out and I wanted to see their clothing
line and see if I liked anything of it
and I found two pieces that I really
liked the first one is this and it's
basically like a cream blouse it's
really pretty it has lace detailing on
the front it has a cutout in the back
which i think is really fun because you
can wear Bandos with it and obviously
this is a summer top so I have to wait
to wear this but I do really like it and
I can't wait to wear it for spring and
summer
the second piece that I got from their
collection is this and I know it was
kind of ranting and raving about this
but it's definitely worth it what
they're saying it's a really really cool
jacket it's basically um it's pretty
thin I wouldn't say it's like a thick
jacket or anything but it's really cute
it's like this army green color it has
stud detailing here on the side it has a
patch and a few patches actually and
then another patch on this side I think
it's just a really fun cute top and it's
really easy to style too so you'll
probably see more of this in like my
spring fashion videos so that's
everything that I purchased pretty
recently from PacSun the next place is
Zara I purchased two different tops from
Zara the first one looks like this and
it's this maroon or Oxbow oxblood
colored shirt it's really really soft
and flowy which is why i like it because
i like sure it's a lot like this to wear
with either leggings or you know like
tighter jeans these are really cute and
you can dress these up and down a lot
and that's why I really like buying
shirts like this but what I especially
love about this shirt in particular is
the leather detail
on the collar and then the zipper in the
back so I thought that was really unique
and fun instead of just kind of like a
plain shirt that I would buy like this
this kind of adds like a different
detailing to it so I thought that was
really cute
the next thing is kind of so much of the
jacket I bought but this is more of an
in a shirt form
and it's that army green color again
it's got the collar with the buttons
down the front they have this kind of
detailing on both of the shoulders with
a skull stud which I think is unique too
so I liked that they're just like these
staple pieces but have unique touches to
them and that's why I like a lot of
Sarrus stuff because they do that a lot
with a lot of their clothing so I think
it's super cute and it's long enough to
where I can wear it with leggings so I
like that a lot because super
comfortable stuff like this is a
necessity in my wardrobe
the last place I went to is brandy
Melville and I don't have a brandy
melville around me at all but I've
always heard people like tweet about it
and talk about it and have it in their
halls or their fashion videos and I was
like what is this store everyone seems
to love it and you guys know me I'm kind
of like a staple wardrobe kind of girl
like I like to wear clothing that you
can wear multiple different ways and
they're kind of low-key they're not too
over-the-top
so when I walked into brandy melville it
was like heaven and I loved it and I
wish I had a store near me I went a
little shopping crazy and I got kind of
a lot of stuff so I guess I'll just go
through each piece for you guys the
first I'm wearing right now and it's
just this t-shirt with this skeleton
detailing on it but what I really liked
about it is that inside the skeleton
part of it it's got little flowers which
is so me because I like to edge up my
wardrobe with either of leather or studs
or like this but then keep it girly by
adding feminine pieces like for instance
flowers or colors leggings things like
that that make you kind of more feminine
so I really really like this shirt a lot
the next thing I got is another kind of
flowy collared shirt except it's
actually not collared it's like
button-up and this is like a gray color
and I should have had this button for
you guys but I don't but it rolls up on
each sleeve on the side and then you can
either tie it in the front or you can
just tuck it in to either
or shorts or whatever and I love this
shirt it's so cute and it's so comfy
like the material on it is so soft one
of those things that you can change up
every time so like you can wear it once
and make it look like a completely
different outfit from the next time you
wear it which is why I love pieces of
clothing like this
the next is another kind of staple piece
all this kind of stuff that I bought is
stuff that's kind of plain but I don't
know something you doesn't want to have
and it's this big kind of loose sweater
it's really really thin and it's soft
too which I really like I've worn this
so many times since I've gotten it I
just love it you can wear it well I can
wear it with leggings I know maybe if
you're a little bit taller you won't be
able to but I can wear this with
leggings or I can wear it with jeans I
can tuck it into high-waisted shorts
wear it with tights I just I love it I
love it you can change it up so many
different ways the next clothing piece
that I got is a skirt and it looks like
this and it's really really cute the
main color of it is Navy and then the
rest it has all these little flowers on
it that are kind of these like brown
oatmeal colors and like a light pale
pink and I think this is really pretty
it would go really well with that
sweater that I just showed you or you
could wear it with like even the blouse
or like the chiffon grey skirt or shirt
that I showed you guys before so this is
super cute I'm so excited to wear this
in the summer like I'm buying so many
clothes that are for the summer or like
spring season that I just need it to get
here and the snow needs to go away so I
can wear all this cute stuff I also
really like that it has buttons going
down the front I just thought it was a
nice detail and I thought it was super
cute now the last thing that I purchased
from brandy melville which I was super
excited about because I wanted something
like this for awhile and I couldn't find
anything around me that I really liked
but I saw it and I loved it and it's a
backpack and it's one of these cute
leather backpacks I don't know I've just
seen these around and I haven't found
one that I really liked until now and I
really liked this one and has all these
really pretty floral detail like that's
like my thing I love florals so
springtime is really fun for me because
like that's my favorite type of pattern
for anything is like these big floral
type patterns so I really really like
this backpack a lot has a lot of room in
it I'm not gonna use it for school or
anything
but like summer beach stuff for sure
this so yes that is everything that I
purchased over the past few couple of
months I hope you guys liked all of the
stuff that I bought I'm pretty sure you
can buy everything still at either of
those stores they should still be
available I'm not 100% positive on that
but I'm pretty sure that they are so if
you liked and you have it definitely go
check it out so once it starts warming
up and the snow is all gone I'll
definitely start filming with those
clothing pieces so you guys can see how
I style them all that fun stuff so again
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will see you guys next time
bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
