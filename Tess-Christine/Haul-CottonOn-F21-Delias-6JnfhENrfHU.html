Alex if you follow me on my lot Channel
you've seen plenty of her but today
we're gonna film a haul because as you
guys know well by the time this is up I
will have been in Florida but right now
we're in Florida filming this and today
we went shopping we got our shopping
done right away off the bat so we went
to three different stores I think we
didn't get a crazy amount of stuff but
stuff enough to make the haul so I'm
gonna show what I got at a store and
then what she got and all that stuff so
yeah we'll just get started so the first
store we went to was called cotton on
and I'm pretty sure that's an Australian
store but yes it is an Australian story
but they had one there and so we really
wanted to go check it out and what I got
there was high-waisted shorts and they
look like this and they're cuffed at the
bottom and it's a very dark wash Jean
and it has three buttons on the top
they're basic just high-waisted shorts I
mean nothing too exciting about them and
they were 29.95 and then I got this
headband it looks like this and it's
like knotted kind of at the top of it
and then it's like elastic here and the
pattern is I don't even know how to
describe this pattern and do you know
how to describe this pattern no it's
kind of like tribally it's got a bunch
of different colors and it has kind of
like a tinsel running through it I don't
know I thought it was really pretty and
this one was 595 so yeah that's all I
got it cotton on now Alex's turn okay
let's see I'll bring out the colorful
shirt um I got these they're super super
soft and they're like super baggy
but is this a cool red color it's really
thought it's like super soft I got to
420 I'm riding the black horn obviously
you guys know what the color black is so
I'm not gonna show it but yeah yeah so
that's what we got a cotton on it and
then we went to forever 21 of course and
what I got were two shirts oh and the
necklace yes Alex picked out one of them
I'll show you the one Alex picked out
first it's a coral color it's a really
bright coral color it almost has like is
you know it's not in neon but it's
really bright which I thought is perfect
for spring since that's in looks like
this and it has white polka dots on it
and then the front has like a tie bow
and it's like a chiffon material so it's
really lightweight and really comfy and
I like it a lot and it's not um like a
cropped one it's actually pretty long
but I'll probably tuck it into shorts so
yeah that I got for 1580 so the next
shirt I got was this one and it's black
and white let's see it's not even
buttoned but anyways it looks like this
it has a peter pan collar on the front
and then it has these black polka dots
but they're they look like scribbled
polka dots like somebody took like a pen
or like I don't know they here I'll try
to show you guys but they're like
scribbled on there and then like I said
it has a black Peter Pan color and then
the back it buttons like here so there's
like a little hole so yeah I thought
that was really cute and it's really
lightweight as well and that was 1780
and then the last thing I got was an
accessory and it was jewelry and it was
a necklace and it looks like this and
basically I don't really know how to
describe this it's got all these copper
chains and then the little beads on the
front are this grey a sparkly color it's
really cool I like it a lot actually
it's not great it's more like taupe yeah
and they're like
glittery yeah it's like a taupe glittery
color it's really really pretty I don't
know if it's gonna show up very well on
camera but yeah I like it a lot so yeah
and this was 880 so my biggest buy at
forever 21 was this black pleated skirt
it's backwards but it's this black
pleated skirt and in the front of it if
you can tell it's like a high-low skirt
yeah it's like low in the front or high
in the front and low in the back and
then it's also like see-through so it's
got like a like a slip underneath it and
this was 1980 it's really cool it's like
the pleated material where the fabric
kind of look it looks like wrinkled if
you don't know what pleated means that's
cool
and then I got this cool about just I
got it because I really like the colors
but it's like purple like orange and the
red and this was um 580 and then lastly
I got some jewelry um these are some
earrings I don't know it has like oh you
can just see like it has like a like a
flower and a little rhinestone yeah and
these are actually pretty cheap these
are 380 and then my last set or just
these um cool gold flower ones and they
come with two pairs of white steps studs
yeah these aren't only 280 so yeah yeah
okay so then the last door we went to
was Delius and there I got two shirts it
was to buy one get one 50% off so the
first shirt shout out to all of my
England followers because I bought a
shirt and that has a British flag on it
like a loose crop top shirt and I really
liked it because the flag is kind of
like metallicky and then it has studs
which I thought was really cool I liked
this shirt a lot and like I said I got
it by one 50% off so I don't know which
one she took first I think this one so
this one was twenty four fifty and then
I got this one for 50% off and this one
was all bits inside out it looks like
this and this is like a super crop top
shirt it's um it has florals on it and
it has this lace detailing it's roughly
and I think of this would look really
cute with the high-waisted shorts I just
bought or like a pencil skirt and like I
said this one I was 50% off so I got it
it was nineteen fifty originally but I
got it for ten dollars so yeah that's
all I got I only got one thing in
Julia's but cool ways ivory colored tank
top and I got it to kind of go with like
this skirt I don't know it looks kind of
like washed out but um I got it to go
with that black skirt that I just got I
just showed you guys and this was um
actually on sale for 1499 but I think it
was originally on sale from 1950 yeah
somewhere around there yeah this one's
from Delia's - that is everything that
we bought while shopping in Florida by
