is going to be a haul kind of a
collective haul because I didn't get
this all at once some stuff I did but
not all of it like you guys requested
from my last haul you wanted me to
actually show you the clothes on so I am
going to do that I'll insert a picture
um after each item that I haul so you'll
be able to see what it looks like on
because I feel like like I said in my
last view that that will give you a
better idea of what it looks like
right so the first store I went to was
forever 21 and usually when I go there I
go a little bit crazy and I purchase or
I find a ton of stuff that I like and so
I kind of controlled myself this time
and I only purchased three things the
first shirt as soon as I walked in and I
saw this and I was like oh my goodness I
have to get this because I've been super
into Fringe lately I don't know I just
think it's really cool and I like the
way it looks on shirt so I found this
and it's basically just a plain grey
scoop neck t-shirt but what what makes
it really unique is the fringe in the
front and I absolutely loved it and not
only did I like the fringe but what I
liked about the fringe is that it went
from like black to this blue color which
i think is so pretty and I absolutely
love this shirt I'm so excited to wear
this and how much it was it was 1780 so
I mean it's normal pricing for forever
21 so it wasn't that bad and I really
liked it so I'll show you what that
looks like on right now
all right so then the next thing from
forever21 that I got was a tank top like
shirt kind of it's like a tank top um
it's I'll just show you what it looks
like so I don't sound stupid explaining
it but this is what it looks like it's
basically like a collared tank top shirt
collared sleeveless shirt there we go
collared sleeveless shirt and it's
floral and I don't have anything like
this so I saw it and I was kind of like
that's interesting and then I tried it
on and I actually really liked it so I'm
really excited about this because the
color is kind of like a minty green and
then the flowers are really unique on it
too so I really really liked that and I
don't really have anything collared and
like chiffon and one you know what I'm
saying so I thought this was really
really cute and it was 1980
the next thing I got from forever 21 was
a little bit different kind of style
from the last two it's a little bit more
fancy and I've always wanted a little
red dress and I know that sounds weird
because it's usually a little black
dress but I never I don't have a red
dress and so I really wanted kind of a
sleek sexy broad dress that I haven't
had before so I found this one and I
honestly like had to get it it was like
perfect but it's a sweetheart top and
it's strapless and I really really liked
that and it's fairly long too which I
really really liked about it it zips up
in the back and what I absolutely loved
about this dress was the material and I
don't know if it's gonna show up on
camera but it's kind of like this like
waffle weave kind of thing material and
it's very thick it's like a thick
material which I really like because
some dresses like this can be very thin
and that stretchy material which I don't
always feel comfortable in because I
think that they're just very thin and I
always kind of I feel like make sure
everything is in place you know what I'm
saying so that's why I really really
liked this one and this one I believe
was $22 2280 something like that I took
the price tag off of it already but
that's how much it was it's fairly
inexpensive and it's so cute and I'm
really really excited about this one too
so I'll show you what that looks like
and then the next story went to was hmm
and hmm is like one of my favorite
stores and I can always find something
to buy in there and it's a little bit
more pricey than for over 21 so I have
to kind of watch myself with that too as
well so I walked in and I kind of was
just like browsing around and I came
across this shirt and it's a sweater
it's thick so I can't really wear it for
um summer because it is a thicker
material it's kind of a fall sweater
type thing and I thought it was so cute
with it it's got big cuff sleeves and I
do wear this off the shoulder it's got a
very wide neck so I do wear it off the
shoulder and I think it's so cute and
it's so comfortable as well and it's
kind of like awkwardly shaped so seeing
it on the hanger you kind of like turn
away from it but I decided to try it on
because I when I shop I like to go for
the things that kind of look kind of
weird until you style it you know what
I'm saying so um I really really like
this letter a lot and I'm super excited
to wear it in the fall I can't wear it
yet because it's so hot but when I can
I'm excited and this was 29.95 it's a
little bit more pricey than forever21
like I said but um it is a nice material
and it's very thick so
then the next door I went to was the
buckle and I'm not sure if many of you
heard of the buckle I know in the states
that they have the buckle but I'm not
sure anywhere else if they do the buckle
is basically a store that has some of
their own Brea or their own clothing and
then have carries some other brands
clothing I don't go in there too often
because it is kind of a pricier store
but I did go in there the other day and
they're totally revamping their look
with their with a style and everything
they're kind of going for like a boho
feel with more fringe and that kind of
stuff so if you are interested in that
or looking for a style like that
definitely check the thumb out because
they got some cute stuff in for
back-to-school
first shirt that I got was another
sweater like material it is a thinner
sweater but it's too hot to wear in the
summer but I'm super excited to wear it
it looks like this and it is off the
shoulder and because it's vote neck is
very wide as you can tell it's very very
off the shoulder but it's so cute the
length goes to about the top of your
jeans so it's not super long but it goes
to like the top of your jeans and it's
not a crop top either um but what I
really liked about this is the color
it's like a light pink color and then I
really liked the Browns in it and then
the little gold detailing I thought it
was so cute and again I have nothing
like that the price of for those that
are interested is 3295 so again it is
kind of a pricier store for something
like this you could probably find
something like this at forever 21 but I
did see it and I just had to get it
all right and then this last shirt that
I got from the buckle um this is very
this is kind of like the fringe shirt
where it's kind of just like a plain
shirt but then it has some unique kind
of detailing that makes it really stand
out which I absolutely love because
those kind of tops can be so versatile
and you can dress them up and dress them
down which I really love so this next
one this is what this looks like and
it's just a plain blue top but then on
the sleeves it has this like studded
detailing which i think is really cute
and then it has this fringe off the
sleeve which i think is so unique and so
cool and again I have nothing like this
and I absolutely love this this was kind
of a splurge item this was 44 dollars
and is eriously could not I've never
seen anything like this so I and I
really really wanted it and so I got it
the brand is Billabong the exact brand
is designers closet by Billabong so you
should definitely go check that out if
you are looking for this top or
something maybe they sell it somewhere
else but I really really liked this
the next place I went to was a thrift
store and I'm really new to thrifting
and I don't I am not usually I'm not a
big thrifter I've never done it before
so I kind of just got into it now and
actually who inspired me to really get
into it was her name's Kristen here on
YouTube and I'll link her page in the
description box you should definitely go
check her out because she is the queen
of thrifting and she takes something so
unique looking and makes it so
fashionable and she just is awesome with
drifting outfit so you should definitely
go check her channel out if you are
really into thrifting and want to know
how to put outfits together with
something from a thrift store so go
check her out so anyways I decided to
check out my local thrift store I have a
couple here in town but the one that I
go to is Goodwill and I picked up a jean
jacket and actually what I did to it is
I kind of like revamped it I ordered
studs off of ebay and I decided to study
my leather jacket and I cut off the
sleeves and made it into it not my
leather I said leather my jean jacket
and I decided to cut off the sleeves and
make it into a Jean vest gives the my
Jean vest kind of an edge and I have
nothing like this and in Mike I have
nothing like this in my wardrobe and so
I'm super excited because this can kind
of edge up any outfit and kind of make
it really unique so I'm really excited
to wear this so I'll show you a picture
of what this vest looks like
and the next thing from a thrift store
that I got were high-waisted jeans
shorts and this has been really big in
the season and I am so new to the whole
high-waisted trend but I'm super excited
to start wearing it but I still need to
figure out how to style it so once I
figure it out I will let you or I will
make a video on it or something so I'm
not going to show you a picture of me
wearing these yet because I still have
to figure out how to style it but this
is what they look like their Levi's and
they were I think like four dollars so
thrifting is super inexpensive so once I
get a little bit better at it and trying
to find you know cute clothes and
turning them into sweet outfits I'll do
like a whole fashion video with just
thrifted clothing so I'm super excited
to do that now for shoes I went to
journeys and I picked up these shoes and
aren't they so cute they are kind of
like a gladiator style shoe but really
really unique and the detailing is kind
of like metallics and greens and blues
and they're really really pretty and I
haven't seen anything like this lately I
have been seeing a lot recently which I
was like I don't know where if this just
went over my head but these shoes are
coming out everywhere now and they're so
cute so I'll show you what those look
like on right now but oh for price these
are these were $30 on sale for $30 and
they're originally like 50 but I got
them on sale for 30 so yeah they're
really cute they zip up in the back love
them
the next I went to was target like usual
if you guys watch my videos you know I
get like seriously everything at Target
and I only got one thing and it wasn't
clothing you guys would be so proud of
me but I got earrings and I saw these
and they just stood out to me because I
have nothing really like them and
they're gold and I don't have a lot of
gold jewelry either so this is what they
look like and they're so cute I love
them and they were only ten dollars and
then I went into Sephora and Mac and I
got some makeup products not a lot or
anything but I got the NARS Laguna
bronzer it's in the cardboard thing
whatever but you guys all know what it
looks like I picked this up because I
needed a refill of it because I hit pan
and I know you guys hear a ton about the
Laguna bronzer here on YouTube and the
one that I've been using in all my
tutorials and everything has been the
first Laguna bronzer that I ever bought
and I bought that a little less than a
year ago so it's lasted me a long time
so if you're worried about the price and
kind of like hesitant to pay that much
they do last a long time so keep that in
mind when deciding if you want to
purchase it or not the next NARS product
I got was the infamous you guys have all
heard about this I'm sure of you have
but I got the NARS orgasm blush looks
like this is just like a pink color it's
really really pretty I really love this
blush again
I don't regret paying the money for it I
really really like it and I don't have a
blush like that bright pink color yeah
either and then I stopped over at Mac
and really contain myself because I
didn't want to spend too much money but
I did get a blush and this is from one
of their limited-edition collections I
think it's just out now I'm not sure but
it's called warmth of coral it's
basically basically like a coral pink
color it's a mineralized blush but it's
not as heavy as the normal mineralized
blush so it's not as sparkly and
shimmery as most mineralized blushes so
again that was like 26 dollars I think
and then I forgot one thing at Sephora I
got the new I don't know if it's new but
the Sephora by OPI the blasted nail
polish and I gotten in silver and I
liked it so far however I did try it out
and you have to be really careful when
applying this because it doesn't as I
have the shadder nail polish and I can
just kind of carefree put that on my
nails and it'll shatter really good but
this you want a very thin coat a couple
of my nails I put thick coats on and it
didn't crack hardly at all so it looks
kind of awkward and really weird so make
sure when you're applying this you put a
very very thin layer on your nails that
is it for my haul I really hope you guys
liked it and most of the stuff is fairly
new so you guys can all go out to the
stores and look for them they should
also be there so um yeah again I really
really hope you guys like this haul and
kind of liked that I inserted pictures
let me know what you think in the
comments below and yeah I hope you're
all having a wonderful day and until my
next video
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
