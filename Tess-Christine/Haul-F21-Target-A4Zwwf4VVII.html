haul and over the weekend I went to me
and a couple of my roommates went and
went to forever 21 and Target my target
is like a weekly thing for us we always
go they're gonna get groceries and stuff
but I'm gonna show you what I got I got
really cute stuff for spring and yeah
I'm excited to show them to you alright
21 the first thing I got were these
scarves and there's two different ones
they're actually loop scarves and I've
been looking forever for these I cannot
I've always wanted one because I always
see girls and they wear them so cute and
I could never find when I could only
find the scarves you know what the
fringe is at the end or like ones that
weren't looped and so when we went there
I had to get it I got this one and I got
this one I got two different colors cuz
I couldn't decide I really liked this
one I have a scarf kind of this color
but um yeah I like it I think it looks
really good for like black and like
pinks and stuff like that so I really
like that and then a neutral tan one
which I really like and they were each
where's the price tag on these 880 I
don't know if you guys can see that yeah
880 and they're really nice they're
really light they're gonna be really
nice for spring and even fall because
scarves are in like all the time so I'm
really excited to wear those and then
the second thing I got was super springy
very flowery and it was this tank top
and I don't know if you guys can see
that and it's roughly in the front and
it's got on the back its kind of got
eight layers in the back and yeah I
thought it was super cute just like a
spaghetti strap tank top I really really
liked this one and I don't have a lot of
flowers like floral I meant in my
wardrobe so my roommates like you need -
I'm very like well seeking the florals
but I'm very like playing colors like
like I don't really like a lot of like
color per se and like ton of flora
florals but I was like this top I love
the style of tank top and yeah it zips
on the side really like it and I think
this was like I took the tag off but I
want to say it was like 12 bucks 13
bucks so yeah super inexpensive the last
thing I got from forever 21 is this
laser it's just a tan colored laser I'm
really excited about this because I have
a black blazer that I got from there I
want to stay in the fall I got it and
then I wanted a tan one for so long and
I thought it would be perfect for the
springtime because wearing the silver
flowered like floral stuff I don't know
I just think it's really cute so I've
been looking one for one for awhile and
it does have shoulder pads which I'm not
a huge fan of this one did and I took
them out and I like them like that
better but these have like a weird
shoulder it's different it kind of
points out like that but it's actually
very flattering when it's on you and it
it just gives you a nice shape and I
really like it and this one is a little
was a bit more expensive it was 2980
but yeah I thought it was a good
purchase it's a really good quality
blazer so and it pretty much goes with
everything alright and then for the
target
I got a clothing I got from Target I got
this jumper it's super cute I'm super
excited to wear it it's strapless and it
has this like ruffle ruffle II thing at
the top and then shorts at the bottom
and it has pockets and I'm excited to
wear this in the summer this is gonna be
really nice for the summer and I thought
it would be super cute with a belt
around it I love building things love
that but yeah this one was $21.99 I
don't know if you can see that but yeah
and the second thing I got was this
little
Dora type of hat and I've seen a lot of
girl wear girls wear these and I really
really like it and yeah I'm excited to
wear this during the summer it's just
gonna be really really nice for that and
yeah I could maybe do a video on how I
like to wear my hair with these hats
because these are kind of tricky to
style but yeah I can do that if you guys
are interested in that or not but yeah
I'm super excited to wear this this will
be nice out on the river where I live so
I'm excited that and then the last thing
I got from Target are actually featured
these in my first video and for the
ellen blair contest and it it's these
nude pumps and i'm very very excited
about these because this weekend when we
were shopping we went to DSW and jessica
simpson has came out with a pair that
looks exactly like these and they were
like 70 or 80 bucks and they didn't have
my size but i was like dying for a pair
of nude pumps because they go with
everything and I think nude looks really
good with florals and in the spring and
summertime so I really really wanted a
pair of these and the heel isn't very
big I I'm not sure the size of the heel
but it's not very big
which I like because I'm I'm not very
good at walking in heels I can walk in
heels but it's not the most comfortable
thing in the world but these are so
comfortable and these are only 29.99
and yeah and I got the last pair at my
target but hopefully they have them
still wherever your targets are because
these are super comfortable heels and
they're super cute so I suggest going
out and get that getting them I got
these two nail polishes I got well first
I got this color because I had been
looking everywhere they were sold out at
my Ulta they were sold out everywhere
for this shatter nail polish and I
wanted to try it so bad and they told me
they weren't coming out with anything
more any more and I was so sad and then
I walk in also the other day and huge
like rack right in the middle full of
shattered nail polishes so if you have
been looking for this and haven't
checked your alte yet go because they
just got a huge shipment in and have the
Sun for ages and then also from Essie I
got this really pretty purple I don't
know if you can see purple color and
it's called nice as nice and it's um
just a really pretty lavender color and
I think it'll be great for the spring
and yeah I'm super excited to wear this
okay so that is it for my haul and I
really hope you liked everything I
bought and can go out and get it
yourself if you liked it and yeah until
next time see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
