is going to be a haul and this is kind
of a cumulative haul because I didn't
get this all at once but I've gotten it
in the past couple weeks so I thought I
would just throw it all together in one
video and show you what I got the first
thing I got were shorts I got two
different pairs of shorts and they're
quite different in styles and quite
different from what I normally get well
you guys know that I like getting
American Eagle shorts they're just plain
jean shorts summer french summer cuffed
it varies but these were quite different
and I got these at Express and they're
kind of Sailor styled they're not
necessarily high-waisted they are a bit
higher than regular shorts but they're
not too high-waisted or they're not as
high waisted as most but I really liked
him because they had these buttons on
both sides and I really really liked
them they were on sale for originally
they were like $60 and I got them on
sale for I think like 25 I think so it
is a really good deal and these two
shorts can be dressed up a lot like
normal shorts with like fringe and
pockets sticking out and stuff are kind
of just like casual jean shorts but
these could be could be dressed up if
you wore them with the right top and the
right shoes these pair of shorts are
high-waisted shorts that I got from
forever 21 and they look like this and
they look kind of boyish but they're
really not they're really cute so this
would go up on my waist and then these
it
it lays kind of short but not too short
um and they're cuffed at the bottom
these were 20 to 80 so they were a
little bit more pricey than most things
at forever 21 I guess but yeah I really
liked these a lot and I'm excited to
style them so now onto something more
casual I got this sweatshirt and I got
this from Victoria's Secret you guys
know Victoria C or seven is semi-annual
sale but of course the one thing that I
really wanted was not a part of the sale
but it still was really cute Anna I
don't really I don't own a Victoria
Secret stretch it at all so I like
really wanted one and because they're
super comfy and I wear this all the time
now it's basically like a half zip I'll
show you the back because I got it in
two different colors I got it in black
and I got it in grey
and they're really cute they're half
zipped they have the dog and then on the
back it says love pink with a number it
says it I'm both and I really liked
these these are just super comfortable
comfortable lightweight sweatshirts
they're not too bulky and not too big
and whatever so they're really nice for
the summer especially where I live
because the summer in the summer time it
still cools off a little bit at night so
it's nice to have a nice comfortable
sweatshirt to wear and these were come
on I took all the price tags off these
because like I said this is a cumulative
haul so I've worn this stuff already but
um the sweatshirts were 39 so I mean
like a bit pricey but not terrible not
terribly bad all right the next thing I
got was from H&amp;amp;M and this is on a hanger
but I'm gonna take it off and it's this
dress it's pretty see-through but it's a
dress and it goes a little bit above my
knees and it's kind of strangely cut
this is the front so it goes like I
don't know like in front is really hard
to explain and then the back ties I
actually wore this from one of my
friend's birthday so I'll insert a
picture of what it looks like on right
now
yeah so as you can see in the picture I
belted it and I think it looks better
like that it just gives cuz it does hang
on you and I think it gives you a better
shape when it give it gave me a better
shape when I belted it and I just liked
it a lot more but it is very see-through
so I did wear a slip underneath it so I
knew it slip this was only fourteen
ninety or 1450 I think it was very
inexpensive for hmm
and I think it's so cute and it's really
cute for summer with the flower flowery
pattern and it's just a really fun some
sundress so I really really like that
the next thing I got was from H&amp;amp;M again
and this I don't know how you guys are
gonna feel about this just because it
looks kind of awkward when it's not on
but it's basically a collared shirt
dress so it looks like this and it's a
creamed color oh the sleeve is in it's a
cream color and I rolled up the sleeves
they they do go all the way down it came
with a belt but I didn't like the belt
it was a skinny belt and I like wearing
it with a thicker brown belt and the
buttons go only halfway down it has
these big pockets and then down here it
has pockets I don't know it hangs down
and then the backs a little bit longer
so it's perfect for a shirt dress
because sometimes if you try to I've
tried to recreate this sort of look with
just a regular button-down and it's too
short for me I don't feel really
comfortable wearing it but this is
longer and it looks very good when it's
belted if you weren't a belt it it would
be like you just rolled out of bed and
put on a giant collared shirt so I
really like this a lot and it's just
kind of a casual yet cute way to just
throw on something when you're going out
to the mall er around town or whatever I
think it was like 40 45 dollars so I
know it was in the 40s so again it's a
bit pricey it's kind of normal for hmm
for this kind of stuff it's good quality
it's a nice material that it's made out
of again I did what I do have to wear a
slip underneath this because on the
bottom not necessarily on the top but on
the bottom it is a little bit
see-through so I do wear a slip with it
just to be careful um the next thing I
got was from forever 21 and it is kind
of a mock blazer but it
is very loose it's like kind of a
cardigan but it's up but it's in the
shape of a blazer so it looks like this
and the bottom is very it drapes down do
you guys want me to when I haul things
should I try that try it on and like
show you I don't know let me know in the
comments well if you like that better
for me to like show you what I got and
then I don't know model myself wearing
it let me know if you like that better
because I can always do that because I
feel like it's really hard for me to
explain this so just let me know but um
it's really cute it's got these buttons
on the side that are like shell designed
I don't know it's just so cute and I I
like it because it's a cardigan style
and it feels like a cardigan on but it
gives that look of a put together blazer
look you know what I mean the next thing
I got was from one of my local stores
here it's basically a boutique that
holds kind of high-end designer brands
like True Religions 7 for all mankind
what else I don't even know I don't shop
there too much because it is really
pricey and so I tend to kind of stay
away from that store but I did go in
there the other day with one of my
friends and I got this jacket and it's a
leather jacket and it's a white cream
color and the brand I'm showing it to
you because I wasn't gonna haul this cuz
I got it in a local store but it is a
brand that you guys are accessible to
and it's jack by BB Dakota I believe and
it's so cute I'm seriously obsessed with
this leather jacket it's not real
leather obviously because it was only
$60 which I thought was fairly good
pricing for a mock leather jacket $60 is
pretty good I've seen mock leather
jackets for over 100 so at like Urban
Outfitters I love this internal color
it's like a purple lavender color I just
think it looks so pretty with the white
color and I don't know this jacket is
seriously awesome it's got this kind of
like Rouge on the shoulders but not too
crazy so it's not like big poofy it's
like seriously my perfect jacket I've
been looking for a white one for so long
and then it's you because it has this
other kind of design on the side where
it's like triangles or whatever I don't
even know diamonds diamonds that's what
it is and then on the sleeve it's got a
zipper on both sleeves and yeah it's
just super cute and super flattering
it's kind of like a motorcycle style
jacket that's what it looks like zipped
seriously obsessed with that jacket I'm
gonna be wearing it all the time in the
fall and it's been cold enough here some
days where cuz it's been rainy and
really crappy weather for a long time so
I have been able to wear it a couple
times but I'm so excited for fall to
come around so I can finally start
writing this like every day because it's
seriously like the cutest jacket ever
I'm obsessed with it alright and that is
it for clothing I did get one pair of
shoes and I've worn these a couple times
so they're a little beat-up already I
don't know why I just I don't know they
are just a bit beat up so bear with me
they are wedges and I have been looking
for wedges for a long time I don't know
if the dirt is gonna show up on these
but I was like trucking through mud like
terrible day to wear these but they're
so cute I got em at Charlotte Russe it's
kind of it's a nude color but has a
little bit of a pink tint to it like a
light pink tint it's so cute and this is
the wedge and it's not a very tall wedge
I don't like tall shoes I mean I wear
them sometimes but it's not super
Unbearable tall and they're so cute and
I absolutely love them they go with
everything cuz the color and I think it
shows up kind of pink on camera but it's
more nude it's more of a nude color but
um yeah I really like it again I got him
at Charlotte Russe they were like $30
but they had one for a buy one get one
for $10 so me and one of my friends that
were shopping together at the time we
both got shoes so we ended up only
paying like
um 20 bucks for like I pay 20 for those
and she paid 20 for her that is it for
my clothing haul I really hope you guys
liked everything I bought and can go out
and buy the stuff yourselves all of the
stuff I got really recent
so especially these these are fairly new
so on these sweatshirts if you're
interested in those the jacket go online
and check BB Dakota and then forever 21
obviously and hmm those that dress and
that um shirt dress literally I got like
not even a week ago so actually about a
week ago so definitely go pick those up
