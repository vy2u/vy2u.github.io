be a haul and I haven't done a haul and
a really really long time so I thought I
would film one for you because I just
recently actually last night went to
Ulta so if you follow me on Twitter you
already know one thing that I purchased
but if not I will show you everything
that I got the first thing and the most
exciting thing for me is the Naked 2
palette and I feel like I'm the last
person on YouTube to get this palette
but I just kind of spaced out and I
didn't really know the date it was
coming out online so I couldn't order it
but it finally came out in my Ulta
yesterday alright those colors pretty I
absolutely love it I'm so excited about
it
the next thing that I got is another
kind of makeup product it's more I mean
it's in the makeup section so I guess
you can call it a makeup product but is
the Urban Decay all nighter long-lasting
makeup setting spray and I've seen this
around YouTube for a while now and I've
been meaning to get myself it before but
I haven't yet and it looks like this I'm
sure you guys have seen it before this
was about $30 I've been trying to find a
cheaper version of this but I haven't
yet and I really wanted to try this
already because I've heard good reviews
on it the next beauty product to the
thing that I got were more of these
masks that I love and I think my
favorite favorite one is probably the
mud pack I don't know it's got a blue
look to it I don't know they have like
pictures on them it's a blue one so I
don't know which one this one is called
but it's the mud pack anti-stress it's
for pore size reducers the next things I
got were for hair and one thing that
I've got and I've been using for a while
is the redkin satin wear blow dry lotion
and I love this stuff I've been using it
for a while now I will probably do a
haircare video in the upcoming future
because I did a haircare or like my what
I use on my hair a while back but some
things have changed from that so I'll
probably do an updated one soon and I've
been meaning to get an oil for my hair
so I definitely wanted to pick
this is just the one and only argan oil
Moroccan oil treatment and basically I
just take a little bit of this and put
it on damp hair so I mean again I will
probably do a whole haircare video for
you guys
the next hair thing that I got was
something that I've been meaning to get
for a while because I've always wanted
to try it and it is a waiver and I've
never had one of these before and so I
really really wanted to try it out I
used it today on my hair for the first
time because again I went shopping last
night I really liked it so far it's very
different from what I'm used to I'm used
to just taking a curling iron or
straightener to my hair so this is very
new it's kind of big and bulky so it's
kind of hard to get used to but I'm
gonna practice with it a little bit more
I really like the waves that it made I
got the big kind came in a package like
this off this big honkin thing it
basically just says creates a large
beach waves it's called jumbo barrels
Revlon perfect heat three barrel jumbo
waver but I really like it so far I like
the ways that it creates it creates very
loose Beach waves which I'm really
pleased with because normally with
cranberries they create very crimpy
looking waves or curls I guess you could
say and I don't really like that look
always so I wanted something that looked
a little bit more natural and this was
about $30 the next and last product that
I bought at I'll tell was the
wonderstruck Taylor Swift perfume and I
smelt this the other day at Ulta and I
fell in love with the smell I absolutely
loved it and the packaging is really
cute which is always a bonus and it's so
cute look at it oh it's so cute so I'm
excited to add this to my perfume
collection and I'm going to make a
perfume collection video very very soon
I know a lot of you guys were asking me
in the comments on my room tour to let
you guys know all the perfumes that I
had so I will be making a perfume
collection video in the upcoming future
and I was thinking about I don't know if
any of you guys watched Bethany Mac
Barbie 0/7 I know some of you do but if
not all of you do you should definitely
go check her out because she has a
really really good channel and I love
her videos and I've been watching them
for a while but I saw recently that she
did a perfume video where she had I
think her friends and her
Zen or something smell they're both guys
and they smelt the perfumes and rated
them on a scale of one to five and I
thought that was a really really clever
idea so I was thinking about maybe doing
that with my brother and one of his
friends because they they're both
seventeen and I think that would be
really fun so sometime when I go home in
the near future I'm thinking about doing
kind of like a sequel to her video
because she did a bunch of perfumes that
I don't have and I have a bunch of
perfumes that she didn't ask the guys so
I thought it would be kind of fun to get
a guys take on perfumes because not only
should you love the perfume but you do
want to like smell nice if you're trying
to attract a boy or anything so I
thought that would be really fun so let
me know if you have in the comments
below if you think that would be a good
idea to do kind of a sequel to Bethany's
video and have my brother and his friend
smell the perfumes and rate them but
that is the video for today I really
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
I really hope you liked everything that
I bought and I will see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
