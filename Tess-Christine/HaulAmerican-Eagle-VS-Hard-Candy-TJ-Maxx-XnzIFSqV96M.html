back from work and I thought I would
film a quick haul for you guys because I
went shopping well actually I didn't go
shopping I picked up a few things a
couple days ago that I thought you guys
would be interested in seeing and I
wanted to film it after I got done with
work because I remembered - and then
usually gets too late and then things
are sold out and that kind of sets out
and make it for you really quick so
excuse my hair and and I feel like I'm
gonna get comment um on where I work
because I get that a lot but if you
haven't seen my other videos I say it in
a couple of my other videos but I work
at a golf course and yes I'm outside all
day so it's definitely draining and I've
been working since 11:00 and it's now
9:00 so yeah I had a pretty long day so
the first thing for makeup I went to or
I wanted to pick up the hard candy some
hard candy products that I heard about
through YouTube and the first one that I
picked up that I'm like playing with
right now you can hear that but it's the
Fox in a box
hard candy blush and the color I have is
spicy and sweet and I've heard a lot
about these through YouTube so I wanted
to try them out I have it on my cheeks
now I I got it a couple days ago
so um yeah I tried it out a couple days
so far I really like it except for one
thing is that you have to have a very
light hand with it you I swirl it all
together and then put it on my cheeks
and I find that all my other blushes I
can just swirl and kind of just put on
my cheeks I don't have to worry about
getting a harsh line this one tends to
be a bit strong so far I don't know I
don't think I'll get it again just
because I don't know it is very harsh
and for me like when I do my makeup
really quick I just swipe it on and then
I like this morning I was getting ready
for work and I was running late and so I
just like swirled it on and went like
that and I was like oh my god clown face
but yeah but I like it so far
and then the next thing that I haven't
tried out yet but I got it a couple days
ago because I heard about it again
through youtube was the hard candy
glamoflauge heavy duty concealer and the
color I got was white one thing noticing
when I squeezed it out is that it is
very thick it reminds me a lot of the
erase case
by benefit I don't know if you guys have
tried that out but um yeah that's what
it reminds me of so I don't know how
much I'm gonna like this I mean I'm in
love with my Sonia Kashuk concealer but
I definitely wanted to try that out
anyways and I'll lie even let you know
if I like it or not now on to close so
one of the first places I went to was
American Eagle because you all know I'm
sure if you watched my fashion videos
that that's where I get all of my jean
shorts for the summer and I had I got in
the mail a 15% off coupon thing or
whatever so I had to go get them and my
luck they were having a sale buy one get
one buy one pair of shorts get the
second pair for $10 so I like had to do
that so um the first pair of shorts I
got were just like a basic Jean cuffed
shorts but these ones are different
because there's like some MIDI like the
MIDI I don't I think that's how you say
it I don't know but what I like about
them is that they're not as short and
they're not like a Bermuda short where
they go down to your knees and they're
not as short as some of the normal
shorts they're like perfect length oh I
think these are new this year like I
don't remember them being there last
season or whatever so I really like them
and then the second pair of shorts I got
were these and they're like acid wash
type shorts and these like these are the
shorter ones they're like fringed at the
bottom but um I thought it was kind of
funny because I actually saw these like
I'm sure all of you like Justin Bieber
fans or whatever have seen those Hawaii
pictures of him and Selena in Hawaii but
she's actually wearing these exact
shorts so I thought it was kind of cool
I was like oh sweet I'm almost positive
that these are the exact shorts she was
wearing they're super cute and super fun
to wear and I'm excited I don't have any
shorts like this at all
oh and for those of you interested in
the prices for these these ones these
were 3650 I don't know if that's going
to show up I don't think I think it was
blurry but they were 3650 and then I got
these ones for $10 but these ones
originally were
Oh 3650 same so all those shorts I'm
thinking are 3650 but they're good
quality shorts I really like them I've
always worn those kind of shorts so next
I went to the Victoria's Secret I had
since my birthday is coming up in June I
got a $10 off thing in the mail so these
like coupon things give me an excuse to
shop so I got a swimsuit and I love
their swimsuits there and I picked up
this one and I thought it was so cute
and they're little like sequins I think
not sequins they're like I don't even
know how to explain that but there's
it's such a cute swimsuit and the color
is probably not going to show up right
on camera but it's like a orangish coral
it's really really pretty color and I
don't have anything like this and I
don't have anything like flashy kind of
like this so this is such a cute
swimsuit and I'm super excited to wear
it I'm pretty sure the price was
somewhere in the 20s and then I got $10
off but normally it's around in the 20s
upper 20s I think and I think it's more
expensive than the normal ones because
it has all these added little detailing
I feel bad but I love t.j.maxx and I
feel bad when I do like fashion videos
and it says t.j.maxx because t.j.maxx is
so iffy all over because they all carry
different clothes and stuff but I guess
like what I'm getting at with my fashion
videos and stuff is kind of like
inspiring you guys to like create
outfits off of that so I'm not saying
like ogle you have to go get this exact
same top to achieve the same look no not
at all so I did go to TJ Maxx and the
rest of my clothing is from TJ Maxx I
jumped on the tribal bandwagon and I got
something tribal print because it seems
to be super in for spring and I really
like it actually I like this kind of
styling and I love this tank top because
of the beadwork at the top oh it's so
pretty it has these stud like things and
then studs here and then the straps are
braided which i think is so cool
I'm super excited to wear this and it's
like fairly long I mean it goes I mean
it goes past my waist I went say it's
like a dress or anything
but yeah really like that and then oh
and the price of that for those
interested was $12.99 compared at $26 so
that's why I love t.j.maxx do you always
feel like you're getting a deal which
you are technically and then the next
thing I got was kind of 70s inspired I
guess it's kind of like I know 70s is
really big in for right now I guess and
I love the 70s trend because I don't
know I think it's really cool and it's a
super loose flowy paisley looking top
and it's very thin material and it's off
the shoulder I have it on a hangar now
but it's off the shoulder and then the
back is super cute it has this button
and I absolutely love it and then at the
bottom it has this drawstring waist so
it's not like ruffles and it's off the
shoulder it's so cute and I'm so excited
to wear it and the price of this was
1699 and compared at $34 so that's
pretty good too next thing I got was
this sweater which you're thinking what
sweater in summer my time are you
kidding but this is a really really thin
sweater I wouldn't even wear this in the
winter as a sweater you can see my hand
to the right look yeah it's like a kind
of like a Airy sweater you know what I
mean you wear it over like a tank top or
something then at the bottom it has a
little band here and so it's kind of
loose on the top and then tighter at the
bottom and the sleeves are like quarter
length yeah I'm really excited to wear
this I love this and I don't think I
maybe I do actually I don't know I used
to have not a lot of things pink and now
I do so yeah I really liked the color
it's pink and white stripes really like
it I don't know if it's gonna show up
red but it's pink I got this at t.j.maxx
again and it looks like this it's black
and it's like a one-shoulder dress and
then it has a long flowy sleeve like
this I don't know if you can see it and
then the bottom is like that I don't
know
yeah it like cinches in right by a
little bit above my waist and then this
is like a perfect length that's not too
short or anything and it's not like too
awkward
weeklong
either so yeah I'm super excited about
this cuz I've been looking for a dress
like this for a while and I saw one on
ASOS calm but it was like $80 and I was
like I don't know I don't really want to
pay for that and then I found this one
and it was only $14.99 and I was like
score yeah I'm a very very excited to
wear this and style this this I think
this will you can like dress this up
with like a lot of cute jewelry and that
sort of thing but yeah that is my haul
that's all I got I don't think I got
anything else nope I didn't
that's it I'm surprised I didn't get
nail polish I don't know what I was
thinking I usually always get nail
polish yeah check your TJ Maxx or
Marshalls because I never used to show
up there and for the past two years I've
been shopping there and you can find the
cutest stuff there that is usually
pretty expensive and for really cheap so
you should definitely go check it out
they're shoes like my TJ Maxx I always
love looking at their shoes because they
have awesome shoes like oh this isn't
really recent well kind of a couple
weeks ago I went into TJ Maxx and I got
these guests shoes let me show you them
and they're so cute they have like a bow
well one side is a bow and then it's
like a strap and it's got a plated
platform in it which I like because it's
not like a big bulky platform at the
bottom it's like hidden so they're super
comfortable and I absolutely love them
they're so cute and yeah and these are
only how much were these I think these
were like $35 and originally they were
like 80 or 90 so definitely start
shopping if you don't already at your TJ
Maxx for Marshalls because you can get
some great steals and awesome items from
there and yeah I really hope you guys
enjoyed this haul and can find these
things at your own store or mall and
until my next video
see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
