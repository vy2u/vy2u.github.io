Holiday Gift Guide video specifically
for her so I almost forgot about doing a
just a regular gift guide until I was
just recently in New York and if you
guys follow me on my vlog Channel I'm
doing vlogmas I'll have that linked
below but you know that the first couple
days of vlogmas I was in New York and
one of the days I was shooting with
refinery29 they actually surprised me
when I got back to Minnesota they had
sent a bunch of Christmas gifts over and
I was so excited because giving giving
and receiving gifts is like one of the
best things I think it's not the whole
point of Christmas but I definitely
think it's an uplifter and it makes you
feel good I think one of the biggest
tips in figuring out what you want to
give somebody as a gift is to kind of
step back and look at what you gave
people over the years or what people
have gotten you because kind of taking
other people's advice or direction with
what they give you as a gift is a great
idea especially if you loved it so I
loved everything that I got from
refinery29 the first thing I got was a
sweater and this sweater is so gorgeous
it's like this very holiday festive
themed sweater but it's totally my style
because you guys know I love black and
white especially in the winter so the
texture on this is really fun and that's
room ory says and I've shopped at
maurices for a while now my mom and I
actually love it I also got a skincare
product it's just kind of an all-over
balm or lotion I also got a NARS lip
kind of quad it has a bunch of different
lip glosses in it which is perfect
especially if you don't know what colors
they like and then I also got a sleep
mask which is awesome because it's kind
of like an electronic or techie gift and
then I also got a perfume if you don't
really know what to get somebody you
want to go all out and go over finery
29s route you can totally do that but I
have some awesome ideas for you that I
think you guys are really gonna love
okay so the first category I'm going to
start with for this gift guide is makeup
and beauty the first and most obvious
thing you could get them are these
awesome kits that they sell at Ulta and
Sephora now they have these all over the
place even at Target as well so more
like drugstore brands but these make
awesome gifts they're super easy to pick
up it's hard to find one under $20 now
but you can get some for under 30 like
this lorac one it's the royal lip lustre
cream collection they're basically just
cream gloss
this retails for $25 but if you have a
friend that doesn't really like lip
colors all that often or doesn't wear
them all that often but doesn't like
them as much you can get them of this
guy which I love this is from my Holiday
Gift Guide at or not my have my holiday
gift my holiday giveaway I'm giving this
away and I love it it's the bronze of
Champions by benefit it has a bunch of
different samples all mainly for your
face very natural very bronzy very
glowing so if you have somebody that's
more into more of a natural look other
than bold lips like the Laura you can
get them this however this retails at I
think $32 so it is a bit pricier so if
you're not willing to spend over $20 I
probably wouldn't go to Sephora because
it's a little bit hard now to find stuff
under 20 however you can get like lip
palettes and you can get eyebrow kids
that are under $20 now but if you want
to go more on the bath and body route I
would go check Target or any type of
drugstore because they have great kits
there for super inexpensive like this
one this one was only $19.99 so under
$20 and you get full sizes of everything
which is awesome and definitely
different from the makeup products
because you don't get as much there but
this is great because this is kind of a
universal gift not everybody wears
makeup like that so this is perfect for
a mom sister a friend even really more
wide range of people so that's why I
would normally go for like a bath
product or some sort of lotion this is
awesome it comes with body lotion hand
cream and lip balm which is all full
sizes and this is the Burt's Bees
honeypot another great option is a
perfume and you're probably thinking
what Parfums are so expensive but
actually at Ulta you can buy little
rollerball perfumes and this one I think
was twenty dollars this is the pink
sugar rollerball these will last for a
really long time and you can travel with
them they're awesome so I definitely
recommend some sort of rollerball
perfume because like I said they're
usually about twenty dollars maybe even
less depending on the brand and type of
perfume you get I probably put them in a
cute miniature stocking which you can
buy at like craft stores or things like
that and then just give them a bunch of
candy because everybody's excited to get
candy right next up is nail polish and
this I actually recently found at
Sephora it's so cute and this was only
19 dollars so again it's under $20
and you get to full size deborah
lippmann nail polish so one is like a
gold glitter and one is like a deep
berry color kind of like my lip color it
makes it great just kind of like quick
wrapping you can use this as a stocking
stuffer if you want but it's great if
you have like a bunch of different
friends and you want to go shopping for
them you can just pick up a bunch of
these and they're really easy to hand
out and give to people and like I said
not super expensive and everybody a lot
of girls wear nail polish so you can't
really go wrong with this now another
great tip for you for makeup and beauty
as you can divide up the gifts so if you
want to give maybe you have like three
friends or something like that
and one may like some of this one may
like some of this and one may like some
of this you can divvy them up however
you please so if you want to get more
for your money and you want to just do
one lip lip gloss per friend you have
six friends you can just get out of the
way for it only twenty-five dollars so
you don't need to give this all to one
person you could definitely get creative
with your wrapping and wrap these
individually give them to your friends
like that along with this you can
totally divvy these up you don't have to
give them all of this at once and that's
another way that I think you can get
more for your money
moving on to clothing and accessories
like I showed you in the beginning
refinery29 got me an awesome sweater so
a holiday sweater is a great great
option because everybody loves sweaters
especially in the winter and holiday
season so you can go the sweater route
or you can go more of the fashion
accessories route which is what I'm
going to show you right now so what I
think are really great ideas to give
someone and really cute ways to wrap it
is to buy these little miniature
stockings at a craft store you can get
them for a couple dollars and basically
all I did was I picked out I picked out
some fashion accessories so in this one
I have a beanie in this one I have a
plaid scarf and in this one I have
mittens and they were all super
inexpensive they were all at least under
$20 if not under 15 so yay so what I did
is I filled this part with Hershey
kisses because YUM and then I put the
beanie on top and then I added a little
back and Bodyworks candle this is a
great idea because each one can be a
separate gift so I added a candle on
this one and then a candle in this one
they probably all add up to
about $30 I would say in total because
bath and Bodyworks where I bought the
candle I bought these little mason jar
ones they have specials on them where
it's like 2 for 12 or sometimes it's 4
for 20 or something like that so look
for deals because they have them all
over this time of year another great
option for a gift is jewelry you don't
have to go over-the-top or crazy just
simple kind of like statement pieces or
maybe just simple pieces depending on
the person you're giving it to what they
what kind of jewelry they like so I just
found like the simple simple pendant
necklace some pearl earrings and you can
decorate them super cute when you wrap
them you can buy those tiny little like
cardboard boxes and wrap them cute with
a little bow it makes a simple tiny gift
but they will definitely love it next
option are phone cases you can buy these
super inexpensive I believe this one was
$10 and this one from packs on both of
these were and this is $10 or $12 or
something like that depending on what
their style is this one has multicolored
macaroons on it and this is kind of like
a boho print next up is room decor and
if you have a friend that's super into
decorating their room these are great
options so the first thing you can do is
get some sort of quoted frame this I
purchased at Target for only $20 I think
even less than that I'm kind of giving
you guys a glare but it just has like a
cute tumbler II quote in it you can give
it to them and if it matches their room
you're good to go
otherwise you can make your own super
easy by just printing out the text
putting them into a shadowbox frame and
you're good to go next up is a dream
catcher and dream catchers are just
really pretty overall they look really
expensive and you can get them super
inexpensive this one was only $15 from a
trading company store where I live super
pretty get one that matches their room
and they will love it so the last decor
idea and actually last gift idea is
definitely one of my favorites and at
least one of you guys has to do this
because I think this is such a good gift
basically what it is it's a lighted
photo wall display sounds so random and
I'm going to show you guys in my room
how I recreated it basically for the
gift all you really need to do is give
them the supplies to make it I just
filled it in a bag like this so I did
the tissue paper I'll give them these
lights which are just mini clear crystal
lights and I purchased these at Target
it says 299 so they're $3 but they were
on sale for like two dollars and fifty
cents which is awesome printouts of
photos which is super easy to do all you
need is just to go to like Kinkos or
something like that or Walmart and print
out a bunch of photos for them and then
all you need to do is give them a little
mini clothespins a little mini
clothespins these are like holiday
themed because I thought it was cute so
all you have to do is give them that and
then either tell them how to do that
maybe show them this video or show them
a photo of it and they can get totally
creative and do anything that they want
for themselves but it makes a super fun
gift in a way to decorate their room
like I said if you have a friend or
family member that's super into that
kind of stuff it's a great not only
decor idea but it's cool that you give
them all the supplies to do it but
that's it for my Holiday Gift Guide
