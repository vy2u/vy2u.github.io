kill nobody
we skip on up up what's up guys today's
video is going to be a holiday party
lookbook as you guys can already tell
and I'm super excited about this one
because I've never done like a fancier
look look I've always done kind of like
my everyday wear or fancier outfit is
usually only in my get the lip videos so
I thought it would be really fun to do a
holiday party lookbook since around this
time of year there's a lot of kind of
like festive parties going on stuff that
you kind of have to dress a little bit
nicer for so I thought I would show you
guys five different looks they all have
kind of like different styles within
them so like ones like a pretty simple
one ones edgy one super glam ones like a
classic like holiday Christmas look and
then the other one is I can't remember
right now but you will see so I really
hope you guys enjoy it but before we get
into the video I wanted to tell you guys
a few more things so I'm doing a few
things off my channel if you guys didn't
know that or off this channel one I'm
doing vlogmas so you should head over to
my vlog channel which is called more of
tests and click on some eyeballs lenses
I have a ton of log messes up I did it
last year but I'm doing it this year and
I think I'm actually going to continue
blogging after vlogmas I really really
do enjoy it and I think I'm getting the
hang of it more so be sure to head over
there and check those out if you are at
all interested in my life outside of
this channel and then also head over to
refinery29 s channel I did a series
called dear New York with Annie
greenberg I was kind of like featured on
a couple episodes and I really loved how
they turned out we did some workout
videos which I know you guys have been
asking me about so you should head over
there and check that out was really fun
we did it at like this gym and I like
was sore the next day like it was
actually really intense and it's all at
home workouts super perfect so I just
wanted to share with you guys some
things I'm doing outside of my channel
in case you want to see more of my face
which you probably don't but maybe if
you do there's your two options but
anyways let's go ahead and get into the
video umm now
okay so starting off with this first
look this one is definitely more on the
fancier side just because of the way the
dress is it's like kind of this shimmery
gold fabric but it's also a lot longer
which I think always makes dresses feel
a little bit more formal but what I love
about this one is I purchase it from
Free People and I always kind of notice
with Free People dresses you can totally
make it more casual which is what I
decided to do by wearing some
over-the-knee black boots you could
totally wear this with like normal heels
and I think it would definitely dress it
up but I think by layering necklaces
like I did which those are from Nasty
Gal and then adding some over the knee
boots it makes it a little bit more
casual but you're definitely dressed up
nice so I think this is perfect for like
an event a really nice Christmas party a
dinner whenever you find the use for
this but I think just having like a
staple neutral color dress like this is
perfect for the holidays so when
thinking of a holiday party lookbook I
could go without having like a classic
Christmas or holiday party look and for
me I always think of red dresses it's
always the time that I pull out red
dresses from my closet I have this one
for a couple years now it's from for
love and lemons I love the lace overlay
and what I did is I paired it with some
over-the-knee boots not only does this
make make it a little bit more
comfortable for me but also it adds
warmth I always think like holiday
parties you want to wear a dress and be
fancy but it is still cold out so I
always wear over the knee boots and a
pair it with like a long black jacket
super formal looking and it just kind of
ties the whole look together you can
obviously totally pair this with
whatever you want it's just a tip I have
for you it's kind of when I drag out
with these over-the-knee boots is when I
have to wear dresses because it always
makes it look super good and pull it all
together
this next look is for those of you who
like to add a little bit of a different
twist to a formal holiday look it's a
little bit edgier so I wanted to show
you guys some different ways you can
just take a simple dress and kind of
throw some different things into it so I
just took this cream dress from forever
21 it looks super nice it is a really
awesome fabric I love the cut of it and
I'm pretty sure it was only like ten
dollars so you really get the bang for
your buck here because it's awesome and
how I made it a little bit different
instead of so simple as I took a scarf
from Free People
I loved how it still has like the gold
tan color in it that matches the dress
but then it has the black and I tied it
around my neck which is kind of a trend
right now um so I think it looks super
good definitely very different and then
I paired it with a leather jacket
instead of like a formal black jacket I
think it just kind of adds a little bit
of an edgy or look to it and makes it
different
I also tied my hair up in a bun but of
course anything really works for this
you can totally have fun and get
creative with your own personal style so
I wanted to show you guys like you can
add whatever you want to it that you
would wear on a normal day basis but
still feel comfortable at a party this
next outfit is for all of you simple
girls or if you get invited to a holiday
party that you're not sure of the dress
code this is always a great option so I
just took this pink shimmery top from
Topshop does something like this is
really awesome because it definitely
looks fancier but you can pair it with
pretty much anything so instead of jeans
which obviously would be the most
comfortable thing I took these wide-leg
pants from Windsor they're super super
comfortable but they look really nice
and I think that's kind of like a huge
tip for you is to buy something like
this and then pair it with any type of
fancy top you can find it also is more
affordable because these pants you can
find pretty much anywhere these ones
from ones are obviously super affordable
but this fancier top from Topshop kind
of ties it all together and you can
totally do like fun makeup do your hair
crazy different whatever you want but
it's just really simple really
comfortable and I think those of you who
don't like to wear a dress or go super
fancy for a holiday party this look is
perfect for you
and this last look is for those of you
who like to dress pretty simple but
still want to be trendy and kind of I
don't know make it a little bit
different so I found this velvet
textured dress from Free People super
fun really comfortable and then I added
some accessories so all I really added
was a necklace and that is also from
Free People it's kind of like a
statement necklace
I feel like this look is really simple
but you could totally pull a Vanessa
Hudgens and add like a bunch of
accessories where your hair and braids
get super creative with it maybe put on
like a fur jacket or something like that
make it super fun but this is for those
of you who kind of like to be edgy
simple and like boho at the same time so
like me I don't know um but I love this
look super easy to just kind of like
throw on and go and you look super good
so that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did be
sure to give it a big thumbs up if you
want some more winter holiday outfit
video ideas because I was thinking about
doing a New Year's one so let me know
and I will see you guys in my next video
