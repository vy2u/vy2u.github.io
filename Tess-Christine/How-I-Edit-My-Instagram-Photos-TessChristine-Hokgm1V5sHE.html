yeah I guess I would say have a theme
but it's not like a super strict theme
where you look at it and they all look
very very similar I kind of go by the
rule that they all kind of look like
they belong in like a cool photo album
together I don't know I try to pick
similar colors and obviously with
seasons when I do different things like
right now it's super pink it has a lot
of like lights and color in it which
normally you know I live in New York
City it's usually like concrete jungle
but like if I travel I went home so I'm
not like a very strict person like I
won't post something specifically
because it won't fit like I'll make it
fit because I like sharing a lot of my
stuff with my life with you guys but it
definitely is white bright very clean
and yeah so now I'm going to show you
guys what I use so starting off with
apps the main one I use main ones I use
our visco via Co whatever facetune dark
room unum and Snapseed so starting off
with a V SEO this one I think everybody
is familiar with it's just kind of like
the go-to editing app so once I have
picked out the photos that I want to
import which by the way I'm importing
the ones that I've taken off of just my
iPhone I will show you guys how I added
Pat's photos which is very minimal so I
wanted to show you guys when I take
photos off an iPhone what I do so I
bring them in and I pick out my filters
so my favorite ones are a6 HB 1 and HP 2
and then also ask to those last ones I
use mainly for like lifestyle photos um
just kind of like scenery shots I tend
to favor a six a lot for a lot of my
outfit of the days because I think it
goes really well for those so I always
turn it down a little bit I never use it
at full so I do about seven or eight and
then I go ahead and I will use the crop
tool if it needs to be cropped and then
everything else it kind of just depends
on the photo that's another thing all
photos are so different when you take
them that it depends so I can mess with
the exposure a little bit if it needs to
be sometimes I'll bump the contrast but
that's very rare if anything I'll go
down a little bit
exposure and then for iPhone photos a
lot of the time I will bump the clarity
a couple just because sometimes iPhone
photos need a little bit help if it's
not as I don't know clear so then I go
ahead and I finish that and then I will
save it as actual size the next app I
will use sometimes is a face tune now I
don't like to go super crazy with this
app and I don't think anybody should
because I don't think it's necessary but
what I think to use it for is okay let's
say I have a pimple gotta get rid of it
right like it's gonna go away in a
couple days anyways so you know might as
well help it out on here so I like the
patch tool let's say I have a pimple on
my face you want to get rid of it I will
go ahead and do that another thing that
I mainly use it for is the details a
little tool so what I like that is
especially for outfit of the days I like
to showcase parts my outfit so I will
rub a little detail on the shoe the
dress make it stand out this app is also
really great for any background stuff I
know a lot of people use it to whiten
the background with the whitening tool
it just kind of depends on your theme
but that's pretty much what I do and
then I will go ahead and save that and
move on to the next app moving on we
have dark room now I really like this
app a lot because if you will have
noticed a lot of my photos tend to be
slightly d saturated so what I tend to
favor in this app is this little color
wheel it has a bunch of different colors
I just think it's really fun because you
can control all the colors in the photo
so the ones I tend to favor are the red
orange and yellow orange specifically
because a lot of the times a 6 filter
will give me this brassy look which I
really don't like so I will go ahead and
use that little dial under saturation
and I will take that down just a slight
bit you can go crazy with it if you want
to but it does the same for all the
different colors this is just a really
good way to help make sure that your
colors blend really well they mesh
together when you're putting different
photos together because obviously you
take them around all over the place
that's not going to be consistent but
this is a good way to ensure that so
it's basically all I do with this app
and then I go ahead and save it and move
on to the next one the struggle win vseo
updated their version so we couldn't
organize our photos we all ID to find
new ones so I really like this one it's
called onnum
and I like it's free and this one is way
awesome then vseo beforehand anyways
because you can go ahead and import as
many photos as you want and then you can
just click and drag them around and
organize them however you so please it's
so awesome you can move them around
really easily you don't have to like re
upload them or anything you can swap
them out you can move them around and
then the ones that are already imported
to your Instagram or that are up already
have a little emblem at the bottom of an
Instagram symbol so you can kind of see
which ones are already up and it makes
it really easy for you to kind of
organize it and get really creative if
you want to now I'm going to show you
guys snap seed which I recently
discovered and I absolutely love it
so I'm going to show you one that
actually didn't do this one's already up
on my Instagram for this but it's an
example photo of what I would use it for
so quickly editing this a six filter
cropped it pretty much left it at as is
I'll open up in a darkroom and then turn
down the orange a little bit and then I
will open it in Scentsy so for this app
I recently discovered it and it's super
cool my favorite thing to use is the
brush tool and what's awesome about it
is you can click exposure temperature
for me you know me and my saturation
gotta bump it down so I click the
saturation went down -10 and what I
would normally use this for is any
intense background color for this one
brick you can basically scrub over and
it'll only desaturate that image or that
part of the image that you're scrubbing
over so it won't touch the color of my
skin at all it won't mess with like the
colors in my shirt it's just really cool
because it controls exactly what you
want to tone down or maybe increase
depending on your feed it's a really
awesome app and I'm excited to play with
it a little bit more so I definitely
wanted to include it and quickly I
wanted to show you guys at one of
Patrick's images and how I added that
which I really don't do anything to it
when working with a photographer you
really don't want to mess with it too
much because they work so hard editing
it on really good software on their
computer that to throw a bunch of
filters on it would I don't know kind of
be annoying to them so if anything I
will fit it to crop Instagram maybe do
like a plus two plus three on a filter
that I like to make sure that it blends
with my feed
but that's pretty much it you guys know
I work with Patrick all the time so he
knows what kind of type of photos I like
anyways but just a rule of thumb with
working with a photographer you don't
want to throw a bunch of filters over
somebody's work um so a lot of you guys
were commenting asking what I do for
that and that's mainly him so I
definitely wanted to give a shout out
because I definitely don't edit those on
my phone he does a lot of that work
himself but yes now you guys know the
secret to how I edit my Instagram photos
it's not that complicated but I really
hope it helped you guys out for those of
you guys requesting it please let me
know your Instagram in the comments
below
I love creepy on you guys I just think
this is a really fun app to kind of
showcase your style and show what you're
into so please let me know or go on my
Instagram and comment but thank you
again for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
