a hair tutorial kind of more like how I
style my natural hair video because I
always get a lot of comments and
questions about my natural hair type and
how I style it when I don't want to use
any kind of like Hot Tools or anything
like that I know everyone has different
hair types so obviously it won't you
know turn out the same on everyone's
hair but I kind of show you different
ways on how I style it and maybe it can
help you out so I hope it does help some
of you out because I know I was getting
a lot of requests for it so I definitely
wanted to do it for you guys plus the
last time I did a video like this was
probably like my first video well not my
first video ever but one of my first
videos so I figured I was kind of doing
for a new one to show you how I style my
hair for all of you guys who have
subscribed to me since like my third
video if you are interested please keep
on watching and I will see you all my
next video
hi everyone so since my hair has a
natural curl or wave to it I like to
style my natural hair when it's wet so
with a wide tooth comb I'm just gonna
begin by combing out my hair until I get
all the tangles out from the shower so
now I'm just taking that same comb and
parting my hair wherever I want to part
it that day and then just combing it out
smooth
now to give my hair some definition and
shine while boosting my curls I'm going
to be taking this product by Marc
Anthony called Strictly curls curl
dividing lotion and placing the onto my
fingertips rubbing it in between my
hands and basically scrunching up my
hair and working the product throughout
my hair using my fingertips it's really
important for me to use products when
styling my natural hair because my
natural hair tends to get a little bit
frizzy if I don't use something to kind
of tame it and shape the curls so that's
why I like using products like this Marc
Anthony though is having a giveaway on
his youtube channel so if you're
interested all links and information
will be below now if my curls happen to
be extra frizzy a certain day I will
take this curl Envy curl cream and run
that through my hair as well to kind of
tame it even more I purchased both of
those styling products at Walgreens and
they're definitely something that I'm
really loving for my natural hair right
now so now I like to let my hair air dry
so for about 15 minutes I let it dry and
then I'm going to begin using a diffuser
now diffusers kind of look really funky
but you can purchase them pretty much
anywhere and they really do make a
difference with your curls so I'm doing
is having the little diffuser at the end
of the blow-dryer and basically just
scrunching my hair up into it until my
hair is fully dry and I've shaped the
curls the way I like them the settings
on my blow dryer are on low and warm I
just feel like the setting works
perfectly for my hair because it doesn't
blow it out too much to where it would
make it frizzy it just kind of shapes
the curls and it gives them a bouncy
texture and works with the products that
I placed in my hair before so now that
my hair is dry that is the finished look
I really hope you guys liked it I hope
it helps you out a little bit with your
natural hair or styling your wet hair
and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
