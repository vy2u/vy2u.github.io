be kind of a hair tutorial it's gonna be
more of a tip and trick hairstyle for
you guys it's going to be me showing you
how I tease my hair a lot of you guys
are requesting on most of my hair
tutorials cuz most of the time I end up
teasing my hair on how I do it because
usually in my hair tutorial and end up
speeding up the teasing process so a lot
of you guys are asking me to kind of
slow it down and walk you through it on
how I tease my hair to make it look kind
of like you have natural volume it's not
too big of a poof it's not too snarly
looking if that makes sense and how I
get it to make sure that it doesn't wrap
my hair too bad or anything like that so
it's pretty simple pretty easy so if
you're interested in seeing on how I
tease my hair and kind of my own tips
and tricks to it please keep on watching
ok so obviously for this you're gonna
need a teasing comb and this is probably
one of my top questions every time I do
a hair tutorial is where you get your
teasing brush so I guess I don't know
the exact answer to this because I got
it from a friend whose mom is a hair
stylist so she got it for me but it's
pretty kind of general you I've seen
these everywhere I mean not the exact
brand the exact brand that I'm using is
called teasing you it's just teasing
with the letter U and then next to it
says Monroe by Monroe so that's my
teasing brush I don't know exactly where
you can get these because I don't know
where my friend's mom got it but um so I
don't know this where you can get this
exact teasing brush but they have pretty
much similar ones like anywhere you go I
know I've seen them at Sally's Beauty
Supply or like Target any where kind of
like a convenience store where you could
get kind of hair products or brushes or
stuff like that a lot of salons will
have these nowadays too so make sure you
check your salon if you're looking for
one but basically my only recommendation
I guess for a teasing brush is to make
sure it has these kind of bristles on it
I wouldn't go I guess for me and my hair
style or my hair type I don't like the
ones that are just combs like with the
plastic knobs I just don't think it
teases my hair very well so I like the
ones that has these kind of coarse
bristles I like this these kind of
teasing brushes a lot because I've tried
multiple different ones and this one has
been my favorite for years now now if
we're actually teasing your hair now
this will depend on actually your hair
type you
head shape even on how you grab but how
I usually grab my hair is I start from
like the middle of my part and this will
all determine how you like it but I like
going from here and I section all the
way to probably like upper mid-back
depending on how big I want my poop's
now if I'm just going for like an
everyday poof I kind of won't go as big
but if I'm going for something like if
I'm doing an updo or something like that
I will definitely go deeper like down
more and start teasing from the bottom
and also I like teasing from the bottom
to the top and I know that varies to
some people like starting to tease up
here and work their way back but I just
found that it's easier for me to get
more of a natural looking pouf because
I'm not the type of person who really
likes big pouf big like big hair back
here it's not really my style or what I
like so like I said I start from here
and I go about kind of like upper right
right about I guess where I can explain
this to you is right about where my head
starts to curve down like right where it
starts to go down so right at the top
basically is where I like to start and
so I take this and then what I usually
do is I usually just use my fingers and
I comb back and kind of gather this
section back and you get about this
amount of hair and I usually like to
tease in three different sections if I
if I decide to leave my hair really
naturally curly and scrunch it up and
stuff I'll probably only take the top
section like here and choose it because
otherwise it gets really tangled so I
take this huge section right here and
then I take my teasing brush and I
basically just make like a see like I
scoop it now this is actually kind of
hard to see in my hair tutorials because
I usually speed it up so it looks like
I'm going like really really fast but I
basically just scoop it probably like
three or four times in the back and this
is where I like mostly tease is like the
back section because that's where I feel
like it needs the most volume and then I
have this so now I take probably like
right here instead of going down like
this like I did before I'll go like cut
it in half like that
and then I'll tease the section again
scooping and the reason why I'm scooping
is I just feel like it teases a little
bit better and it doesn't rat your hair
or make it so gnarly as if you're ready
to go up and down that kind of rats it a
little bit more this kind of just scoops
some of the hair underneath to make it
poofier but it won't wrap the whole
section of hair which is why it still
looks kind of smooth on top and then if
I can get a last section if I don't run
into the tease before I usually like to
tease that as well so yeah now I have
this kind of like awkward looking pouf
thing now with my hair I usually just
use the teasing comb again and kind of
just like lightly like very lightly just
comb off the top and smooth it down and
kind of shape it this is how I usually
shape it is I use the teasing comb
because otherwise it'll just be awkward
and then I take my fingers like this and
I kind of just like poof it up and then
that's just how I poof my hair is it's
not look too too big or anything it's
very natural for my liking obviously if
you have thinner hair this might if
doing this at the end might flatten the
whole poop and what you've just done
might be completely ruined so keep that
in mind is that when you're if you have
thinner hair maybe try just using your
fingers and kind of smoothing out the
top this might smooth it all the way
down I'd know I've teased some of my
friends hair who has thinner hair and if
I do that it just comes out right away
also another teasing kind of tip for me
is I don't spray hair spray in between
each layer I think that wraps it a lot
more and makes it really more like
snarly and I don't like that my hair
kind of holds its poop once I just spray
like right now I would probably finish
with hairspray on the top but I wouldn't
spray in between each layer just because
I feel like that rat's it a lot more if
I wanted a like a very long lasting poof
all night kind of thing I might spray it
in between each layer very lightly with
a flexible hold hairspray because that
way I can you know comb it through and
if I use a strong hold hairspray it'll
get really snarly yeah that's pretty
much all I do for teasing it really is
simple and I hope you guys this is
helpful I know I kind of slowed things
down a little bit and didn't speed it up
way through when I talk
with you guys so hopefully it helped you
guys who were asking me to make a video
on this but yeah if you have any other
questions about teasing your hair or
anything like that definitely leave them
in the comments below I don't be happy
to answer them
yeah I hope you all are having a
wonderful day and I will see you guys
next time bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
