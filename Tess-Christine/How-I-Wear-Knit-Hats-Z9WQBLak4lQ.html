be kind of a fashion styling video in my
last video which was the I heart fall
tag I mentioned that my favorite fall
accessory was hats like these kind of
winter hats and I got a lot of requests
to do a video kind of styling them and
at first I didn't really know how to go
about this because I didn't really know
what a lot of you guys meant but then a
few of you said I don't know how to wear
them or I don't know what to do with
them when I get them so I thought it
would make a really quick video for you
guys showing you how I wear different
styles of these kind of wool or knit
hats that you can buy and you see like
everywhere nowadays hopefully it answers
your guys's questions for all of you
that asked for it if you are interested
in seeing how I wear these funky little
hats then please keep on watching so the
first style of these wool hats are these
ones and these are the really really
thick ones you can buy so they're not
like the circle ones or kind of like
round or shave ones which I'll show you
in a second but these ones are actually
kind of like big long big thick like ol
hats so how I like wearing these is
usually when it's like really cold out
because these will definitely keep you
warm I mean they're super cute on your
head but they actually do serve a
purpose in keeping your head warm so how
I basically wear these is I usually have
my hair down for these just because I
think it looks a little bit better and I
just basically stretch it over my head
until I get like right up to the top of
my head and it goes directly over my
ears so this is why this hat is actually
very effective because it actually does
cover your ears and keep most of your
head warm so these are really awesome
this purple one I got at Topshop and
then this one I got actually in like a
local store so I guess I'll just show
you what this one looks like on - it's
basically the same as the other one and
it just keeps your back your head warm
and your ears warm and I like these
because they're slouchy in the back so
they give kind of like a relaxed feel
anyways so now that you know how to wear
these on your head I will show you the
circle ones which I think you guys have
seen a lot more because those are in a
lot of stores like forever 21 H&amp;amp;M that
kind of stuff so I'll show you those
okay so these are the circle ones you
can get both of these I actually got a
target you can find these I like I said
pretty much anywhere what I mean by
circle hats is the best way I can
describe them is when you look at them
they kind of lay flat like a like a
circle see they're very different in the
big wool ones and the fact that and the
way that they're shaped and the
thickness of them - because these aren't
as thick as those okay so however this
is pretty very simple all I do is
basically take the Hat open it up put it
on my head right about to my part like
here and then I do like to leave like
these front sections out just to give my
hair I don't know
bit more dimension I guess I don't know
I just think it looks better with
framing my face but that's totally
optional you do not have to leave these
back pieces out or the front pieces as I
read so basically all I'm doing is
taking the rest of this hair now you can
leave it out if you want to I think it
looks just as cute if you leave it out
but if my hair is not looking very cute
that morning I basically just take it
take all this hair and basically just
shove it in the Hat like so I think this
one looks really cute
I wear this a lot I like wearing
earrings with it and then just putting
on either a sweater or a jacket or
something and it looks super cute I
really like wearing it like this
especially when I'm running late I've
been using this hairstyle well not
really hair style but this hat technique
a lot lately because it keeps my hair up
and I don't have to do anything to it in
the morning I can just kind of wake up
and put this hat on and I'm like good to
go
so this is definitely like one of my
go-to things right now when I'm running
late I will show you it with leaving it
out um basically all I do the same thing
with big wool hats I basically just put
it on over like this and I'm good to go
so they're super easy a lot of you guys
are asking how I wear them basically
that's it it's really really really
really simple and it's a quick hair fix
absolutely love hats so I really hope
