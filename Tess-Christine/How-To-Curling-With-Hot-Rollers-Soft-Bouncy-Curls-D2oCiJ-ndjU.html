be a hair tutorial curling your hair
using hot rollers and I've never shown
you guys how to curl your hair with hot
rollers before because this is actually
my first time using them and I got a
request on my facebook page to show you
guys how to use hot rollers in your hair
and I thought it was a great idea
because I had not shown you before and
they're kind of tricky but yet really
fun to use because they kind of come up
with different outcome of curls versus
like a curling iron curls but I do want
to say I've been getting a few comments
on that I'm doing a lot of curling hair
tutorials and that is mainly because
those are my top requested hair
tutorials now if you're the type of
person who are sick of my hair tutorials
and me teaching you how to curl your
hair please please please leave a
comment below either in on this YouTube
video on my Facebook page on my Twitter
send me pictures of anything you want
that doesn't involve curling your hair
because I've gotten a lot of comments
lately well not a lot just a few asking
me why am i doing so many curling hair
tutorials and that's because I've been
getting so many requests from them and
to me they're all very different and a
lot of people curl their hair the same
way so when you guys request celebrities
and stuff I redo them for you guys
because you guys asked me to so I do
want you guys to keep that in mind if
you have a hairstyle or anything like
that that you've seen a picture of and
you want me to do that doesn't require
curling your hair please let me know and
I would be more than happy to do it but
I'm trying to please everyone here so
please keep that in mind I'm trying to
do as many videos as possible but today
was actually another requested one so I
just want you guys to keep that in mind
and it is using hot rollers and like I
said in the beginning of the video I've
never used hot rollers before but I
wanted to try it out for you guys
because I really like the outcome of it
and I've seen a couple YouTube videos
using them and so I thought it would be
really fun so the hot there the hot
rollers or curlers or whatever that I'm
using are from Flatiron expert and is
the Bayliss Pro ceramic and ionic
curling set thing it looks like this
they're basically just hot rollers
they're really really easy to use and
they come with all different sizes the
ones I use in this tutorial are the
purple ones the blue ones and the pink
ones so yeah it's really really easy to
do and I was very surprised and it
doesn't take very long at all the only
thing that takes long is just like
waiting for it to cool in your hair but
otherwise
super simple so if you're interested in
seeing out how I curled my hair with hot
rollers please continue watching this
video thank you guys all so much for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye everyone once I flip the
on switch to high it takes about 10 to
15 minutes for the curlers to completely
warm up and get to the right to temp
temperature to curl your hair the
curlers themselves have these little
grooves on them that allow your hair to
grip on easily when you're rolling it up
so it makes the curling process a lot
easier
as for my hair itself I did blow-dry it
after I showered it and I did straighten
straighten a few of the flyaway pieces
that I have naturally but obviously
that's totally up to you if you have
naturally straight hair this will work
fine and if you have really curly hair I
would recommend doing what I did so now
I'm taking one of the medium sized
curlers and I'm taking the strand of
hair that I have and wrapping it around
the curler about halfway and then I'm
just gonna go up and with a clip secure
that in place now the reason why I am
starting about halfway onto the hair and
wrapping it around I just found that
it's a lot easier than going all the way
down to the end of my hair piece and
starting to curl it up because I have a
lot of layers in my hair and when I
start at the very end of it a lot of the
layers fall out and it makes it a lot
more tricky for me to get all of the
hair around the roller and the sections
of hair that I'm taking our medium to
large sections because I don't want my
hair to be super tight curls I want
these to be kind of like looser bouncy
or curls and if you take smaller
sections of hair it's gonna give you
tighter curls and that also depends on
the size roller that you you're using so
when I'm picking the rollers it doesn't
really matter what type you go for just
remember that the bigger the roller the
looser and bigger the curls gonna be and
the smaller the roller the tighter the
curl is gonna be so if you want really
tight curls definitely go for the
smaller rollers but if you want bigger
looser curls go for the bigger ones and
how I'm selecting the rollers I'm kind
of doing the bigger ones towards the
front top section and then the smaller
like little pink ones I'm gonna do on
the bottom since that's where my hair
normally falls out of the curl so just
keep that in mind when you're doing it
there's no really precise way that I'm
doing it it's just kind of random and
kind of how I want I'm doing one every
other in different sections
so now all I'm gonna do is do the same
process on the other side of my hair and
as for how many rollers I'm using on
each side it ends up being about six or
seven rollers on each side of my hair
obviously this will depend on your hair
thickness or hair type there's enough
rollers and enough clips definitely when
you buy this set for you to be able to
use as many as you want I have a lot of
curlers left over once I'm finished
because like I said I only use about six
or seven on each side so it's basically
really simple I'm gonna do is keep
repeating that process until I finish
here and then I'm gonna wait about 15 to
20 minutes for the curlers to completely
cool now it's really important to let
your hair and the curlers completely
cool or the curls are not gonna stay the
way you want to so after about 20
minutes now I'm just gonna basically
take out each roller and this part is
really simple they rip they fall out
quite easily you don't really have to
worry about tugging or pulling on your
hair it's really really simple and you
get these nice bouncy curls at the
bottom which is the whole point of
rollers I think it's really fun because
they give you these bouncy curls on the
end instead of curls all the way up like
how a curling iron would so yeah I'm
just going to finish taking these out on
the rest of my head
now once all the rollers are removed you
can kind of play with your fingers mess
it up a little bit just so you know that
when you do run your fingers through it
at least for mine the curls did fall out
a little bit so keep that in mind when
you are taking them out but all I did
was finished with hairspray and that is
the finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this and thank you all so much
for watching bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
