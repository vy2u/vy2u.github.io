very quick and simple hair tutorial and
that is going to be me showing you how
to do a fishtail braid and this is kind
of like my version or what I like to do
when I do a fishtail braid
it's kind of just like a messy second
day hair look for me so I thought I
would share with you guys because I know
you guys all love second day hairstyles
because they're super easy super quick
and this gets your hair out of your face
out of your everything it's just kind of
up and back but it still looks really
cute so if you are interested in seeing
how I did this fishtail braid please
keep on watching I will see you guys in
my next video bye guys so for me it's
the easiest to start out with straight
hair now this is my second day straight
hair so it's obviously optional but this
is just how I found the easiest to do
this braid so now I'm gonna do is tease
the crown of my head because my second
day hair needs a little bit more volume
so that's when I that's what I'm gonna
do to give my hair a little bit more
life now I'm gonna do is take that back
section and pin it on the lower nape of
my neck and push it up a little bit this
is just gonna give some volume and make
my hair not look so like pin down to my
head when I do the braid so I'm just
gonna take two bobby pins and loosely
secure that I don't want it to be too
sectioned off from the braid next I'm
going to gather my hair to one side it
doesn't really matter what side but I'm
going to do the opposite side of where I
have more of my hair so on the side
where it is parted that's where I'm
gonna gather my hair and now I learned
this from city and makeup if you watch
her on YouTube I found this way a lot
easier to do the fishtail braid and it
is just placing a ponytail there but
we're gonna take it off later it's just
gonna make it easier for you to braid
the hair actually in the strand so now
all I'm gonna do is take that ponytail
and split it in half now once I have the
two sections split in half you're gonna
grab outer sections of your hair and
bring it in to the middle and gather it
with the opposite section this is
actually a very simple braid it just
takes time practicing on gathering both
sections and kind of holding it on
securely so now all I'm gonna do is
repeat that process I'm just gonna grab
from the back section and bring it over
and connect it with the other section
take the back section bring it over the
ponytail and gather it with the other
section so it's just gonna take some
time working your fingers and practicing
with that to make sure you're holding
the sections right and then all I'm
gonna do is make sure I'm pulling tight
each time now I want this braid to be
kind of loose but at first I want to
keep it tight so
make sure you do that because it'll be
easier for you to see the fishtail braid
and be able to gather other sections of
hair and try to keep in mind to take the
same section of hair on each side I know
it can be kind of tricky to do that as
well but make sure you're taking the
same sized sections because then it's
going to give a very even fishtail braid
so now I'm going to do is repeat that
process all the way down the ponytail
I'm just going to take a section from
the back and bring it to the other
section and you're just gonna repeat
that until you get down however far you
want on the hair hair strand
now once I get to the bottom of the
ponytail or however long you want to
braid it down I'm just going to secure
that with an elastic
now the ponytail that you place at the
beginning you're just gonna basically
slide that down the braid it comes off
really easily and it's no problem at all
and it makes your life a lot easier so
now I'm gonna do is pull the fishtail
braid out a little bit I'm just gonna go
by each sections on my hair strand and
just pull it out just to give it kind of
a looser look and make it look a little
bit more messy and a little less
uniformed and so once I pull out to the
amount that I want I'm just going to
finish with some hairspray and pull out
strands around my face this is what it
looks like from the back I just think
this is a really really cute hairstyle
and it looks great for a second day hair
it's just kind of like a messy way to
keep your hair out of your face so yeah
that's the video I really hope you guys
liked it and I'll see you guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
