be doing a hair tutorial on what I like
to call messy curls and I love doing
this hairstyle because I think it's very
fun and curly and it doesn't look like
you took a lot of time to get ready
because the curls are loose and messy
and I just think this very this
hairstyle is very very fun and cute and
that's why I wanted to share it with you
all you're going to need is this curling
iron that I use like every day but it's
a Conair 1 inch I believe curling iron
and then hairspray and he protect it
that's all you really need and yeah then
you have the look so I guess that's it
so let's get into the tutorial alright
hi guys the first thing we're gonna do
is with blow-dried hair we're going to
section off our hair I like to section
mine a little bit above my ears and then
just tie that off next we're gonna take
our curling iron and we are gonna use
the clamp and we're gonna wrap the curl
away from our face
take another section of your hair and do
the exact same thing now for this
section you want to wrap the hair the
opposite direction so not towards your
face and then just repeat and spray with
hairspray and now take another section
down section off again I like to section
mine off by my eyebrows this time
now we're just going to do the same
thing again every other so first wrap it
away from your face and then to your
face and the reason why we do this is
because if you do it all the same
direction you're going to get the curls
to be uniformed with each other and kind
of blend in this way the curls will
cannot be all separate spray with
hairspray again now take the last layer
down since I have more hair on the side
where I part my bangs I like to section
that off one more time
now we're just gonna repeat again go
away from your face and then to your
face this will just prevent the curls
from blending in with each other now
once that's done spray with hairspray
and flip your head over and spray it
again and now take your fingers and run
it through the curls now with the
teasing comb we're going to tease the
crown of our head
I like to tease from the back to the
front so I can control how high my
Plouffe is and we are going to tease
after we curl this time because we want
the girls to be messy so it doesn't
matter if her fingers rooting them now
with a another comb we're gonna swings
down the booth
spray with hairspray and it's finished</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
