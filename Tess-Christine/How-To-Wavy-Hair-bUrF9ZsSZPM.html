be doing a hair tutorial and I'm really
excited to do this look because it
actually was a request by one of my
subscribers so I'm really excited to do
it for her and secondly it is my go-to
hair look unless I'm like in a hurry and
I jump out of the shower and just
scrunch my hair then I'll do that but
otherwise if I'm actually making an
effort to do my hair I choose to do this
look because it looks very natural and
just very pretty and I really like it it
it's I would say I would consider this
wavy hair uh yeah I really really really
like this look and I hope you guys do
too so the products we're going to use
today are one a curling iron and this is
a 1 inch curling iron I believe and the
one I'm using is by Conair and I really
like this curling iron I've been using
it for years and years and years and it
is the curling iron I use pretty much
every day so really recommend this one
and then the second thing you're gonna
need is a brush and a comb to tease your
hair I'm using an actual teasing comb
you can get these pretty much anywhere
now especially a hair salons they have
them all the time then you're gonna need
hairspray I'm using matrix's ba-boom
hairspray I just recently got this and I
really like it so far so yeah I
recommend that and then heat protectant
and I'm using the Chi 44 iron guard he
protected and then I've clipped to
section off your hair and you can get
these pretty much anywhere Target
Walmart they come in those little
packets but yeah I really hope you guys
like this look and let's get into the
tutorial ok so the first thing you're
going to do is section off your hair
into layers I like to put it start the
first layer right above my ears and then
all you're going to do is clip it up and
with a brush brush through your hair and
then with heat protectant spray the
layer and brush through it again to make
sure the heat protectant gets all
throughout your hair and then with a
curling iron wrap the hair
around the barrel do not use the clamp
of the curling iron because the clamp
will give you more of a circle shaped
curl and then by wrapping it around the
barrel I'll give you sort of an s-shaped
curl which I'll show you in a second and
that's what you want to create the
wave-like effect then repeat it through
the rest of the layer of your head right
and then spray it with hairspray and
then take it your hair down and section
off again I like to section mine right
by my eyebrows and then all you're going
to do is repeat the same step again wrap
it and repeat alright and then take the
top layer of your hair down and now you
are going to tease so take the section
off hair at the crown of your head and
spray some hairspray and start teasing
and I like to do my eye tease it and
layers and I like to do it from the back
to the front because it gives you
control of how big you want your pouf
and yeah gives you a bigger pouf and
then spray that tap with hairspray and
then now I'm going to section off the
layer that has more hair where I part it
to the side and now I like to smooth
down my baby girls on the side of my
head I have little tiny hairs that curl
and I like to smooth it down with the
clamp then all you're going to do is
repeat on that side and spray down what
you've done and then on this side I'm
going to clamp my baby hairs again and
then this time on this side of your head
throughout the entire part of that side
of your head make sure you point the
curling iron down switch hands this will
give you have the curls go away from
your face now take your fingers and run
it through your hair to create a natural
effect wave and then finish with
hairspray and you are all finished I
hope you guys like this one
alright that was the look for today and
I really hope you guys enjoyed it and I
really hope that you can go out and do
it yourselves
alright until next time see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
