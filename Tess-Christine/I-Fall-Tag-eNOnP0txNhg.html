be a tag video and today's tag is the I
heart fall tag I really liked this a lot
I don't usually do tag videos but I
thought I would give this one a go
because I liked the questions a lot and
I thought I would just share it with you
since almost my favorite season and I
mean I might as well so if you're
interested please keep on watching ok so
the first question is what is your
favorite fall lip product and that is
super easy because it's been my favorite
for ever now and you guys have heard me
rant and rave about this but it is this
the Revlon just bitten kissable balm
stain but this color in particular is my
favorite for fall the color is crush
it's my favorite I've gotten so many
people hooked on it I'm wearing it on my
lips now I've worn it in actually a lot
of videos so I don't know this is just
the perfect color it looks good on so
many different skin tones you definitely
should try this out if you haven't
already because I'm obsessed with it the
next question is what is your favorite
fall nail polish and this is kind of not
hard but I mean I love any kind of like
dark colors for fall so any kind of dark
colors on my hand or I'll go completely
opposite and go for like the neutral
like very nude paint colors so it's a
toss-up between the two but I decided to
pick with the dark colors because I
think that I like those a little bit
more my two favorites in particular are
both by Essie and one is wicked and
that's this one and this one is a super
super deep red color
it almost looks black but it's not it's
just a very very dark color I really
like this a lot and then the one that
I'm wearing on my nails now is fishnet
stockings and I've told you guys about
this before but I really like this one
is what is your favorite Starbucks fall
drink and I guess I didn't really know
how to answer this one because I don't
really like the fall drinks at Starbucks
comes out with during the fall or winter
seasons like the pumpkin spice I'm not a
huge fan of that I don't really like
that flavor very much at all I kind of
stick with my favorite there I guess
what I usually get at Starbucks is
either the white chocolate mocha or the
chai tea the next question is my
favorite fall candle and this one is
been talked about a ton but I actually
don't really buy that many candles
because I don't burn them all that often
like I do every once in a while when I
don't know I want to just make my room
smell really good or
our living room but in particular and my
favorite one is leaves this is the one I
burn the most as you guys can see we
keep this in our living room at our
apartment so it's burned quite a lot I
know everyone talks about this but I do
really like it because I'm not a huge
like candle freak so I just buy a few
and this one happens to be my favorite
right now what is your favorite fall
scarf or accessory and I'm a big scarf
fan but I wear kind of like one or two
in particular that are just kind of big
like wool scarves so I didn't really
want to share those so because I don't
know you guys have seen those plenty of
times though my favorite accessory would
be hats these in particular these things
they're like the knit hat I don't know I
love them they're perfect for when I
don't really want to do my hair because
it basically hides your hair underneath
these things this one I got at Target
and this one I got Topshop there
basically this one's a little bit more
slouchy as you can see and this one I
mean I kind of like shove all my hair in
this and it works out perfectly so I
really really love these kind of big
wool hats for fall definitely definitely
a favorite
let's see you haunted house haunted
hayride or haunted corn maze um all
haunted okay this is my thing I have a
love/hate relationship with anything
scary I love it and hate it at the same
time so when it comes to like scary
movies haunted mazes haunted hay rides
anything like that I hate them because I
hate being scared like it's just I hate
anything scary because I am like the
biggest baby ever I get so scared at
those things but I love it at the same
time because I'll watch scary movies
I'll go to haunted houses I just like
love the feeling but I hate the feeling
I don't know do you guys know what I'm
saying when I talk about that because I
hope you do I've never been on the
haunted hayride but I'm going on one
this weekend so I'm super excited about
that because I've never been on the
haunted hayride but probably what would
scare me the most is a haunted corn maze
because I don't know walking through the
corn maze or like corn fields um would
just scare me so much because they could
like pop out at you and you could get
lost I don't know it freaks me out
and I don't know if I could do that one
the next question is your favorite
Halloween movie now for this so I'm
going to tell you guys two answers
because one is going to be like a cutesy
Halloween movie and
for that like cutesy kind of fun
Halloween movie you would probably be
Halloweentown on Disney Channel I love
all of them
they're classic Halloween movies for me
so probably Halloweentown definitely
Halloween time but as for like scary
Halloween movies probably the ones that
get me the most are Halloween with like
Mike Myers those creeped me out really
bad candy to eat on Halloween um I guess
well candy like my favorite candy
doesn't really change because it's out
all year they just come out with like
Halloween packaging um so I kind of
didn't want to cheat you guys out on
this Anson or so my favorite Halloween
kind of or like fall treat I guess
that's out is definitely caramel apples
I love caramel apples so much at apple
orchards oh they're so delicious and
they usually only are around during this
time so that's definitely my favorite
what are you dressing up for for
Halloween now I was between three
different things because I couldn't
decide I wanted to be a nerd the Black
Swan or a mermaid so I was totally torn
between those three things um I think
I'm gonna be a nerd I've always wanted
to be a nerd for Halloween and I never
have so I think I'm gonna be one I know
it's not very original because everyone
does that but I don't know I just really
want to be it and I have like super cute
outfit picked out for it so I'm thinking
that I really want to be a nerd but the
Black Swan and the mermaid would have
supercool makeup and like hair I don't
know it's such a toss-up for me I don't
know follow me on Instagram and you'll
find out I'll put it below because you
guys really should the last question is
what is your favorite thing about fall
and follows my favorite season and I
told you guys that a billion times but
my favorite thing about fall is
definitely the weather like I told you
guys in previous videos I live in
Minnesota so the weather in the fall is
like perfect for me here it's not too
cold it's not too hot it's just perfect
and then also the colors I'm absolutely
obsessed with the tree the trees and the
leaves changing colors and I don't know
I'm just I don't know I love fun I
