to be a January favorites video you guys
know that normally I don't do favorites
videos just because stuff doesn't change
from you month to month but this past
month for some reason I tried a whole
bunch of new products and I found that I
really liked a lot of them so I I mean I
don't have a ton of new stuff but I have
a few things that I wanted to show you
guys because I find these videos really
helpful on YouTube and I hope you guys
do too so to start out the safest video
I'm gonna begin with makeup products and
this in particular is kind of like a set
and I've been really liking this for the
past month Tarte sent over their new
Tarte makeup bag and I've been trying
out all the products that are inside and
they're all really really good products
I'm wearing them all in my face right
now and the reason why I wanted to share
it with you guys in this favourites
video is because not only do I think
that they're really good products but
it's actually gonna be on sale on QVC
it's gonna be kind of like a one day
only thing and this and all the goodies
inside this is gonna be for $59 which is
a super good deal because if you are
familiar with Tarte products you know
that they are kind of on the pricier
side so to get all of these really good
products and new ones might I add for
that cheap of a price which sounds kind
of pricey but for how much you're
getting in this makeup bag and for the
quality of Tarte cosmetics is a really
good deal in my opinion so these are all
the makeup products that I'm really
liking this month because it's all I've
really been trying that's like new so I
definitely wanted to include it in this
January favorites so I'm gonna kind of
briefly go through everything in this
bag and show you guys what's inside that
way if you're interested on QVC you can
definitely purchase this I'll have a
bunch of links below to where you can
find all this and all that jazz inside
you get this which is the Amazonian clay
12-hour full coverage foundation now you
think Amazonian clay
are you kidding I'm not putting clay on
my face like that's what I thought of
when I first got this I was like that's
gonna be so cakey and thick like gross
but I was pleasantly surprised all I do
is take little dots and put them on my
face of the foundation and then they
also give you inside this bag a
foundation brush which is kind of like a
flat top kabuki so I basically just buff
it into my face and surprisingly it's
actually really light and it goes on
really light on your face so I really do
like
it is full coverage so it will cover
those thoughts that you don't want
noticed so I really like that a lot so
if you're looking for a good full
coverage foundation I would definitely
go for this one it does have SPF 15 in
it - which sunscreen in your foundation
is kind of like a bonus for me and
that's how kind of how I look at it
because it's kind of like a twofer if
that makes sense
so yeah you get those two things in
there and then you also get this which
is the Tarte the brow architect brow
shaper liner and definer and this one is
a super cool thing you get three things
in one and you're probably thinking what
but first you get a shaper which is just
like a basically a bristle brush to like
comb through your eyebrows and then you
get the liner which mine is in a light
brown color to fill in brows or any
areas that you want to shape or anything
like that and then you also get a little
concealer which basically conceals you
know any flyways or like straight hairs
and then you can also shape them and
make them really defined which I think
that's so cool I've never had like a
brow pencil that has that in there so
that's really really nice and really
handy that it's all like compact in here
the next thing you get is a blush and
this one is a really pretty baby pink
color it's called fearless and it looks
like this it has a little shimmer in it
too which i think is really really
pretty you do have to have a light hand
with this because otherwise it can go on
super super pink I am wearing it on my
cheeks now I think it's really really
pretty and kind of like a basic pink
color that you'd want to have the next
thing you get is a lipstick and this is
kind of like a my lips but better
lipstick so it's nothing too intense so
I like that a lot because it's good like
everyday lipstick and then the last
thing you get in this makeup bag is a
mascara and it's the lights camera
flashes mascara which i think is kind of
a fun name the brush is very very big
which I actually like some people don't
like big brushes but I really do I think
it gets into your lashes a lot better
and this one has short and long bristles
so it combs and length lengthens and
thickens your lashes which is funny
about this because when I first started
using this you can actually feel it
combing through your lashes which i
think is super cool and I think that's
partly the reason why the brush is so
big and that's why I can feel it so well
but it actually does
home your lashes really really well so
that's everything that you get inside
this makeup bag I think they're really
really good quality products and
definitely think you get what you pay
for and the deal that you get is really
good because most of the times
foundation can be just as expensive as
this whole bags moving on to another
kind of I guess makeup or beauty thing
that I'm really liking and it is
individual eyelashes now I really wanted
to try these for so long just in general
because I know that a lot of TV shows
that I watch like Vampire Diaries for
instance they use individual eyelashes
on all the girls and I always think
their eyelashes look so good but not in
a fake way if you know what I'm saying
so I really wanted to try them I don't
usually wear these like day to day I
usually only wear fit false eyelashes
for events or like something fancy going
out something like that but sometimes
the regular false eyelashes I'm not a
huge fan of always just because I think
you can see the band and sometimes it
gets a little sloppy so I think these
look super natural and I really really
like them moving on to my next favorite
is for your teeth now a while back
probably two summers ago I want to say I
made a video on whitening my teeth and I
use the cras 3d white strips these are
still my favorite they work really well
for me now my roommates hate these so I
think this is kind of like a trial and
error product for you because like for
instance my roommate Alex has tried
these and say that they make her gums
hurt really bad so she just cannot use
them at all
see for me they don't faze me like I can
use them and I used I don't use them
every day I use them every soft and
maybe like once a week but they don't
hurt my gums at all after I use them but
for my roommate Alex they do so I really
like these they're one of my favorites
but I would definitely try them out
maybe and see if they work for you and
if it makes your gums hurt then I would
say try something else
you guys know that I stopped using
Proactiv just because I wanted to change
it up and I found that I really liked
the clean and clear advantage
exfoliating scrub it's like a three-step
process kind of similar to Proactiv but
I've been really liking that when my
roommate actually got me onto that but I
tried a new one and it is the clean and
clear advantage daily soothing acne
scrub and this has aloe and avocado in
it and so I immediately was drawn to
that because I'm kind of on an avocado
cake lately that's kind of another
my favorites and I was gonna save to the
end of the video but one of my food
favorites right now is avocado so I
thought it was kind of funny that I
tried this new facial scrub my roommates
were like of course you got this one has
avocado in it I don't know what my deal
with avocado is lately but I've just
been loving it I think it smells so good
and normally I would say fish face wash
does not smell good it smells especially
like acne medicine or acne face wash
does not smell good at all so I don't
know why this one does but it does the
next thing is kind of a food is or like
nutritional item that I've been really
loving right now and I made a video back
when I made the crest 3d white strips on
my diet and fitness and it is I talked
about in that video I talked about this
it's called body bye-bye it's a
nutritional Shake Mix I stopped using it
for a while after that but I'm kind of
back on this now just because I am NOT
kind of on a nutritional kick and I've
been working out a lot and I'd really
really like this for after I workout you
can take it to lose weight I guess it's
for weight management but I'm not taking
it for that reason I'm just taking it
for healthy nutrition which is another
way you can use this product I will link
my old diet and fitness video in the
description box below in case you are
interested in learning more about that
because I do explain this more in detail
in that video so I'll have that linked
below but I'm definitely loving this and
have been for the past like two months
now my last favourite in particular is a
fashion favorite and these boots are
them and these are by Windsor and I
really like these a lot I've been
wearing the crap out of these in these
winter months they have salt and snow
stains all over them but I've been
wearing them like crazy they just match
everything they go with pretty much
everything in my closet they're perfect
I love them I made a styling fashion
video with these boots in particular so
I'll have that linked below or it might
be on the sidebar was wandering my
recent videos where I made styling these
so you guys can get a better look at
them like I said they're from windsors
so yes that is it for my favorites video
I didn't want to throw in some random
favorites but I couldn't really think of
any for you guys I told you guys that
I've been like OD'ing Annika kados like
that has been
absolute favor I don't know what the
deal with that is a lot of you guys are
asking me to do random favorites and I
can't think of any this month but next
time I will think of new ones for you
guys but anyways I hope you guys found
this video helpful and found some new
products that you guys want to try out
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and I will see you guys next time
bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
