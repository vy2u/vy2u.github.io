with some last-minute
easy couple costume ideas so I really
hope you find this helpful these are
some of my favorites so I really hope
you guys enjoy and let's get started
okay so for this first costume you could
be at Mia Wallace &amp;amp; Vincent Vega from
pulp fiction and if you don't know who
these two are you definitely should
watch this movie it's a classic it's so
good it's definitely one of our
favorites and it's a very popular couple
costume because it's so easy a lot of
the stuff you can probably find in your
own closet already so it's perfect for a
last-minute costume so for Mia's costume
the basic thing you need is a white
button-down shirt now you could go for
the classic collar one which is what she
wears in the movie but I wanted to
change it up a little bit just in case
there is other Mia's out there um so I
went for this off the shoulder one from
Windsor which I think matches her vibe
very well and then for the rest of it
you just need some black jeans I just
wore some I already had in my closet
along with some strappy black sandals
but you could also go for black pumps
and then you need a black wig unless
your hair is already like this which is
epic
but I got mine off of Amazon and then I
wore some red lipstick and carried
around fake cigarettes for perhaps for
Vincent the main thing is an all black
or dark-colored suit so your guy
probably has this already in his closet
if no if not they're fairly easy to find
for super affordable price and then
underneath that he needs a white
button-down shirt with a bolo tie that's
huge I found one super cheap off of
Amazon if he has long hair you can tie
that low back up on the nape of his neck
and with strands coming out at the top
and then for an added fun crop you can
buy like a fake syringe at the Halloween
store because that's kind of what
happens in the movie he stabs me in the
heart with the syringe if you watch it
you get it um but anyways that's it it's
so easy and it's an epic costume when
this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're
gonna see some serious
okay so costume idea number two is a
super fun one
this is Marty McFly and Doc from Back to
the Future and this one I feel like is
really underrated I don't know why I
haven't seen more of these duo's on
Halloween because this one is so fun and
if you're the type of couple that
doesn't like to dress all cutesy for
Halloween this one is perfect for you
because I think Pat and I could not say
serious space areas for one clip of this
because we were laughing so much so this
one's very easy as well for Marty's
costume all you're going to need is a
white and black button-down shirt a red
vest and a denim jacket that's kind of
like his main top on part that's gonna
kind of like stand out for the rest of
it you just need some light washed denim
jeans and some like vintage looking
sneakers he wears Nikes with like the
red stripe but I just had some white
ones already that I just wore or of
course you can wear converse another
thing is he wears aviators or some type
of like sunglasses and then I have
bought a Casio watch like an old baby's
watch from Amazon like that like always
I'll have all the stuff links you can
buy it super easily and then if you can
skateboard which I can't but you can
carry on a skateboard or skateboard all
night which would be really fun so
moving on to a Doc's costume this one is
also very easy and Pat actually had a
lot of the stuff in some closet um so
you only need to buy a few things so
starting off with the main parts of his
outfit you need some some sort of like
khaki colored pant um and then like a
floral or patterned shirt doc always
wears this kind of like crazy stuff
underneath his lab coat you could go for
like the one suit lab coat if you wanted
to but this one is just a little bit
easier so we just bought a lab coat off
of Amazon and then a crazy like Einstein
mad scientist wig with some glasses and
it looked perfect like he definitely
recognizable especially if you stand
together I just think it's so fun and
you can make this a group costume too I
think it would look really epic
for the third costume we went for a
classic storybook row and we did Alice
and Mad Hatter couple-costume
we took inspiration from not only Tim
Burton's Alice in Wonderland but also
Vanessa Hudgens and Austin Butler I love
how they both kind of modernized it and
made it a little bit different from the
classic one this also makes it super
easy to pull from your own closet hence
being perfect for a last-minute costume
so for Alice's outfit I just wore this
off the shoulder denim dress which I had
all through the summer and that's truly
loose to make it more Alice I tied
around a white apron which I got from
Amazon along with my socks which are
just like a white with black bow socks
and they're like up to the knee but I
scratched them down into like my
everyday fall booties just to make it
like I said a little bit more modernized
I guess and then I wore a black choker
and then a blonde wig which I already
had from my stranger things video um but
you can go ahead and wear like a classic
Alice weight with like the bangs and
everything if you want to and then
lastly I found this little rabbit purse
from Amazon it has like the Queen of
Hearts on it I thought it was perfect it
kind of tied the whole look together and
plus you can keep stuff in it which is
awesome and then for Mad Hatter this one
was really easy to put together
also because Pat had a lot of the stuff
so he just wore some black denim jeans
with like rips and then along with his
um Brown like lace-up boots which
matched the brown hat which we bought
from a Halloween store and then around
that we tied a like a fun printed scarf
that I already had owned and then he
wore a green printed top from ASOS which
he can wear again and then to mix prints
because Mad Hatter we had put on some
like striped suspenders which again he
already had making this so easy for him
and then for the hair I just bought some
orange temporary hairspray from the
party store and sprayed that all over
his head and we even smudged some
eyeliner onto it under his eyes to make
them look even more mad and after that
the costume is complete I absolutely
love this one I think this one was her
favorite just because of how fun and
different it was and I like that we were
able to put her on
on it so let us know in the comments at
which costume we should be this year and
don't forget to check out all my
Halloween videos that I've done so far
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
