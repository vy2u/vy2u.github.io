a Wonder Woman costume this year because
it's definitely a popular one with the
new movie that came out I kind of did
Harley Quinn last year when that whole
Suicide Squad was a huge thing I always
get a lot of hate on videos where I do
popular costumes because it's like basic
but I'd like to show you guys my own
spin on it
plus it's just helpful for a wide range
of people and I just think they're
really fun and easy like this one and
you're not buying one of those like
really crappy Halloween costumes that
are plastic and never fit right I hate
those so this is in my opinion something
that I would wear if I was gonna be
Wonder Woman so I really hope it helps
you guys out okay so for my Wonder Woman
costume I obviously decided to go on
more of casual route than her actual
costume I noticed that her costume has
red and blue in it so instead of the
blue leather looking skirt I just pulled
from my own closet and just did some
similar shades of blue high-waisted
denim jeans and then some over-the-knee
boots I think you kind of get the gist
of it with the color combo and then for
my bodysuit the only things actually
that I had to go get were the bodysuit
in the accessories so the bodysuit is
from Windsor store and I thought the
bodice had a similar shape to her corset
and it's obviously a similar color so I
think it works really well
definitely more of a last-minute costume
but I think it looks really great and
it'll definitely be different from
everyone else's so then for my
accessories like the headband and the
arm cuffs those are also from Windsor
store so it's kind of a one-stop shop
making it super easy and perfect for a
last-minute costume okay so you guys
know that I'm a huge Game of Thrones fan
I love Daenerys Targaryen I did an
outfit video for her for Halloween last
year I thought I would include her in
this last-minute female character
costume video because surprisingly this
outfit that I put together is super easy
to just pull from your own closet in
fact the only thing I bought was the
dragon pin and then I obviously had the
wig from last year but otherwise it's
super easy she's this is kind of like
her winter look her wardrobe has
completely changed so I thought I would
show you guys one that I think would be
perfect for a costume party it is a
little bit warmer
keep that in mind but I definitely think
if you show up at snares targaryen
everyone will love it I feel like Game
of Thrones just has such a wide fan base
and I think it's awesome so I definitely
wanted to include her as I hope you guys
enjoy okay so for this Daenerys
Targaryen costume this is a lot easier
than it probably looks so the main
pieces you're gonna want to make sure
you get or look for in your own closet
is a black pleated midi skirt I got mine
off of ASOS super affordable and you can
read wear it for the fall season because
they are super in right now but I just
wore that and then for my top I had this
like black turtleneck pretty simple
pretty basic and then over it I had this
top that had kind of like a wrap detail
with a little bit of texture to it just
because the material was different that
I thought worked really well but any
type of blacktop on this will work well
just the key thing that you want to make
sure you have is long sleeves and in her
winter outfit she's just very very
covered so unless you want to go on more
of a sexy daenerys targaryen look then I
would probably stick to this and then
for the boots those are just over the
knee boots pretty self-explanatory but
then the key pieces to this are the like
shawl thing that she has I pulled this
belt which I actually had from my own
closet it's like a chain belt these are
kind of all over the place you can find
them off of ASOS as well or you could
just go to a craft store and get a chain
literally that's it so once you have the
chain I bought the dragon pin off of
Amazon and then I just took a long gray
scarf I was gonna originally go to a
fabric store which is totally an option
it's very affordable easy to just run
out and get but I have this long start
that kind of looked like her cape that
kind of drapes over her shoulder so I
just used the dragon pin to pin that on
the chain and it was as simple as that
really easy and I think it looks really
similar to hers especially for a
last-minute costume obviously it's not a
cosplay version but it'll do for a
Halloween party and then lastly to
finish your costume the key thing you
need is the wig or if your hair is
similar color you can do that as well
but I just think that having the wig is
kind of like a key daenerys targaryen
thing
and it'll make you more recognizable I
will have my wig that I got last year
linked below but they sell these all
over the costume shops now so you
shouldn't have a problem finding one
even if it's just a cheap one like I
said it can be super last-minute and
you'll still look good okay so this next
costume is a lara croft from tomb raider
and i love this costume there's no
denying that it's not the most original
because it's definitely been done many
many times before but there's no denying
that it's one of the easiest best
last-minute costumes because it really
doesn't involve much it's also perfect
for those of you who like to dress a
little bit more sexy for Halloween and
because it doesn't involve many clothing
pieces either but it's definitely really
easy I wanted to include it because it
fits my female character last-minute
costume idea and I wanted to remind you
all about it because it's kind of an
older one as well so yeah love it okay
for the Tomb Raider costume this one I
think is definitely the easiest to throw
together the day of Halloween because it
doesn't require much so she has a black
top and black bottoms so that's all you
really need to pull from your own closet
both my top and shorts are from Windsor
store I've seen a lot of girls modify
this so they use different color tops
like all staying in the neutral color
palette but you can totally modify this
up to you you can put your own spin on
it that would be cool but the main piece
for this is definitely the holster and
the holster belt the leg straps all of
that that's very key to her look so I
purchased mine off of Amazon you can get
these at Halloween shops or you can just
prime them overnight on Amazon really
easy so that's kind of what she has on
her body but then she also carries
around weapons I definitely wouldn't
recommend doing that I think that just
having the holster belt and the leg
straps will give it away because some of
her other key pieces that make her stand
out is her hair so for her French braid
you just basically French braid the back
of your hair all the way down I had to
add some extensions because my hair
short now it doesn't look the best but
you guys get the idea and then pull some
straps down herbs drops pieces down by
her face and you're good to go I just
added some eyeshadow all over it to make
it look like dirt and then threw on some
combat boots and those are pretty
self-explanatory straightforward just
some combat boots I'll link them if I
find
but yeah then you're done okay so this
last question is from Kill Bill and I'm
gonna show you guys how to dress up as
the bride I feel like this is another
one of those costumes that was kind of
forgotten about I feel like a lot of
people dressed up as her a while ago
since the movie is fairly old but it's a
perfect one to bring back it kind of
reminds me of my Mia Wallace and Vincent
Vega when I did with Pat last year but
this one is just so easy literally a
jumpsuit and a wig um so it's perfect
for last-minute I just think it's
another really badass costume and yes I
hope you guys like it so this last
costume is definitely my favorite
because I think it for sure stands out
it doesn't require much explanation but
her outfit in the movie she has a
two-piece so it's like a jacket and
pants so a lot of the times at the
costume shops you'll find them sold like
that which can make them get pretty
pricey
so I did my research online kind of
looked around and ended up finding this
jumpsuit which ended up being a lot
cheaper it has the similar type of logos
on hers it's definitely more of a like
cheaper material than probably the whole
leather getup but it's easy to just
throw on purchase last-minute and you're
good to go I just wore some black
booties she obviously has like these
yellow sneakers but that was just way
too intense for me so I just throw in
some black booties because it was easy
and then for the sword that was pretty
easy to find on like in like a costume
shop I'm pretty sure I got it off of
Amazon so I will link that below and
then for my wig I just have the same
wake that I used in my Halloween videos
last year for like stranger things and
mile under land I find when you just buy
like a really solid wig you can use it
over and over again so I actually lucked
out and found this lace front wig off of
Amazon if it is still there I will link
it for you guys
but this one I think is really cool
another key thing that you should do is
definitely splatter blood all over the
front of this costume and on your face
she has no shortage of blood all over
her and throughout this movie so I
definitely think it'll look even more
about us than it already does if you add
fake blood but that is it for my video
today I really hope you guys enjoyed it
if you did it be sure to give it a
thumbs up
let me know in the comments below which
look was your favorite or which should I
dress up as for Helene but yeah I will
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
