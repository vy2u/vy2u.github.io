from my normal videos I decided to jump
on the bandwagon and film and
expectations vs. reality video for two
reasons one I think that they're super
funny and two if you follow me on social
media or my blog channel you know that I
recently moved to New York City so a lot
of you guys were asking me how I've been
adjusting I think this video is a
perfect and funny way to kind of show
you guys the reality of living here if
you guys know I've only been here for
about three weeks so a lot of these I
had tremendous amount of help from my
friends Carrie and Julia they have been
here for about two years now they both
are going to school here so they were
kind enough to help me out with this
video and be in it conveniently enough
they both have YouTube channels so I
will link both of their channels below
you should definitely go check them out
because they are awesome so yeah I
really hope you guys liked this video
and let's get started before moving to
New York I knew what the subway system
was like I had taken it a few times but
you always kind of expect it to be like
this
if you catch it on a bad time it's
usually like this
before actually living in New York City
I always thought that since there were
so many subways and so many stops that
you could just come out of the subway
and you'd be at the location you wanted
to be but in reality when you get out of
the subway your final destination isn't
always right there we still have like
ten blocks to walk are you serious
I always thought this is super funny
because in television shows and movies
you always see people hailing cabs and
they make it look so easy all you have
to do is just stick your hand out there
or whistle and it just like comes up to
you I always thought that's how it was
but it's way more complicated than that
sometimes they don't even stop and
sometimes they won't even take you where
you want to go
Wow
now when you think of New York they
always say it's the city that never
sleeps so you kind of imagine your
nights and weekends to look a little
something like this
and while I do some nights most of the
time when you actually live here they go
something like this
most of you guys know that I haven't
been in the dating pool for some time
now since I've been with my boyfriend
Patrick for a while so Carrie and Julia
kind of gave me an insight to what it's
like being single in New York City you
think with the amount of people that
meeting somebody would go like this
but actually it's like this looks like
Oh way way way now this is definitely an
expectation I had because you would
think while living in New York City a
place where a lot of celebrities go and
stay or live you would just always run
into them don't but actually I haven't
yet and neither have Carrie and Julia
don't know sorry I get that a lot you
guys know I love my fashion and shows
like Gossip Girl and Sex in the City
really had my expectations set high for
how I would look during the day but in
reality for how much walking you do it
goes more like this
I laughed by far the worst
apartment-hunting
coming from Minnesota a place where it's
not a huge high demand to live prices
are pretty reasonable so you kind of
expect it not to be as bad so concreting
stop you guys now its prime location
Chelsea closed to all these trains and
it's only 45 a month I guess one for
Fatima easily yeah no uh 4500
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it I know a
lot of the reality scenarios set a
negative light on living here but to be
honest even though I've only been here
for a few weeks New York City has been
the best decision I've ever made as far
as moving I absolutely love it here the
ups and the downs
it doesn't matter to me I think it is so
much fun again I really hope you guys
enjoyed it be sure if you give me a
thumbs up if you like this kind of video
cuz I've never done it before so let me
know and I will see you guys in my next
video
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
