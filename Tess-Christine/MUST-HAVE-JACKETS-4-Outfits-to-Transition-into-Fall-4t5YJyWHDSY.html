channel today's video is going to be a
styling video and it's my first fall
video so all things great I was thinking
about what styling video I should do and
I thought about summer to fall
transition because if the weather is
like where it is where I live in New
York it's not quite fall weather yet so
like you can still get away with some of
your summer outfits but it's starting to
cool off so in my head I was thinking
okay what makes it super easy to
transition into fall weather
dang jackets so I show you guys four
crucial jackets that I think make it so
much easier to transition into fall
weather they look awesome I show you how
I style them it's perfect if you need
some shopping tips or you're kind of
looking at your leather jacket and are
like what do I do with this I got you so
I really hope you find this video
helpful and let's get started okay so
starting off with the trench or
sometimes called the Duster coat these
are absolutely awesome
I definitely recommend getting one mine
is from Lulu's I like it because it's
not too long I'm petite as far as height
goes so too long of coats can sometimes
drown me but these are awesome because
you can throw it over just your classic
t-shirt that you've been wearing all
summer or even a dress I have a wedding
coming up and I'm really excited to just
throw this on over it because it is
going to be a little bit chilly so this
is a fall jacket that I definitely
recommend getting because it just goes
with so many things so like I said I
paired mine with a t-shirt which I got
from revolve some high-waisted jeans
from ASOS some fun leopard print booties
and then I just tied a choker around my
neck
now I definitely couldn't go a whole
Jacket video without talking about denim
jackets because they are a lifesaver
they will be the best thing you ever buy
this one is from Topshop and I highly
recommend getting an oversize or
boyfriend fitted denim jacket I've had
the cropped ones more slimming ones and
I tend to not wear them as much as I
wear this one because you can layer it
so well and for fall that's key so
layering denim jackets or even pairing
it over a t-shirt and skirt since it's
like the end of summer this is perfect
so I wore a suede skirt which I actually
wear a lot in the fall that is from
Topshop I bought it last year it's
another really good purchase for the
fall time and then I just wore a cropped
t-shirt which i think is from American
Apparel some black booties which are
sock booties from Lulu's which is also
where my choker is from which is kind of
a fun studded choker and then I wore a
really cool hat that I got from chef Bob
next up we have the bomber jacket or in
this case the varsity jacket I love
bomber jackets I definitely think that
there's something to invest in I show
you guys them all the time like your
classic bomber but I wanted to show you
guys this one this is like an oversized
varsity style jacket which i think is
very fun it's super on-trend right now -
from ASOS I love the colors in it I
think it's gonna be really fun to layer
I can put hoodies underneath it it's
just going to be really good to kind of
bulk up since it is velvet so it's
definitely heavy duty and I can wear it
with a bunch of different things so for
instance since the end of summer I have
some crop tops that I haven't worn so
this one is a long-sleeve one it's from
the brand JOA I like it because it's
sweater so it's another good layering
tip and then for my shorts those are the
ASOS ones you guys know them and love
them and then um my booties are from
Urban Outfitters
and last but not least we have the
leather jacket this is kind of like the
og of jackets for me this has always
been my go-to I think leather jackets
are so awesome to layer with sweaters
along sleeve t-shirts just anything it's
just a staple but I wanted to show you
guys an end-of-the-summer look for those
chillier nights when you still want to
go out and have fun and where you're
awesome slip dresses or oral dresses
whatever you have throw a leather jacket
over it it instantly becomes a little
bit warmer but it still looks so awesome
so under my leather jacket which is from
Urban Outfitters I have a slip dress
which I had from Reformation I wore a
t-shirt under it and some sock booties
and I look was complete without they for
my video today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it let me know in the comments
below which outfit or jacket was your
favorite or that you would most likely
wear and I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
