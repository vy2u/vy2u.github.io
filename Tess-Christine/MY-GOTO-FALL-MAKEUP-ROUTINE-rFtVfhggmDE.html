channel today's video is going to be a
makeup video and I'm really excited
because I found a bunch of new products
since I last showed you guys my makeup
routine which is months ago because when
I find products that I like I stick to
your routine and don't change it out
much that's why I don't do a lot of
makeup videos on this channel but I got
a lot of requests for it from Instagram
and just like my intros and outros to
make a new one because I think you guys
have noticed that it's changed which it
has so I'm really excited to show you
guys this but before we get started
quickly I'm not a makeup artist I'm not
like a makeup guru so this is like I'm
not probably not the best at like
tutorials but I wanted to show you guys
what I did and second of all this is
like very full glam makeup like for me
at least like I don't do this every day
unless I have to film or I have an event
or something like that so I wanted to
get make you guys get the most out of
this video and show you like the full
shebang so I'm done talking let's go
ahead and get started to begin I always
start with my eye makeup first so I go
in with the benefit stay don't stray
eyeshadow primer and I put that on my
lids then I'm taking the Revlon shadow
brush and I'm picking up just a beige
color just as like the base all over my
lid then I'm going in with the Revlon
crease brush and I'm picking up like a
burnt orange color along with a light
brown color mixing the two and bringing
that into my crease and I blend blend
blend until I get the desired look that
I want I tend to sweep upwards towards
the end of my brow if that helps you at
all and then I pick up a light brown
shadow and I put that on the outer
corner and then the inner corner leaving
the center of my lid open because one of
my favorite things to do is pop like a
shimmery gold color in the center just
to brighten up my eyes but I like that
the inner and the outer are darker is
just something new that I've been doing
so then I've been back into winged
eyeliner I used to be anti eyeliner in
general for a while but now I've been
loving it again so I'm just taking a
liquid eyeliner pen and then basically
creating a wing what helps me is to
start on the outside
first and then bring it inwards um it's
just what's where's I'm not perfect at
it but it works for me so hopefully it
helps then after curling my lashes I
apply mascara I'm using the benefit
they're real mascara i comb downwards
first and then lift the lashes upwards I
just found that this works and gives the
most volume to my lashes this way so now
we're going to move on to face so the
first thing that I do is I prime my face
using the benefit Porefessional primer
and I put that all over it does give my
face of really red appearance after I do
so but it works so well so then for a
foundation I go in with the Armani
luminous skin foundation and I mix that
with the Kevin o Kwan skin enhancer I
think it's called I'll have all of the
products that I'm using in the
description box below but this is if I
want like full coverage I want it to
like last all day I'm getting my photo
taken or I'm filming this is perfect so
I use a beauty blender to blend that all
and evenly to my skin using patting
motions is key because if you swipe it
you're moving the product so Pat that
into your skin so then I'm going in with
my favorite concealer and that's the
Urban Decay Naked concealer and I put
that underneath my eyes on my t-zone and
any fill Emma shoes I have then I pick
up the Revlon foundation brush and I've
been using this recently for cream
contour like I said this is full glam I
don't do cream contour every day but I
use that brush to pick up the cream
bronzer and I place that into where you
would normally contour your face then I
go in with the Beauty Blender and I
basically start blending in the
concealer first and then I go ahead and
blend in that bronzer cream bronzer and
using patting motions if you swipe it
too much you're going to move the
product but if you swipe it at all swipe
upwards on your hollows of your cheeks
then I go in with a little puffer thing
I don't know what it is and I pick up a
translucent loose powder and I lightly
lightly bake my face I don't go crazy
with this it just helps set everything
so while that a bit bakes quote-unquote
weird I'm gonna do my eyebrows so I'm
using a benefit eyebrow pencil tool
exact name will be
oh and I'm basically filling in my brows
you guys have um or some of you have
given me crap about my brows ever since
I started YouTube but I like them like
natural-looking I know that they're
crazy I just have to live with it I'm
not perfect at this step but this is
just what I like I like to brush them up
afterwards I don't like a very thick
defined brow I like them to look messy
and natural it's just my thing I don't I
don't know so anyways after that I'm
going to go ahead and dust off all of
that loose powder that was baking on my
face and then I go in with bronzer so
I'm using the Make Up For Ever bronzer
and I'm picking up with it with it with
the Revlon a contour brush which this is
my favorite brush ever for this I just
love it so much so I basically put that
where I put all the contour and then I
will go in with a blush so I'm using the
Revlon blush brush for this and I'm
basically picking up a blush and it's
just a light color like pink color and I
place on the apples of my cheeks then I
take the revlon kabuki brush and I apply
my highlight I'm using the Becca
highlighter in Champagne pop and I love
it so much so I put that all over where
you highlight and then I go ahead and
use that same Revlon shadow brush and I
pick up that burnt orange color and I
put that underneath on my lower lash
line and then I go ahead and finish off
the eye makeup look with bottom mascara
so now moving on to lips you already
know Urban Decay Naked 2 is my jam I
love this stuff so much um so I line my
lips with that and then in my last video
I was talking about this which is the
Kat Von D bow-and-arrow um liquid
lipstick it's awesome I love this color
it's like my go-to fall color and then I
finish everything off with the tatcha
luminous dewy skin mist I think that's
what's called
and
but that is it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did be sure to give it a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments below what
winter videos you guys want to see
