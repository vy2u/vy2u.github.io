channel a today's video is going to be a
styling video and it's a fall themed one
and I know I'm a little late but this is
kind of like a phone book both my fall
style basically this is just here to
give you guys some new outfit ideas or
fashion inspiration so I really hope you
find it helpful
I love these type of videos they're
always my favorite I cannot wait for the
winter one for snow because I feel your
pain
so anyways I'm not going to waste any
more of your time and let's go ahead and
get into the video so starting off with
the first outfit I or this suede jacket
which is from Express I love suede
jackets in the fall time because they're
so easy to come by they're easy to style
I love the color of this one this one is
from Express by the way and I always
keep it simple I just wore as hangs up
and jeans for this but I kind of jazzed
about by adding a neck scarf because
I've been loving that trend this year so
that is from Lulu's and then for my
black booties I've been kind of sticking
to these ones from Steve Madden they're
so comfortable perfect for everyday
moving on to outfit number two this one
incorporates of my go-to high-waisted
denim jeans from ASOS and this hat from
shop Bob I love styling this especially
in the fall I just think it goes with a
lot of different things so how I styled
it is I wore this striped shirt from
Lulu's and then to add a little bit of
color to it to match the buttons on the
Hat I wore a brown belt and then my
fluffy teddy bear coat which I've had
for years now but these are so easy to
come by so you can find them a lot of
different places and then my black
booties from Steve Madden
this next one incorporates something
that I'm always wearing the fall time
that's kind of a staple for me and
that's big comfy fall sweaters so this
one I'm wearing is from Elliot and then
over it I'm wearing a black long coat
from Lulu's these things are great for
layering so I love kind of stacking
these things on eita on top of each
other because they're so simple and then
I'm wearing my favorite denim jeans from
Lulu's and then of course I got to have
my converse to stay comfy and then to
add something fun to it I just wore
these framed glasses that are like
aviator style from forever 21 I've been
really into rocking stripes and
turtlenecks are kind of like my go-to
for the fall because they're so easy to
layer and I just think they look really
good and on top of that they're just
very comfortable so I'm wearing the
striped one from ASOS I love the colors
in it to me it just screams fall so how
I styled it is I just wore some
high-waisted denim pants those are from
Lulu's and then I added a big chunky
belt from Urban Outfitters over if it
was a little bit chillier I wore my
denim jacket which is from Topshop which
is oversized and I love it and then of
course my black booties
for this last outfit I've been really
into a leather leggings or leather pants
I just think they kind of transform an
outfit and make them look a little bit
different so I absolutely love them mine
are from Zara they're a legging so they
were very affordable I love them
so how I styled it is I just tucked it
tucked a blouse into it then when I'm
wearing is a floral one from ribald I
love the dark floral it's perfect for
fall and then over I'm wearing one of my
favorite jackets from Macy's I love that
it's brown but it has black seams in it
so you can kind of mix it and I just
think it looks so good and then I wore
just my converse to keep it simple but
that's it for my video today I really
hope you guys liked it and found some
new fashion inspiration from it please
