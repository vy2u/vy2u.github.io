is going to be a makeup collection and
I've gotten so many so many requests for
makeup collection video so I thought I
would show it to you but just a warning
and a disclaimer that my makeup
collection is not very big I am NOT a
big collector when it comes to makeup
especially the type of makeup I use
because you guys all know that Mac
products NARS all that stuff gets very
expensive so if I try a product out or
something like that like I go to Sephora
and I buy like all these new products
like I will try them out even if I don't
like them I will finish them because but
I'm going to spend twenty plus dollars
on something I'm going to finish it so I
don't usually like collect things when I
buy them so I buy them and then I use
them up and then if I didn't like them
I'll buy new stuff or I'll repurchase so
I don't have a huge collection I just
have a small little container that I
keep all my makeup in so I will show you
everything that I have and I guess this
would be kind of an interesting video
for you guys because everything I have
in that makeup um
compartment that I keep is stuff that I
use almost everyday and that I love so
it'll give you guys good ideas on what
products I love and what products I
would recommend to you but yeah I really
hope you guys like this video let me
know what you think in the comments
below let me know if you have any
questions about any of the products I
mentioned and anything like that or if
it's anything in depth feel free to
message me I really hope you guys enjoy
give me a thumbs up and I'll see you
next time bye guys this is where I keep
all of my makeup it's just I keep it in
this three drawer plastic bin that I got
at Target what I keep on top that I
don't keep thin the drawers are my
liquid foundations or at least some of
them I keep my two Mac ones and the two
Mac ones these were like the first Mac
foundations I think I ever got
so they've lasted me quite a while but
they're the Studio Fix fluid foundation
and I have two different colors because
I was I bought one in the summer and
then I needed a different color because
I was obviously a lot Tanner in the
summer I keep these on top because these
are kind of notorious for spilling and
they don't stand upright in these
drawers so I have to keep them upright
so I just keep them on the top this one
is the mac prolongwear these are the
only matte foundations I've ever tried
and I've ever used in case you guys were
wondering the color matte foundations I
am an NC 40 + NC 35 and then this one is
NC 30 so I'm kind of all different
shades my students can change is color
with the different climates and seasons
so that's that then I also have a
benefit high beam and I use this a lot
especially in this summer and then I
have this kabuki brush that I got at
Target
it's the Sonia Kashuk line kabuki brush
shirt ever and I use this to apply my
powder fall powder foundation or powder
or whatever over my foundation and then
I also have mac's fix+ and I think this
is kind of a luxury product I won't say
it's not like an this necessity or
anything but I do like to spray this
over my face after I finish my
foundation so I kind of use it as a
finishing spray and I like it now onto
brushes on this brushed in case that I
have I got at t.j.maxx and it's a pencil
holder I believe so I kind of just made
shift it into a brush holder and this
used to not be as cluttered but I
recently bought brushes off of hautelook
or hot look calm and their crown brushes
I usually they're used to use the Sonia
Kashuk brushes which I still use and I
love these they're just a bit expensive
I think they're like they can be like
almost $20 a brush so I kind of steered
away from that but then just because
those not expensive but then I recently
went out I looked at huh and they were
having a sale let me see if I can find a
good one on crown brushes and so I
bought these crown brushes it they came
in a pack these are just like maroon
colored and they had a great deal on
them and they came in this case I'll
show you like this it's kind of like a
mock leather case and you open it up and
it holds all the brushes in there with
the flap the first drawer is going to be
kind of a boring drawer but it has the
least amount of stuff in it but I'll
start with it
sounds when I pull this open and has all
of my lip products I got this little
container at Target as well I got it
next to this bin actually so they have
all these kind of storage departments
compartments sorry
around each other so if you just go
check it I think it was like two or
three dollars but this is where I keep
all my lipsticks I don't keep them in
really any I don't organize them by
brand or anything I do organize them by
how often I wear them so like in the
back are colors that I don't wear often
and then in the front
I keep colors that I wear so like my
favorite colors would have to be this
Mac one the colors cream cup and this is
just a really pretty pink color this is
like my all-time favorite color and then
I like the Revlon's airy-fairy
and this is just a light oops this is
just a light pink color as well I'm very
into the my lips foot better look
because I'm not a huge bold lipstick
where the darkest color that I do wear
like on an everyday basis which I do
have really dark colors but on an
everyday basis I like wearing this one
and spied benefit and this is kind of
like a it's not a red it's a reddish
pink it goes on very not so dark it goes
on kind of like you ate a popsicle but
in a good way
does that make sense the color is good
to go if I benefit and I actually the
reason why I got this color is not only
I liked it but I found out that they use
this exact color in the Twilight movies
so like oh I have to get this now onto
over here I keep basically like my
everyday lip stuff so I keep like my EOS
lip balm I have two lip liners I don't
have a lot of lip liners I just have
those two ones by Victoria Secret ones
by NYX I have the two elf conditioning
lip balms ones and peacefully pink and
ones in nice natural don't particularly
like this nice and natural color because
on my lips it makes it washes me out it
makes me look a little pale like my lips
kind of blend in with my skin color and
I don't like that so this I kind of use
over two over lipsticks to tone it down
so that's where I use that one
then I just have some chapstick stuff
like that and then a few lip glosses and
then in the back I have a few backups of
things and things that I don't really
use and then this is actually a blush
palette and the reason why it's up here
is because it doesn't fit anywhere else
but um this was in my last video with
them the Transformers look or whatever I
use this I got this with the brushes
from up here and I like it so far I
don't have a lot of blushes so that
definitely expanded my blush collection
not have like every color I have
possibly need next shelf is face stuff
starting over here I have my powders to
setting this is a translucent powder
this is by Laura Mercier I absolutely
love this translucent powder powder it's
I would definitely recommend it it is
very expensive but it does last a long
time because you only need a little bit
so I absolutely love that powder I just
think it sets my makeup perfectly and it
doesn't leave a white weird residue that
some translucent powders do I have a Mac
powder that I've been using for ever
it's in the color NC 40 so it's a little
bit dark for me so I don't use that all
too often in the summer I'll use it but
um it's a little too dark because I did
buy that in the summer um the powder
that I'm using everyday right now is the
Maybelline Dream matte powder absolutely
love this I use this with that cute
kabuki brush to set my foundation next
to it I have the Laura Mercier primer
the foundation primer in oil free and
for those of you with oily skin I would
definitely recommend that because this
brand also carries on moisturizer one
and that will just moisturize your skin
a lot so um before your foundation it's
probably not the best idea this is
seriously the best foundation primer
I've used ever I've tried a bunch of
other ones I've tried a few drugstore
ones but this one seriously does the job
it leaves my makeup on all day and I'm
the type to get really oily skin and it
does not it prevents that you guys have
seen this all before it's the Laura
Mercier silk cream foundation and I am
in the color beige ivory and again you
guys have heard many things about this
foundation so I'm not going to ramble on
next I have my
moisturizer the gemma kid tinted
moisturizer in medium if you want to
know more about that check out my summer
besties tag or something like that I've
mentioned it a little bit more than that
next I have concealers and as you all
know I'm obsessed with the Sonia Kashuk
hidden agenda concealer palette so
that's up for concealer the other
concealer I have is this NARS concealer
that I used in the beginning when I
first started making videos
it's very cakey and very thick so I
found that I love this so much more than
this so um I would definitely recommend
getting this over the NARS one for sure
and then I have the erase paste by
benefit I'm almost out of this and I'm
going to show you it but the color I'm
in for this is the one I like getting my
concealers light because I do have very
dark circles under my eyes for other
concealers I have this one concealer
that I absolutely hate so I would not
get this it's the Neutrogena Healthy
Skin eye brightening pen it is just
stupid and I just don't like it at all I
used it a couple times and I don't like
it so I just keep it in there for some
reason I'm not really sure why but for
other concealer the hard candy
glamoflauge glamoflage concealer I'm in
the color light I really really like
this concealer actually a lot it's very
thick though it reminds me a lot of the
erase paste so if you like the erase
paste and you want something a little
bit cheaper try the hard candy
glamoflauge I only use this under my
eyes and I use this before my foundation
and then I use this concealer other
concealer I have this is like the first
concealer I got from Mac and it's the
secret cover-up something this was like
one of the first things I ever bought
from Mac and so I went into the counter
and I asked her you know if she could
match my color and she gave me NC 42 and
now learning about Mac and the cult the
shades then 242 for a concealer is the
complete wrong shade for me so it's very
disappointed because that just kind of
sits and I've been trying to mix color
mix concealers to kind of use this up
because I'm really frustrated with that
next I have a Beauty Blender sponge that
I used to blend my concealer love love
love
this then if we go over here I have the
Mac Wonderwoman
compact that is limited edition so I'm
not going to spend too much time talking
about it but it's I've used it in a
couple of my videos I can't even open it
for you but it's basically a three thing
it's got a highlighter a bronzer and a
blush and the color I am in is pink
power next to it it's kind of in the way
I have the Victoria's Secret bronzing
stick highlighting thing or the color I
have is bronze rays
next I have NARS Laguna bronzer I'm not
even to pull this out because us have
seen this a million times but NARS
Laguna bronzer loved that then as for my
blushes I don't have a lot of Mac
blushes but I'm one of the first ones I
got was this one I really like this one
this is light over dark it's a
mineralized blush it's basically just it
has a little bit of pink in it but it's
kind of more bronzy looking and then
another one mineralized blush I got is
this one and it's dainty and then also I
have well-dressed by Mac which is an
amazing pink blush I absolutely love
this color it's a bit light and then I
have a cream blush which is the color so
sweet so easy and I really really like
this cream blush I've been using this
everyday in the summer and then for the
elf blushes I have 3 elf blushes peachy
keen tickled pink and mallow mob so
they're all kind of normal blush colors
and I featured these in a couple of my
videos so I think one was in my summer
besties tag these are really really good
brushes the studio blushes these are
very good and I would recommend these I
would highly recommend these these are
very very good blushes next I have this
Physicians Formula shimmer strip I like
using it more so as an eye shadow than
as a bronzer or a highlighter because of
it as a bronzer it's just too shimmery
and as a highlighter it's a little bit
too dark so I like using it more for an
eyeshadow healthy glow bronzer Miami
strip a hot there it is
but yeah that's the color I have and
then I have a few other things back
there that I'm not really going to talk
about I have a couple Milani products
and I I heard about these through
YouTube and I haven't decided if I liked
them yet they're a little bit strong for
blushes you also have a light hand
but I do like them they're fairly
pigmented I have the bronzer back there
I hate it I would not recommend the
Milani bronzer it's just too shimmery
it's just like when you put it on your
face you just feel like you're glowing
and you go out in the Sun and you look
like Edward Cullen you're just like
sparkling all over it's just not cute
well on him it is but not on me and I
have this that I'm trying to open right
now the Fox in a box blush that I've
talked about I've only used this a
couple times
I'm not going to repurchase it but it's
nice to have in my collection just in
case I want that color it's a very
strong pink color so I keep the stuff
that I don't use all the time in the
back so for the last showing of another
one of these little dividers things
inside there I have the Mac painterly
paint-pot and then I have two primers
the two this one came with the Naked
palette and this one I bought on its own
Urban Decay primer potion I have this
Garnier skin renew anti puff roller
I like this eye I do like this I think
it's helped a lot I want to get the anti
dark circle one more so I think instead
of repurchasing this I will buy the
other one instead I have some NYX jumbo
eye pencils in the club used of these in
all my videos so you've seen them before
and then I keep my two mascaras I keep
gel eyeliner from a Mac and I also keep
all my eyeliners down here as well my
liquid and some eye pencils I have this
eyelash curler that's from Revlon you
guys have seen that before
anyways nothing special about that then
as for eyeshadows I have my Naked
palette and I have my Mac palette and
also underneath that I have the beach
color Beach 88 colors palette and the
cool shimmer in case you were wondering
on that and then for back here I have
backup so I have a few Mac palette
fillers I have some cream eyeshadows
that I bought have the NYX nude on nude
palette I have I have a lot of eyeshadow
palettes I like buying those more so
than individual eyeshadows because I
just feel that they are easier to store
for your eyes only mysterious for brown
eyes and I do not recommend this I have
used it a couple times and I don't like
it I like the Knicks nude on nude
palette by
I don't like this one I just feel like
this one is very cakey and powdery and I
am NOT a fan and I have not used that
more than like three times so I would
not be repurchasing that for sure these
are my absolute favorite
eyelashes because I think they look the
most natural for if you want to wear
eyelashes during the day and you don't
want to look like you are wearing
eyelashes you just want your eyelashes
to look fuller instead of wearing you
know big spidery eyelashes that everyone
knows you're wearing so um I like
wearing these a lot they I got these at
Target all the Ardell fashion lashes in
the number 135 black and I cut off the
ends here because they're a little too
blurry for me so I cut off like probably
two like here I cut from here off and I
put these on the outer corner and I just
think it looks so good and I think it
just makes my eyelashes look a lot
fuller and it brightens up my eyes a lot
more and then my Maybelline quads I have
four of them I have this one apricot or
aurora aura I don't know whatever this
is a limited edition trio from
Maybelline but I'm sure you can find
similar colors that they have in their
permanent line the next one I used in my
last video and I forgot to mention the
name so I'm sorry about that I was
meaning to put it in the description box
and I keep forgetting but this one is
called sunlit bronze the next one I have
is this one and it is plum smokes I like
getting the purple colors because like
you guys know it brings out brown eyes
so that's why I have this one I think
it's kind of a subtle pop of purple
without going too crazy that's why I
really like this and then what I
recently got is the color natural smokes
natural smoke so these are matte colors
or not there's like two shimmers and
then these two are matte which I really
like because I like mixing matte and
shimmer so I haven't used this yet
because I just recently got this so I'll
let you know what I think but yeah I
like that one a lot but yeah that is it
for my makeup collection I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I'll
talk to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
