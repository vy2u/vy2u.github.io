be an updated makeup storage and
collection video I was getting a lot of
requests after I instagrammed a picture
of kind of how I'm organizing my makeup
this year so if you are interested in
seeing my makeup let's go check it out
okay so this is my makeup organization
this is right on my desk this is how I
kind of organized my everyday makeup and
stuff that I kind of grab every day I
bought this at Amazon and a lot of you
guys were saying when you put you're
commenting on my Instagram photo that
you can purchase this at the Container
Store but I purchased mine on Amazon as
well as the lipstick container or holder
right on top I have this mac fix+ I have
the Urban Decay all nighter long-lasting
makeup setting spray I have the Make Up
For Ever HD primer also next to it I
have the foundation that I'm currently
using and it's the Chanel Vita aqua
foundation and then I also have the
benefit Sunbeam and then a benefit

basically just have lip products I have
my favorite lip balms which are the EOS
lip balms I have my absolute favorite
lip stains I'm loving these right now
these are the Revlon just bitten
kissable lip balm stains I have a lip
gloss and a few lip liners in there as
well and then I magar near 40s skin
renew anti puff roller and then in the
second drawer I have basically my
everyday face makeup so I have the Laura
Mercier translucent powder that I love
using I have my hoola benefit or my
benefit hoola bronzer I have a blush bag
here that I really like using the
coralista blush that's my favorite
summer one so that's in here right now
I have different concealers my Bobbi
Brown concealer that I use for
underneath my eyes I have my instant age
rewind concealer by Maybelline that I
really like for under my eyes as well
and then the Sonia Kashuk quad concealer
palette that I like using for blemishes
and then underneath here I have a Mac
mineralized skinfinish that I use as a
highlight in soft and gentle and then I
have this Stila convertible color dual
lip and cheek cream in the color petunia
alright and then in this bottom drawer
this is kind of like a cluttered mess
but this is basically all of my eye
products that I use on a date
basis this has a bunch of different
mascaras that I really like using if you
watch my makeup tutorials you'll know
all the mascaras in here because I use
these in almost every tutorial I have my
favorite eyeliner which is the Mac eye :
smolder and then I also have an eyelash
curler I have some of my favorite eye
shadows one is NYX in Sahara and then I
have a NARS duo right here and then this
Anastasia brow duo which I use almost
every day and the color I'm in is medium
ash I have my Mac painterly Paint Pot
that I use every day and then I also
have another primer which is the Urban
Decay primer potion in the color sin
which is kind of like a shimmery beige
or a shimmery kind of gold color and
then moving on to lipsticks obviously
lipsticks you can to use up every day so
I have a little bit of a collection over
here so like I said before I bought this
clear acrylic container from Amazon I
basically keep all of my lipsticks in
here besides the stains that I have up
here I just have these lipsticks I don't
really have much more so I have
different Mac ones and Revlon I have the
Revlon lip butters the NYX matte lip
cream and a few Rimmel London ones as
well as some Victoria's Secret one a lot
of them are just basically like neutral
nudes and pinks because that's what I
like wearing moving over here this is a
brush container that I purchased from TJ
Maxx I believe it actually was supposed
to be for like pencils or something like
that but I really like the design of it
so I got this and then a matching one
over there that I'm going to show you in
a second but this is basically where I
keep all of my brushes the brushes that
I use are mostly from Target and crown
brushes I got a good deal once on
HauteLook or whole look for crown
brushes so I just purchased a set and
that's what I've been using ever since
and then a few Sonia Kashuk brushes from
Target as well over here I have this
kind of office it's I think it's
supposed to hold like envelopes and
things like that I got purchases at
t.j.maxx so in here I keep different
palettes and also my hair brushes and
then I basically just keep palettes in
here so I have my Mac palette that I
made and then I have my two different
naked palettes and then some Beach
cosmetic palettes back here they have
the bareMinerals Matt Foundation and
then I have to Alf conditioning lip
balms and a kabuki brush and also a
Beauty Blender sponge that needs to be
cleaned I also decided to put a flower
here just to make it a little bit more
decorative I bought it at a craft store
or super inexpensive they're fake
flowers they're not real or anything but
that's basically what I keep here this
is what I use every day so that's why I
keep it on my desk and up front
underneath my desk I keep this
three-tier drawer set that I purchased
at Target I believe it's just plastic
and this is where I keep kind of things
that I don't use everyday like different
blushes I have a few different blushes
in here there's elf Mac blushes things
that I use just not you know like every
day like for school but I use this stuff
for like tutorials and stuff to give you
guys a bit of a variety I have a few
different powders and a few blushes
again as well kind of just like a
miscellaneous door drawer and then down
below I have different like Maybelline
quads I have a Revlon quad you know
things you don't use for an everyday but
stuff that I could potentially use for a
tutorial so that's where I kind of go
for this makeup all right so that
completes my makeup collection or
storage video I really hope you guys

of tips and tricks for you guys to keep
your makeup in and how to organize your
makeup if you're interested in that kind
