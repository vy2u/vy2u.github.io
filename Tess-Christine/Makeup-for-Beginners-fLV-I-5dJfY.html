going to be video all about makeup for
beginners and this is a highly requested
video from a lot of you you know for
those just starting out in makeup and
you know watch your videos here on
YouTube and can't quite achieve the look
as best as you want to so I kind of
slowed things down a little bit
explained myself a little bit better so
you guys at home can you know figure out
how to do these looks yourselves in this
video I explained how to contour your
face how where to put highlight and
blush and and like for your eyes how to
you know get the typical smoked out look
towards the edges without you know being
too crazy that everyday kind of smokey
eye so I kind of slowed things down a
little bit and showed you guys how I do
it and how I learned it and yeah and the
product that I'm using for my eyes my
face makeup is just like my face makeup
routine I used everything the same but
for my eyes I used the NYX nude on nude
palette a lot of you guys are requesting
eye makeup look for that and I did you
know just a basic smoked out one I
really hope you guys find this video
helpful and if you are a beginner
looking how to do makeup continue
watching this video alright so the first
thing I did was covered my face with my
favorite foundation I'm using the Laura
Mercier soap cream foundation in the
color beige ivory next I'm going to be
taking my concealer palette NARS it's by
NARS and it the color is vanilla honey
and I mix the two colors together and
put that under my eyes and by my nose I
kind of create a triangular effect from
my
eyes to my nose this is where you have
the darkest circle also when picking out
concealer you want to make sure you get
it close to your skin tone but try to
stay lighter because you want to
highlight under there not so much create
a darker effect because you already have
you know dark circles right next I'm
just covering up any blemishes
next I'm taking a powder to set my
foundation I set my foundation because I
have fairly oily skin and I like to have
my foundation stay on all day and this
just kind of ensures it because the
powder sets the oils in the foundation
but the powder I'm using is a Mac powder
loose powder in the color NC 40 but you
can get any powder if you have trouble
finding the color of your skin you can
always use a translucent powder there's
one by NYC that's really good and that
works a lot better too alright next I'm
taking a bronzer mine is by NARS and
it's the color Laguna and I'm taking a
angled brush
this will just help me come to her a
little bit better and how I like to
contour it is on the temples of my
cheeks my upper forehead and jaw line to
help me figure out where to contour my
face I suck in my cheek bone or my
cheeks and this kind of defines my
cheekbones and allows me to place the
bronzer underneath my cheekbones which
is where you want to put it when
contouring next I'm just kind of gonna
line my face you're kind of creating the
number three on your face in a way and
then I like to put a little bit on my
nose to add kind of a subtle glow
with the same brush I'm going to be
taking a highlight I'm just using Mac
palette it's a Wonder Woman
limited-edition palette and the pink
power or you can also use a shimmery
eyeshadow this works just as well for a
highlight if you don't have one and I
like to focus that just right above my
cheekbones it's usually right on the
outer half underneath my eye I also like
to put this on the bridge of my nose
this kind of just gives it a your nose
kind of a little glow and then on the
upper part of my top lip then with a
blush brush I'm going to be taking a
blush mine is by Mac and it's just kind
of a shimmery bronzy pink color and I'm
smiling to find my apples that's how I
like to know where to place my blush and
I'm just placing it lightly on the
apples of my cheeks all right and then
for my eyebrows I'm going to be taking
the color soft Brown by Mac it's just a
light brown color and I'm going to fill
in my brows with that color
when picking out a brow color to fill in
your brows make sure you pick them
always stick to a lighter color if you
go darker your eyebrows they're just
going to turn out black next I'm taking
a wax stick this I got at Sally's Beauty
Supply it is called femme Couture brow
grooming wax I like to use wax on my
eyebrows because it just helps to helps
your eyebrows stay in place throughout
the day mine sometimes tend to go astray
hey that right um anyways yeah I used to
use a gel and I found that made my
eyebrows a little bit crusty and nasty
but now I'm just taking a eyebrow home
and I'm kind of just combing them out
and shaping them I like them alright
next I'm going to prime my eyes using
Mac's painterly paint-pot I'm gonna
apply that all over both of my lids and
you can pretty much find eyeshadow
primers anywhere now I know that now
some drugstore brands even carry them so
pretty easy
alright then from the next do-don new
palette I'm going to be taking light
baby pink color as kind of the base for
my eye shadow look
and I'm just going to be taking a shadow
brush and placing that just on the lids
of my eyes
alright next I'm going to be taking kind
of a sandy gold color it's a light gold
color it's not too bold and I'm going to
be putting that on my lids as well this
kind of gives your lids a subtle hint of
you know a brown brownish gold color
which is very pretty and very natural
next I'm going to be taking a dome
shader brush and picking up sort of a
dark brown bronzy color and I'm going to
be focusing that on the outer half of my
eyes lips and kind of working that up to
my eyebrows I know most grooms here I
know I have made a couple eyes shadow
tutorials where they say to create a V
and that can be kind of tricky at first
so I'm starting out by just placing it
on the outer half of your eyelid will
help you create the dark smoky effect
that they are going for by not making it
too complicated for yourself
alright next I'm taking a fluffy brush
and I'm just going to blend that color
out blending eyeshadow out actually is
very beneficial to do because you are
able to control how smoky you want your
eye look if you kind of make mistakes by
adding too much eye shadow you can kind
of blend it out and kind of erase any
mistakes then to darken the look a
little more I'm just gonna take that
black color with the dome brush again
and focus that on the outer corner of my
eye this will just make the look a
little more darker if you want it either
for night or this look is very subtle
though so you could wear it this during
the day for sure but if you want to
darken it you can always add more or
less color
alright then with a flat shader brush
I'm going to be picking up from the same
palette a light shimmery beige color and
using that for my highlight I'm just
gonna focus that underneath my brows on
my brow bone and then I'm also gonna be
placing it on the inner corner of my eye
this will just brighten your eye a
little bit more alright next I'm going
to be taking the NYX super skinny marker
it's a felt tip eyeliner brush and I'm
going to line my top lid I like using
the felt tip eyeliner a little bit more
because it is able to give me a little
bit more control instead of using a
brush and a gel liner or a pencil liner
it's very very tricky when you're just
starting out so I'm using a felt tip
liner especially this one because the
tip is very very skinny so it gives you
a lot of lot of control and it is able
to you know help define the line a
little bit more there's also buried a
wing out so if you're going looking to
do the whole winged eyeliner I would
definitely recommend this skinny
eyeliner marker for you because it is
able to wing it out and give you a very
crisp line moreso than it would if you
were you know using a brush angled brush
on your own
and how I like to line my eyes I like to
start in the middle of my eye and work
my way out and then go back in towards
the inner half of my eye
all right next I'm taking a pencil
eyeliner this one's by L'Oreal and I'm
just going to line my waterline I like
using pencil eyeliners for the waterline
just because they're a lot easier and
they look a lot cleaner and they're
there all right and then next with a
angled brush I'm going to be taking that
black color again and just focusing that
underneath my lash line my lower lash
line on the outer corner this kind of
just smoke ins the look a little bit
more and kind of gets rid of the harsh
eyeliner line if you don't like that
look alright next I'm going to curl my
eyelashes just using a Revlon eyelash
curler right next with the Maybelline
falsies mascara I'm going to just cult
might add up top and bottom lashes with
that watching this video is so funny
because I think it's so weird does
anyone know why we open our mouths when
they put mascara on
I've always wondered that you know
mermaids always talk about that and I
try so hard to keep it closed because I
think I look so funny
but I think it's weird all right and
then on to lips lipstick can be kind of
tricky when you're first starting out -
coming you know figure out your right
shade so a tinted lip balm would be my
best advice for you plus I love this
because it gives it a nice subtle color
without being too bold as a lipstick
would the tinted lipstick I'm your
tinted lip balm I'm using as the Burt's
Bees tinted lip balm in the color pink
blossom I love this a lot it's
definitely one of my favorites this
month alright that was it and remember
girls lessons more and makeups only used
to enhance your beauty not to make you
beautiful alright that was the video for
today I really hope you girls enjoyed
the video for those of you you know
starting out and makeup I hope I hope
you found this video helpful and yeah
until next time see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
