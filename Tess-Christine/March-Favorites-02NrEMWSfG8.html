be doing my March favorites video and
I'm super excited for this because it is
my first favorites video so I have a
bunch to show you so let's get into it
all right my first all-time favorite
thing right now
there are candles I absolutely have been
loving candles and I don't know why
because I haven't had them here all year
in my apartment because I've always been
afraid I was gonna like burn the place
down but me and my roommate actually
went to Bath and Body Works like I'd say
a month ago and got candles and it is
just been making our place smell so good
and I just love it right now and the
sense I bought our frosted cupcake which
smells amazing if you haven't smells yet
go out and smell it and passion flower
and this is a really really good scent
as well and they're both super relaxing
since they're not too strong and
overpowering they're just very very nice
sense and I absolutely love them the
second thing that I'm loving for March
is the for makeup at least is the laura
mercier a silk cream foundation and I
know a lot of people here on YouTube
rave about this foundation and the price
scared me I'm gonna be honest with you I
was like there's no way I'm gonna pay
that much and then one day on a whim I
just bought it and ever since that I've
absolutely loved it and if for those of
you interested my color is beige ivory
and seriously this foundation it I love
it I can't even explain to you it is
definitely worth the money and it is
probably and it lasts so long because
all you really need is like the size of
a pea you don't need like that much
foundation to cover your face it just
blends so nicely absolutely love that
another I guess makeup related product
is this brush you guys can see it it's
just a dome brush it's by Sonia Kashuk
and I got it at Target and it just done
my favorite brush if you saw my smokey
eye or my brown smokey eye video you
know that I use this like a majority of
the time and it just it I don't even
know it just places the color where I
want it and I just love it I use it for
like everything and then another thing
is the Beauty Blender sponge I got this
at Target it's just I know some people
here on YouTube I know
Elle she has talked about this before
and yeah so I tried it and I loved it
and it the pathan only purpose I use it
for is just to blend like around my nose
and my eyes to make sure my concealer is
blended and I don't know like on my
forehead in my hairline like I just made
it it really helps with that the second
thing I'm loving for makeup I guess is
this lip gloss and funny story about
this lip gloss actually I went into
Sephora probably a couple months ago and
I wanted to try the NARS Turkish Delight
lip gloss cuz I heard it was just a
really good lip gloss very natural pink
color and they were all out and so I
asked the lady if she had any more like
in the back or something and if there
even is a back and she's like oh no but
I know of a lip gloss that's really
similar to it and it's just as good and
I was like okay so she showed me this
one and it's um the cherry lip gloss
Korres natural products I don't know
it's in Sephora and the color is light
pink xi can see that yep
they're um love this I was it's kind of
small but it's lasted me for a while and
yeah I was kind of hesitant to try it I
just tried it and loved it I loved the
color I always get compliments on it and
I owe all my reminds me can I use that
one lip gloss so it's a definite hit and
I definitely think it's worth it so I
would go out and get that if I were you
another thing I like is my EOS lip balm
I love this lip balm
got it at Ulta it's like right by that I
couldn't find it for
and I was looking for this I wanted to
try this and I couldn't find it and it's
up by the register and like that where
they sell like the mini travel things
that's where it is in case you're
looking for it another thing I love is
the Sonia Kashuk I makeup remover
I am the it's where the oil and the
water separate in and you shake it up
and it turns like that purpley color I
don't know I really like this eye makeup
remover I use a cotton ball and it takes
my eye makeup off super easy before I
use no eye makeup remover I don't know
what I was thinking I was like scrubbing
my eyes to that and but yeah now I love
this and I use this all the time alright
for nail polish favorites my favorites
are the icy colors I love these colors
the two I'm loving are nice is nice
which is like a lavender color and
French affair which i think is one of
their new collection ones I just got it
recently and it's like a pink a light
pink and a light purple the pink I'm
actually wearing on my nails now you can
see it's just a super like light nice
light pink color they're both super
pastel E pink
I mean pastel these spring colors so I
really like those and then another thing
I'm loving for March because I recently
got it is the shattered nail polish
absolutely love this if you didn't see
my last video also just got a huge
shipment in and they have tiers of
shatter nail polish so if you've been
looking for it for a while it's there
now hopefully still so you guys could go
home and get it another thing that I'm
loving is this from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works is
the sleep pillow mist looks like this
so Roma therapy I don't know saying and
you I spray it on my pillows every night
before I go to bed and I love the smell
of it I like just as I dig my face in my
pillows and just smell it I love it and
it's supposed to help you sleep better I
don't know if that's true I just love
how it makes my pillow smell so yeah I
do like this and then for hair product
the one thing I'm loving right now is
the
Rarity's volume inject mousse and i have
naturally curly hair I mean not super
curly but naturally like wavy curly hair
and when I don't want to take a lot of
time to get ready I jump out of the
shower and I put this mousse in my hair
and I scrunch it and it makes my curls
so nice not frizzy at all like sometimes
when I scrunch my hair I am gonna drive
air dries it gets frizzy and I hate that
cuz then I have to go over it with a
curling iron this just makes it so nice
and I tried this recently and I love it
love it love it and I never used to use
hair moves before I always used to use
like spray gel or whatever but I tried
moves - my mom uses mousse for her curly
hair and I tried it love it
last thing that I'm loving right now are
feathers and this seems to be a popular
trend lately are feathers and I got
these feather earrings recently oh and
my forever 21 I forgot to show less than
my forever 21 haul but um they're like
peacock feather earrings and they have
beads on the top really really like
these earrings feathers are huge right
now I don't know what sparked them but
loved them my roommate actually got
feather extensions which sounds weird
but she got like three long feathers
they're not sick or anything like this
they're very thin feathers she got him
bound in her hair with the metal
bindings in metal plastic I don't know
what they are but um it's actual
extensions in her hair and she has
really long hair and they look so cool I
love them and she gets complimented
everywhere she goes they're like oh my
god you have feathers in your hair where
did you get this and so I have been
deciding if I want to get them or not
I'm not too sure yet but um but she
loves them she she can style them with
the hair you can curl them you can
straighten them they're like crazy but
yeah feathers are super in right now so
I kind of jumped on the trend and got
these feather earrings which I'm loving
right now but yeah that is it for my
March favorites I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and until next time see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
