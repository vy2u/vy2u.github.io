going to be a may favourites video and I
haven't done a favorites video in a
while I think my last favorites video
was March favorites and yeah so I
haven't done one in a while so I thought
I would do one because I have a bunch of
new products that I haven't shown you
guys well maybe I've shown you a few but
not all of them and so I have a lot of
makeup products and then a few other
items that I want to show you guys that
I'm loving for me well first I want to
start out by saying that for May one
exciting thing that happened in May
right at the end of May May 30th
I was announced me and my roommate Jenny
were announced as first to move
finalists and I'm super excited about
this there's top 10 finalists and the
prizes are really awesome if we win we
get to go to New York which would be so
much fun and so I would really
appreciate if you guys went on Facebook
and voted for mine and Jenny's first
move dance I actually took the first
move dance that I had on YouTube down to
kind of force you guys to go check out
it on the Facebook page and hopefully
vote for us there's some awesome
contestants and everyone did really
really good and so it would be just
really really mean a lot to me and Jenny
if you guys would go and vote for us if
you liked our dance now on to my may
favorites for our products well the
first thing that I'm loving for May that
I've been using all of May and this is a
face product and it is the gemma kid
moisture tint Pro finish moisture tint
yeah it's basically like a tinted
moisturizer and I love using tinted
moisturizers in the summer and just
because I my job involves me being
outside and it gets hot and I don't want
to sweat off thick foundation so I like
using a tinted moisturizer last summer I
use the benefit tinted moisturizer and
that one only comes in well I guess this
does too but I don't know I just I guess
I didn't find the right
none of the shades really matched me
very well it kind of gave me like a
weird finish and I didn't really like
that so I'm trying
the
I'm a kid tinted moisturizer and I
absolutely love this stuff and it
matches me perfectly for those
interested I am in to medium or mid or
something like there's there's three
there's light medium and dark and these
blend in fairly well to your skin I'm
wearing it now and in the past like
three or four videos I've been wearing
this and I absolutely love it I got it
at Target for those of you interested on
where I got it I got it at Target it's
about it's kind of pricey for a
drugstore tinted moisturizer but it's 20
sorry there's bucks there it was like
twenty four dollars and sorry the
lighting is going to be changing because
I'm outside using natural lighting and
it's just being ridiculous today so
sorry
my lighting goes in and out but um yes
the I got it at Target it was $24 it's a
bit pricey for a drugstore foundation or
tinted moisturizer but I haven't really
found drugstore tinted moisturizers
before and I love this one and I mean it
looks kind of like a small bottle but
again it's a tinted moisturizer so you
don't need that much of it to cover your
whole face however one thing I do have
to say about this product is that it
does not give you a lot of coverage so
if you're the type of person that wants
a lot of coverage I would not recommend
this
it definitely evens out your skin tone
it just doesn't cover it it doesn't give
you as much coverage as a foundation
would what I'm absolutely absolutely
fell in love with it is better than you
guys know that I used to use the NARS
concealer palette and I found that that
concealer was very thick and it was hard
to apply without really like yanking at
my eye which I did not really like to do
so I tried I went to Target and I got
the Sonia Kashuk Kush I don't even know
how do you say that Sonia Kashuk hidden
agenda concealer palette and you guys
seriously if you haven't tried this
please go try it the concealer is so
creamy and it's just amazing and it
comes in three shades sorry this is
gonna be really dirty because I use it
everyday but it comes with a light shade
and a medium shade I like mixing the two
together and then a greenish shade but
what I really like about this green
that you know how sometimes when you buy
green concealers they're a bright green
and there you find that they're very
hard to blend in at least that's how I
feel so this one is kind of a it has
green in it so it definitely is gonna
reduce redness because I have redness on
my skin and so I use that to cover it up
but it I mixed this with like the top
one and it just works perfectly and I
absolutely love it and then there's the
powder in it too but I don't use a
setting powder so I don't really use
that part but um if you guys haven't
picked this up I think it was like ten
dollars but um yeah I've been using it
all May and I'm still not even close to
hitting pan so I really really recommend
this it's definitely one of my favorites
you have to go get it what I'm loving
right now is actually the elf blushes
and I'm I've always used matte blushes
not always but usually I use Mac blushes
and I found this found a bunch of
blushes by elf and this one is in the
color tickled pink and my absolute
favorite blush of all time is well
dressed by Mac and this is what this
look light looks like and I absolutely
love this so I mean like this would
definitely be one of my may favorites
I got it in May and I've been using it
in May loved it but then I recently got
the elf one the elf tickled pink and it
isn't awesome dupe for it like if you
don't want to spend the money on Mac
products and you know people talk about
that stuff on YouTube all the time and I
found an awesome dupe for awhile dressed
by Mac okay this one is the elf one and
then this is the well-dressed so they're
fairly similar Pink's it's just this one
kind of shows up a little bit more pink
so you kind of have to have a lighter
hand with it whereas the Mac blush you
can kind of just like crank on your
cheeks and you don't have to worry about
it but um yeah so I found an awesome
dupe for that so if you've been wanting
well dressed my Mac and don't want to
spend the money go pick up tickled pink
but elf I think it was like three
dollars so awesome purchase is the
Maybelline it's a Maybelline trio and
it's a limited edition one but I've
recent like I got it I want to say three
weeks ago if that and the color is
apricot Aurora I think and I got mine at
Kmart I don't I'm sure you could get it
at Target any drugstore but they're
awesome colors basically it's just like
a peachy pink color beige color and then
a white and the white is used for a base
if you want to make it more noticeable
but I absolutely love this and I love it
because it's an awesome just like
overall color for summer and then you
can always darken it with Browns or
anything like that in the crease if you
want to absolutely love it I think I'm
gonna do a big summer tutorial on my
summer makeup my everyday summer makeup
and I'll definitely include this in
there another thing I'm loving
especially in May is this jump NYX jumbo
eye pencil in the color purple velvet
and it is a dark purple color and I love
it because I use it with this trio and I
just I put it on the bottom lash line
and I absolutely love it it gives me a
pop of color or a pop of color but like
a purple color so it's kind of dramatic
but not like crazy violet big purple
eyes it's just nice and it brings out my
brown eyes absolutely love it so I would
definitely recommend these jumbo eye
pencils I just love the purple one right
now but I think they're awesome the next
thing for eyes that you guys know I use
is the NYX super skinny eye marker and
absolutely love this thing I use this
every day because um the tip is really
really skinny and I use this every day
because it's so easy to use and it's so
quick and I I don't really need too much
of a steady hand with it and I can just
swipe it on and it's easy as that so I
definitely love this as a felt tip liner
if you guys haven't picked it up I would
definitely try it mascara I'm loving
from May I used to use the Maybelline I
think I don't know the falsies
Maybelline falsies still love that one
but now I'm on to the L'Oreal voluminous
millions of lashes mascara and I
absolutely love this mascara because I
love the brush it's I don't even know if
this is gonna show up but it's a comb if
they have a little comb the bristles are
so cool it separates my lashes nicely it
doesn't clump up too much absolutely
love it you should definitely all go try
it if you haven't already now on to lips
my favorite lip product right now is the
elf
conditioning lifts lip balm in the color
peacefully pink and it's what I'm
wearing on my lips now and I absolutely
love this because it's very creamy
and it feels so good when you put it on
your lips and it's not as cakey and
thick as a lipstick would be if you
haven't tried it do it in if you buy
your elf products at Target I at least
my target doesn't sell these so you
should definitely check um
Kmart because that's where I got this
they sell this and nearly nude the color
nearly nude or nearly natural
I think it's nearly natural they sell
both of those at Kmart and so if you've
been looking for them like I have and
did want to order them as for a lipstick
the thing I'm the thing the lipstick I'm
loving is by Maybelline it's the color
is make me pink and it is just this
pretty natural pink color it's basically
like one of those lipsticks that are
like my lips but better type lipstick
and I absolutely love it and I've been
between me this and the Mac cream Cup
the color is creme Cup by Mac absolutely
love that lipstick but as for a
drugstore I love this one right now for
nail polish if you guys haven't seen my
latest video about nail polish you
should go check that out anyways but the
nail polish that I'm absolutely loving
right now is it's by a sea and the color
is it's genius
and it's this purple color with gold
specks in it and I'm not going to talk
about this too much because I did
mention it in my nail polish video so if
you want to see more about it just go
check out that video what I'm loving
right now for hair is the macadamia
natural oil products you can get these
at Ulta I know
potluck or whole book whatever it was
having a sale on them yesterday I don't
know if they still are but these are
awesome products and this is the
leave-in conditioning cream nourishing
leave-in cream yeah leave-in leave-in
conditioning texture cream and I
absolutely love this this is the smaller
one you can get a big pump one I'm
pretty sure I have this and I have the
mask the conditioning mask for in the
shower and a lot of you guys have been
asking me what I do with my hair I'm
going to do a haircare video probably or
just like what I use on my hair everyday
so a lot of you guys were asking
and these are definitely my favorite
products to use on my hair they they
make my hair feel so soft and textured
and just healthy and I absolutely love
them right now on two scents I guess and
I'm sure you guys are all expecting this
one but my favorite scent right now is
Daisy by Marc Jacobs I recently got this
I think end of April and our beginning
of May and I've been using it everyday
in May sense and it just smells so good
I absolutely love it you guys should
definitely go pick it up if you haven't
yet I'm absolutely in love with this
movie I thought it would be kind of fun
to do it because it came out in May so
why not is I am Number Four and if you
guys haven't seen this movie I don't
know if you some of you guys have and
didn't enjoy it but I really enjoyed it
and I showed it to my brother the other
day and he really liked it so if you
have a boyfriend or something and you
want to watch a movie with him and he
doesn't want to watch a chick flick or
something check this out cuz this movie
is really enjoyable for even girls to
watch it's very action-packed but it's I
mean the main character Anna is really
attractive so if that doesn't pull you
in I don't know what will and uh huh no
but it's a really really good movie it's
full of action and suspense and if you
like those kind of movies definitely go
pick this up if you haven't seen it
already I really really enjoy it I have
a favorite youtuber right now she's not
