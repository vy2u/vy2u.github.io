be doing the roommate tag this is my
roommate Christina hi so basically what
we're gonna do is we're gonna answer
questions there is 21 questions that um
we answer about each other and we
haven't had questions so I have no idea
what the yaks so we'll just start with
number one the first question is did you
guys know each other before you became
roommates yes we did um well we were on
the dance team here at school together
that's what we met and then basically we
just like hung out all the time with
dance whatnot and then became really
good friends um in our two other
roommates and then we decided to live
together yeah and so we met each other
at freshman year and so this is our
sophomore year and we're living in
apartment we actually have three other
roommates but they're a yeah I'm the
best roommate so that's one else she's
not what did you guys initially think of
each other the first time you met I
thought christina was I don't even know
I just thought she was nice it's the I
don't know this is weird because um this
is kind of hard question art that is a
great question
I don't remember like my first
impression I think I think we are both
like those freshmen who yeah people and
media spread into each other yeah kind
of like hey and just kind of go along
yeah we didn't know anyone really and so
like we met like the first week or two
of school so then we kind of just like
clicked because we were just like I
don't know we just have both have kind
of the same personalities so we just
started talking I guess a question
number three how long did it take you
until you guys became friends well sure
oh yeah that's kind of the same question
well wording but we um we were friends
like right away I guess like until we
became best friends became best friends
like this we're in together yeah because
like freshman year we like we're still
like getting to know
each other kind of thing you're like I
don't know testing out like different
people we were like meeting other people
and then like when we started rooming
with each other that's when we became
like really close like yeah question
number four what do you guys usually
argue about will you shake like
literally don't argue II seriously I
have like one argument and it's about
something retarded like chase channel or
yeah arguments we don't really have like
actually we when we argue like most of
the time we're like joking with each
other and we always take it like one
step further and just like argue just
like we're dumb ridiculous
usually when one starts laughing and so
we need to know what's not serious it's
like we're just kidding right and we
really don't
I like I'm trying to think I don't think
we've ever actually had an argument it
was just like something stupid like I
can't even think of something we would
argue we really don't fight yeah no not
all might make fun of each other yeah
but in like a humorous way like we said
have nothing to be like me we both don't
have the same personalities or were like
sarcastic with each other we're very
sorry
we like understand each other's humor so
like if she tells me my hair looks like
crap like I know she's proud she tells
me to taper off
yeah she's all like it's kind of it's
more like funny but we take each other
seriously so don't get offended or
anything no what is one thing that
really bothers you that your roommate
does you wanna go first oh you got me
you can go first
sorry what she's gonna say what a thing
that our bothers me about Christina is
she likes to chomp her food very loud
yeah I know she can't help it but it's
okay so if I was Christina I have gum
right now and this is how she chooses
one that's even necessary like it's not
it's not that yes yeah it is and um no
I'm really I'm not trying to make you
look gross and disgusting that's just
one thing that bothers me about her I'm
like used to it now that I live with her
but I still I bring it up she jumps a
lot over there now what about me let me
think I see there's really only that
annoys me too much I guess okay well
Tess
obsessed with breakfast foods literally
she eats I would say like her favorite
breakfast foods are cereal yogurt bagels
toast eggs anything breakfast related so
the thing that annoys me that she does
is she literally eats breakfast for
almost every meal not always this isn't
like a common thing like but most of
time it happens like oh me I'll be
eating dinner less a plate of spaghetti
or something I don't know she didn't
bagel or baking eggs like I know some
reason it's flooding annoys me it's
nothing like I don't get pissed or get
mad I just find you annoying sometimes
when it's like it's dinner why aren't
you eating dinner you're eating
breakfast foods but it I wrecked the
suit sometimes just one thing that I
find odd and that gets on my nerves
but I don't really care it's fine she do
whatever she wants that was a rant
do you guys both have the same passion
for makeup or no like okay I got her
into makeup cuz buy more makeup
yeah share your makeup but like before
we really started rooming as each other
she kind of didn't know how like what
color isn't worth what colors and like I
got her into like um I shadows she never
used to wear eyeshadow my mom she bought
I got me and yes she'd asked me like I
don't know like about my eyes or
something I did my eye makeup and then
she'd be like I'm gonna do that and so I
kind of like her eyes does work because
I use it aunt Billie baby Thanks what
does she think of your YouTube so that's
you oh well first of all I thought as
cool as she's doing this so I think it's
really fun but sometimes I do you think
it's weird she was kidding
it's a joke I know she that's for real
no I thought they were great um I really
like them I think she's really funny and
all the clothes that she picks out in
the makeup I follow them I listen to her
advice so you like it I like them okay
who spends the most time getting ready
in the morning no it's okay we've
actually had this discussion before like
once upon a time like whatever we were
talking about this and we both kind of
take equal amounts to get ready is that
except sometimes I
that I take a little bit more if I'm
doing like different hairstyles like if
I like curl my hair a certain way you're
like us yeah with her - oh I don't spend
I don't know like you know like on
morning when I go to school I guess I
literally I wear my glasses a lot so I
could care less so like what's under my
glasses sometimes so I wouldn't Lee take
like five to ten minutes do a makeup
nothing serious and then with my hair up
or do something if I glasses I'd wear
them but if like we're going out I think
me each - yeah Edward if we're like
going out to like dinner you're like
hang out with friends or something like
that we always like make an effort to
get ready but like for school and like
classes and stuff like we unless we have
like if we have like a late at least for
me if I had like a later afternoon class
like our ideal even line I have to wake
up at like 9:00 so it's like kind of
hard to motivate myself you ready yeah
what was something that you two didn't
notice about each other until you became
roommates well I noticed that we were
such best friends
yeah I didn't know I didn't liked it as
much as I do oh um no I don't know I
didn't know well she had this huge
passion for makeup I have no idea like
so I think bless you had no idea but I
knew she always dress really cool cool
like had like clothes and stuff but I
never knew if she was like someone to
make up like she is yes yeah I didn't
know that what do you guys sometimes get
fed up with each other from seeing each
other too often no no like what this is
like like okay yeah no we don't like we
have three other roommates and so we
kind of like balance each other out and
we like love our other remains our other
two mates
um we all have very different
personalities we're the ones that like
click the most so like we balance each
other out really well so we never really
get like sick of each other and like
since we have so many other roommates
like you just go smile right it's like
hard to like get sick of each other when
you have like so many other
personalities surrounding you so it's
just like I don't know yeah and we and
we aren't in the same classes what you
know it helps because like we never saw
oh yeah we don't see each other and then
to each other like a dinnertime and we
have yeah and then we talked about like
our homework and like I don't know we
have written yeah so we never get sick
of each other I know um I miss her like
all my weekends it's kind of odd uh-huh
yes softy I know um how do you avoid
tension while living with each other
well I guess we kind of just explain
this yeah I know like because since we
have two other roommates I think that if
we I don't know and we don't see each
other all day so it's hard to like avoid
tension I guess so why don't we just
close our door yeah cuz we have separate
rooms so we can just go into our own
rooms and kind of like do our own thing
for a while and like that helps and but
like being this close to friends we are
you can't really avoid it like we tell
her mates all the time you can't avoid
conflict it's it and it sounds different
when you're like living with someone
because like I've had like or I have
best friends like that for my hometown
but like are totally different if I were
to like live with them so we kind of
like since we were living with each
other constantly like we kind of know
each other's like limits I guess and
like what buttons not to push at times
like we just kind of know so like that
tension thing just never really happens
yeah um what's your one rule while or
what's one rule you guys have while
living with each other no rules I would
say I gastly don't make a mess yeah
keeping a no lean like the kitchen is
really big for this one like she like
Legion and so she though clean like when
she always like freaks out if like one
of our roommates makes or even me if we
like make toast or something and then
like when you take the toes out of the
toaster and then it like get these
crumbs everywhere she'll like take like
409 and like scrub it down she's like I
don't even know yeah so I guess our rule
is just try to keep like thinking up my
old man yeah like don't leave dishes
around that kind of stuff but you can do
whatever you want in your own room like
we don't get whatever judge yeah um how
do you deal with sharing a bathroom
recently if we're like all like like
especially on weekends like when we want
to like go out to like dinner or
something or go hang out with like our
friends like we all kind of like want to
get ready at the same time and so then
that kind of maybe but like other than
that we kind of know each other schedule
so we don't have to worry about like
showering scheduling like I don't know
we it the bathroom thing isn't a really
big deal question number 14 do you make
two separate dinners at night we're
never like exactly hired the same time
right it all depends on like we have our
own schedules on like when we're hungry
but if we like a plan to like make
dinner to others I'm yeah we'll make
like we make like pastas and like rice
and chicken it's our big thing right now
chicken or we're like suckers for going
out yeah when we if we make dinners at
home like we don't make it's just like
ramen or every move like legit meals cuz
you can actually get like good meals for
Jesus cheap so like you make tacos tacos
is cheese like Jenny's spaghetti
SpaghettiOs we yellows and grilled
chicken I know like we have good meals
yeah umm nationalities I guess it's just
like it's their own that yeah it says
nationalities so I nationality I am like
a mutt I'm like full of different things
like I am I think my biggest one is
French Canadian and French Canadian and
polish Irish I'm Irish I'm like a fourth
Irish polish Irish French Canadian doll
so like my three big ones I there's like
a list but I don't even know all of them
um a little bit of I'm a little bit
Irish on my dad's side know my mom's
side oops sorry no I don't even know I'm
Irish channel part of from my lover my
dad I don't know and I'm a little bit
finish and it's a couple other things so
over there I just don't know question
number 16 do use your roommate's things
without asking I do but only one thing
is that I broke my straightener in the
beginning of the year and so I use her
straight narrow because I haven't laid
nightmare around gonna buy it but that's
not asking that told it yet she told me
I could use it so like if she's ever
gone at clash in like la chord or
anything so like I'll just like go on
and get her straightener it's not like I
rummaged through her things and like use
it but like we're like close enough
where if she were to like come in and
use my makeup like I probably wouldn't
care what are your favorite things that
you like to do with each other shopping
we like to shop we cuz we're both
to like the same sort of like clothes
and stuff we also go to eat a lot I said
um I don't know I think we're just like
where we live there's not much to do
besides like go out there friends or
just like that so we were just make fun
we'll just like go up to eat yeah um so
we do that a lot
yeah we go out to eat a lot watch movies
sometime B's we know we read movies
between breads nice we rent there's like
a red box here that's really cheap and
then there's like a - for $0.99 other
videos or videos or on Tuesday so we
like rent that cuz you do a thing with
like a bunch of our friends or we have
like scary movie Wednesday so we always
do that together that's like a big thing
but like other than that like shopping
like normal like girly stuff I guess we
have a lot of the same favorite TV shows
like she really got me into Bravo TV
like the Housewives show she got me into
those and then like I like like ABC
Family show I'm like CW like Hellcats
and vampire she got me what happens when
one person gets sick the other gets sick
the other gets sick it's just inevitable
because we used like all the same stuff
and like we're around each other enough
where we just don't close but we take
like medicine and stuff where we try to
get like not sick but I'm also I don't
think there's been times when we've all
been sick like usually one person it
winter we all kind of get cold yeah I
got we both got that cough really bad
this year but have you ever thought
about having pets or a pet yes yes we
have except we can't have pets in our
apartment our landlord doesn't allow it
but we've actually babysat a little
kitty for one of our friends he like
brought over his little cat's name is
Batman sweet baby is after a weekend
that was really fun but we really want
like next year you want to puppy we want
to get a puppy but we don't know yet
it's big responsibility so we'll see
what is the funniest thing you've done
together well we do a lot of funny
things together like I don't know what
actually it's not like we go out to do
funny films this might happen at room
anything ha I'm into us like I know like
we went to Florida for spring break I'm
like we got attacked by seagulls so
you're both eating icecream cones and
like like a swarm of like 50 like drum
dieting and then like where I attack my
cone and Kristina like screamed and like
ranch daddy's gonna poop on you so I
like threw my eyes
home because I realized was my ice cream
cone and then um they like all attack my
ice cream cone and then they like looked
at Christina and she had her ice cream
stones we had just gotten these ice
cream cones that injury yeah I'm like
delicious I should yeah and then they
like look at her and like swarm after
her and literally were like running
around the beach like maniacs like man
why everybody was relaxing in the Sun
yeah he's laughing I never laughed that
hard in my life like that was hilarious
and we're all the try before the wings I
just like randomly have been like I
think a lot of the funny moments aren't
really random like places ok I think I
don't know we kind of just like make our
own jokes they're laughing yeah last
question has being roommates helped or
