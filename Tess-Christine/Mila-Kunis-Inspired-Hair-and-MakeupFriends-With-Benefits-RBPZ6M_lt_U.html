be another celebrity inspired hair and
makeup tutorial and today's video is
inspired by Mila Kunis I got a few
pictures sent me on Twitter and Facebook
and then I was kind of looking at
pictures on Google of Mila and there is
a ton to choose from so I kind of just
stuck with one that kind of stood out to
me which was when she was in friends
with benefits and I don't know if you've
seen that movie or not but it's her and
Justin Timberlake it's a really really
funny movie I really liked it a lot and
I really liked how she looked in the
movie so I kind of decided to do an
inspired makeup and hair look off of
that and again kind of like what I've
been doing recently is I've been doing
two different hair looks one that's kind
of like the main hair look and then kind
of like a bonus one at the end so
formulas makeup I kind of incorporated
it from the movie and then kind of just
in general she kind of always has a
smoky eye and in the movie it's not
super intense so I kind of kept it a
subtle smoky eye she uses a lot of
Browns blacks and copper tones so that's
what I chose to use for the eye as her
hair I kind of stuck with just her like
basic textured straight ish hair she
never really has like super curly hair
in the movie it's kind of natural
looking it looks very just chill and
kind of just textured and messy and it's
not like perfectly stick straight either
so I kind of did that and then it's kind
of like a bonus hair look at the end
because it was super easy to do I
decided to do her kind of signature
ponytail in the movie now if you've seen
the movie you kind of know that if her
hair is not down and kind of just like
loose and flowy it is up in a ponytail
and I kind of decided to do that
ponytail I thought it was a really cute
and classy look and I thought it looked
really cute on her so I decided to kind
of throw that in at the end let me know
what you think in the comments below
please let me know your next celebrity
on my Twitter or Facebook page is way
easier for me to see it on there and I
will see you guys next time
after I primed my eyes of course I'm
going to start using my Mac palette and
from my math palette I'm just going to
be picking up a wood winked now this is
kind of a shimmery bronze gold toned
color and I'm just going to be placing
this directly onto my lid and it's not a
huge deal if it gets into the crease
because we're gonna be putting other
colors there anyways and blending it
upwards next I'm going to be taking soft
brown now this is just a matte brown
color very light brown color and I'm
just going to work that in windshield
wiper motions in my crease next with a
matte black color I'm just going to be
using matte with an eye shadow pencil
brush and smudging that into my upper
lash line
milla always has a very smoky look to
her but sometimes it's not necessarily
smoked out in the crease it's more so
smoked out on the lid so that's what
we're doing for this look so make sure
that you focus the darkest color on your
lash line in this case we're using black
you don't have to be too precise with
this because we're going to be using
another color over it but just make sure
the darkest color is closest to the lash
line next with expresso which is a matte
brown color I'm just going to be using
the same brush the other side of it and
I'm just going to be placing that where
the black ends this is gonna kind of
give a gradient look to the smoky
smokiness I guess you could say and make
it just look a little bit more natural
now I'm taking a clean eyeshadow brush
and I'm just kind of blending the two
colors together don't blend it too much
to where the black isn't known as well
but blended enough so there aren't any
harsh lines next with the leftover black
that's on the eye shadow pencil brush
I'm just going to be kind of creating an
outer V and working that into the crease
this is just gonna define the eye a
little bit more and make the black look
a little bit more noticeable next I'm
taking brulée by Mac this is just a
matte cream color and with a fluffy
brush I'm just going to be placing this
on my brow bone and kind of blending out
any imperfections around the eye that I
created with the black next with another
eye shadow pencil brush I'm just going
to be picking up that same black color
and working it onto my lower lash line
next with an eye pencil I'm just going
to be lining my upper lash line and both
my water lines this is just gonna make
your eyes look a little bit more defined
now I'm going to curl my eyelashes in
preparation for mascara the mascara I'm
using is the L'Oreal millions of lashes
mascara and I'm just going to apply that
onto my top lashes the other mascara I'm
using is the Rev ront Revlon's grow
luscious mascara and I'm just going to
put that on my lower or my upper lash
line and my lower lash line now time for
the cheeks I'm going to apply this peach
color blush to the apples of my cheeks
and a little bit underneath my
cheekbones just to define my face a
little bit more
now since the eyes are a little bit more
intense I'm just going to stick with a
nude lipstick and the lipstick I'm using
is hue by Mac and this is just a light
nude paint color and over top of it I'm
just going to put a light pink lip gloss
just to give it some shine now once you
finish that this Mila Kunis inspired
smoky sultry eye look is complete now
let's move on to hair for this look I'm
starting with my hair just freshly
blow-dried but second day hair would
work for this look as well so to begin
I'm taking a straightener and I'm using
the straightener to kind of curl the
ends under because Neela's hair it looks
straight but not so straight to where it
looks like she's straightening it looks
more natural so that's what we're gonna
go for in this look so I'm gonna do is
take the straightener down and flip it
underneath it's kind of the same
technique if you ever know how to curl
your hair with a straightener it's kind
of the same T technique as that you're
just gonna not rotate the barrel as much
so I'm gonna do is it's very simple I'm
just going to complete that throughout
the rest of my head and you're not going
to switch I know I like to switch every
other direction but I'm not doing that
for this look I'm always going
underneath and away from my face
now to give my hair some volume I am
going to tease the crown of my head just
a little bit this is obviously optional
I just know that I like to tease my hair
and I know that Neela's hair is full of
volume so if yours lacks that teasing is
definitely an option so once you're
finished with that the hair look is
complete this first hair look I guess
it's really simple and it's a really
awesome everyday hair look
but now let's move on to the second look
now horomia's hair and this her hair is
just a basic ponytail pulled back but it
has a lot of volume in the front so I'm
gonna tease this my section of hair even
more and I'm gonna work it all the way
up to the front of my head so once I'm
done with that I'm just going to gather
it back now still keeping your part
because Milla's ponytail definitely has
a definition of a part still there but
to the fact where it's still pulled back
so with a teasing comb I'm just gonna
kind of work this back just a little bit
using my fingers works too you can kind
of just play with it until you like how
it looks now don't worry about the
volume because when your hair is in the
ponytail you can still add some volume
which is what I'll show you in a little
bit so now I'm going to section my hair
or secure my hair with a ponytail in the
middle back of my head so once your hair
is secured into the ponytail I do have a
little bit of fly away so with some
hairspray I'm just going to lightly
spray that and kind of smooth my fingers
back to kind of give it that smooth
classy look that she has now she give
your ponytail a little bit of extra
volume like Mila has you're just going
to take your two hands and place them
directly by the ponytail and push up
this is just going to give your ponytail
a little bit more volume in the back
section or crown of your head but that
is it for this second little fun
hairstyle and you're all finished I
really hope you guys like this Mila
Kunis inspired hair and makeup tutorial
