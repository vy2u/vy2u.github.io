some Halloween tutorials so to start out
with something simple I picked the
adorable Minnie Mouse this tutorial is
super easy so it's perfect for a
last-minute costume idea so let's begin
with the makeup this eye shadow look is
very easy it's perfect for beginners
because I'm only using a few different
makeup products on the eyes so right now
I'm applying an eyeshadow primer that
has a shimmery base to it in preparation
for my eye shadow which I'm applying now
which is a gold shimmery color I'm
applying that into my lids and extending
that a little bit into my crease now to
give my eyes a little bit of definition
I'm applying a light brown matte color
into the creases of my eyes I'm using
windshield wiper motions with the eye
shadow brush to give a more flawless
look and apply it evenly throughout the
crease what I like about using a lighter
brown color is that I can build it up
very easily so if you use a shadow with
great pigmentation you can build it up
until you're satisfied with the color
now all I'm doing is taking that same
brown color and sweeping it onto my
lower lash line for some balance with
the eye shadow look to get those cute
mini mouths eyes and to make my eyes
look a little bit more animated of
course I'm going to using a liner to
give myself a winged eyeliner look I'm
using this one by Maybelline it's a gel
liquid liner and I'm just using the
brush that they give you to create a
winged liner on both of my eyes so it
kind of flicks out at the end and gives
that fluttery look that many has now all
I'm doing is applying some mascara to my
top lashes I'm just doing this so I have
preparation for my false crazy false
eyelashes that I'm using so I'm just
kind of flicking out those top lashes
and making them fear appear big and
fluttery to make my eyes a little bit
brighter lighter and bigger I'm going to
apply a white liner into my waterline
this is just gonna make my eyes
obviously up here bigger and give a more
dramatic animated look now how I am
applying my mascara to my bottom lashes
is I'm using the top of the mascara and
kind of bunching them together to make
my eyes look even more animated I keep
saying that but it helps a lot to make
them look bigger and wider so now I'm
taking these crazy false eyelashes these
ones are important because they have
dramatic flick at the end so your eyes
are gonna appear more fluttery like
Minnie's eyes which have these long
eyelashes at the end of her eyes so all
I'm doing is applying that with my
fingers and adjusting it with tweezers
on both of my eyes these are very heavy
eyelashes so it might say take some
practice applying them but they give the
exact mini look that you want how they
just kind of flick out at the end and
give that very fluttery girly effect
that she has for my face makeup all I
did was apply some concealer underneath
my eyes and some foundation you can use
whatever you normally use for your basic
face makeup but I'm applying some
highlighter to give myself a little bit
of shimmer and then some bright pink
blush to the apples of my cheeks
moving on to minis cute little mousy
nose I'm using a liquid liner to draw
this on it's way easier to use a pencil
liner but for some reason all I could
find was this liquid liner so I'm just
drawing a circle on the tip of my nose
you can do this to cater to your own
nose shape but I just kind of lightly
drew a circle on the very tip and then
to give that kind of animated shine on
her little nose I used the white liner
that I used before to draw a little line
on the side of the nose so for her lips
I obviously decided to use red so I just
picked this bright red lipstick to apply
to my lips
so that's it for the makeup I thought it
turned out really cute and very
mouse-like
in my opinion I feel like I look like
little mouse right here
but yeah now moving on to the hair so
for my hair all I did was curl it with
this Conair curling ER and all I did was
curl it from the bottom up to the top I
didn't want to show you guys this
because I've shown you guys this a ton
of times but I just basically curled my
whole head like this and I'm taking a
wide tooth comb now and kind of combing
out the curls so they don't look so
uniform but then I wanted them a little
bouncy because I am a cube Mouse so I
wanted to my hair to be a little bouncy
and not so you know like wavy to my head
so I decided to backcomb a little bit on
the bottom of the curls now many
wouldn't be a mouse without her ears so
of course we have to add some I
purchased these from the Disney Store I
liked him because they were sequin and
sparkly and fun so I just put those on
my head like so obviously you can put
them on however you like it but that's
just how I did for the outfit I decided
to look through my closet instead of
buying a traditional Minnie Mouse
costume I just figured I could find
something that I already had so of
course she wears red or polka dots so I
found this red dress that I had from
ASOS which I purchased a while back but
to make it a little bit more costumey I
decided to add this which is called a
petticoat it's kind of like a tutu slip
I bought it at a costume store where I
live it was only like 999 the costume
store by the way is called Party City in
case you have one so I just added that
and I thought it added more of a cutesy
Flair of course I added black tights and
shoes I wish I had yellow ones but I
just added black ones for this outfit I
found a polka dot dress that I bought
awhile back from forever 21 I thought it
was perfect in case you wanted more of
the Polka Dot mini dress like she's seen
in more so that's it for my Minnie Mouse
tutorial I really hope you guys enjoyed
this if you do try it out don't forget
to tweet me pictures thank you all so
much for watching and I will see you all
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
