to be another celebrity inspired hair
and makeup tutorial and today's look as
you can tell by the title is Miranda
Kerr I've gotten a lot of requests for
her and sent a bunch of pictures and I
chose her more like natural everyday
hair I guess I would say because she has
her hair curled a lot in a lot of the
Victoria's Secret um shoots and stuff
like that her like the fashion show but
like on her every day just like Miranda
Kerr she kind of has this very like
volume eyes straight but not like
completely straight textured hair it's
really really pretty and it looks super
natural and I wanted to show you guys
how to achieve that before because I've
never shown you guys how to blow-dry
your hair with a round brush or anything
like that or give your hair kind of a
straight look but not being like pin
straight so I thought this was a really
cool look and also it's not a curling
hair tutorial because I'm pretty sure
that if I were to do one of her curling
hairstyles I would have used the same
techniques that I've used in a lot of my
videos so I thought I would try
something different out today and then
as for the makeup she kind of has like
all as for like eye makeup she has done
pretty much everything so I kind of
focus more on the actual face makeup
because she always has this kind of like
dewy natural sunkissed glow to her and
so I kind of wanted to show you guys how
I achieved that or how I attempt to
achieve that at home without tanning or
anything like that so if you are
interested in seeing this Miranda Kerr
inspired hair and makeup tutorial please
keep on watching and I will see you guys
in my next video bye everyone
to begin for the face makeup you're
gonna start by applying a BB cream now
the reason why I chose to apply a BB
cream is because BB cream is a mix
between a tinted moisturizer and a
foundation so this is gonna give you
kind of a nice glowy look without making
you look like oily or anything like that
so once you're finished applying that
you're just going to blend that evenly
throughout your skin and by the way my
hair is in the towel because I'm filming
the hair tutorial after I do the makeup
but now I'm just going to apply
concealer to give that flawless look
that Miranda has I'm just going to blend
that in under my eyes with a Beauty
Blender sponge
once you finish this step now you're
going to want to set everything with the
powder so the powder I'm using is a
translucent powder I like using a
translucent powder because it doesn't
change the color of my foundation and I
try to match it perfectly with the BB
cream that I used so now once we finish
with that you're gonna want to give
yourself a little bit of glow and this
is what I'm loving using right now and
this benefit Sunbeam it gives you the
perfect amount of glow and doesn't make
you look very shimmery or glittery or
anything like that and it doesn't change
the color of your foundation so you're
not gonna look orange or anything like
that so this is actually really perfect
to get that kind of sunkissed kissed
glow that Miranda Kerr has so I'm just
gonna apply that on my cheekbones and on
my age of my nose to give myself a
little bit more color I'm just going to
add some blush and that is it for the
face makeup it's fairly simple so now
let's move on to hair for the hair
you're gonna want to start out with wet
hair so either shower or wet it down
whatever you want to do and you're going
to apply some sort of oil to your hair
now I'm using the one and only argan oil
and I'm just going to apply that to the
ends this is going to give your hair a
very soft shiny look to it and it's
gonna look very healthy so I like
applying that next you're gonna want to
use some sort of protectant from your
blow-dryer since you're gonna be using
very harsh heat so I'm using a red can
blow-dry lotion and I'm just going to
evenly disperse that through my hair now
to blow-dry your hair I'm just going to
section it up because I'm blow-drying it
a little bit different I'm gonna be
using a round brush and so it's just way
easier for me to kind of make sure all
the sections are dry when I section my
hair off so now with the round brush
you're just going to place that
underneath certain hair pieces it
doesn't really matter how you go about
this I like to start from the front and
work my way back and I kind of just go
in random sections and you're gonna take
your blow dryer that has the attachment
head to it it kind of looks like a duck
beak but this peak beak is very
important because it directs the air
flow of your blow-dryer and now when you
want you to blow-dry your hair kind of
straight you're gonna want this because
it directs the air flow directly onto
the brush and the hair that is in the
brush so this is very important most
blow dryers do come with them but just
make sure you have one or it comes with
one when you are purchasing one so now
I'm gonna do this do for this is
basically just repeat this process
throughout my whole entire head so I'm
going to do is take that round brush and
place it underneath the hairpieces curl
it under and basically just put that
attachment headpiece directly on to the
brush and work my way down the hairpiece
and I'm just gonna repeat this process
until my hair is dry now what this does
for your hair instead of just
blow-drying it the regular way is it
will blow dry your hair straight if you
don't already have straight hair or
close to straight and it will also give
you a lot of volume especially at the
crown of your head so if you're someone
who doesn't like to tease your hair this
is a perfect way to get that added
volume without actually teasing Miranda
Kerr always has voluminous straight hair
but it's not pin straight so if you want
that look this is a great way to achieve
it but my hair is naturally curly so
there are parts that I'm going to need
to straight know if you have a different
hair type your hair might already be
straight and you'll be good to go but if
you're someone who has curly hair like
me you're gonna need to use a
straightener so I'm doing is taking a
straightener after I applied heat
protectant of course and all I'm gonna
do with the straightener is go down each
sections of hair and I'm kind of going
randomly at this on whatever pieces I
see are still curly or wavy and I'm just
going to curl the straightener or like
rotate it under towards the ends now
you're not gonna want to rotate it all
the way to where your hair will curl but
you're gonna want to do it so your hair
at the end pieces of your hair flip
underneath this technique will also
smooth down any frizz or anything that
your hair produced once you use low
dried your hair so now once you're
finished straightening any sections of
your hair I am I did choose to tease my
hair now this is obviously optional but
Miranda Kerr does have a lot of natural
volume and probably a lot of added
volume so that's what I'm going to do
for this I'm going to tease the crown of
my head just to give myself a little bit
more volume with the straight hair
now to give my hair a little bit more of
a smooth look and make it look a little
bit more healthy I'm just going to take
this John Frieda after straightening
suit smoothing serum and I'm just going
to place that throughout my hair and on
the ends lastly with a straightener I'm
just gonna go over any pieces that I
feel that need to be curled under a
little bit more to give a little bit
more texture to my hair
so that completes my Miranda Kerr
inspired face makeup and hair tutorial I
