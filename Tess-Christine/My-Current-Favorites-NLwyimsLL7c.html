favorites video and I haven't done one
of these in quite some time
and I feel like I always say that in
favourites videos but that's because I
don't have new favorites monthly it's
like every so often I'll try out new
products and then find some that I
absolutely love and that I want to share
with you guys side note this video was
supposed to be get ready with me for the
pool since I live in Minnesota I don't
have a beach but the weather wasn't
really cooperating with me as you can
tell I'm in a fluffy sweater so it's got
a rainy and gross so I haven't finished
that video yet but that should be my
next video along with my Blake Lively
get the look video just so you guys are
aware but a lot of you guys were asking
for a favorites video so I have a few
products here that I'm gonna share with
you guys so if you are interested then
just keep on watching my first favorite
is the Dermalogica oil control lotion
you guys heard me mention this if you
saw my what saved my skin video which
has been doing awesome I'm glad you guys
are loving that video it's just a great
lotion I use it at the start of my
makeup like before I have anything on
I'll wash my face in the morning and
then I will put on this moisturizer
lotion type deal and then I will begin
my makeup and I love it I have oily skin
so it really helps control the shine
throughout here and here love it next
favorite is a primer and it's the
Smashbox photo finish foundation primer
and tuck okay I've been the type of
person that's like primers are totally a
gimmick and like you don't need them but
I caved and I bought this one and I've
actually been using it like everyday I
really like it it just makes my skin
feel smoother it helps with the color
correcting I think tremendously so I
really like it
my next favorite is gonna be familiar if
you watched my Nina Dobrev get the look
video but it is the it cosmetics bye bye
under-eye concealer I purchased this
because for my get the look video I
looked up some of her favorite makeup
products and she had mentioned this one
for when she filmed Vampire Diaries she
says it's great for getting rid of
under-eye circles so I decided to try it
and I really loved it I think it's
awesome I've been using it ever since I
and I really like it so if you're kind
of skeptical on that or you have a
really bad under-eye circles
try this I purchase mine at Ulta and
it's great I love it
next is my favorite blush at the moment
and it is by benefit and it's the rocket
or blush did I say that right I don't
know in the summer I don't wear as much
makeup so it's just kind of a nice blush
of color it kind of has a little bronzy
tint to it so it's kind of like a duo
almost I don't really know I just really
like it on my skin especially when I get
a little bit tanner I think the color
looks really great so I would give this
a try I feel like this would look good
on a lot of skin tones so if you haven't
already tried this blush I think this is
probably my favorite blush out of the
benefit blush that they have next is an
eye primer and is the NARS eyeshadow
primer I'm used to using the urban decay
eyeshadow primer
I liked that for a while the thing is is
like again with like what I said with
the foundation primer I never really
thought I shadow primers made a
difference and like the Urban Decay one
worked it didn't work as well as a lot
of people said because I have like
naturally oily skin and especially my
eyelids my eyeshadow never really lasted
throughout the day so I thought it would
give this a try and I really like this
this is stuff I've actually noticed a
difference within just like the first
use of using this underneath my eye
shadow it doesn't crease as much like in
my eyelids which is what I've noticed
the most with this so yep I like it next
is for the eyebrows and I tried that
Anna stayed Anastasia Anastasia however
you say this brand because I've heard it
said so many different ways but it is
just the dip brow pomade
and I got the brush that it kind of
recommends to get with awesome you guys
like I struggled so much with my
eyebrows like I could never get like
that perfect eyebrow shape that like all
these girls are rockin nowadays I
struggled because I have pretty crazy
brows naturally so it was really hard to
tame them and like fill them in if you
haven't tried this and you're struggling
with like shaping your brows this stuff
is the easiest and trust me guys I'm
seriously terrible at brows like
terrible at my brow
so this stuff I'm telling you is easy
and it makes them look so good thing is
an eyeshadow palette and it is the Too
Faced chocolate bar palette and yes I
know everybody is talking about it I
feel like all the videos I've been
watching on YouTube lately are talking
about this freaking chocolate bar
palette but it's pretty cool guys I'm
not gonna lie to you I think I really
like it it just has a bunch of neutral
colors in it and it has a few like
bright colors like it has a bright pink
color and like this really sparkly like
purpley lavender color but I don't know
I just really like it it's cool and it
kind of it smells like not really like
chocolate but it smells different and it
smells kind of good so there's that okay
the next thing is a setting powder and
it is the Make Up For Ever HD High
Definition powder I'm used to using the
Laura Mercier translucent powder I've
used that for seriously like at least
two years but this stuff I tried because
I was running low on that and I just
wanted something different it's like a
translucent powder so it's not gonna
change the color of your foundation it's
not really cakey when it goes on it's
just like a nice setting powder it
doesn't leave me too shiny or anything
like that and it lasts a lot longer than
the Laura Mercier one which I've been
stuck to for years so I'm glad I found
this because I think this works a little
bit better moving on the next thing is
the velour lashes and these are just
false lashes I purchased for my Nina
Dobrev tutorial I purchased two of them
I don't really like using false lashes
that are banned like I'd rather use the
individual lashes just because I feel
like they look a little bit more natural
and they I don't know aren't so clunky
and heavy but these are awesome you
definitely pay the price for them
they're not like too much more expensive
but they are more expensive than just
like the stuff you can get at drugstores
um but they last a lot longer and they
just look more natural and that's like
my thing like when you put on false
lashes you don't to be like oh that girl
is wearing false lashes you want them
just just be like nice and full at least
if you're anything like me so I've been
loving these and I want to purchase more
but I wish you could purchase these in
stores because I just like hate ordering
stuff like this but my next favorite is
a self-tanner and you're probably
thinking what the
a self-tanner in summer you're crazy but
I live in Minnesota as you guys know I
say that in like every video now but it
took a lot longer than usual for summer
to get here so I was feeling really pale
a few months ago so I started using the
st. Tropez bronzing mousse self-tanner
let's be honest we've heard everybody
rant and rave about this so I was like
I'll give it a try the only thing is
like it doesn't last very long at least
is kind of like what I've noticed it
looks great initially but after like a
week maybe less it's like not really
there anymore but if you have an event
or something nice you have to look tan
for this stuff I feel really safe using
because it doesn't leave me orange as
much as I want to like kind of put on I
kind of just do it all over and it
doesn't leave me like crazy orange or
scary whatever use this it's great my
last favorite is not a product it is a
book and I finished the Fifty Shades of
Grey trilogy and I was tweeting about it
and I was like no it's over what should
I read next and everyone was saying this
so I did I'm not finished in with it yet
so no comments below
on what happens I'm almost done you guys
I'm almost done I did not ask anybody
about this book or I had to not see the
movie so I went into reading this like a
couple days ago like with no backstory
on it really so I don't want to be
ruined the ending on this cuz I have no
idea so I really like this book if you
haven't started reading it please do
it's a fairly easy read you'll get
through it in like two days I swear but
that's the video for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it be sure to try out
any of the things that I mentioned
because I actually genuinely love these
and I should probably tell you guys and
it's my birthday tomorrow
if you know what age I'm turning leave
it below in the comments below and see
if you guys are right because that'd be
funny I hope you guys enjoyed this video
be sure to stay tuned in the next couple
days for some more fun videos that I'm
working on
yeah I will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
