going to be a current favorites video
and I kind of like the idea of a current
favorites video instead of like monthly
favorites because most of the time I
don't have new favorites every month
like if I like something that month I
usually continue using it for more than
a month so unless I find like a new
product during that month I don't really
have a lot of new favorites so I thought
I would try the whole current favorite
thing because I like I like that idea a
lot more so I'm gonna show you some of
my current favorite beauty products as
of now so the first product that I'm
loving as of right now and I've been
using it for a while now but it's
something that I use everyday so I
thought I would include it in this
favorites but it is the Garnier skin
renew anti puff a roller and I've
mentioned this in some of my older
videos but if you haven't tried this yet
you definitely should it just feels
really really good underneath your eyes
and I really do believe that it helps
the puffiness underneath your eyes
especially if you have to wake up early
in the morning like before school or
something this helps wake you up and
have your eyes look a little bit more
refreshed so I love that right now I got
mine at Target
the next thing I'm loving right now for
makeup is the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation and I just recently did a
review on this foundation along with the
Laura Mercier silk cream foundation so
if you haven't seen that video she'd
definitely go check it out but I'm
loving this right now again it is made
for film and camera so that's why I like
it a lot plus I like the foundation
itself it's very light on my skin so I'm
really loving this right now I think it
shows up really great on camera and for
an everyday foundation so I definitely
think this is worth the money I love
this foundation and for the for you
those of you interested the color that I
am in is 120 right now the nice makeup
product that I'm loving right now is the
Korres lip gloss and I've mentioned this
in one of my first favorites I think it
was my first favorite as I mentioned
this but this look gloss seriously is
amazing and I'm wearing it right now it
is just the perfect color it goes great
over any lipstick color well maybe
except for like a bright red color but
it is the perfect color my Ulta I just
recently picked up a new new lip gloss
tube and it was 50% off so the price was
only like $7 for this when normally it's
like fourteen so that was a pretty good
deal for this and it lasts quite a while
it's a small tube but it lasts a while
for me at Lee
so I really like this a lot it's just a
really really good light pink color the
next makeup product that I'm loving
right now is a mascara and it is the NYC
high definition Volume Mascara it's an
orange tube like this and what I really
like about it is the brush on it it's
very unique I just don't have a brush
like this I'll hold it like this it is
like square shaped almost like rectangle
shaped and it's not like it's not round
like the LashBlast fusion so that's what
I really like about this it really
really works with your eyelashes I like
it a lot you can really extend them up
and it gives them great volumes the next
beauty product that I'm loving are these
masks and you can get these at Ulta at
least that's where they sell them for me
the one that I'm showing you right now
is like an anti-stress peel-off mask but
I did recently with my roommate we did
the mud masks or they're like darker or
they're like a light green color and
it's for like it's for pores so it's to
reduce the size of your pores and clean
them out and I really really like these
masks a lot they're really fun to do
with your friends anyways but I think
they actually really work they make your
skin feel really soft and rejuvenated
and I like these right now I can't off
the top of my head remember the price of
these but you can get these at Ulta they
have them in the little write as you
checkout they have that little stand
with all the stuff and that's where I
saw all these masks the next beauty
product that I'm liking right now is for
your hair there's two things from I here
one is this teasing brush and if you
don't own a teasing brush already you
should definitely go pick one up you can
get one at Sally's Beauty Supply I think
even target sells the mail or any hair
salon will have these I got this from
one of my friend whose mom is the
teasing or teasing uh the hair stylist
so she got this from me but you can get
these at pretty much any hair salon or a
Sally Beauty Supply I know has a ton of
different ones but these are really
really good I use this every single day
if you like teasing your hair if you
don't like teasing your hair then
obviously I wouldn't recommend this but
I just think these cheeses your hair
really good and gives it a lot of volume
the next thing for your hair that I
really like is the John Frieda Frizz
Ease flawless finishing cream I've been
using this
and I had this for a while and I used to
only use it when I straighten my hair
but I found that it actually works
really great on curling hair so once I
curl my hair I run this through this
especially the ends and it makes the
ends just look really put together and
not so frizzy sometimes I get frizz ease
up here too like on the top of my head
when I either straighten my hair or I
curl it so I'll just take like a pea
sized amount and rub it to between my
hands and like smooth that down and it
just gives the curls a nice shine it
just makes them go all together they
just look really pretty and the smell is
good too so I like that a lot and
another block plus about this is that it
doesn't make your hair look greasy I was
kind of nervous about that because
usually finishing cream is really greasy
and this did not make my hair greasy at
all but it probably would if I used a
lot of it so if I used a lot of this at
a time and put it through my hair my
hair would kind of look a little shiny
and a little weird so but just a little
bit works the next two things are for my
body and I've shown you guys this before
in my last favorites video but they are
the hand and food or the soap and glory
lotions this one's for your foot and
this one's for your hands and these work
so good I absolutely love these they
smell amazing and they really do work my
hands feel so soft my feet especially my
heels get really dry in the winter so I
use this heel genius but I mean it can
go all over your foot and they work so
good and now you can get them at Sephora
so yay for that because I've got bought
these when I was in England but now you
can get them at Sephora so that's really
exciting so if you haven't tried any of
these products that you definitely
should it lasts a long time like I said
I got these both in England and they are
not even close to being out so
definitely worth the purchase and they
work great so that is all my current
favorites for you guys I didn't want to
like unleash with like a ton of
different things to show you so I just
showed you a few of my favourite things
that I'm using everyday I hope this
helped you guys figure out what you want
to buy next at the store if you are
interested in trying any new beauty
products I hope it helped you a little
bit with figuring out things that I like
and things that you make like if you
watch my videos a lot so again I really
really hope you guys liked this video I
hope you're all are having a fab
the state and I will see you guys next
time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
