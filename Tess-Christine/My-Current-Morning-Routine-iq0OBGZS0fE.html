be my morning routine so starting out
there's me sleeping super exciting and I
get up around 8:30 9 o'clock every day I
really try to get up this early even
though some days I like to sleep in it
just gives me a head start in the day
and ready to film videos so I still live
in my college apartment I'm going to
live here until May so I'm passing my
roommates rooms and I am headed into the
bathroom now in the morning I really
like to wash my face it just makes me
feel more awake and ready for the day a
face wash that I really enjoy using is
the cleaning clear morning burst skin
brightening obviously it's yellow it's
my absolute favorite it just wakes my
face up and it helps with acne spots
which is really awesome because I do
have some of those and also the spot on
my cheek you guys haven't really seen
that but that's a birthmark in case you
were wondering but like I said it just
makes me feel more awake and refreshed
so I love doing that right away so after
I'm done doing that I had right over to
my Keurig because coffee is definitely
the first thing I must do in the morning
so while that's heating up I'm going to
make breakfast now I really love
breakfast so I kind of choose what I
brought whatever I'm feeling at the
moment and today I chose oatmeal I
really like the maple brown sugar kind
that's my absolute favorite um I've just
been like obsessed with oatmeal lately
so it's one of my favorite things to
make in the morning plus it's really
filling and hearty and it's just
delicious
so I'm going to put that in the
microwave and put it in for about a
minute in half and while that is cooking
I am going to go get my coffee ready I'm
gonna go in our cupboard and pick out a
mug which we're lacking because we just
did dishes I'm just gonna put in a k-cup
I love hazelnut flavored coffee it's my
favorite so I'm putting that in there
and letting the coffee brew and then I'm
grabbing my oatmeal and what I love to
do with my oatmeal is add honey this is
just some organic local honey it's
really delicious but it definitely has a
different texture than regular honey so
that's why it's a little it looks a
little bit harder but um so I just mix
that in there I just really like how
taste in my oatmeal and then after I'm
done mixing that up I'm just going to go
ahead and grab my coffee what I like to
add to my coffee is just a little bit of
sugar depending on the type of coffee I
use so I'm just going to add that and
then stir it up and then I usually drink
coffee with creamer I actually really
have never not used creamer so I'm using
this coconut milk creamer it's dairy
free which I've kind of been doing
lately so I really like it and it tastes
identical to the regular creamer so when
I eat my breakfast and drink my coffee I
usually go into the living room with my
roommates and we all drink coffee and
eat our breakfast together and just kind
of chat but when I was filming this my
roommates weren't home so I couldn't
really show you that but if they're not
home I will usually just watch TV when I
was filming this I'm pretty sure I was
watching Supernatural if you have ever
seen a comment below it's a super crazy
and intense show but after I'm done with
breakfast I will head into the bathroom
and I will start my shower now it's
totally random to me whether I shower at
night or in the morning but this morning
I just decided to take a shower so in
the shower what I use is the Aveda color
conserved shampoo and conditioner I have
color treated hair so I like to treat it
with shampoo that caters to that and
then obviously some other shower
necessities that I use so once I'm
finished with my shower I hop out wrap
my towel around myself and walk myself
all the way back to my room
so after I get out of the shower I
really like to moisturize my skin so I'm
use just using a nathie no daily
moisturizer and moisturizing my legs and
arms I like to do this especially if
I've just shaved my legs as well because
it really helps with keeping them
moisturized so all I did now is just
throw on some comfy clothes to get ready
in some leggings on a sweatshirt and
then wrap my hair in a towel and of
course I've got to make my bed that dog
is my little dog that I've had since
I've been really little and I still
sleep with him and then now I am just
going to spray a rosewater spray all
over my face it's kind of like a toner
it feels so good and then of course we
got to use deodorant so I put that on as
well so after my hair is a little bit
less wet and kind of absorbed into the
towel I'm going to begin combing out my
hair with a pic or a wide toothed comb
they both work the same so I'm just
going to comb out my hair and then part
it how I want for the day and then the
products I use in my wet hair are the
Aveda damage control spray this just
really helps with UV protection and
split ends so I really like it and then
lastly I use the orb a I think it's
pronounced gold blast hair oil
absolutely love this stuff and I just
basically rubbed this mainly focusing
and on my ends and then working it out
my hair so after I'm finished with that
I never blow dry my hair I can't even
remember the last time that I did I
usually like to let it air dry so I just
kind of pin up my bangs with a clip and
then I go out into my living room again
first hanging out my towel of course but
while my hair is drying this is the time
where I usually like to kind of sit down
and check social media and talk to you
guys a little bit when I wake up in the
morning it's kind of like mid morning
right now
and then I also go over my video to-do
list and see what I have to do today and
obviously I'm checking this one off the
list today and then I usually go on
YouTube and catch up on some videos
because I enjoy watching them as well so
I'm just doing that and once I've had my
fix of that I usually get up when my
hair is semi dry and I head back into my
room and start to get ready
so starting out the lotion I've been
using is the Dermalogica oil control
lotion this seriously has been a
lifesaver for my oily skin and it really
helps with breakouts because I was
struggling with that for a while but has
really helped a lot and now it's time to
put my makeup on I was debating on
keeping this in here because you guys
have seen me put on my makeup so many
times but my foundation and makeup
routine kind of always changes plus it's
a part of my morning routine anyways so
I might as well show you
so obviously I'm putting on foundation
and concealer and using a Beauty Blender
sponge because it's my favorite and then
finishing everything with a translucent
powder and then of course bronze and my
face because I'm not getting any Sun
with this winter and then putting on my
favorite blush at the moment and of
course highlighting my cheekbones now
I'm just moisturizing my lips with the
chapstick and then I'm going to fill in
my brows this brow tool from Benefit is
seriously awesome it's like a little
wand it's makes things so easy and it
just fills them in so nice I absolutely
love it so on a regular day I'll
probably just throw on mascara and be
good to go but if I'm gonna put makeup
on my eyes what I love to do is just
take a shimmery pink color and then put
a brown color into the crease and then
finish it with some L'Oreal gel eyeliner
it's my absolute favorite and it's so
easy and quick because I've been doing
it so much so lastly of course I'm going
to curl my lashes and I'm good to go
so for my hair I'm just going to take it
down once it's dry and I'm going to use
this crazy YouTube editing thing that
everyone does snap boom my hair is done
so awesome if it only worked that way
but it doesn't I just used my Conair
one-inch curling iron like I always do
and after that I'm just going to go into
the bathroom and brush my teeth don't
think I forgot that part but I like to
do it when I'm kind of like all ready to
go so I'm just using the crest 3d white
toothpaste and I'm just going to brush
my teeth and you guys get a zoom in on
my mouth
super cute
so after I'm done with that now it's
time to change for the day so I am
wearing these high-waisted pants that I
absolutely love they're from Nasty Gal
they're super super comfy and I just
love them and when I filmed this it was
Monday so I had to throw on my Monday
chic shirt from forever 21 because you
know you got to make Monday fabulous
somehow and since it's still cold I am
probably going to wear a flannel over it
but for the meantime I'm just going to
tie it around my waist while I'm inside
so yeah that's my typical morning
routine I really hope you guys enjoyed
it let me know what you think in the
comments below and I will see you guys
in the next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
