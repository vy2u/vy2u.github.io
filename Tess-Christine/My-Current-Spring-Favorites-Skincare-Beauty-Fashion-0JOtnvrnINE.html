to be a current favorites video I have a
bunch of stuff that I've been absolutely
loving and some new stuff that I tried
out and then some stuff you might
recognize but basically if they made it
in this video you know that I've been
using it like crazy so to start out with
skincare I'm gonna start with two of my
skincare favorites both of them are from
Olay fresh effects you guys know I've
been working with them for a while now
so I'm lucky enough to be able to try
out some of their new products from
their clear skin line which you guys
know I'm a huge fan of trying to find
awesome clear skin acne saving products
or acne helper products does that make
sense I hope so you've seen both of
these before they're probably my
all-time favorites from this line the
first one is the Olay fresh effects
clear skin swirled mattifier you guys
know I use this like crazy I use it
before my makeup but what's really
awesome about it is basically just
smooths your skin like a primer but it
also helps get rid of redness reduces
pores all that fun stuff you know that
you want to go away this kind of does
the trick so I really like this a lot
and then the second one is the Olay
fresh effects clear skin spot zinger
both of these you can get in there three
in one or three system kit so kind of
bang for your buck there but anyways
this one is a spot thing or pretty
self-explanatory you basically just put
it on any pimple you may have I like
using this at night and then overnight
it will kind of work in my skin it has
silicic acid in it so it's a great acne
treatment product I've noticed it a lot
I had one on my forehead here and I put
it this on last night and it's
significantly reduced I wish I would
have shown you guys last night because
it was a honker next up we have makeup
my first makeup favorite is this thing
by Make Up For Ever it's the HD pressed
powder the reason why I like this so
much is it's a pressed powder form and
it's in a compact so basically I keep
these two things in my bag and it's been
a lifesaver for me if you guys live in
New York or kind of understand the
humidity here I'm not used to it it is
humid like crazy so I'm sweating a lot
super easy to just apply really quickly
and it definitely helps reduce the shine
yay next up is a blush this I have on my
cheeks now and my friend Kerry had just
used it and she's obsessed with it so I
told
to get it she like loves the color I
think it's a color that looks good on
any skin tone I really truly believe it
I haven't tried it on every skin tone
but I really think it's awesome it's by
the balm cosmetics and it is the cabana
boy next up is an eyeshadow palette and
this is the one that I've been using for
pretty much every day for about a month
now it is the Smashbox double exposure
palette looks like this in specific I
use this side of the palette I've always
been more of like a neutral color girl
anyways so what I like about this eye
basically these two are match so they're
kind of like my go-to colors this is
like a shimmery these are kind of like
pinky undertones but and this one is
kind of like a peach color which I used
all over my lid then I use this matte
cream color on my just my base of my lid
this in the crease and then black on my
I just took a flat shadow brush and put
that on my lashline for just a really
easy natural everyday look like I said
it's been really hot here recently so I
don't like to like take on a lot of
makeup so it's nice when I just kind of
have a go-to eyeshadow routine and yeah
that's basically it okay how'd you go
run and get this in the bathroom because
I almost forgot it but this is another
one of my favorites right now and it is
the Smashbox photo angle pure pigment
gel liner in black I really like using
gel liner pens recently and I don't know
they just give me a lot of control with
my winged eyeliner it's one of my go-to
looks and I really recommend this and
I'm putting this in my video because one
I use it a lot and two I think it's
perfect for those of you who are just
kind of trying out the winged liner and
need a lot of control because this
really gives it to you next up our two
hair products the first one both of
these I have in sample sizes I tried
them recently when I went to the
Birchbox store in New York I just picked
up these two things and the first one is
a dry shampoo I will have it's like
weirdly named so I will have it in the
description box below but this dry
shampoo is awesome I've been using it a
lot and almost gone with it it's almost
empty and I think I'm gonna go buy the
big version of this because I really
like it and it actually works on my hair
like a lot of dry shampoos don't work
for me so I don't know why I just think
that they don't so this one I definitely
found
works I've honestly gone without three
days without washing my hair once and
that's a long time and I just used this
and it's really awesome so I definitely
recommend this and then the other one is
a texturizing spray I usually love the
or Bay one but I have to order that
because I don't really know where to buy
that in store and that's always a hassle
for me just because it is but this is
another weird name so I'm just gonna
have it in the description box but it's
a texturizing spray
there's the Sun again Suns back
basically just spray it in my roots kind
of give it a shake and it's definitely
has more volume in my hair especially
second day I love using this stuff so I
would recommend this for texturizing
spray if you were looking for one next
and last for the same it's video are all
of my fashion favorites I have a few new
ones for you
first up chokers and this is so funny
because I never thought this would
actually come back when I was in early
high school this was a huge trend we'd
have like just the tiny black chokers
and we thought we were so cool I did not
think it was gonna be back but it's back
in it's fierce and I'm loving it
but I just like how creative it's
getting now both of these are from
Topshop I believe well the Sun is not
cooperating with me today so I'm just
going to keep rolling with it another
favorite that I've been wearing like
crazy are these sunglasses recently
picked up how do you say this I've heard
it's is it Quay kay I don't know this
sunglass line is really really fun I
love it so much they're not as pricey as
Ray Ban which is awesome
and I don't know I just think they're
really cool these have been kind of my
go-to a lot of you guys on my Instagram
Sun have been commenting about it and I
don't know I just think they're really
cool next and last are two different
shoes the first one are these fun
sandals which I love I've been wearing a
lot of flat shoes since having moved to
New York which I'm gonna explain that in
a video on my main channel real soon but
anyways these kind of sandals they're
like fun decorative they're not like
super high or anything so it's kind of
fun to like if you're dressed up or have
to look like nicer these sandals are
really awesome I will have a bunch of my
favorites a link to below
they just kind of jazz up an elephant
you don't really have to do much next up
are these bibs
I'll have been wearing these like crazy
they are just the kids they're just
basic kids but these are like all black
leather me oh my gosh an all-black
leather you can really wear with pretty
much any outfit and it's gonna look good
it's not gonna look necessarily like a
sneaker but they are as comfortable as a
sneaker and I don't know just on my
favorite this month or two but anyways
those are my current favorites I really
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me
know or tweet me or Instagram me you try
out any of these products and you love
them too hopefully you do I really think
you will and yeah that's it thank you
guys for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
