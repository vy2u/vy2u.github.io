be a favorites video and I haven't done
a favorites video in a while but that's
mostly because I haven't been making
videos in a while so I thought I would
make a favorites video for you guys to
tell you guys what I've been loving over
these past couple months I guess you
would say since I made my last favorites
video these things I mean some of the
stuff is the same but some of it has
changed I decided to throw in beauty
favorites fashion favorites and a couple
of random like music and other YouTube
channel favorites because in my last
favorites video I asked you guys if
you'd be interested in that and you all
gave it a thumbs up so that's perfect so
that's what I'm going to be doing today
so if you're interested please keep on
watching so first I'm gonna start off
with my Beauty favorites and the first
favorite is gonna be well actually these
next three products are all gonna be for
your face the first is this foundation I
mentioned this foundation before but I
went back to this I was using the Chanel
Vita aqua Lumiere foundation for a
really long time probably all through
the summer and I really liked that
foundation but something made me switch
back to this one and I love this one a
lot of you guys are asking me which one
I liked better I couldn't really decide
at the time but I think it's this one so
that's why I decided to include it in
this favorites video I really like the
Make Up For Ever HD foundation it works
really well on my skin and it doesn't
irritate it at all or anything and it
just feels really light and nice and
that's why I really like it the color I
am in right now is n120 for those of you
guys that are interesting my next
favorite is a concealer and it is the
L'Oreal True Match super blendable
concealer looks like this um I really
like this stuff a lot I use this for
underneath my eyes and I really really
do like it I think it covers up my dark
circles really well I don't know why I
decided to try this I just did and I
ended up really liking it I used to use
the Bobbi Brown skin corrector which
isn't a concealer but that works really
well for underneath your eyes but this
seems to work just as well for me and
covers them up pretty well the color I
chose was fair light that's mostly
because I use it for underneath my eyes
not to cover up blemishes I use the
Sonia Kashuk um quad for that the next
is another face product and I'm thinking
about making a whole new foundation
routine or even just like
get ready with me video with using these
products because they're all kind of
like go in a row but this one is the
L'Oreal True Match super blendable
powder and the reason why I have this is
because I use this to contour so I got
it in a darker shade the color I got it
in is classic tan and I use this to
contour because it's not shimmery like
some bronzers are which I don't like cuz
I don't like to use shimmery bronzers to
contour my face I'll probably have to go
a little bit darker when I go into the
summer months because my skin obviously
gets tanner so I'll have to go a little
bit darker but this is what I'm loving
right now so if you guys want to see an
updated foundation routine was kind of
all the new products I've been using
please let me know in the comments below
if you're interested in that because I
will do that for you guys
so my next two favorites have to do with
my skin so my first favorite is I
mentioned this plenty of times before
but it is the clean and clear advantage
acne spot treatment this stuff works
awesome if you haven't tried it please
do it's a really really good product for
on-the-spot acne treatment or just if
you have a blemish or something you put
this on it and then go to bed and in the
morning it's significantly decreased
it's awesome I love this and I will
continue to show you guys this in my
favorites video because I have yet to
find a product that will beat this it
does sting a little bit when you put it
on your blemish but that goes away
within seconds it's just because it's a
really strong acne medicine that helps
obviously clear breakouts you can get
this at like I think I purchased this at
Target so pretty much anywhere where
they sell cleaning clear products the
next is a face wash and it is the
cleaning clear advantage three-in-one
exfoliating cleanser I'm pretty sure you
can buy like all the stuff in a set but
I just purchased it separately this
stuff is awesome and like you guys know
to wash my face I've been using Proactiv
since I've been in seventh grade and I
wanted to try something new and my
roommate Christina uses this so I
thought I would give it a shot and I
found out that I really really like it
I've been using it ever since I've tried
it so probably for a month or two now it
seems to be just as effective as the
proactive that I've been using on my
skin so if you have tried Proactiv and
it didn't work for you I definitely give
this just this a shot because I really
like this stuff
you can get this at drugstores the next
product is for your hair and I've
mentioned this before but it is the John
Frieda Frizz Ease secret weapon flawless
finishing cream really liked this stuff
a lot I've mentioned it to you guys
before like I said but this stuff just
works so well for taming flyaways frizzy
hair I'm just kind of smoothing down
your ends it lasts a long time because
you only need like a pea-sized amount on
your hand and then just rub it probably
through here you don't want to focus too
much on your roots because it'll get
kind of greasy looking but this stuff
works really good and if you haven't
tried it definitely try it because I
really really like this diet the next
items are all gonna be fashion items and
my first favorite for these kind of
winter months I guess you could say our
booties and these in particular are my
favorite they're lace-up booties and
they're wedges I got these at Target I
really really like these a lot I've been
wearing these almost every time that I
go out even sometimes during the day I
wear these for Christmas actually they
kind of dress up any outfit they're not
too tall and they're really comfortable
because they are wedges so any kind of
wedged bootie is like my absolute
favorite for this kind of winter months
I guess like I said I got these at
Target but these I've seen like this
kind of style boot I've seen in a lot of
places fashion favorite is lace I'm
absolutely obsessed with lace this
season I don't know what it is I just
think it looks so pretty and classic and
I love it and my two taps in particular
that are my favorite are one is this one
and I just purchased this one actually
and it's from Zara I don't know how well
you guys are going to be able to see
this but it's basically like a lace
peplum top it is so cute so this one's
from Zara and then I have this one which
is kind of like a see-through one but
you wear like black underneath it and
this one is from Kohl's it's the Lauren
Conrad stuff but I just think lace is so
pretty and it makes anything look just
like dressed up and nice and I just love
it for the winter and like pairing it
with like red or like cranberry lips is
so pretty I love that and my last
fashion favorite are infinity scarves
these two in particular have gotten
quite the use out of them this season
with me they're both I believe I don't
know where this one's from this one's
from Nasty Gal I don't know where this
one is from actually but these you can
find seriously anywhere forever21 has a
bunch of
just infinity scarves in general
infinity meaning that they're like loop
scarves so I loop them around but these
are like so perfect for what I need in
the winter they just keep me so warm I
love them they're just so awesome as far
as other favorites go my first favourite
that I guess I'm gonna categorize is
music and my music favorite right now is
Ed Sheeran I've been tweeting about it
actually a lot I'm on such an edge here
and kick right now I've been listening
to his album on repeat I don't know what
it is I just love his music especially
right now I don't know what's going on
but I just love it so much and I know a
lot of you guys are add cheer and fans
