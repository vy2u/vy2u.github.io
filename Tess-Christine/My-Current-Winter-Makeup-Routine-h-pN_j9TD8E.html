be my full face makeup tutorial and I
figured I was due in for a new one of
these because I was getting a lot of
comments on Instagram and I looked at my
last full face makeup routine video that
I uploaded a couple months ago and a lot
of the products in that video I've been
kind of switching out for some new
products and I absolutely love them so I
really want to share them with you guys
this video is also in collaboration with
Maybelline to showcase kind of a winter
wonderland look because it's now winter
videos and I'm so excited as you can see
my bedding is starting to change my
apartment is just fall to winter
transition like crazy so I figured I
would show you guys a makeup look kind
of centered around that so be sure to
head over to Maybelline's youtube
channel and subscribe to them for more
fall to winter transition looks and yeah
if you guys are interested at all in
this makeup look then just keep on
watching to the end I'm going to be
using the Maybelline that gilded in gold
palette and this is limited edition this
year so it's only in stores this month
so if you like it get your hands on it
soon and I'm gonna be using those four
colors in the palette as my main
eyeshadow colors so I'm taking that pink
shimmery color and I'm placing that all
over my lid and then I'm going to go in
with the gold shimmery color and place
that over that focusing that more into
the crease I tend to reach for more
shimmery metallic eyeshadow colors in
the winter more so than the fall and
when fall ends summer when I use more
matte shades then with just your regular
bronzer I'm taking a fluffy brush and
placing that in my crease color as a
transition and just kind of add some
depth so a great tip is just use your
bronzer for this part then I'm going in
with that darker color in the Maybelline
palette and I'm placing that on my lash
line kind of Fanning that outwards
focusing this on the outer half of my
eyelids
then with a slightly tapered a blending
brush I'm going to go ahead and blend
that kind of all together to give it
kind of this gradient seamless look
super natural I wear this look almost
every day then I'm going to take that
lightest shimmery shade in that palette
and place that just with my finger on
the center of my eyelids just as a
highlight and I also like to put this on
my brow bone I just feel like this opens
up your eye a lot and it just makes it
look super pretty
moving on to eyeliner I'm using the
Maybelline master graphic eyeliner by
eye studio and I'm creating a small wing
I tend to reach for more black eyeliners
in the winter just because it adds a lot
more dimension to my eyes whereas in the
summer fall time I tend to skip the
eyeliner part and just keep it super
natural but for the winter I kind of
like to make it a little bit more
intense I really like this eyeliner
though because it is kind of like a
marker and it gives you a lot of control
so I just create a slight wing at the
end and then slowly drag it in as you
can see here I work really slowly at the
step because I don't like my eyeliner to
be super dramatic just a small line then
I'm going in with an eyelash curler and
I'm curling my lashes and then I'm going
to be using the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara to comb downwards on
my lashes first and then bring it
upwards I love this wand it gives me a
lot of control I also like to layer my
mascara so I'm going to go ahead with
Maybelline the falsies a push-up drama
mascara and I'm gonna apply another coat
to my top lashes I like this because it
has cup shaped bristles to kind of grab
your lashes and push it upwards super
dramatic I love it now moving on to my
crazy brows my brows are always just
insane so what I found I really like the
most is the Anastasia brow duo kit the
first one is kind of a wax I really like
it my brows as you can see are kind of
curly and crazy so this really helps me
kind of control them tame them down and
fill them in so I'm just doing that like
so I take my time with this because my
brows need it so I'm doing that on both
and then a really important step to
filling in my brows is I always brush it
out afterwards and before
now that my eyes are done I'm going in
with the benefit Porefessional primer to
prime my face minimize the appearance of
pores all the good stuff and then for
foundation my holy grail foundation is
the Make Up For Ever HD I will probably
never stray from this I love it so much
and I'm just basically putting that on
my face with a Beauty Blender it's the
best way I found to apply foundation it
just gives you a very natural airbrush
looking appearance and yeah I love it I
could go on all day about it and then
moving on to concealer I'm using my
cosmetics bye bye under-eye concealer or
the under eye part which is kind of the
important part and then for blemishes
and everything like that I'm using the
Maybelline fit me concealer and yeah
just kind of blending that out with the
other end of my Beauty Blender sponge
now to set everything i'm using the
laura mercier translucent illuminizer
powder and i'm placing that underneath
my eyes especially where my concealer
was and on my t-zone so pretty much
anywhere where i put concealer because
that's where my face gets the oily eyes
throughout the day i'm stead of setting
that like so and then I'm taking a Becca
bronzer and I'm placing that on the 3b
part of my face so underneath my
cheekbones on the top of my forehead and
underneath my jawline if I want to I
will also run that on my nose just for a
little bit of a balance or a slight nose
contour but I hardly ever do that
back to the awesome Maybelline palette
this is kind of like an all-in-one thing
so I'm taking the secret hidden
highlighter underneath there and I'm
placing it on the tops of my cheekbones
on the top of my nose and on my Cupid's
bow and then I'm also going to go ahead
with that blush because that blush is
awesome it's just kind of like a really
neutral peachy pink color and which is
my favorite type of blush and I'm
placing that on the apples of my cheeks
now that my face makeup is done I can't
forget the rest of the eyes so I'm just
quickly going in with a pencil brush and
picking up a bronzer and I'm placing
that on the underside of my lower lash
line and then I'm going in in that
Maybelline palette and taking that
illuminizer and placing that on the
inner corners of my eyes just to kind of
brighten it I love doing this it's a
really awesome trick and then I'm going
in with that push-up mascara and coating
that on my bottom lashes so for my lip
color I usually tend to go for a ma B
pink color that actually looks a lot
like my nails but this time I'm going
for a red color or like a berry so the
one that I've been loving is a
Maybelline creamy matte lipstick in the
color divine wine I think it kind of
completes the makeup look overall it's
something that's super effortless and I
think it's really pretty
what that's it for my video today really
hope you guys enjoyed it be sure to give
it a thumbs up if you are excited for my
winter videos this year because I know I
am and I hope I'm not the only one if
you try out my look or create your own

mascara and I will check them out but
yeah I think that's it thank you guys so
much for watching again and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
