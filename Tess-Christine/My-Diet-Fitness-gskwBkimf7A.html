was a very highly requested video and
that is my diet and workout first I want
to get into my a little bit about my
background because I feel like that's
super important for something like this
because everybody is different in their
body types and how genetics work out so
I kind of wanted to give a little bit of
background by that because a lot of you
guys were interested in what I do to
keep myself healthy for pretty much my
whole life I did not have to watch what
I eat or anything through middle school
in high school I didn't have to watch
what I could eat whatever I want and not
gain a pound and just stay exactly the
way I was which if you guys watch my Q&amp;amp;A
video you guys knew that I was picked on
a little bit in middle school and a
little bit of high school with the way
that I was size wise I was very short
and I was very skinny and very kind of
awkward looking and that's just always
been kind of how I grew up and that's
kind of the women in my family that's
kind of um how they were when they were
younger as well so definitely genetics
has a huge role in my appearance so
obviously duh right but um the way that
I my body takes food and exercise if
that's all genetic for me my mother put
me in dance when I was 4 so I started
exercising off the bat right away so
that definitely increased my metabolism
and I was younger I never had to worry
about the gym or have a gym membership
at all even through high school because
I'd always did dance I did dance for
almost 6 hours a night but if it wasn't
dance team it was studio it was the
studio that I was in or it was teaching
man so um that is what I did for
exercise my whole life so basically I
didn't have to watch anything that I ate
because not only was I exercising almost
6 hours a night but I was very blessed
with having um small jeans and my family
colleges when I really know and started
to notice my body changing and my body
reacting to different types of food and
different exercises so I started to eat
a little bit more healthy in college
just a little bit and I noticed that
when I would eat the days where I would
eat very healthy I would have a lot more
energy
and then those days when I wouldn't eat
very healthy if you know what I'm saying
so I started noticing that and of course
I loved the days where I felt really
energetic I felt like motivated to do
things so I kind of decided to like
change my life and eat healthy and I'm
not very drastic I don't I'm not
strictly you know just healthy greens
fruits vegetables every day like I have
my cheat days cheat meals you know where
I like because I enjoy food and I enjoy
junk food and things like that so
they're always nice to eat but I do
definitely watch that a little bit more
now that I noticed that I'm not
exercising as much every day and I am
starting to grow up and I do have boobs
and hips now like I didn't in middle
school so it's definitely different in
that sense as for workout wise if I were
to workout I would only workout probably
1 to 3 times the times a week I don't
think I've ever worked out more than
that maybe like a couple times with a
friend here that I live with in the
summer we always go in the morning and
if she motivates me to go a lot then I
will go more than three times a week but
most of the time if I do workout like
during last year's school year I worked
out maybe twice a week through the gym
that we had through our university
otherwise in the summer I would work
some weeks I'd work like five days for
working out five days a week and some
days I would work only two so it all
really depends on my motivation because
I don't have like a really big I have a
drive to you know get healthy and be
healthy and fit but I don't have a drive
to lose weight I I don't see myself as
someone who needs to lose weight so I
don't feel that I need to go to the gym
obviously the gym is healthy in other
aspects of your body not necessarily
just to lose weight but to be you know a
healthier person your body needs
exercise to be healthy but I like to do
other things to be healthy I like to go
outside I like to hang out with friends
me and my family we go bike riding we do
we do things very energetic outside in
that sense so my gym I don't really have
a specific workout if I were to go to
the gym what I love to do is I love to
go on the elliptical I'm not a runner so
I hate the treadmill absolutely hate the
treadmill at like despise the treadmill
but if I do I feel like I should go on
it I will it's a great workout so I love
that but
elliptical is what I truly like to do
there and I usually go about 20 minutes
on the elliptical and then if I feel
really motivated I will go 10 minutes 10
minutes on a bicycle and I love that
that works out and gets me sweating gets
my heartbeat pumping my body move in so
I love doing that and then I usually go
to into some sort of a weight room and I
just started getting into weights like
this last year I love working out my
legs I'm not a big upper body workout
person but I love working my legs and my
butt that's my favorite I love that
workout and I love working my core that
is it for my gym routine I don't do
anything special I've never taken any
jaqen like one class I really want to
start yoga because I heard that that was
really fun obviously with me going away
for studying abroad I won't have a lot
of time to do stuff like that but when I
get when I get back I definitely want to
take up some sort of yoga class I think
that would be fun if any of you guys ah
take yoga you should let me know if you
like it in the comments below because I
want to take it I also want to take
Pilates I heard that is really fun as
well so let me know if you take any of
those and what you guys think of them
because I'd be very interested because
I've never really taken a class before
like I said I've always been involved in
dance so I never really got the
opportunity to take class or let alone
wanted to take a class now on to food
what I eat um like I said I don't like
to deprive myself of the foods that I
like I really do like a lot of food any
of my friends would know me that I just
love to eat things like I love food I
have I'm a sweet tooth maniac like I
love every type of candy there is so I
definitely have that sweet tooth but
obviously I need to watch what I want to
eat a little bit more not necessarily
because I think I'm fat or anything it's
just because it's healthy for you to eat
better things then skittles and Twix
bars every day you know what I'm saying
so I definitely started to realize that
a little bit more in college and with
noticing how food affects you a little
bit more so I definitely try to eat
healthy I noticed though that eating
healthy can be very expensive it's so
much different when you're living on
your own and you don't have your parents
buying you groceries like when I go to
the grocery store I will usually pick up
frozen food like me my roommates would
always pick up frozen food and you know
so much easier and quicker to make a
meal then it is
- you know chop up fresh produce and not
only that but fresh produce is very
expensive and it goes bad quickly so you
have to eat it all right away so that
gets pricey so I was always kind of
hesitant to eat super healthy like that
because it I just couldn't really afford
it and I felt like like none of it
lasted long enough I felt like I was
always going to grocery shopping so I
wanted to find something that was like a
little bit easier for me to kind of get
the nutrients that that would supply you
with but a lot more accessible and a lot
more affordable and it was funny because
my sophomore year this last year my
sophomore year second semester one of my
friends has discovered this product that
her family started using and it's fairly
new but it is called Body By Vi and I'll
show you the package what it looks like
now this is what it looks like basically
it is just a nutritional Shake Mix it's
powder inside here and it has so many
vitamins and minerals and just nutrients
in here it's crazy and if I knew what
all of this does for you like I would
sound so intelligent right now but I
don't but um I went to the this product
is sold kind of like how Mary Kay is
sold Mary Kay makeup or like Avon
there's a representative usually anyone
can be representative and they have
parties at their houses where their
friends come and try out the product and
see if they want to order it through
them and then they you know they get
points through ordering whatever so I
went to one of her shake parties they
called it a shake party because this is
a shake and we got to try all the shakes
because I didn't want to spend my money
on something that I didn't think I
wasn't sure if I would like or not so I
found I found it and I loved it and when
we tried it so you can mix it with water
milk or orange juice those are the most
popular but you can mix it with any
other types of juices but basically you
just take two scoops there's a little
scooper in there and you scoop it into
anything and you blend it with ice so I
love that and I think it tastes so good
the flavor that it comes in a sweet
cream but they also send you a bunch of
different flavors like chocolate and
strawberry but you can also add many
different other flavors as well they
also say that you could add I've never
done this because I love the original
flavor so much I don't add any of the
other flavors because I love this one so
much but if your type of person that
gets bored with this flavor it doesn't
like this sliver you can add different
flavors but I've also been told the
instant pudding mix that you use the
little powder instant pudding through
like jello or something you can add to
this along with the two scoops and it
changes the flavor so you could do like
cookies and cream you could do
butterscotch you could do anything you
know and I've heard it tastes really
really good and it only has 90 calories
per two scoops so for two scoops it's
only 90 calories so for um those are you
interested in losing weight this is
really great what I got this war was
actually weight management so it's for
weight management and healthy nutrition
so it's a nutritional shake but you can
also use it for maintaining your weight
and also losing weight so I did it to
maintain my weight so what I did was I
replace breakfast with a shake and if
you're trying to lose weight you would
replace breakfast and lunch with a shake
and you would be surprised how filling
this actually is there's a ton of great
success stories on this I've heard so
many it's fairly new
I will lick link the body bye bye it's
called body bye bye if I didn't say that
already but I will link the website in
the box below so that'll give you a lot
more information and a lot more
nutritional facts and things like that
and I will be able to tell you because
all I know is what she told me at the
party so if you are interested in this
definitely go clicked click that link
below it has done wonders for a lot of
people so if you are under 18 I would
definitely ask your parents if you could
try this before you go ahead and order
it because obviously it's a little bit
um different than just a you know fun
shake its its meal replacement so I
would definitely talk to your parents
about this before you order this just a
disclaimer I'm not being sponsored by
body body by by at all they do not
contact me they do not send me this I
bought this strictly through a friend at
my work who I met on campus and this is
my third couch pour prices if you guys
are interested on one pouch is fifty
dollars and two pouches is 100 dollars
and this is my third pouch and I started
um at the end of April so I started
about right when I started making these
videos I started so and I'm only on my
third one
I was thinking about it and I was like
oh my gosh like at first $50 or like
$100 for two sounds like a lot of money
right off the bat but like if you think
about it you're replacing a meal so
think about how much um certain like if
you add up how much how many likes you
say if I replace this for breakfast like
if I were to eat Eggos or cereal
anything like that not only would I not
have to buy as much cereal and Eggo
waffles or say whatever I eat for
breakfast but now this also fills you up
quite a bit so you would save on all
those snack foods that you like to munch
on during the day so I definitely
thought this was worth the money it just
kind of was a replacement in my grocery
money I wouldn't say this is something
that you know is instead of eating your
vegetables eat this it's just kind of it
gives you as much nutrition nutrition as
that would but again I'm not really
authorized to um recommend any of this
or tell you any nutrition facts on any
of this so I would definitely recommend
you guys go check out the site if you
are interested in this definitely go
check out again it's called body bye bye
I will link it in the description box
below but that's what I started this
summer
again I'm not doing this to lose weight
I just did this to get more nutrition in
my diet and eating habit as for all my
other meals I definitely altered it a
little bit not a lot I would um I really
do enjoy salad so I just started to eat
those a little bit more um I would
definitely if instead of a cheeseburger
or something I would eat a grilled
chicken sandwich I love chicken so that
was an easy task um I definitely started
to drink a lot more water and you would
be surprised how much that changes um
not only do you have to go to the
bathroom a lot which is kind of a
setback because I started drinking a lot
of water I would fill up a big water
bottle and drink it throughout the day
and I would always have to like leave
class or out of the bathroom it was kind
of a hassle but water is so good for you
and it definitely changed the way you
eat too because they always say that if
you feel hungry sometimes you're just
dehydrated which you wouldn't think that
you are because you don't feel that you
are but most of the time you are so
drinking water is very actually very
good for you so I did start to drink a
lot of water that's what I do now um but
for as my everyday meals I just try to
stay away from the big snack you know no
nose and if you have any questions or
anything about my diet or fitness I'll
be happy to answer them I really really
hope this video was helpful it was very
very highly requested so I was gonna
make it but I do want to say that I
mentioned her in a couple of my actually
like one video before this but she's
actually is my friend here and she
started her own YouTube channel I'm I
met her in high school she's been my
friend since high school so uh her name
is Cory and again I've mentioned her in
another video but she is actually going
to school to she's going to college to
be a registered dietician so she knows a
lot more about food and fitness than I
do
so I know a lot of you guys want to know
what I do so I told you but now if you
are even more interested in knowing what
can help you she has your own YouTube
channel where she explains everything
that you can do she she's very very
helpful in the fact that she gives out
information about how to read nutrition
label she she does like this or that at
restaurants she's her videos are very
very helpful and I am lucky enough to
live with that every day so I am able to
ask her questions you know if we ever go
out to eat together and she'll kind of
help me and tell me which one is
healthier so if you are looking for a
drastic change or something like that
definitely go visit Cory's channel um

her passion she loves doing it so she'd
be happy to answer and your questions
