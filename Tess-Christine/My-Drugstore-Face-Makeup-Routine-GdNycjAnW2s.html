be a face makeup routine using drugstore
products you guys all know that for my
regular face makeup routine I do use
higher-end foundation products but a lot
of you guys were requesting me to do one
with drugstore products just because
it's a lot more affordable and a lot
easier to you know obtain and purchase
yourself these are the drugstore
products that I like to use on my face
if I weren't using high-end products so
this is what I found that I love right
now so I really hope you guys enjoy this
video again let me know if you have any
questions about anything that I used in
the comments below or any other
drugstore brands I'll be happy to let
you know anything that I know I've been
using drugstore foundations since
probably high school so and then I just
recently switched to higher-end products
when I was in college so I have had a
longer time using drugstore products so
if you have any questions about any
other types of brands or anything from
drugstore product drugstores let me know
in the comments below and I will answer
as many as I can so again I really hope
you enjoyed this video and I'll see you
guys next time bye guys to begin I am
using maybelline instant age rewind
eraser dark circles concealer the color
I am in is light and I'm just going to
be placing this underneath my eyes and
around my nose and then with my finger
my ring finger I'm going to just blend
that into my eyes and around my nose as
well
next i'm going to be taking l'oreal true
match foundation in the color warm beige
and i'm just going to be taking my
finger and placing little dots around my
face this will just make it easier to
blend later i really like this
foundation i found that there's a lot of
shades to match your actual true shade
which i really like because sometimes i
find it hard to find my exact shade in a
drugstore foundation just because you
can't test it so i really like this
brand a lot and with a flat top powder
brush from ELF i'm just going to buff
that into my face
next I'm taking Maybelline Dream matte
powder in the color medium beige and I'm
just going to lightly dust that on my
face to set my foundation and concealer
I don't want to overdo it because I
don't want to take my makeup on as a
highlight I'm using Maybelline Dream
bouncy blush in the color rose petal I
found that this color is light enough to
use as a highlight which i think is a
great dupe for any of the expensive
highlighters at higher end stores next
I'm taking an elf blush in the color
tickled pink and I'm just going to
lightly dab that on the apples of my
cheeks I really like this butt blush a
lot I think it's a great Duke for well
dressed by Mac which is my favorite math
blush lastly I am going to finish with
some yo s lip balm to moisturize my lips
and that is my completed drugstore
foundation routine I really really hope
you guys liked this video and I will
talk to you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
