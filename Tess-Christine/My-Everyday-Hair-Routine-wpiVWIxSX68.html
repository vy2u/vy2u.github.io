hair tutorial on my everyday hair
routine I have naturally curly hair so
in the morning I like to jump out of the
shower and scrunch my hair so I'm gonna
show you guys how I do it it's very easy
very simple and I think a lot of people
can achieve it that's why I wanted to
share with you all you really need is a
mousse at least that's what I use and
the mousse I'm using is the Garnier
Fructis volume inject mousse and this
moves I've been using for a couple
months now and before I didn't use use
to use a mousse I used to just use spray
gel and I spray that in my hair and
scrunch it but I find this works so much
better any type of mousse really works
well but this is the one I use it's a
very simple and quick hairstyle that I
like to do in the morning before class
so I really hope you guys can go out and
try it yourself another thing I want to
give a big shout out to all my
subscribers thank you guys so much for
subscribing it means the world to me I
remember just a couple weeks ago I only
had 10 subscribers and now I'm like
almost to 300 so it just means the world
to me that you guys are watching my
videos and liking them because I started
this and out of nowhere I did the Ellen
Blair contest and then I just decided
that I wanted to start videos and I
found that I absolutely love doing it I
love sharing with you guys my ideas on
hair and makeup and it just makes me
feel so good that people are actually
watching my videos so I want to thank
you guys so much I love you all and yeah
I'm gonna keep giving videos you too you
guys don't forget to request I have a
ton of videos in mind that I'm gonna be
doing so I'll eventually get to your
video I want to do every one so yeah I
guess that's it so let's get into the
tutorial all right so the first thing
I'm going to do is take mousse and I'm
gonna put a good portion of that in my
hand I'm going to start scrunching it on
that half of my head
then I'm gonna repeat the same thing on
the other side right and then I'm gonna
do the bottom to do this I like to flip
my hair over all right and then I'm
taking a blow dryer mine is just a con
air blow dryer I got it at Target and
I'm taking an attachment head that kind
of looks like a duck beak I guess and I
like to smooth down my bangs because
otherwise they will not stay like that
during the day next I'm taking a
diffuser you can get these anywhere Hair
Salons Target and I'm putting it on top
of my blow dryer then I'm gonna start
diffusing my hair I'm also gonna put it
on low and warm you don't want it on
high because it's just gonna make your
hair frizzy and this will just keep the
curls intact while drying your hair at
the same time and I'm just gonna keep
repeating this until it's dry next I'm
taking a Conair one-inch curling iron
I'm just going to kind of wrap random
pieces of hair around the barrel this
will just make sure my curls are even
throughout the entire part of my head
and I like to do this to smooth down any
curls that start to frizz or anything
like that and by wrapping it around the
barrel you get an escrow and it won't
ruin the curl that it's already there
that's why I like doing it there's no
really precise way of doing this in
which hair you pick up it's just
whatever one's kind of look straight or
flat as the ones I like to do
great and then finish with hairspray I'm
just using matrixes ba-boom hairspray
alright and the look is complete I
really hope you guys liked it thank you
guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
