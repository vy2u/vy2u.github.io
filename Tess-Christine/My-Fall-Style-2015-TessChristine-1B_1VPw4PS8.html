nothing life to see if it hurts and you
can't take no more lay it on me
someday when you leave
hi friends okay so today's video is
going to be a fall lookbook and I'm
really excited about this because you
guys know I love styling videos but look
books are ways my favorite because I
tried to treat them as if it was a line
like my own line of clothing and then
that was the clothing that was coming
out so it's very put together it's stuff
that I actually wear yes but it's not
just like a t-shirt and jeans which
everybody loves every now and again but
this is just like a fall inspiration
outfit video so I really hope you guys
get some fun ideas for your fall
wardrobe or fall outfits putting
together all that fun stuff so if you
are interested then just keep on
watching okay hi hello for this first
book I thought I would show you guys
something involving denim because denim
is a staple in my wardrobe as I'm sure
it is for a lot of people especially
during the fall time so I wanted to show
you guys one of my favorite jumpsuits
and it's a denim jumpsuit I purchased it
from ASOS I love it it's super comfy but
it's also trendy which you guys know I
love but comfort is key for me so how I
styled it was I belted it just to give
it a little bit more of a shape and also
to kind of take away from the fact that
it's kind of like a utility jumpsuit by
adding feminine pieces to it it really
kind of takes away from that and I just
love it
so I wore that brown belt from ASOS and
then over it if it was a little bit
chillier that day I wore a fuzzy coat
cardigan type of thing and that's from a
ritzy a' and then for my shoes i wore
some brown suede booties from zara i
purchased that in the beginning of fall
and i just wear them all the time
they're super comfortable and they go
with everything
this next outfit is probably one of my
favorites because it has kind of a boho
feel to it but it's also super comfy
which you guys know is my favorite and
it corporates a lot of pieces that I've
had for a while so I wanted to show you
guys that you can reuse a lot of the
stuff you already have you don't have to
go out and buy new things so starting
out with the dress you might think it's
skirt but it's actually a dress I wore
it in the summer it's from H&amp;amp;M
so I wanted to show you guys how you can
turn it into something for the Fall so I
just took this brandy melville grace
sweater and I put it over the dress and
then to prevent myself from looking like
I was had a bunch of fabric hanging off
of me I belted the sweater onto the
dress so it gave me some shape and made
it look very flowy and nice I love that
so I used the same belt from before and
that's from ASOS and then I wore the
same Zara booties from before they're
just awesome they go with everything and
they're so fall and then over I wear
some layered necklaces which I purchased
from Nasty Gal
and then it wouldn't be fall without
floppy hats so I have this one from Zara
that I love I just think the colors on
it are really pretty
this next look is super New York in the
sense that it involves a lot of black
clothing which I love it was super easy
to put together but it also looks pretty
trendy and it involves one of my
favorite fall trends which are Poncho's
or poncho tops my poncho top is from
revolve clothing it's a cropped one as
you can see here but I love the tassels
on it
I love the color-block coloring I think
it looks really good plus it gave me an
excuse to style it with one of my
favorite belts which is from below the
belt I love the detail on it I think
it's just really pretty I wore some
super old high-waisted black jeans from
ASOS I've had these forever and I just
love them they're super comfortable and
then for shoes I just wore some black
booties black booties are a huge staple
for me in the fall winter summer
whenever so mine are from Reagan bone um
definitely recommend them they're super
comfy this next outfit is definitely my
style in a nutshell it was by far the
first one that I was just like easily
put together I just did something that I
just always go to in my closet because
of one of my favorite things which are
over the knee boots
I just think no matter when I can find
an excuse to wear them fall winter
spring summer I will they're just super
easy they make your outfit look so good
and now they have these boots all over
the place so don't splurge like I did I
will link a few other over the knee
boots that I think are really awesome so
those I just absolutely love so how I
styled it was I wore this kind of floral
smock dress it has lace-up details on
the front it's a floral print but it has
fall colors and that's from ASOS and
then over it I wore one of my staple
pieces which is a leather jacket
this one's from Urban Outfitters it's a
little bit thicker than usual so it's
perfect if it's a little bit chillier I
can layer it with scarves beanies hats
whatever I want to so this outfit is
totally versatile and I just love it
okay so for this outfit I posted this on
Instagram actually for like an outfit of
the day and a lot of you guys are
commenting asking you to put it in a
video so here it is I love this one of
course it features over the knee boots
black ones I think are my favorite just
because they go with everything so how I
style this was I wore a romper rompers
are also my favorite not just for summer
but also for a fall in winter because if
they're darker colored you can wear them
with like tights or darker color things
or clear with jackets and scarves
they're just super easy mine is from
Nasty Gal then I wore a bomber jacket
I love bomber jackets they're kind of
all over the place right now mine's from
Topshop I love the color of it and then
I have a black bag from forever 21 and
then of course my go to club master
ray-bans
yes this one okay I'm super excited
about this because I wanted to show you
guys you can totally just rock a t-shirt
jeans and a big comfy sweater and still
look somewhat trendy so starting off
with my jeans I got mine from Paige
denim probably my favorite place to buy
jeans just because they're so
comfortable and they feel like leggings
they're awesome
then for shoes I wore the same Zara
booties from before because I thought
the color looked super good with it then
for my top I wore an express 111 tee
super comfortable fabric and it's just
like a big comfy t-shirt then for my
sweater I wore this big oversized yellow
sweater from American Apparel and then
for my scarf I got that from Urban
Outfitters I liked it because it wasn't
like a normal bandana scarf it had fall
colors in it this weird kind of floral
print but it matches a lot of my
clothing and then that's it
okay guys last look this one I've used
the clothing pieces to make multiple
different outfits I think it's so
versatile I love it
so starting off with a skirt I got a lot
of comments on various social media
sites where I got this thing and that's
from Nasty Gal it's like an olive suede
button-up skirt super cute goes with a
ton of different things for my bodysuit
that is from Windsor and then for my
really fluffy comfy jacket that is from
ASOS I love that one so much
the brown color goes with so many
different things and then for my boots
those are from Topshop they are this
like faux snakeskin print I think
they're really unique and different and
I worn them with black jeans they look
super good you can totally dress them up
or down I think they're awesome but that
is it I really hope you guys enjoyed
