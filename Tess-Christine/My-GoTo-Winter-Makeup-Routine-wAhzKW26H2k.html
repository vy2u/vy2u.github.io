makeup tutorial and I haven't sat down
and just filmed a regular makeup
tutorial in a really long time and
recently I've been getting a lot of
requests for it so that's exactly what
I'm gonna do for you guys today I
thought I would show you guys in my
go-to winter or holiday makeup look
because this is like the go-to look for
me pretty much for the past I don't know
three months and I've been wearing it
and a lot of my Instagram photos and a
lot of my intros to my videos and I get
a lot of questions about it so I figured
I'd show you guys in this video so I
really hope you guys find it helpful and
let's get started starting with a fresh
face of course the first thing I'm going
to do is apply a primer my favorite
right now is the Porefessional primer by
benefit and then for foundation my go-to
foundation is definitely the Make Up For
Ever HD foundation so I'm applying that
with a Beauty Blender all over my face
and moving on to concealer my all-time
favorite is definitely the it cosmetics
bye bye under-eye concealer I love this
stuff it definitely removes your dark
circles and it seriously works so great
I love it so much and I'm using a Beauty
Blender to blend that in as well to set
the cream makeup that I apply I'm using
the Make Up For Ever HD a translucent
powder and I'm just applying that all
over my face to set everything
moving on to contour blush and highlight
I'm using the pH cosmetics forever nude
sculpt and glow palette I love this so
much I especially use it when I'm
traveling it's just like the perfect
palette because it has everything in one
the bronzer as you can see it just
contour my face so amazingly and the
blush which I love I'm using the center
blush that's definitely my favorite out
of the palette it's like a Bobby pink
color it definitely gives you a more
natural look so it's not super bright
pink but it goes so well with the
bronzer now before I apply the
highlighter in that palette I'm just
gonna go ahead and use the josie maran
argan oil highlighter and place that on
my upper cheekbones this is just kind of
creates a base for the highlighter the
highlighter itself works awesome on its
own I just added the argan oil if I want
more of a bronzey glow
moving on to eyebrows I'm loving the
Anastasia brow Wiz brow pencil I love
this so much it definitely gives you a
more precise way to fill in your
eyebrows I switch off between this and
the brow pomade from Anastasia I love
them both
this one just gives me a little bit more
control and precision when filling them
in
moving on to eyelids I'm going to start
by priming my eyes with my favorite
eyeshadow primer by NARS and then after
I'm moving on to of course I shadow the
palettes that I've been loving recently
is this one by BH Cosmetics it's just
the dark rose eyes shadow and blush
palette before in the top corner are
definitely my favorite so I'm going to
start with this one which is just a
beige shimmer e color and I'm placing
that all over my lids this definitely
helps open up your eyes a lot when you
start with a lighter color then form a
crease color of course I'm just taking a
matte light brown color with a large
fluffy brush and I'm just placing that
into my crease as a transition color
because I'm going to be using this
gorgeous berry color it looks like I
just love it's like a Samadhi pink color
I'm very holiday I just love it I use it
all the time and I'm placing that on the
outer corner of my eyelids to kind of
brighten them and add a little bit of
color too Plus this eyeshadow is super
buildable so it's awesome so you can
control how much of that color you're
actually putting on I just think this
looks so gorgeous already I'm in love
with this look and then for my brow bone
I'm just taking that highlighter from
that last BH Cosmetics palette and
placing that on my inner corner and on
my brow bone for a highlight
instead of using a liner to line my eyes
I'm just picking up this olive color
from that palette and placing that
directly on my upper lash line I just
love that has some added color but the
darkness of it kind of looks like you're
lining your eyes it's perfect for a more
natural everyday look which I've been
doing all the time plus I just love how
the olive color brings out the brown in
my eyes I just think overall with the
green colors and the red colors it's a
very perfect holiday New Year's look I
just love it so much
so as you can see I place that on my
lower lash line as well and then I'm
just finishing off with some mascara
next for my lips one of my favorite lip
liners to use lately is the urban decay
24/7 glide-on lip pencil in the color
Naked 2 I like it because it's not super
dark it just kind of brings out your
natural lip color and I've been wearing
this in so many videos and Instagram
photos and you guys all asked me what it
is so this is definitely my favorite
but after that that is my go-to makeup
look I love this so much I definitely
think you guys should try it out it's so
easy to do yourself and I just think
it's so pretty and so festive for the
holidays but that's the video for today
I really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did be sure to give it a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments below what
video I should do next and I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
