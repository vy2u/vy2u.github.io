channel so today's video is going to be
a really fun one because it's kind of
like a challenge but I've been seeing
this video go all over the place on the
internet I feel like everyone's doing it
and it's called my Instagram followers
control my life for a day I'm sure you
guys are familiar with it but basically
what it is is you use poles on your
Instagram story and people vote on
things that they want to see wanna see
you do so if you want to be a part of
something like this make sure you are
following me on instagram because this
is it involves my Instagram followers so
yeah I really hope you guys enjoy it and
let's get started so I got out of the
shower a little bit ago and I did my
face makeup but I'm going to do a poll
asking what types of makeup should I do
as far as bold or more natural that
always plays up into my eyes so yeah I'm
really excited to ask you guys this I
really hope you vote natural because
believe it or not makeup is one of my
least favorite things to do
I enjoy makeup but I definitely don't
like to spend forever on my face doing
makeup so I really hope you guys vote
more natural it's a very clear winner
which is natural thank you guys so what
I've been loving to do recently I don't
even mess with eyeshadow I think I told
you guys in the beginning of the video
but honestly like my makeup I wanted to
take like 5 minutes in the morning and
that's it
so lately for my eyes have been using a
cream bronzer to put on my eyelids and
that sounds really weird but I basically
just use my finger like this this is the
fuzzy Beauty one get on my finger and
basically just tap it on my lids
definitely a little bit of color on my
legs and that's usually all I do
sometimes I'll add liner like I think I
might be winged eyeliner I'm just like a
little bit but for a natural date a look
this is literally all I do to my eyelids
anyone else hold their breath when they
do liquid liner now that makeup is done
let's check on the hair pull and but I
kind of did those at the same time
because that way I can kind of get ready
in the bathroom all at once okay 70% as
of 18 minutes ago say curl it 30% say
straight let's go ahead and curl it so
I've been trying to you know embrace the
natural texture that I have going on so
i'ma show you guys what I've been doing
for that first things first is I use a
wave spray I have so many favorite wave
sprays but right now I'm using the jisu
wave spray basically my hair is like
pretty damn right now like like a
mixture I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going
to spray this all over my head okay so
I'm gonna give that a second to sit in
my hair in the meantime I'm going to go
lay out some outfits for you guys to
vote on okay so I laid out these two
outfits for you guys to choose from I
really like both like I have no
preference so whatever you guys decide
is gonna be okay but I basically did
this like dress with a shirt underneath
and then just like a basic top with some
trousers both would be wearing the shoes
on the jacket so what I'm using is I'm
just using a curling wand a really tiny
barrel I don't know the exact size of
this barrel but it is the smallest one
in the new me kit which is this curler
so yeah I'm just gonna go ahead and curl
my hair
it's very messy but I really like it
sometimes I will put it up and like have
pieces out in the front or I'll just
like let it be like this and like flip
it over the day whatever over the day
but you guys get what I meant like flip
my hair around it like get flat um but I
really like it because it's one of those
things that I've it's humid or if I
start to slice or something gross that
happens when it's summer my hair just
kind of like goes to its natural curl
and it doesn't look as bad as it would
if it were like straightened or like
I've sectioned off on my hair and like
decided to curl it piece by piece
so yeah update on the outfit Pole I'm
letting it set up a little bit longer
than I should because it's literally
50/50 right now so I don't really know
what to do
I'm gonna let it sit up for a little bit
longer and then I'm just gonna have to
go with whatever one wins at the time
even if it's at like 1% more and just
have to go with that so I don't wait
around all day all right
this outfit was the winner I love it
super cute I decided to put my hair up
and have like the curly pieces down
because I thought it looked good and
showed off like the outfit really well
so now coffee time what did you guys
vote I love you you voted coffee shop
and I can't wait to take you there
because it's like the best almond milk
lattes ever so let's go
thank you
I'm back from getting coffee I picked up
some for this guy over here since he
will be joining us soon as once I I just
put up the next poll which is should we
shoot some photos which we usually do on
a daily basis should we shoot them in
Brooklyn or Manhattan so I'm curious to
see what you guys vote for I feel like
we do a good mix of both we do shoot a
lot in Brooklyn dude since we do live in
Brooklyn but I'm curious to see what you
guys end up voting for so the pricing
Lee Brooklyn is winning I don't know why
I thought you guys would vote the city
but it's winning it's like 52% so I'm
gonna take that as a win for Brooklyn it
actually just got sunny out I'm really
excited so Pat and I are gonna go
outside we're gonna shoot this outfit so
I got the photo done and I post it on
Instagram so you guys were like a part
of it because you literally picked my
outfit my entire look and where I shot
took the photo so yeah I just posted
that photo now it's like back to normal
everyday stuff like chores for one we
have all of these boxes down here that
we have to take downstairs to recycling
and like break them all apart it's a
really tedious and annoying job and we
have to do it because we leave literally
tomorrow so we just don't want a bunch
of stuff piling up so I thought it would
be really funny to have you guys vote us
to take down all the recycling myself or
Pat so I made a poll and so we will see
I see you Patrick voted test you little
brat
how do you feel that they voted for you
feel like I was taking advantage of
stupid situation I actually feel bad so
I think I'm gonna cheat and help you I'm
okay with that
thanks Bubba but the next poll I need
help with is because I'm packing and I
thought it would be fun to ask you guys
kind of what to pack but we leave
tomorrow we're going on a trip and how I
avoid over packing as I lay out all of
my outfits first so I'll show you so I'm
a few things out I have a swimsuit like
some outfit dresses mainly but then this
is what I'm gonna ask you guys I have
both of these white dresses which is a
problem in itself because why do I need
them they look exactly the same but I'm
gonna ask you guys which one I should
bring on my trip I'm definitely leaning
towards this one I'm pretty sure it's
number two on the Instagram story but I
just like this one a little bit more
because it's lightweight and the other
one is a little bit heavy so we will see
hopefully you guys pick you've been
picking all of my like leaning towards
all day so I believe in you spend about
20 minutes and number two is a very very
clear winner so I'm gonna go ahead and
pack dress number two now that package
is just about done I'm gonna be
productive even further and I'm going to
start editing this video together but
while I do that I'm gonna put up another
poll so almost dinnertime so I'm going
to ask you guys what I should get
delivered because I'm not making food I
want to deliver food I'm gonna ask you
guys if I should get sushi or a salad
there's this huge salad if I Chloe that
I love I eat them both way too much so I
don't even really know what I want or
what I'm in the mood for if I want sushi
or if I want that so I'm gonna let you
guys decide okay so I am all comfy cozy
on the couch and I am about to eat my
sushi which you guys voted for but I
thought the last poll would be what I
should watch I'm currently watching two
shows right now Parks and Rec and the
originals
and I put up a poll and I'm basically
I'm having you guys decide what I watch
tonight normally I'd probably have like
a sway one way or the other but honestly
I'm like totally down to watch both so
I'm curious to see what you guys say so
I'll be back in a little bit make
incisions
all right Tess you are in luck with
double-checking it and it was 50/50 for
a while but sharks and rec is winning
always by a little bit yes so we're
watching Parks and Rec although even
though you may be one in a minute maybe
you will you do like the originals
occasionally yeah but anyways I just
like this one some more
yeah Ron's on to something okay so we're
gonna watch Parks and Rec chill out I'm
gonna edit this video together make sure
I have all my stuff together for
tomorrow and then I'm done with today so
I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video I pretty much took you along to
almost most of it um but I thought this
was really fun to do and I felt like
super interactive on my Instagram and I
feel like it was I don't know it was
just really cool and different and I
really liked it so I hope you guys did
too if you did be sure to give it a
thumbs up and I will see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
