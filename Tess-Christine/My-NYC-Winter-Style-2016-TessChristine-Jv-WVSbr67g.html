lookbook you guys know this is my
favorite video to do I love look folks I
love styling videos um so I'm pretty
pumped I show you five outfits that I've
been loving that are probably my
favorites for the winter season and I
hope you guys get some fashion
inspiration from it however it's in a
freakishly warm winter as you probably
know and this is my first winter in New
York but I've been told it's usually a
lot colder and snowing by now but it's
not so therefore my outfits cater
towards that however you only have to
change a few things if you want it for
snow climate the shoes and the jacket
and you'll be good to go if it snows
which I will let you guys know on
Twitter and Instagram let me know in the
comments below that if it does would you
guys want like a winter lookbook for the
snow or like snow outfit ideas let me
know but anyways I hope you guys get
some fashion inspiration from this and
let's get started
okay so starting off with the first
outfit I love this one because it
incorporates all of my favorite winter
colors so anything neutral is kind of
like my staple in the winter it's the
first thing that I grabbed in the closet
in the morning it's kind of like me
being adventurous with color but not at
all because I kind of mix them so I
started off with a sweater from Free
People which I absolutely love I love
the style of it I think my favorite
thing to wear in the winter are sweaters
that have like big cowl necks or
turtlenecks because it's kind of like a
built-in scarf and then you can wear it
if it's extra cold so I love that
then I paired over a teddy bear coat
from Topshop which I've had for years
now but I love it because it's perfect
for layering especially when you're
wearing neutral colors then for my jeans
I just wore some black ones which are my
favorite those are from Paige denim just
super comfortable and then for my
booties I just wore some taupe colored
ones from Urban Outfitters if it was a
little bit colder I would have layered
socks the benefit was like extra cold I
would have wore more like sturdy boots
but a tip for you if you still want to
wear your trendy booties is to just
layer socks underneath them because it
still looks super cute
for outfit number two I love this one
because it involves a color now I
spotted this a full faded mauve pant
trend at American Eagle and they kept
being sold out of my size so I ended up
splurging and going for the page denim
ones which I actually really prefer
because they're actually corduroys which
never in my life did I think out by
quarter eyes again but they kind of have
a thicker material to them instead of
just like a legging Jean so I love that
and then I just paired that with the
same tan booties from Urban Outfitters
as before and then over it I wore a
white sweater from Topshop that I've had
for a few years now the best part about
winters you can hold onto your sweaters
and they create outfits over and over
again and then I wore this coat again
from Zara which I love because you can
layer it and it's not gonna look super
bulky so you can wear a shirt under the
sweater and then a shirt under the
jacket and you can just keep layering
and it's not gonna look crazy it's kind
of my tip for you if you still want to
be fashionable is layering is key and
then for my scarf I wore this huge
blanket scarf from Target which I love
because it keeps my face warm I can just
wrap it around me so many times and I
just love it
look number three definitely seems to be
a lot of your favorites on Instagram so
I love this one I think this one is
super fun it's definitely city chic and
that it's super trendy looking but it's
really not because all it is is a
sweater and jeans so starting off with
the jeans those are just the same black
ones black jeans are kind of like my
staple in the winter I always throw them
on and then over it I wore a sweater
from Urban Outfitters actually got this
in the sale for like 10-15 dollars I'm
pretty sure and then for my jacket I
just wear a grey one from All Saints I
bought this one last year and it's just
kind of been my staple it's just easy to
throw on
especially for those not as cold of days
but you can also layer it with scarves
and it ends up being super warm for my
shoes I just wore some black booties and
then I just touched off with a black hat
no pun intended
and that's from rag-and-bone
look number four I guess you could say
is like a casual look but it's more so
just bundled up it's for those days when
you just want to layer on a bunch of
stuff it's super cold and windy this is
what I would normally go for if it would
be snowing I would switch up the boots
but anyways that let's start out with
the jacket which is one of my favorites
I purchased this from Urban Outfitters
it's a Levi's jacket what I love about
it is the color it's a super neutral
color it's like an Olive taupe color but
it matches pretty much everything buying
neutral jackets is kind of like the way
to go
because you get the most use out of them
but this one's super warm so I just
paired that with a huge scarf from Zara
this one is a fun way to add some color
because it's like a maroon color plus
it's super bulky and then underneath it
I just wore a simple sweater from Zara
and then for my jeans jeans you know is
just a staple I have been favoring
obviously Paige denim in this video but
I really love it super comfortable for
my shoes I just wore some tan booties
and then of course I had to throw on a
beanie which mine is from American Eagle
I love this throwing on hats is just a
one and easy way to get rid of a bad
hair day but it also keeps you super
warm
and lastly look number five is kind of
dressed up casual and what I mean by
this is it looks super nice so you can
wear it to like a dinner or maybe just
like a casual event but it's also super
comfortable and I would wear this
honestly on a day-to-day basis so it
involves a sweater dress which I'm
surprised it's my only one featured in
this video because I absolutely love
sweater dresses this one I'm wearing is
a maroon short one from American Eagle I
absolutely love it I think sweater
dresses just go with everything
of course I paired it with some tights
and some over the knee boots mine are
from Stuart Weitzman but they make them
cheaper now so I will link them below I
should have waited and then lastly I
just wore a huge fluffy coat from
Orencia which I love because it kind of
matches everything because it's white
and fluffy if it was a little bit colder
I would have layered a scarf but other
than that that's pretty much it
well that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did be
sure to give it a thumbs up let me know
in the comments below which outfit was
your favorite and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
