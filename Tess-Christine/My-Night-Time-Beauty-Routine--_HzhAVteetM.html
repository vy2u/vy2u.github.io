nighttime routine I put my hair on top
of my head to make sure it is out of the
way now I start using simple cleansing
facial wipes to remove any makeup that's
on my face
I like these wipes because they are
alcohol and oil-free which is great
because my skin is more on the oily side
before moving onto my cleanser I move
the rest of my eye makeup with a Sonia
Kashuk eye makeup remover I use a cotton
ball to do so because I think it works
the best for me
I really like this stuff because it
isn't super oily and gets the job done
I switch my facial cleanser a while back
and a lot of you guys were asking what
I've been using so for about two months
now
I have been using the Michael Todd true
organics charcoal detox cleanser this
cleanser is for acne and combination
oily skin types the color is a bit
different but that's because of the
activated charcoal which apparently is
super absorbent substance that helps
unclog pores and remove impurities
moving on to toner I use the blue-green
algae toner from Michael Todd and this
stuff seriously smells amazing it has a
mix of different nutrients and organic
ingredients to eliminate all that gross
stuff that can damage your skin I always
used to skip this step but I've really
noticed a difference once I started
using a toner again plus the fact that
it's more organic makes me feel way
better about putting it on my face now
I'm using the K nu anti-aging skin
repair serum from Michael Todd which is
a bit of a luxury for my skin the
ingredients of this helps to repair and
heal the skin even though I'm only 22
years old slowing down wrinkles and
preventing future damage seems alright
to me now moving on to my eyes mine are
very sensitive so I like to use an eye
cream the one I use is a V nose
positively ageless lifting and firming
eye cream this helps brighten up the
skin around the eyes and reduces dark
circles for moisture eyes are I switch
off between the Aveeno positively
radiant daily moisturizer and the night
cream the night cream however is really
thick and heavy so most of the time I
like to use the daily moisturizer to
keep my skin from getting dry
for any blemishes I may have I use the
clean and clear advantage acne spot
treatment I just use a small amount on
each blemish or where I feel one coming
on this is a gel consistency and may
burn a bit when it's first applied but
it goes away within a few seconds to
keep my teeth pearly white I use the
crest 3d white toothpaste to brush my
teeth I've used this stuff for a really
long time and I think it works nicely
and it doesn't taste bad at all my lips
get super dry and chapped once it starts
to cool off and the snow starts falling
so I like to use a lip scrub but this
one is from lush and it has a minty
flavor so it's perfect after I brush my
teeth plus it's all natural and edible
so you can lick your lips afterwards
lastly I apply a chapstick to moisturize
my lips this one is a Burt's Bees ultra
conditioning lip balm and that's it for
my nighttime beauty routine before bed
I'll probably hang out with my roommates
make some sleepy time tea talk to you
guys and go to sleep I hope you all
found this helpful links to all the
products I use will be below thank you
all so much for watching and I will see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
