collection and this has been very highly
requested for a while now I just hadn't
got around to doing yet so I finally got
around to it and I'm going to show you
all the perfumes that I own because a
lot of you guys are interested in that
when I did my room tour so if you are
interested in seeing which perfumes I
own please keep on watching so I guess
I'll just start with some of the
perfumes that I've had for a while now
most of them are Victoria Secret
perfumes just because I really like the
smell of their perfumes and they're
really easy to get and they're not that
expensive so I guess I'll start with the
oldest one that I have from that and
that is the Victoria Secret body mist so
I guess it's not even really a perfume
but I consider it's a perfume because
this is kind of a strong scent if you've
ever smelt it before but it is called
sexy little things new are and you can
get this at Victoria's Secret I think
this is the bottle that you can get for
like $10 so it's really affordable and
it's lasted me for a while now it is a
really kind of strong scent I would say
but it's a very pretty Sun so I would
probably wear this at night if I go out
with my friends or go out to dinner or
something like that I wouldn't
necessarily wear this like daily just
cuz I think it's kind of a strong scent
for that I don't really know how to
describe sense so we'll see how this
video coats cuz I'm not very good at it
but this one I really really enjoy it's
probably one of my favorites from
Victoria's Secret so if you haven't
smelt this one you definitely should go
smell it this one is the dream angels
heavenly and it comes in this bottle
like this again I'm pretty sure that
this is another one of the $10 ones look
the sizes are pretty big for the amount
you pay or maybe this is like 20 now I'm
not sure but this scent is so pretty it
smells
I don't even know what these don't smell
like flowers to me so I don't want to
like say that they smell like flowers
and they're not musky like old people
smell if you know I'm saying they're not
like a musky perfume it just smells
really really fresh and I absolutely
love this one a lot it's very different
as to this one because like I said this
one is more of a nighttime one and then
this one I would wear more during the
day the next Victoria Secret one that I
got next was the supermodel perfume and
I actually got this as a gift from one
of my friends for Christmas a while back
but this one smells really good too
they're all they all obviously smell
good cuz they're obviously in my
collection for a reason I went to pot
something that doesn't smell good so my
description saying that it smells good
is pretty obvious but this one again I
would probably wear at night more so
than during the day the next picture a
secret one that I have are sexy little
things vixen and I just think this
bottle is so cute look at how cute this
bottle is I don't don't have one that
has like one of these squeeze pumps and
so I was super excited about that
however I found that this doesn't really
work very well I don't know if it's just
the bottle but it takes a little bit to
like it smells kind of similar to the
supermodel one to me
I don't know why it just kind of does I
think I got this one in the semi-annual
sale for like five or five or ten
dollars like seriously it was so cheap
this is their new one it's called
Victoria's Secret Angel their angel one
yeah because it's got angel wings on it
mmm it smells so good I love it
the next one that I've had for quite a
while now is the Marc Jacobs Daisy
perfume and this has been my favorite
perfume for a long time now this is
probably my favorite summer scent I wore
this seriously every day in the summer
well not every day obviously I feel like
it would be a little bit more gone than
that but in the summer I wore this
almost all the time if you haven't smelt
this I know a lot of people love this
scent so if you haven't gone stuff gone
and smelled it go to Sephora or Ulta or
wherever has this near you and smell it
because seriously seriously it's so
oh my gosh it smells like daisies and
flowers and I think was my friend um
told me once and I got in her car and I
just sprayed this on myself and she's
like you just smell like you ran through
a garden of flowers this was probably
one of the prefers perfumes I've ever
gotten it is the DKNY be Delicious and
it's the green one and I wouldn't
necessarily say this is my favorite and
I don't usually wear this very often I
would probably pick any other one to
wear them this one it's not that I don't
like this said because the scent is very
pretty and it's smells really fresh and
Apple II the next perfume that you guys
all seem to comment on in my room tour
is this little guy I mean you guys all
we're like oh my gosh it suggested
beaver for you okay obviously I don't
know if you said it like that because
they were comments but I just kind of
laughed a little bit cuz all you
believers out there um picked up on this
really fast but yes I do like Justin
Bieber for those of you guys are
wondering I'm not like a die-hard fan or
anything but I do think his music is
super catchy and I wanted to go smell
his perfume at Macy's when it came out
so I was there with one of my friends
and we went to go smell it and I
absolutely loved the smell of it so I
didn't even care and I was like I want
this so I wore this a lot in the summer
when I did buy it it's a really really
good smell so if you haven't if you were
steered away from the Justin Bieber
perfume for any reason I definitely go
smell it because it's a really really
good scent it smells super fresh and
it's a really age-friendly scent I just
along with Daisy I just think these both
are really good um summer perfumes and
then the last one you guys thought in my
Ulta haul and that was the Taylor Swift
perfume which this perfume I've been
wearing every single day I absolutely
love it I think it's just a really
pretty Winterset scent it's very fresh
and very but still a little strong to
where you smell I don't even know how to
describe sense but um I guess this is
just a perfume collection not really a
description of how they smell so yes
this is the wonderstruck Taylor Swift
perfume I absolutely love this again
I've been wearing this like every day
and I just recently got it so I would
definitely recommend this perfume and
you going out smelling
because it smells freakin delicious and
then I don't even know I didn't even
think I was gonna like throw these in
here but I thought I might as well I
have like a ton of these sample ones
that you get like either in magazines or
I don't even know where you would get
these I want to tell you which ones that
I think I'm gonna buy because the
Victoria's Secret bombshell one smells
really good I have like actually like
four samples of these because they were
just giving them out like crazy in their
magazines so I have three of these and
these smell really good but I keep these
because I mean they work they're their
perfume and I don't obviously I don't go
through these all fast enough so this
size is actually like perfect when I'm
just trying it out because I can get
like three or four uses out of each of
them so well even probably more than
that it is the David Beckham women
perfume and I've used literally all of
it there's just like a little bit left
and it is called Cody C oty it smells
amazing and I haven't even seen the real
bottle of this like the actual bottle
but I really like it a lot and it's made
by David Beckham so that's really cool
cuz he is sexy I don't know if you guys
saw the H&amp;amp;M commercial at the Super Bowl
but but those are all the perfumes that
I own and I know I mentioned in a couple
of my videos back or a few of my videos
back that I was gonna do a perfume video
with my brother and maybe one of his
friends where they smell all the
perfumes and rate them I just think it
would be really fun to get that take on
it for all of you guys who are watching
and want to know kind of like what guys
or what some guys like in a scent so if
again in that video I explained that as
Bethany's video but I have some a lot of
different perfumes and she showed the
guys that she was with so I thought it'd
be kind of fun to do like a sequel to it
so again please let me know if you're
interested in that I got a lot of good
feedback for that on my video when I
mentioned it so I'll probably do that
this coming weekend when I go home I
really hope you liked this perfume
collection video I have a lot of
perfumes that I think you guys should
all go check out if you don't have them
already because I think you'd really
enjoy them let me know what you think in
the comments below or any other
questions about my perfumes and I will
see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
