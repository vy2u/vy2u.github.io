is going to be an updated skincare
routine and if you've been following my
channel for a while now you know that
back in the summer I did make a skincare
routine video for you guys but I've been
guiding getting a lot of requests
recently for a new one because some
things have changed and I know I've
gotten new followers and subscribers and
stuff who haven't seen that video so I
wanted to make a new one for you guys
and the people who have been following
me for a while don't worry some things
are different so you'll still benefit
from watching this video so to start out
I'm gonna give you kind of like a little
brief history of my skin just because I
think that's really important to know
about my skin prior to using the
products that I use and after and all
that kind of stuff I think that's really
important in kind of picking your
skincare to kind of compare it to the
skin that I have so in middle school and
high school I never suffered from well
actually my whole life I've never
suffered from really acne prone skin at
all I don't have acne prone skin I've
never suffered from acne or anything in
middle school high school I did suffer
from breakouts that I wanted to get
something to help clear up my skin so
that's why I chose to start with the
skincare routine even though I didn't
have acne prone skin I still wanted
something to kind of help my skin out so
my skin in general I would say is a
combination oily skin I do have very
oily skin not super oily but I do have
oily skin I never get really dry skin so
yeah that is my skin in general now to
start out with what I use that I have
been using since seventh grade and I
swear by this product and it hasn't
changed since my last video and I
absolutely love it now before I even say
anything about it I know that I'm gonna
get a lot of comments because this
product certainly does have mixed
reviews and that is because everyone's
skin is different so by me saying that I
use this product and it works for me it
may not necessarily work for you but I'm
just telling you guys what I use and
maybe if you haven't tried it you can go
try it and see if it works for you
because it has worked wonders on my skin
and I absolutely love it and that is the
insert commercial celebrity now Proactiv
I always find this funny when I talk
about these in videos because it's just
so commercialized nowadays that I just
feel like one big commercial when I'm
talking about this but trust me I'm not
I just have been using this seventh
grade and you guys don't already know I
am a junior in college now so that is
quite a while that I've been using this
I use the 3-step system but technically
I only use the two I use different
lotions I don't use the third step I
don't know why I just don't really like
the lotion all that much so I use the
two the first one the renewing cleanser
and the toner I guess to start off with
when I did start using it my skin did
seem like it was getting worse like when
I first started it it felt like my skin
was breaking out more so immediately I
was like oh this doesn't work I don't
like it but I kept using it because I
was told by some people that when you
start a new skincare routine that's a
little bit stronger or different your
skin will break out a little bit more at
first and then it'll clear up afterwards
so I kept using it I stuck with that and
like I said I did break out a little bit
more after I started using this and then
afterwards it completely cleared up my
skin and so if you're the type of person
that tried it and then quit after it got
your skin bad or something like that
just keep on using it for a little bit
longer I would say probably after a
month this really drastically changed my
skin so for that month period when I
first started using it I did not really
like it because I thought it was
breaking me out more so I mean it's up
to you on whether or not you want to
sacrifice that month where you just have
kind of a lot of breakouts but after
that it has worked great for me like I
said I used this one this one and then I
used different lotions but how I apply
this on my face at night I use this only
at night because my skin is a little bit
sensitive and the fact that if I were to
use this at night and in the morning it
would not it would make my skin dry out
a lot and I would not like it it would
just be bad so I only use this at night
when I am washing my face obviously but
yes I used to use this just with my
hands I would squeeze a little bit on my
hands and basically just wash my face
with my hands but recently probably I
want to say like three ish months ago I
decided to get the Clarisonic and now I
hadn't tried this for a really long time
just because it was a really expensive
product and I just
sure and this was working fine for me
but I kind of wanted to try something
different to even deeper clean my skin
instead of just using my fingers just
because I felt like it was effective to
the fact that it was keeping my skin
clear every now and then I would get a
few breakouts but it was far it was
working fine for me until I heard so
many great reviews on this so I really
wanted to try this and it is the
Clarisonic Mia and I got the purple one
I got this at Ulta and I believe it was
120 dollars so like I said it is a
pretty expensive product but I have
found that I absolutely loved this thing
and I know everyone raves about it on
here but seriously I think that if you
are a person who has a lot of skin
problems and just nothing's working
nothing no face washer whatever I would
definitely save your money and get this
because this just seriously deep cleans
your skin so well and before I would
notice when I would use this I would
just squeeze it on my hand wash my face
and then use the toner with a cotton
ball and I would use the toner put eyes
on the cotton ball and wash my ear well
put it all over my face and the cotton
ball was always just a little bit dirty
and had makeup on it or something like
that so I always kind of realized that
my skin wasn't getting very clean then
when I started using this it completely
changed it so now I get all my makeup
off I could really deep clean inside my
pores which is what you want and all I
do is squeeze a little bit of Proactiv
onto the head and I just basically work
it from my forehead down to my chin
around my cheeks all that kind of stuff
and then as for lotions like I said I do
have oily skin so I try not to use very
heavy moisturizers at night because I
just don't like how that does to my skin
I just don't like it but if I were to
use some sort of lotion because I do
want to get to keep my skin moisturized
so if I do use something it is the the
Aveeno positively aged ageless
reconstruction treatment night treatment
night treatment cream but I can't talk
today but it looks like this and I got
this at Target I believe I can't
remember the price on it because it's
lasted me seriously
forever but I really like this stuff a
lot I use this before bed now if I want
to kind of give my skin a natural glow I
will use the Sancho Pez gradual tan
everyday moisturizer for face in light
medium and I really really like this
stuff a lot the only thing that I don't
like about this stuff is the scent it's
very perfumed very perfumed I will I
don't like the scent at all but I think
it really works and it's the only
self-tanning lotion or moisturizer that
I feel comfortable putting on my face is
because it doesn't break me out and
that's what I really like I used to use
the Jergens and I found that that was
just a little bit too oily for my skin
now as for on-the-spot acne treatments I
would normally use the Proactiv refining
mask and I use that on very kind of deep
blemishes those ones are the ones that I
really need treatment for but I don't
even have that to show you because ever
since I started using this I don't get
those anymore so the only thing I have
to worry about is occasional just like
small breakouts and for that I have
found my absolute love if you guys have
not tried this you should because it is
seriously amazing and it works overnight
so fast for me I can't even explain to
you and it is the Clinique act acne
solution clearing noise riser hydrate
hydrate gent pure fend but that's a lot
of words I'll have it in the description
box but it looks like this I got this at
Sephora and you only need the smallest
amount and you just put it on the
blemish that you have and seriously
overnight it's gone like it just works
so well for me and I can't even express
to you guys uh how much I love this
stuff I would definitely recommend it
out of all these products this for
on-the-spot acne treatment is amazing so
then as you guys know like I told you
with this I don't use this twice a day
now in the morning I do like to watch my
face every now and then I don't usually
wash my face all that much just because
I just usually wash it at night but if
I'm I'm the shower in the morning or
something like that I won't use this I
will use something like this which is
not as strong as my proactive and I like
using the clean and clear products I
really like the clean and clear this one
is the morning burst it's like pretty
much gone I love the morning burst
cleansers because like I said I use a
different moisturizer in the morning so
I like to use the more
ones this one is the skin brightening
facial scrub I really like this stuff a
lot it smells good it doesn't dry out my
skin and it's just that is it for my
skincare routine I hope this wasn't a
whole bunch of information just loaded
on for you guys I don't use a ton of
products on my skin but those are
everything that I use on a daily basis
so you guys are all wondering and I was
happy to share it with you I really
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
and kind of got some new tips or new
products you kind of have an idea on
what you want to try you guys also all
