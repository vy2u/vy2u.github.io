going to be all about my skincare and I
had a lot of you guys commenting asking
me hey what do you use for your skincare
and all that sort of thing I'm just
going to show you guys what I used to
take care of my skin and I really hope
you guys find this helpful I know that
people's Skynyrd is different and it
doesn't work for everyone so I do still
hope you guys found this video helpful
this is gonna be kind of simple because
it's just kind of one thing that I use
and it is Proactiv whoa and it is
proactive and I've been using Proactiv
since I've been in probably seventh
grade I've been using it for so long and
I mean I'm us going to be a junior in
college now and I still use it and I've
been using it since I've been in seventh
grade and I've tried it out then and
it's worked for me ever since for those
of you guys who aren't familiar I'm sure
all of you are it's a three-step process
one is a cleanser one is a toner and
then one is lotion and use it all at
once and some people use it twice a day
once in the morning and once at night I
find that a little too harsh for my skin
so I just use it at night I do have a
cleanser that I used to take all my
makeup off and then I use this then this
and then this so it goes one two three
kind of simple so then in the morning I
use the oil-free acne wash pink
grapefruit foaming scrub by Neutrogena
and I love the stuff because it smells
awesome
and it doesn't break me out I I'm not
the type of person who has very
sensitive skin or a type of person who
has very acne prone skin so I don't need
to be like too concerned with what I use
but so I kind of just try out anything
for a morning cleanser I've used the
clean and clear morning burst I love
that and I use this right now and I
absolutely love it because it smells
really really good for on-the-spot acne
treatment Proactiv has one it's called
the refining mask and if you see them in
commercials all you mean is a little dot
and you put it there and it's gone but
no it doesn't it doesn't work as well as
the commercial says at least for me it
takes a few days with this for it to
actually be completely gone but
otherwise what I used to use before I
got this was I used to use the clear
sole stay clear
Shing acne treatment cream um and this
works very well this one tends to work
better when you have a for me at least
this tends to work better for me when I
have a very deep pimple and this one
works for like on the spot right when
it's there and it's already there you
know what I mean and then this one take
that this one you know you can feel one
forming I use this and this one works a
lot a lot better and then I love this
one still though so if you guys haven't
tried the clear so stay clear one I
definitely would check this out because
I have been using this my brother I
think to use this this still my brother
uses Proactiv - but we both used to use
this before we got the refining mask and
this works just as well I find for
on-the-spot acne treatment and then for
lotions and that sort of thing at night
I use what at night I just used that the
three the lotion or whatever at night
but then in the morning I use a novena
lotion it's a vino face lotion it's just
the basics of you know face lotion if I
need it I don't have very dry skin in
fact I do have oily skin so I tend to
not I don't want to over moisturize my
skin so I tend to kind of stay away from
very heavy moisturizers because I do
already have very oily skin if you guys
haven't tried Proactiv I would
definitely give it a shot I know some
people have tried it and said it hasn't
worked for them I have a friend who
tried it and it didn't work for her it
doesn't work for everyone but if you
haven't tried it and you do have acne or
sudden breakouts or something like that
I would definitely try it I feel like I
sound like the commercial which is not
what I'm going for I'm not being
sponsored by Proactiv at all I've been
weren't using this in seventh grade like
I said before and it works for me but I
mean since it did work for me I would
suggest you guys to try it if you
haven't tried it already but um yeah if
it hasn't worked for you I'm sorry I I
still hope this video was helpful you
should definitely go try these because
this one smells really good and I
believe it's for I don't know if it's
for sensitive skin but it was a voted
Allure magazine's readers choice award
for 2009 so I mean I think a lot of
people liked it that definitely try this
or this if you've tried Proactiv and
doesn't work for you I love these two
and if you haven't tried Proactiv go try
it and
hopefully it'll work for you and yeah
that is it for my skincare it's just
plain and simple that's it so I still
hope you guys found this video helpful
and that sort of thing and I hope you
guys enjoyed it and as always until my
next video see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
