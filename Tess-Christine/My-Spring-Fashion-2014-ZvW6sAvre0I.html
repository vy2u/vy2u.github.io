be a spring fashion video and before you
say something I know I'm late in the
game but I live in Minnesota and it
finally just got nice out so it is still
spring for me but you guys know how
these videos work I just show you some
outfits that I've been loving wearing
during the spring season this year and
hopefully you guys can draw some fashion
inspiration from it so if you are
interested then just keep on watching
okay so for this first outfit I
absolutely love this one the top that
I'm wearing is from ASOS it's just a
basic crop top but I love the Sun and
the moons on it I just think it's so
cute and it's totally my style for my
skirt that is from Zara
I love the white color of it it's
perfect for spring in the summer but
then the cut of it is super unique I
didn't have anything like it and I just
think it's really fun to style my jean
jacket that's from American Eagle my bag
that's from Rebecca Minkoff and then of
course my shoes those are from Nordstrom
moving on to the next outfit this one is
so me I love leather so I'm always going
to wear it so for my top that is from
ASOS I absolutely love the pineapples on
it they're so cute and then my
high-waisted shorts those are from Zara
and then my leather jacket is from karma
actually but it's just a basic leather
jacket my awesome shoes that I've been
wearing all spring are from Nasty Gal
and yeah that's it now onto the third
outfit this dress is seriously my
favorite thing ever I just recently
purchased it at Topshop it is so
incredibly comfortable it's like a
jersey material but I could seriously
wear it all day doesn't even feel like a
tight dress it's awesome this really
really cool necklace that I just
recently purchased from Urban Outfitters
is really crazy but I thought it was so
unique and fun and it's one of my
favorite things to do with the spring
this pair like crazy fun necklaces with
kind of toned down items and I just
think it's so fun to style and then my
shoes those are from TJ Maxx and my bag
is from Nasty Gal
moving on to this next outfit this one
is definitely one of my favorites
because it has one of my favorite prints
ever which is floral it's one of my
favorite things to wear during the
spring and this kimono has it all it has
a floral has a bunch of colors it's
perfect but like I said this is a kimono
and kimonos are a huge trend for the
spring season but I actually really
really love them I have a ton of them
and I think they're so fun that this one
is from Zara and I'm absolutely in love
with it the top that I'm wearing
underneath it is just a basic white crop
top and that's from Topshop my jean
shorts are just the same as before
they're just basic high-waisted jeans
shorts and those are from Zara
as far as my shoes go I love wearing
just like sneaker shoes in the
springtime so these vans are like my
go-to they match pretty much everything
and then of course I have to throw on my
ray-ban club master sunglasses because
I'm in love with them
this next outfit is super fun and
different totally out of the box for me
but I'm absolutely loving this trend
that kind of is popping up during the
springtime and it's the whole t-shirt
Jersey dress I've always been a fan of
super comfy wear and this definitely
fulfills that because it's a t-shirt and
it's a dress so it's just like a bonus
outfit the dress that I'm wearing is
from pepper Mayo it's an Australian
online store that I absolutely love so
that's where the dress is from and it's
also where the shoes are from which I
think are really really fun I decided to
pair it with this kind of backpack style
purse from ASOS which I just think it
gave the overall look a little bit of a
different vibe but overall I just really
really liked this look and I'm
definitely going to be looking for more
t-shirt dresses as the spring and summer
continues
alright guys this is the last look and
this one is just super effortless and
very comfortable it's just something you
could wear pretty much all day every day
the overalls and I'm wearing are from
PacSun and I'm loving the fact that
overalls are kind of a trend again and
they're popping up more in stores
because I just think they're so cute and
comfortable to wear and really unique to
style as well the crop top that I'm
wearing is from Topshop and then the
shoes are the same as before and those
are from Nasty Gal
but that is it for the video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it be sure
