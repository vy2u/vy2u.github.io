fashion video yeah and if you guys have
been following me for a while this
background will have looked very
familiar to you and that's because I'm
back at my parents house right now for a
little bit until my new Lee starts from
my new apartment and then I can move in
in June but anyways yes today is going
to be a fashion video and I know you
guys love these fashion videos and the
reason why I don't do them as often as I
do tutorials and other things is because
they are very very time consuming so I
need like a whole day to do them and so
well not exactly a whole day but like if
I was to like sit down and edit it after
that I would need like seriously an
entire day because it takes so long for
me to film these and that's why I don't
do them as often but thank you guys for
being patient for me I love doing them
it's not like I don't like doing them I
love doing them it's just it takes a
while for me to actually like pick out
the outfits and that kind of stuff so
yes um basically all I did was put
together some outfits that I liked
wearing during the summer season I guess
I would consider this a summer fashion
video because it's already getting
pretty warm where I live so all this
stuff is very like heat friendly if you
are interested in watching that please
keep on watching let me know if you
think in the comments below please
always let me know which outfit is your
favorite because I like getting feedback
like that so yeah thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video bye everyone this first dress
is a little bit more on the fancier side
so I wouldn't wear this on like a day to
day occasion but anything fancy you have
to go to throughout the summer this is
perfect for like a summer wedding or
something like that and it is from
Windsor store calm the shoes are from
Charlotte Russe and this really cool
kind of like shark tooth necklace is
from H&amp;amp;M and then I also belted it with
a belt from new look
running over my lines again this next
outfit is something I would definitely
wear on more of a day to day occasion
the shirt that I'm wearing is a blouse
from forever 21 and I absolutely fell in
love with the lace short trend so I
found these really awesome lay shorts
from TJ Maxx for only about 15 bucks the
bracelets that I'm wearing are from H&amp;amp;M
and Francesca's and the shoes I'm
wearing are from TJ Maxx again this next
dress is a little bit more casual than
the first one so I like wearing this I'm
more of a dude day-to-day occasion as
well I produced this very recently at
t.j.maxx I really really love the
one-shoulder kind of roughly look to it
and then the wedges that I'm wearing are
from PacSun and then the bracelets are
from H&amp;amp;M I just think it's a really
really comfortable dress and it's
perfect for those really hot summer days
now this next outfit is definitely more
on the casual side something I would
wear on a day to day basis but I still
think it's really fun because of this
bright colored kind of reddish orange
blouse from Windsor and then the really
fun necklace that I paired from hmmm and
then the shorts that I'm wearing are
from Urban Outfitters and then the
sandals are from chez max so if you
couldn't tell I'm loving dresses for the
summer season because I just think
they're super easy to wear and they keep
you cool during this hot summer months
which is why I love them this one I'm
wearing is from Windsor I absolutely
love it I think the pattern is really
fun it has some bright colors in it
they also love the mesh detailing on the
shoulders and on the back and there's
the high-low skirt which i think is
really fun I love that trend right now
and then the shoes that I'm wearing are
just basic black flats from Target
during the summer this outfit is
probably one of the outfits you'll be
most likely to see me in if you see me
on the street it's just really easy and
simple and fun to put together
the blouse that I'm wearing is kind of
like a snakeskin blouse from hmm and the
shorts are from Target the bracelets
that I'm wearing are from Francesca's
and then I just decided to pair it with
some old navy flip-flops
this next outfit is kind of casual and
different but I still think it looks
really cute it's like one of those
outfits that's super easy to put
together basically all I'm wearing is
the shorts and the top are both from
Windsor and they're just really really
flowy and fun as you can tell the shirt
has a really cool design in the back and
then I also paired it with a necklace
that I purchased at Windsor as well and
it kind of gives that fun peter pan
collar that we all love this season and
then i'm also wearing these wedges from
PacSun probably the most comfortable
wedges that I own this next up it is
another super casual one but it's one
you would actually find me in most out
of all of these and the tank top I'm
wearing is from American Eagle the
converse are just converse and then the
shorts are from forever 21
this last outfit is super colorful which
I love the skirt is from Windsor and I
think it's really cool ace detailing and
then this mint blouse is from H&amp;amp;M which
is super popular right now because of
the mint color I love the skirt because
you guys know I love the hi-low trend
right now and then the bracelets are
from H&amp;amp;M and Target and then the shoes
that I'm wearing are the same wedges
from PacSun which you guys all know by
now are my favorite so yeah that is it
for this fashion video I really hope you
guys liked it and I'll see you guys next
