another summer fashion video if you
haven't seen my first summer fashion
video I will have that linked in the
description box below I put together
about seven outfits I really hope you
guys like them and thank you all so much
for watching okay so for this first
outfit I'm wearing this kind of flowy
chiffon pink shirt from TJ Maxx and then
the shorts that I'm wearing are just
plain white shorts from American Eagle
and then the really awesome shoes that
I'm wearing are from Steve Madden I
think the spikes are really really cool
on it it kind of adds like a edgy vibe
to the outfit but yeah it's just really
casual and comfy
because next outfit is one of my
favorites just because of how like
unique and colorful it is I just really
like it this kimono style kind of
chiffon shirt that I'm wearing is from
Nasty Gal calm I think it's just really
fun and bright colored and the shoes are
also from there as well I think these
are really cute booties and then the
shorts that I'm wearing are from Urban
Outfitters and the tank top is just a
white tank top from Express so this next
outfit I decided to jump on the cutouts
and studded collar trend by buying the
shirt from Nasty Gal comm I love that
store lately seriously I'm addicted and
I went a little online shopping crazy
but I really love this shirt it's super
colorful and really really unique which
is what I like about it the shoes that
I'm wearing are from Target and then the
shorts are the same shorts as before
from Urban Outfitters this next whole
outfit is from Urban Outfitters except
for the shoes those are the same booties
from Nasty Gal calm but I thought this
outfit was really cool I really liked
these high-waisted shorts they are like
the most comfortable shorts ever they
are super super comfortable they feel
like sweatpants obviously but in shorts
and the shirt is really unique - it's
kind of like paint splattered I don't
know I just really like this outfit it's
kind of different from like my normal
style but it's super casual and really
really comfy still
I obviously so far in this fashion video
have been loving the high-waisted trend
so I love pairing it with different
things with this look I decided to pair
it with this kind of chiffon flowy shirt
from Urban Outfitters and then these
really cool studded shorts from Toby
comm which I thought were really really
cute this next outfit is one of my
favorites because it's the first color
in my wardrobe of this like orange e
peachy color that I own so I'm obsessed
with it and I got this off of Nasty Gal
calm again I know I spent way too much
money there but I just thought it was
really cool the beading on it and the
style of the jumper is just so cute and
unique and I have nothing like it I
decided to pair with these wedges from
PacSun but I've also worn it with just
like plain flip-flops to it looks just
as q-see I really like this I belted it
with a belt from forever 21
this next outfit is definitely on the
casual side but you can definitely dress
the shirt up but since I'm doing more of
a day-to-day fashion video I just
decided to keep it the way I would wear
it on the day to day basis but this
shirt is from Toby comm and seriously
how cute is it it's kind of like paint
splattered and has those really cool
stud detailing I just think it's really
really cool and then the shorts are from
Urban Outfitters but yeah that's it for
this fashion video I really hope you
guys liked it and I will see you guys
