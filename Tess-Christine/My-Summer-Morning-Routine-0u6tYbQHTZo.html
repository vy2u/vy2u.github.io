summer morning routine when I'm trying
to be productive so I really hope you
guys enjoy it and let's get started so I
usually get up around 8:30 it's just
easier to get my day moving that way and
I check social media and bed like most
people do and then after that I get up
and I begin my day no I usually make my
bed first and you're probably thinking
that does not look like your bed and
that's because it's not I moved in with
Patrick for the summer until I can find
a place my own and yeah that's why I
have a surfer themed room and I also
moved in with his two roommates so I'm
feeling a lot like Jess from new girl
I'm just saying so anyways I go into the
bathroom and I begin washing my face now
this hasn't changed from my last morning
routine that I did a long time ago
because this has always worked for me so
I just wash my face with clean and clear
morning burst skin brightening facial
scrub I love this stuff it's helped a
lot with my acne scars but I am breaking
out right now because it's that time of
the month but it really does work I like
it a lot and I've used it for years
No
so after I finished washing my face I
just like to spritz a little rose water
on my face it just feels really good and
I do this in the morning instead of
using a toner and now it's time to brush
my teeth so I'm grabbing my too fresh
and I'm using a 3d or crest 3d white
toothpaste I've used this stuff for a
long time I like it I think it makes my
teeth really white so that's that now I
go to the gym so I get my workout
clothes out and I'm putting on deodorant
cuz you don't know at all and then I'm
just putting on some Vaseline cocoa
butter just to moisturize my lips
because it feels nice
or the gym all I bring is my phone for
music some hand sanitizer for afterwards
and some headphones so this is what my
gym looks like it's just a regular
ordinary gym but in the summer I'm
actually pretty lazy so I only go about
three times a week now you guys probably
could guess but it's shower time so now
I'm just turning on my shower and I'm
getting in and if you want to know
exactly what I use to wash my hair and
all that jazz I made a what saved my
hair haircare video a little bit ago and
that's on my channel if you're
interested so now all I'm doing is just
drying off my body like everybody else
does and then I'm just putting on my
robe from Victoria Secret as super soapy
and comfortable and I really like it but
now after my hair is kind of dry a
little bit I'm going to get combing it
out with a wide tooth comb I just think
this is the most gentle on my hair so
that's what I like to use it now all I'm
doing is just using a leave-in
conditioner treatment and then after
that I'm going to use a hair oil I'm
just just treat my split ends and dry
hair now I'm just grabbing some comfy
clothes to put on I don't really get
dressed right away because I most likely
film so I just put on some basic comfy
clothes and go into the living room and
there's Patrick yay but basically I'm
doing is making my coffee I just use a
coconut creamer because you guys know I
don't drink that much dairy and then now
I'm just making some hazelnut coffee and
yeah it's like everyday for me like I
don't go a day without coffee
I just wouldn't survive
for breakfast I like to change it up but
most of the time I just enjoy a good
bowl of cereal so I'm just having some
mini weeks now and then I go onto my
computer go over my video list figure
out what I got to do today and just hang
out if I have some extra time I will
make the effort to paint my toenails
just because in the summer I'm always
wearing sandals and showing off my toes
so I like to paint some different colors
so I'll either go for a super light
colour or a super bright one in this
case I went for SES in the Cabana which
is just a bright turquoise color and
apparently it's only exclusive to
Walgreens so if you're interested in the
color that's where I found mine next
I'm usually filming my makeup and today
I was filming for my Blake Lively makeup
tutorial so if you want to see that that
that's the previous video on my channel
but after I'm done filming I get back
into my super comfy clothes and I go
outside and I use sunscreen this is the
Banana Boat protect and hydrate I love
this stuff it has aloe vera it's non
greasy and absorbs in seconds so it's
like a moisturizer and a sunscreen which
is perfect because I hate burnt skin
when I'm done filming another thing I
love to do is where fun that lip colors
in the summer because it makes me feel
like I look tanner and I always feel
super natural with my makeup so either
go for a bright pink or a red and in
this case I'm using the Revlon Colorstay
moisture stain and Stockholm red I love
this stuff because it moisturizes my
lips without the stickiness which is a
huge plus moving on to my outfit like I
said I was filming my Blake Lively video
today so I just put on one of the
outfits got ready for it grabbed Patrick
and we were outdoor ready to film also
for those wondering a majority of the
products I use can be found at Walgreens
I mainly go there because it's right
around the corner and it's a one-stop
shop so I can get all my products at
once but now secret giveaway time if you
want a chance to win $100 to Walgreens
then check the description box below for
details but that was my summer morning
routine I really hope you guys liked it
and I will see you guys in my next video
