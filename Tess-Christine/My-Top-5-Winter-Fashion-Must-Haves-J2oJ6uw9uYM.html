like my new Christmas background this is
our tree my fan in my family's house
this is our tree it's blinky this year
it didn't used to be blinking like that
but I think I kind of like it's kind of
like the tree is glistening if it's
annoying in the background I'm sorry I
hope it is it but I thought it would be
a little bit more exciting than just
like a boring white wall but anyways
today's video is going to be my top 5
fashion must-haves for winter and these
are things that I think that every girl
should have in their wardrobe for winter
because I think they're a must-have and
those things that I wear all the time
during the winter and I know a lot of
you guys requested something like that
so I thought I would do it and don't
worry before I get any comments I
promise I will do a winter fashion video
that is probably gonna be my next video
I think I even might film that today so
all the stuff you see here I'm gonna put
in outfits and everything like that so
you can see how to put it together but
these are just key pieces that I think
that if you are out Christmas shopping
or something like that or even gifts for
friends and things like that I think
that every girl would enjoy something
like this to have for winter so let's
just get right into the video so my
first favorite thing
well not favorite I guess my first
fashion must-haves for winter are
sweaters and it kind of seems like a
given
yeah sweaters but I absolutely love
sweaters and I think it it has to be
said because I think that winter
obviously you should have sweaters and
they keep you so warm and you can make
them so cute and you can dress them up
in all different ways or dress them down
depending on you know where you're going
or what the certain of that is for
sweaters are very very versatile and I
love them for winter and so the ones I
have to show you now don't worry I have
a fashion video I promised but sweaters
like this one I'm wearing now which is
from American Eagle and I like sweaters
that are longer to wear that they would
cover your butt so you can wear with
like leggings or something like that I
think that look is super super cute for
the winter
but otherwise just cardigans and things
like that for those not in a super cold
climate with jeans and leggings even
would work just as well so this one I
got from American Eagle another example
one that has like a little bit more
color and this one is like an open style
cardigan this one is from PacSun and I
really really like the the pattern on it
and the colors on and I just
looks very wintery and these sweaters
are super thick and super one for winter
sometimes I don't even find myself
needing a jacket over them that is my
first fashion must-have for winter is
sweaters because they are so versatile
and you can purchase one sweater and
wear it like five different ways that is
a really good idea for her video I think
I might do a video now that I'm talking
about that to take one sweater and wear
it like a bunch of different ways
thinking I'll do that I gotta think of
it first but I'll do it because that's a
really good idea the second fashion
must-have for winter that I think that I
always find myself wearing our hats and
for example I'll show you the three hats
that I love for winter and they're these
they're like the knitted hats and these
are kind of the same style this one I
got at forever 21 I believe nope I got
this one at H&amp;amp;M and they're kind of like
the beret style hats you guys have seen
these plenty of times before but I love
wearing these in the winter especially
bad hair days because these cover up
your hair on bad hair days and you can
make them look really really cute and so
they're kind of a lifesaver in that
sense this one is from there's this one
from this one is actually from I got
this when I was studying abroad systems
from a random store in Barcelona so I
can't really tell you where this one's
from but you can get these hats pretty
much anywhere I've seen them at Target
I've seen them at Kohl's I've seen them
at pretty much any store right now in
the winter are these hats so these would
be a perfect gift because I think a lot
of people I mean unless you know the
person they don't wear hats at all but
these are the perfect gift because they
are lifesavers monster and they're super
warm so there's these two styles and
then I like this style which is like a
longer be nice tile and this is white so
I haven't worn this one yet cuz I got
this when I was studying abroad too and
I got it at the same place in Barcelona
which is kind of funny because Barcelona
is selling these really warm hats but I
don't know if it gets really cold there
I don't know if you live in Spain tell
me if it gets cold because I found these
everywhere and it was really surprising
to me cuz I was there in like September
but anyways this one's like a beanie
style hat and
these are super warm these go even go
over your ears and like pretty much all
over your head so these will keep you
really really warm in the winter and
they're really cute so that's a bonus
and so it's a definite must-have and
again these will be in my fashion video
so uh don't worry about figuring how to
wear these because I'll show you in my
next video but yes hats are must-have my
3rd fashion must-haves for winter is
scarves and it kind of goes along with
the sweaters hats scarves you can kind
of go for a whole outfit with these
actually everything that are all my
favorites you can make an outfit out of
which is really convenient
so anyways scarves love scarves and in
particular in the winter because where I
live is very cold our big scars these
aren't my lifesavers they keep me so
warm in the winter and I love wearing
them with jackets with sweaters with
anything they keep you so warm to keep
your neck warm you can wear them over
your face and it gets really really cold
so I love these this one is a loop scarf
it's really really long starts here and
ends here
yeah and it's um it's like this pink and
tan kind of woven really really really
really soft I got this when I was
studying abroad too but I got this at
river island and so if you have a river
island I know my friend just got a red
one there like a couple weeks ago so
they probably still have these I'm
almost positive they do but they are so
warm to save me on some of our field
trip studying abroad when it got super
cold because it was just so warm and
it's so long that it keeps your body
more when it's underneath your jacket so
I love these this one I got at H&amp;amp;M this
one isn't a loop scarf it's like a just
you know a traditional scarf but it's
the same material as the other one it's
like that woven really really soft I
can't even think of the word for this
material but I absolutely love this so I
got this one at H&amp;amp;M it's like a maroon
and black I got this one pretty recently
too so if you're looking for it you can
probably go still pick it up my fourth
fashion must-haves for the winter are
leggings or tights and I seriously wear
leggings and tights all the time in the
ledger which you may think why because
they're not the warmest things in the
world but what I love doing is layering
and you can layer tights and leggings
and it's extra extra warmth and I love
that if you're wearing with a big
sweater and then with
it's you really don't have that much leg
that's actually in tight that's showing
still so I actually really enjoy it and
and it can make if you're wearing a big
bulky sweater and then you have big
bulky jeans on it can kind of make you
look oversized and kind of just really
sluggish but if you have put together
you know even like tight skinny jeans or
jeggings or leggings on underneath a big
giant sweater it just looks so comfy and
so cute and that's like one of my
favorite fashion trends for winter for
leggings I have these from Macy's but
you can get leggings seriously
everywhere I don't even need to tell you
where to get them because you can
probably get them anywhere you guys all
know what leggings are they're not as
thin as tights and they're obviously not
as thick as jeans they're just like
spandex they're really really
comfortable I love them they're like
sweatpants almost just not as baggy but
they feel super comfortable so that's
why I love wearing them under sweaters
another thing are tight and there's two
different types of types of tights that
I like there's these ones these ones I
just bought because tights have an issue
with ripping at least mine I tend to
snag them a lot so I go through a lot of
tights but they're fairly inexpensive so
I don't really mind repurchasing them
but these ones are from Target they're
just like the Moroni brand am I saying
that right
yeah Moroni brand they're the opaque
tights but the thing is is they're not
super super see-through they're like a
solid black color and they're thicker
than like a regular sheer type which is
the next one I'm going to talk about but
these ones I like getting for certain
outfits like sweaters and things like
that where I'm wearing you know thick
tights it wouldn't would make more sense
to wear you know thicker tights with a
sweater than you know sheer nylons with
them you know so it just makes more
sense to wear these I know a lot of
places sell tight so you shouldn't have
a problem finding them another pair of
tights that I like right
are these ones and they're the sheer
ones they're they're nylon material so
they're very very thin so if you live in
a super cold climate like me visa will
not keep you even a little bit warm it's
basically like your skin still exposed
so these funds are
you shear their black sheer tights
I love wearing these with skirts pencil
skirts and like loose-fitting tops or
sweaters or something like that because
this would be super good for you know
going somewhere fancier or yeah a
certain event that's fancier in the
holidays or something like that because
these are not really meant for you know
lounging around I mean you could I have
before but they're more of like a
fancier looking kind of tight with if
you wear I'm with pencil skirts and
stuff like that but you could most
definitely wear these with sweaters and
it would do the same thing it's just not
very warm but I mean if it's not very
cold then it makes sense right now onto
my fifth thing and final thing for
must-have for winter and you guys can
probably all guess because I live in the
Midwest like I said and it's snowing all
the time but it is boots and these are
really dirty because I wore these all
last winter but these are ugg boots
they're the Bailey button ones I think
that's what they're called
I absolutely love boots and not just out
boots I'm not just saying on boots I
have Bearpaw boots that are like the
knit ones I don't have them here to show
you but you'll see them I'm sure in a
different video but these ones I love
these ones are so so warm and so are the
knit ones any kind of boots
I even like wearing tall boots in the
winter with leg warmers or like big
socks underneath so they like stick out
the top I think you guys know what I'm
talking about but like boots that I've
been wearing you know in the fall and
stuff like that I can wear in the winter
if I just like kind of layer up with
like big heavy socks underneath they are
just as warm to me so I like doing that
as well but definite boots are must-have
and especially this time of year you can
find these almost anywhere these are
good Santa present for all of you guys
wanting to you know ask Santa for
something I would ask for boots and
these can be dressed up so cute
especially with what you're wearing on
the rest of your outfit if you're
wearing a really nice sweater you know
with the belts and leggings and then you
have these like it still looks really
really cute and not like so snobbish
because these could be like slavi if you
wear them with slavi is that a word I
don't know but you can definitely dress
these up or dress these down so these
are very versatile as well for the
winter and plus there
really warm so I mean why wouldn't you
want you have your feet all nice and
warm during the winter so I definitely
love these all right so that is it for
my five fashion must-haves for winter I
really really hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I hope it helps you out with
maybe some Christmas presents or stuff
to ask for for Christmas or even just
some shopping ideas the next time you go
