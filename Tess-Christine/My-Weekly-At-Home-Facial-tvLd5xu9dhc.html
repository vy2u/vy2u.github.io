be a weekly at-home facial that will
help rejuvenate and repair your skin
I've been doing this routine for a
little over a month now and while my
skin isn't perfect I definitely have
noticed an improvement and not only acne
scars but my skin tone as well so if
you're interested just keep on watching
and let's get started the first step
you're going to want to do is tie your
hair back it makes your life a whole lot
easier and it's way easier to work with
your skin this way the next step is
going to be to remove your makeup and
cleanse your face the cleanser I really
like using is the Proactiv cleanser but
you can use whatever cleanser works for
you the next step is to exfoliate I have
pretty oily skin so I like using this
personal microdermabrasion this device
works by the use of gentle suction and a
rotating disc that lifts the impurities
and exfoliates the skin I chose to use
the blue disc which is for sensitive
skin a really good thing about this is
that you don't need to charge it at all
you simply just plug it in now my first
time using this I was pretty scared I
have to admit it's kind of intimidating
when you turn it on but it doesn't hurt
or anything so don't worry so to use
that all you're gonna do is make sure
your skin is tight and in upward motions
move through the device upwards when
using this device it's really important
that you don't go over the same area of
skin twice because you don't want to
scratch your skin up this device is
pretty powerful so you just want to be
careful of that so now basically I'm
just finishing the rest of my face I do
my forehead my nose and my chin and
everything like that you're interested
in this device that's available at
personal microderm com and I have a
coupon code for you guys yay so if
you're interested I'll have that in the
bottom bar below now your face may get a
little bit red after using this device
but don't worry it'll go away overnight
moving on to step number four you're
gonna want to apply some sort of face
mask I've used all three of these so I'm
just gonna go over them briefly this
first one is a health and beauty Aztec
secret Indian healing clay this one is
very powerful so if you're into kind of
a strong facial I would recommend this
one this one is by the body shop it's a
tea tree face mask this one is very very
light and is one's a face mask for those
who like kind of a soothing facial and
that one that's very strong this next
one is one of my favorites and it is a
clay mask at clay and oatmeal which is
the one I'm going to be using today
and this one's really nice it's kind of
a medium between the two it's not as
strong as the Indian healing clay but
it's not as light as the bodyshop one so
it's all what you prefer I like them all
now to apply this face mask I'm just
using my fingers and applying a light
layer however you like to do this is
fine I like using my fingers you can use
a brush if you want to but when you're
finished you're gonna look like this
giant green monster which you know it's
always fun but yeah so you're just gonna
wait about 10 minutes and then once it
starts cracking like this on your face
you are going to rinse it off now for
step five you're gonna want to
moisturize my favorite moisturizer is
the Cetaphil just plain moisturizing
lotion and I like spreading that
throughout my face and onto my neck and
chest
moving on to the last and final step I'm
going to hydrate and repair my skin by
using this 100% argan oil and using a
ring finger and placing that underneath
my eyes and a little bit on to my cheeks
and with that you are finished I really
hope you guys liked this weekly at-home
facial routine and I really hope it
helps you guys out thank you guys all so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
