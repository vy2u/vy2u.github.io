would feel just like
if you
take it
hey everyone for today's video I decided
I would show you guys six of my favorite
winter outfits that I wore this season
in case it helps you guys out if you
live in a colder climate like I do I
know what it's super cold you just want
to be bundled up but hopefully I show
you guys some ways to still be cute and
show off your personal style okay so
starting off with outfit number one of
course as you can see I went ice skating
but this is definitely an outfit that I
would wear on an everyday basis it kind
of embodies my everyday winter style I
am kind of petite in general so instead
of wearing super bulky sweaters which I
love and are super comfortable
they kind of drown me so a tip for you
if you have a similar body shape is to
wear kind of like a tighter fitted
sweater underneath and then you can wear
bulky sweaters it just is a little bit
more flattering and shows off your
figure still without kind of drowning in
your clothes but starting with my pants
those are just some basic high-waisted
blue jeans from PacSun super stretchy
and comfortable for my gloves those are
from Target and they're convertible so
their mittens and then they turn into
gloves super convenient now for a hat ah
that's pretty much a necessity in the
winter where I live so this one's my
favorite this year and it's from Urban
Outfitters it has a little bunny ears
for my black jacket it's kind of a
textured pea coat and that's from
forever 21 and my red plaid scarf is
from Miss Selfridge now I wanted to show
you underneath my jacket since that's
convenient when you get inside so I'm
just wearing this grey fuzzy sweater
from American Eagle
moving onto outfit number two just a
casual day in the woods right no but I
wanted to show you guys a bunch of
different Minnesota scenery because I
thought it'd be interesting but anyway
starting off with my jacket this is from
ASOS I'm obsessed with it it is so warm
I love the color and the details all
along it like that kind of fuzzy
material I don't even know what that's
called but I love this jacket super warm
so underneath it I'm just wearing a
plaid or like a flannel that's from
PacSun and then the same blue jeans from
before blue jeans are like my staple for
the winter I just love them for my shoes
these are from Target and they're kind
of a nicer looking booties and then I
just wore some gray socks from forever
21 underneath it for some added warmth
now I may be one of the few youtubers
that hasn't moved to a warmer climate
yet so I don't have an amazing Beach to
film at but I do have ice castles so
moving on to outfit number three I just
had to take you along with me to the ice
castles in Minnesota this year because
they are amazing it's like nothing
you've ever seen before I had so much
fun walking through this place it's just
magical and what's awesome about it is
it's all hand carved so people actually
sculpt this place and they make tunnels
slides it's just so cool they even had a
waterfall and now with frozen being such
a huge hit they even made an Elsa throne
which of course I sat in and then
slipped off of it classic but I just had
to show you some clips from the ice
castles and then also show you my outfit
starting off with my shoes I wore some
on boots but they're not your classic on
boots because these are like heavy-duty
winter ones they're super warm and
comfortable and really good traction on
the ice as you can see I'm standing on
it no but I had those for like a year
and I love them but anyways my jacket
that is from forever 21 the same
textured pea coat along with the maroon
scarf from Zara that I'm obsessed with
my blue sweater is from Nasty Gal super
warm I love wearing Croft sweaters like
this because they're so easy for my
gloves these are just a mittens from
coal a super warm and then my gray
headband is from Target
moving on to outfit number four this is
definitely a super comfortable outfit
but it also looks a little bit nicer so
it's perfect if I kind of had to go
somewhere that had to be a little bit
more dressed up but still wanted to be
comfortable so it's one of my favorites
starting off with the sweater which I
absolutely love I have it in two
different colors that is from Free
People it's just the super chunky loose
bulky knits turtleneck sweater and I
love it
my maroon scarf that's the same one from
Zara like I said I wear it every day my
tan coat that is from forever 21 I also
paired it with some tights from Target
just to keep me a little bit more warm
and then my boots are the store Weitzman
lowland boots in black they're awesome
and I love them they definitely dress up
and yell fit
moving on to outfit number five this is
definitely another casual one but a
little bit more put together so starting
off with the jacket that is just a tan
pea coat from Target super comfortable I
normally would have that button but I
wanted to show that off the outfit if
you know I'm saying um my boyfriend
jeans those are from gasps and then I
also wore some Brown booties from Aldo
with some black socks from forever21
underneath because I love showing you
that for when you get on a hidden side
since this is more of an inside outfit
anyways I just wore this maroon sweater
from Windsor I love the tribal print on
it and then for my crop top I got is
from for love and lemons like I said
once you get inside this outfit is
perfect it's not something I'd stand
outside for hours in um but it
definitely is a little bit more of a
cute winter outfit and lastly for outfit
number six you guys know how much I love
my boho style in the summer so I had to
incorporate it for a winter look this is
definitely one of my favorites so
starting off with my romper that is from
PacSun it's from the Kendall + Kylie
collection what I loved about this
romper is that it had darker colors so
it's actually perfect for the winter if
you pair it with some tights and some
tall boots like I did and I'm just
wearing a really fuzzy teddy bear coat
over it and that's from Topshop I've had
it for a year now it's so warm and then
I just wore a necklace from forever 21
and then the same Stuart Weitzman
lowland boots which is awesome because
it covers a lot of my leg and then for
my headband that is the same one that I
wore before and that's from Target
perfect keep your ears warm while also
being fashionable and having it look
like a headband
but that's it for my winter style video
I really hope you guys found some
fashion inspiration be sure to let me
know in the comments below which outfit
was your favorite and I will see you
guys in my next video
