noticed I have quite the different
background today and the reason for this
Oh my cat the reason for this is I came
home to visit my parents for the weekend
and yeah so I'm at my old house in my
hometown so yeah that's why the next
couple videos are going to be like that
because I'm planning on filming a bunch
while I'm here but yeah so today I'm
doing my everyday face makeup routine
and this was actually a request so yeah
I guess there's not much else to say but
let's get into it alright hi guys so the
first thing I'm going to be using is
Narses Pro prime skin smoothing face
prep and this is just up the description
of it is to minimize pores and smooth
out your face it's sort of a primer but
I wouldn't considered a foundation
primer and I just focus that focus this
where my pores are the biggest which is
around my nose and the inner part of my
face and then next I'm taking the Laura
Mercier foundation primer and oil free
I'm using oil free because my skin is
already oily and I'm just taking a
pea-sized amount and rubbing that all
over my face right and next I'm taking
the Laura Mercier 6 silk cream
foundation in the color beige ivory and
I'm just using the small pea-sized
amount again and rubbing it between my
fingers I find that this works out best
moreso than using a foundation brush
brush because it allows me to blend my
foundation a lot easier into my face
alright next I'm using NARS --is
concealer palette and vanilla honey and
I like mixing the two colors together
and then I focus that underneath my eyes
and then the by my nose and the inner
parts of my nose and I sort of create a
triangular effect from my nose up to my
eyes with the triangle pointing down
this is where you have the darkest
circles on your face and then I'm using
Mac's loose powder in the color I'm
using is NC 40 and I'm using this to set
my foundation and concealer and I'm just
taking a large fluffy brush and I'm just
going to put that all over my face
next I'm taking Narses Laguna bronzer
and I am going to focus this on the
temples of my face the upper part of my
forehead and I'm going to contour it on
my cheeks below my cheekbones and then
on my jawline in sorte I like sweeping
it and sort of creating the number three
on my face this seems to work out the
best for contouring and then I also like
to put it on my nose on the sides of my
nose all right and then I'm taking max
limited edition Wonderwoman compact in
the color I'm using is pink powder power
and I mean just using the highlight for
this why you jewelley just use the
highlight because I like the other
brands are so much better but um it does
come with a bronzer and a blush a dupe
to this would be Sephora sculpting
palette and then I'm taking a blush
brush and I'm using Mac's light the
colors light over dark and it's a
mineralized blush and I'm just going to
put this on the apples of my cheeks
all right and then once I'm finished
with that my face makeup is done all
right that was my face makeup routine
and I really hope you enjoyed the video
and until next time see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
