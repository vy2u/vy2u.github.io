channel so I'm filming in front of my
front door because as you can tell it's
an apartment or yes I know I did not
wait two years like I did with our last
place to film this and I'm really
excited because we finally got it kind
of all together there's a few things we
want to like add and change a little bit
but not too much so that's why I kind of
wanted to wait and make sure we have
everything so I could give you guys some
more ideas so obviously this is where
you enter and there's a huge Holloway so
I'm gonna take you through that and
we're gonna start in the main room
but before I let go and explain
everything quickly I know you guys kind
of already know but I just wanted to
like reiterate this um you guys know
that we live in New York City but this
apartment is in Brooklyn so we've always
lived in Brooklyn we switch
neighborhoods when we moved to this
place and we kind of got like a bigger
place for less money which we were super
excited about Plus this building is
super super old as you can tell when I
like bring you around it you'll notice
like the doorknobs the doors the paint
it's just very very old which is what we
were looking for because if you guys
watch my apartment tour from last year
the first two years of us living in New
York we were in a very new apartment
like everything was new the appliances
were new it was really nice but when we
envision ourselves living in New York I
was thinking like friends and Seinfeld
and like just old gritty apartments and
that's kind of what we wanted so when we
looked for a new place we found this and
we immediately were like yes so keep
that in mind we could never afford a
place of this size in Manhattan so if
you are living in New York want to move
to New York look at Brooklyn because you
can find some really cool spots there
was three girls living here before so
they think I think they turn this into
either the living room or another
bedroom but we decided to use it as kind
of like our studio like Pat keeps a lot
of his camera stuff here so every time
that we want
because we usually film or shoot photos
at least every day so he kind of keeps
his stuff right here for now we're still
kind of figuring out wherever you want
to put everything and then this mess Oh
corner is me so this clothing wrap I got
at IKEA super cheap basically I just put
everything about I have to shoot on this
so anything that I haven't like any new
clothes that I haven't posted either on
my Instagram or I want to feature in
like halt or like a lookbook or
something like that I kind of like lay
out here and it just gives me a good
idea so it doesn't get lost in the
shuffle I'm not gonna lie it's usually a
mess so I wanted to keep that true
there's even a suitcase on the ground
because we're leaving we're going on a
trip so we're packing ah this you I saw
in our last apartment to where this is
in our bedroom used it as a dresser we
keep it out here I just think it looks
really pretty it's got some cracks in it
just from like moving and all that but
yeah this is from Urban Outfitters this
is kind of random might as well talk
about it we found this in where do we
find this bad in the basement the
basement of our apartment yeah okay so
we found it it's like an old old
suitcase we thought it looked cool Pat
used it for a couple photo shoots and
then we just decided to keep it in here
because we thought it looked it looked
like it match the little bit we have a
fire escape which I love it's just very
in New York and I was really excited
when we found a place that had a fire
escape because I just loved it and it
looks it just looks cool we wanted a
table because we did have one in our
last night so we just had like a bar top
but we wanted to keep this like pretty
open for filming purposes so we wanted
to get just like a breakfast table or
like a high high top table because we
have bar stools from our old place that
we didn't want to get rid of so we went
to a flea market in Brooklyn and we
found this table we probably could have
made it our cell
we were at home but it was pretty
inexpensive like I said found at a flea
market and we loved it at this a lot of
this editing on here which is okay so
moving on you come through these doors
which we never never shut hardly ever
you guys saw the furniture from our old
place we kept it obviously so the couch
and the chair we bought when we were in
Minnesota
got it forever still looks good to us so
we're keeping it also with the table
we've had that since college it's from
Pier one it's got a lot of memories into
it too with the amount of people that
like put stuff on it and the wood is
kind of all over the place but we like
it and it looks cool so yeah that's
boring stuff the rug I'm really excited
about the broad this is from the world
market this is a live plant you guys saw
this in one of my blogs when we bought
her Gertie right she's doing well she
has a few weeks that died but other than
that she's holding up she's growing
looking great we put a big mirror here I
always find that when you put mirrors in
apartments it just helps open everything
up
it makes it look super nice and bright
okay so one really cool thing I remember
when Pat and I toured this place before
we actually bought it we noticed this on
the walls basically it's just like this
built in shelf essentially um it's so
freakin cool we decided it made our life
so much easier because we were able to
put books and photos up there without
actually hanging anything most of this
stuff is Pat's photos that's Pat's photo
love that
that's our friend Josh he sketched that
and then that is a viewer actually I
will have her all of her stuff linked
below she is so sweet and she takes the
most amazing photo she's from Spain and
I believe so I will link her Instagram
below so you guys can see that um this
top hat as like a collectible growing up
right
have you in this thing no I got it in
Australia okay got it in Australia
that's another one of Pat's photos so
what we for sure envisioned wasn't you
before we got this place we were like
yes that's like all my books can go up
there it just looks cool and how's it
going to steady yeah it looks cool in
here and it helps like kind of it's like
cluttered but not cluttered at the same
time it just has a lot of our
personality organized chaos organized
much like our life so this is another
set of doors we're gonna go into the
kitchen now fun stuff about the fridge
yes it's really old but we decided to
get some magnets because we didn't have
a magnet fridge in last place we got
this like scrabble kid there named dirty
words on there no okay um but when our
friends come over we do like fun things
with them and even a Halloween party
so everyone decided to make like creepy
words out of the Scrabble letter is this
no that's okay it's all very spooky
because we got a Halloween party page at
that but regardless I don't know where
we got the Scrabble letters but then we
also got these really cute I think those
are from Chiara the Scrabble letters
yeah oh I think they are when we looked
at this apartment the landlord was like
don't touch the kitchen especially the
hatch which i think is like punch hatch
tomato tomato
I don't know I don't know you guys get
it looks like this it's super old and
the landlord is like don't touch it
don't fix it don't do anything to it so
we're like okay cool we can live with it
it's pretty awesome
Pat keeps a lot of his stuff in here um
coming over here this hutch hatch
whatever continues here and this is
where we keep all of our dishes then
down here we have this little easel
which again is from Magnolia market
fun fact it's Magnolia market is by chip
and Joanna Gaines from that HT is it
HGTV I'm not sure they're getting a line
at Target and I can't
they just have the coolest stuff so I
have this easel Christy Teegan cookbook
on it yes love it there's a really cool
wine rack that's actually usually filled
with wine but you know it's not another
little shout-out to Magnolia market they
have the best fake flowers or greenery
this is where I got these we have a
hanging plant which I want a hang higher
but we just haven't gotten around to it
yet
she's regal you haven't named her yet we
got the hooks and all of that from Ikea
super inexpensive those are our most
used pots they look kind of crazy but we
have a gas stove so unless you have cast
iron skillet they get kind of crazy okay
so you walk down this hallway and you're
kind of like back where you started I'm
going to sound like a broken record but
I got this and these really cute things
from Magnolia market love you Johanna we
have this you guys saw it in our last
apartment as well this is just like a
weird decor piece that we bought at Pier
one a long time ago and then decided to
fill it with Polaroids of friends that
come to visit or just come to our
apartment in general it's just a fun way
to kind of like relive a memory because
most of the time we're having a very
good time in these Polaroids and it just
it's fun thing to look back on the only
thing I wish I would have done was like
date them but get it whatever your stuff
works I like the idea of an open closet
even though it doesn't look as clean
necessarily in here it's like what you
said organized chaos we kind of like it
it's easy to just grab and go it's
unique we don't we didn't have one of
these before
and most of the time when we have a
closet we leave it open anyways so pop
stuff my stuff I kind of take over as
you could probably imagine no let's talk
about the go bed it's the same bed same
actually everything that you guys saw
except for the pillows and the blanket
we still hadn't got a queen bed imagine
that it's on our to-do list we still are
sleeping on up all crazy the headboard
is the same that you guys saw before
it's from Pier one and then our
bedspread and sheets are from Target for
our pillows they're all the blue
and the pink one are from West Elm and
this one is from Target we kind of got a
lot of our bedroom stuff at West Elm
there was one right around the corner
from us when we first moved to New York
ever which is why the lamps the
nightstand are all from West Elm
but you guys picture you guys all that
anyways this bench we had in our hallway
in our old place it's from Target we
keep like extra sheets extra towels and
stuff like that in there and then how
the curtain hanging got some fairy
lights I have to fill these with stuff
Pat and I are still trying to figure out
what we want to put there like press
frames so a lot of the times people put
in like press flowers or greenery in
there we just got to figure out what we
want to put in there but those are from
Anthropologie and then this again is the
same Rebecca will have her link below as
the image outs out in her living room
she actually sent this to us which was
so so sweet of her so definitely a huge
shout out I'm gonna put her Instagram
even on this green here you go girl um
but yeah we love her stuff so yay all
right so you come down the hallway we're
gonna go into the bathroom next but
quickly I wanted to talk about this cool
thing that Pat put together from our
Cuba trip he took all of these on film
and he framed them really nicely it's
definitely our favorite photo so we put
that in the hallway I think it looks
really nice
one thing that we really liked about it
was this so cool we want to get like a
WC no I'm talking about shower curtain
this is from Target really pretty I like
it it's actually kind of new okay so
what you guys saw this over the toilet
thing we got this from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
you saw my dad and it fit together in
our moving vlog still holding up strong
I was gonna clean this and make this
really pretty but I just had to keep it
realistic this is how my makeup looks
mostly all the time the products pretty
much stay the same is the stuff that Pat
and I
or mostly me use pretty much every day
so I like to keep that very accessible
got some towels you know bathroom things
and that's pretty much it okay so now
let's move on to the last room which is
the office slash guest room so this is
what it looks like and if you guys saw
my last apartment which I sound like a
broken record again because I keep
talking about it but we didn't have a
window so it's much more open it's not
so cave like which we love so for where
I do all my editing for you guys is
right here my desk chairs same as last
time from West Elm and then up here I
got this bulletin board from Target
which is like 9 bucks and I think it's
basically my info wall it looks really
pretty and then also I have my video
ideas up here which I add to cross out
that whole thing feeling every beauty
guru for lack of a better word or just
like youtuber has these they're the Alex
drawers from Ikea they're so nice I have
like makeup extra makeup stuff for stuff
that I get gifted I have like important
documents things like that it just kind
of helps keep everything organized
we bought this daybed in Minnesota we've
had it for a while it's nice because if
people aren't staying here because we
love to have our friends come and visit
hence the Polaroid wall it pulls out
it's like a triangle bed so we can fit a
lot of people but what I like about it
is kind of like a hub for all my outfits
as well so if I'm planning something and
just I just got done cleaning up all my
Halloween stuff it kind of piles on here
but it's a good visual thing for me to
see everything uh and that's it oh my
gosh you love the space it has a lot of
character it's exactly what we wanted so
we're really really happy with our
apartment I hope you guys liked it and
got some design ideas or ways to
decorate your place your room your
apartment your house whatever you feel
so yeah thank you guys so much for
watching
and I will see you all in my next video
