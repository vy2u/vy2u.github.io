be a very short intro video into a new
series that I'm doing on my channel as
you guys can tell by the title and if
you follow me on any of my social media
sites you know that it's gonna be called
get healthy with me so it's kind of a
play off of get ready with me but this
time I'll focus around a healthy
lifestyle my channel as you guys know is
beauty fashion and lifestyle and I focus
mainly on beauty and fashion so I figure
it's about time that I fill that
lifestyle category and do some health
videos plus I was getting a ton of
requests to do a diet and fitness
routine I can't even express to you guys
how many times I got asked for that and
I was thinking about it and instead of
just doing one video I figured I would
make it into a series because there's so
much you can talk about involving food
fitness apparel like there's just
endless amount of things this series is
seriously entirely up to you guys
because you guys are the ones that
requested it so often then I figure I
would leave it up to you and that's also
the kind of the reason why I wanted to
make this intro video so I could get
requests below I have about four or five
videos planned already it's gonna be
really fun but I want to know what else
you guys want to see but I do want to
add a short disclaimer in that I am NOT
a fitness professional nor am i a
nutritionist so I want to keep that very
clear throughout this entire series that
I am not advising you guys to do
anything these videos are just strictly
things that I do to keep myself have
self healthy and things that I have
learned over the years my videos are
going to be very relaxed they're not
going to be extreme they're not going to
be crazy workout crazy dieting habits or
anything like that I thought this series
would be perfect for you guys because
it's a very easy transition from maybe a
not so healthy lifestyle into one that's
a little bit more healthy so it's just
gonna be very informational and you guys
can take it how it is and just kind of
maybe just find some inspiration or do
some of the things that I'm doing and
hopefully we can get fit together
because that'd be awesome I really hope
that you guys enjoy the series please
give it a thumbs up if you are excited
for it because I really want to know how
you guys think about the series since I
kind of went out on a whim here and
decided to do it so give me a thumbs up
on this if you really liked it and also
let me know in the comments below
videos you guys want to see involving
health I'm still gonna do beauty and
fashion videos but I want to know in the
comments
videos that you guys really want to see
for me and I will do my best to do them
the first video of the series will be up
sometime this week and it's going to be
all about snack foods so I'm going to
start out easy and just kind of quick
and simple so it's gonna be really
really fun so I really hope you guys
stay tuned for that
and I will see you guys in my next video
