channel today's video is going to be a
fun one because every super fun video I
do is Patrick so I figured since you
guys just saw the Ireland travel vlogs
and we just got engaged which is so fun
I thought we would do like a trivia I
don't really know what to call this I
tried to explain this to him and I
didn't really even know what I was
saying kind of like a most likely to I
don't know what I'm gonna call this at
the end of the day but I feel like it's
been a while since we've done one of
these or we answer like personal
questions last time to do one of these
was in our old apartment yeah which is a
long time ago like our boyfriend tag
that we did yeah was well I mean we've
been dating for five years so that one I
think I uploaded like four years ago yes
that's something about right and the
boyfriend does my makeup he mailed it so
old okay so I have the nut questions but
scenarios on my phone you guys will pick
up the game as soon as we start playing
it so let's just get started
easy I was born in 91 we were north 92
but your March birthday I'm a Jew
birthday
why do you think Bubba would you did not
victim why are you think that why am i
saying both no this is wrong if he's
taking any of this credit I'm not saying
that I made the first move but I'm also
saying that you didn't make the first
move your friends made you take the
first move okay but that's beside the
point
yes my friend Christine shoutout
Christine if you're watching she
actually went up to Pat and was like hey
meet my friend Tess and I was like super
nervous wait you gotta weep for me I
don't know if I would have said you I'm
a cautious driver
guess who's minute more accidents that's
not even like you both made it here
though you know we graduated from
college both of us in here but yeah I
would say you're far more studious than
I am getting to shoes
wait and also it depends on the surprise
if it's from Pat writes like if I'm
keeping it from Pat I feel like I'd be
better but if it's like my friends and
I'm just like too excited I would ruin
it I'll give you that yeah you're good
keeping them from me but your friends
you're just like I just want to tell you
right now how do you catch the surprise
of when you were gonna propose I didn't
know I didn't have an idea
only because you had an idea for like
the first month we were late that's way
too generous so it'll be joking I'm
scared I was kid that would dip their
toe in the water before jumping in and
you would just jump in cannonball yeah
almost it's really nice but you're a
great cook and I wouldn't want to rain
on your parade yeah sure is there a
surprise card
wait why cuz it's not surprising Oh like
not
mostly because I'm stubborn and annoying
or usually correct I'll take that okay
but I have a disclaimer on why I say
that yeah there's like a
spends more money because he's like very
impulsive I think about my purchases a
lot more than he does but in his defense
I'm fortunate enough to wear like with
what I do I get sent a lot of stuff that
would probably normally purchase so that
makes it is good I'm not a morning
person at all you wake up early super
early you're good at that just like the
morning
you don't run that Ferren Oh
this was at Mitch's cabin yeah oh yeah
okay got it
he definitely said it first memory
reinforced I had a couple White Russians
I was like you know we should hang out
together for ever it was confusing
because initially when we were all like
hanging out with friends and stuff he
said it but we had been drinking so I
didn't really know if he was like for
sure
but later that week he said it like when
we were just chillin it was a warm-up
you know for sure
my clothes are everywhere
and my coffee mugs I got the in it's
recorded it's this is amazing this will
be playing at the wedding
what no you take a long shower you've
listened to albums in a shower be okay
that's the in a bath no no no but not
the whole album that's in incredible
waste of resources today you took a very
long shower no yes I haven't showered
today yesterday you took a very long
shower no more than three songs zero
sense of direction and even with an
iPhone yeah it's pretty bad it's awful
you're adventurous you go with the flow
I'm like fun which sometimes like no
it's light they both in some ways I
would say like I'm like right here but
like the little the little Patrick is
popping out right there because you do
in a lot of ways I'll give myself the
the path yeah not the not the Rick not
the Rick get a pant leg oh I've got some
booty shorts if it was a full pair of
pants I have the booty shorts she has
like the the rest of it was important
guilty Siraj today which is why I'm
wearing a hat oh yeah yeah I honestly
don't know the answer to that I don't
know either
you know honestly that could have been
like a mutual thing I can't save it I
think it was a test Rick
a test Rick it's a test why do you think
we've never made a couple names
[Laughter]
wait that was a real question I don't
even know why that's on there I it's
yeah obviously I think you guys are
pretty well aware of that
sorry mostly grew up Pat does but he's a
cleaner person which i think is another
question from here wait really
you think you're a bad guy I like to be
I'm a guy go full starfish when I can
this is the first time I'm hearing that
because I've always told that I'm the
bed hog because you always like
extremely okay use you seal the covers
but my feet hang off the end of the bed
so I naturally just like scoot sideways
like a little diagonal action so I can
stay out all of me on the that's true
you're joking right you're okay
Carrie Marie if you're watching this
please vote me because you know are you
kidding you made me make you a peanut
butter sandwich last night I like 11:00
p.m. with bananas I got baby you kiss
Mary maybe we're even can we be it can
we be a pest for a Tetrick maybe huh
he's not budging fine
I'm a bigger baby
that's not an argument it's like the
Wardrobe question you know he has great
music choices you ever want to hang up
with Pat he'll make a bomb-ass playlist
appreciate that thank you
I'm a softy okay okay fine but I would
say you more so I think you're really
cute when you want to be but I'm also I
haven't I don't know I think I'm just
like a romantic like you guys have to
back me up on this there is one time
when we got back from dinner and he
moved to the living room table and
played a cute song and like wanted to
dance like that's frickin romantic I
would not think of stuff like that
those are all the questions or scenarios
I guess I hope you guys got to know a
little bit about us and our relationship
and that whole mushy gushy stuff but I
know you guys like these video so that's

in trip no Charl outro thank you
