finally right I know don't kill me I
know does got her together and it's
filming an apartment tour finally oh my
gosh Patrick and I have lived in New
York City for a little over a year and
it took us to actually right now to
finally get our apartment together and
how we wanted it and because if you've
ever got apartment shopping especially
when you go from like pretty much
scratch it's really expensive and it's
really difficult to envision with in
your head and put it actually in a space
so I wanted to make sure it was done and
you guys can get some ideas from it if
you're decorating his face um so I
wanted to make sure it was helpful and
not just like shall we so anyways I
really hope you guys enjoy it and uh
yeah let's go ahead and get started hi
welcome to our apartment Patrick you
want to show yourself hello
okay he's standing by the door so that's
where we walk in pretty self-explanatory
all right so you walk down the big
hallway and this is the main apartment
area so let's start in the bathroom
because bathrooms all kinda look the
same starting off we have this thing
which if you watch my moving vlog my dad
and I bought this from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond
it's just like an over the toilet
storage it kind of gets cluttered but
it's where I keep all of like the stuff
I use everyday so a lot of like my
skincare um I have hair products I have
my makeup brushes these are the Revlon
ones I love them so fun fact about this
thing I bought this like um a TJ Maxx so
long ago like in college and it's
literally I think it's a pencil holder
but it's been my makeup brush holder for
so long now so that's our I keep all the
Revlon
Chiz and then all of my makeup and then
in here is like obviously just the sink
underneath your there's like all the
others junk and like I keep my hair
tools in here this is like worth extra
toilet paper goes and all that fun stuff
yeah that's basically it so now moving
on to the kitchen I feel like it's a
pretty big kitchen for like a New York
apartment we really like it we keep this
as like glasses like it kind of gets
cluttered pretty easily um this never
stays clean so this is the probably the
cleanest you've ever seen it shout out
to Carrie who knows that this is never
clean but we cleaned it just for you
guys because we actually use it
I genuinely like try to cook I've been
really into plated if you guys ever
heard of that
so fridge super unorganized so I'm not
going to be like cribs style like hey
check out what's in my fridge and like
all like nice waters because it's like a
mess in there it's pretty
self-explanatory it's a kitchen it's I
like it it works so yay this is a wall
mount and earth know mount a wall decor
piece that I bought from up Pier one a
while ago um
I supposed to just be like a decor thing
but it ended up trying into like this
Polaroid thing when we have our friends
come to visit our family or guests or
whatever we take their polaroid and it's
just kind of a fun like thing from home
that we like to see familiar faces and
it's just kind of fun to show everyone
like who's all come to visit because
yeah a lot of the furniture that I got I
actually purchased from home because in
Wisconsin Minnesota furniture and all
that is a lot more affordable Bennett is
here so I thought as much as I could
bring from home I would do that so I
bought this from just like a home
furniture or like Ashley Furniture I
don't know basic barstools but I liked
it because it matched the kitchen which
is black and then are like the rest of
our decor which is brown moving on into
the living room the first thing I guess
we have is this bar with our dead
flowers I haven't replaced them yet but
you know keeping it real it's very
sparse because we just actually added
this we have this table somewhere else
and we wanted to be at it
like just throw it so we wanted to keep
it I thought I would turn it into a bar
so you have some glasses there get
filled up with some wine and that whole
thing because we enjoy that next is this
shelf which I really like this is from
West Elm and it's kind of cool to
display its kind of art piece and its
own so we have a lot of pad stuff on
here actually so his hats we've got some
books of his is a little small thing
that we bought in Bali and um cameras
via a record player which is a verdict
or we literally use this thing so much
all of our records are down there okay
so now in the living room this is from
Pier one these are just from a furniture
store in Minnesota like a local one is
having a deal on it so I actually got it
for super affordable price we want to
add some color because everything was
really neutral in here for a while so
the two blue pillows those are from
Anthropologie and then this is from
these two pills are from society6 and
then we also put freeze-up which are
actually Pat's photos yay
this will die he is from Urban
Outfitters not real I have this fake
palm plant which I got from what way
fair all my necklace I hate it when he
does that cables from Target um that
candle was actually sent to me from Shay
Mitchell actually when she was so kind
and saw my look videos there's took me a
little care package that was one of them
so I thought that was a really cool add
color how I noticed my necklace that was
turned is because you have a mirror
right here which is from myself um but
we try to get it on sale cause it's
super pricey so this we bought actually
off the floor they were doing like a
moving sale so it's got a few Nick's in
it but it works really well it's nice
because it adds like adding mirrors and
stuff to your place adds a little bit of
not only like dimension but it also
makes it appear bigger because you see
more with it and ladder very urban
outfitter ease of me isn't it um but I
actually bought this like from a barn
flea market and
Johnson and he was so funny he was like
why do you girls keep buying all my
ladders and I was like well you know
you're selling them for like $10 in
Urban Outfitters charges like 100 so
that was a cool steal so that's a tip
for you we've got a Gamecube right here
we bought that when we were here Pat and
I cats loves that but we got that
because we like playing monkey ball I
don't know if you guys have ever played
it it's really fun now let's go ahead
and move into a bedroom Pat has his own
closet yes okay so that's his closet
he saw this lovely clothing in there and
shoes and all that fun stuff starting
off with the rug the fuzzy rug this is
from Wayfarer um it's nice soft whatever
the headboard is from pure one if you
notice it's actually a queen headboard
so the bed does it that it's a full bed
but eventually we're going to get a
clean bed and actually mount it but I
think that looks nice for now again some
of Pat's photos I got a dreamcatcher
here from Urban Outfitters the bedding
is from Target except for these two fun
pillows those are from society6 um this
dresser is where obviously we keep like
intimates and like just t-shirts and
shorts and stuff like that um this is
from Urban Outfitters it's really cute
but it's not very practical in this size
you have to be really careful with it
I already broke it down here which is
hilarious um I was like this one morning
and I made me hit the thing and it
crapped it was really bad luck I have
this little ring touch thing we bought
this in Mexico Riviera Maya from a
travel blog in that little shop that we
showed you and then this plant is from Z
Gallerie it's a fake um fiddle leaf tree
and the reason why we buy the fake stuff
is because we've tried real plants in
here and they just don't live long
enough to even buy them because we don't
very good sunlight because it Pat wants
to show you we face another building so
follow me um so again you see everything
this is a washer and dryer we're
actually really fortunate to have this
in our place because it's kind of rare
in New York City where you have it in
your unit most of the time it's in the
building and sometimes it's not even in
the building you really go to a
laundromat so don't joke about that this
is just a hall closet it has like hopes
and things like that I'm not even going
to open it because it's a mess and
whatever so now I'm going into the
office looks like this it's you know an
office so we've got my computer right
here uh desk
Kenshiro from what's down kill me again
this is another one that's never ever
clean um and Pat has all of his camera
gear staff oh what a mess yeah um we've
got this big pumpkin thing which I
actually recently got from us
I'm sorry Wayfair got like my jewelry
Pat's jewelry eating because this room
doesn't have a window so when we were
looking for our apartment we got a one
and a half it's not technically a
two-bedroom because there's no window so
I found this at home and it's a window
near which is really cool
so it kind of gives the illusion that
there's a window but there's a mirror in
here so it helps I would keep a bunch of
like important documents and like camera
gear and like products and stuff in
there super boring now we have my closet
if you guys want to know how I keep all
my crap here this is my closet it's
actually fairly it looks fairly
organized we had have all my tops a few
jackets dresses pants things like that
then like shorts jeans sweaters
sweatshirts purses shoes like my nice
shoes that I want to keep nice and then
under here are all kind of like my
everyday shoes I just like rummage
through down here when I want to get
something this is a daybed I got this
from home furniture super portable I got
it on sale so this is like when we have
guests if they don't want to stay in a
hotel they are more than welcome to
here there's a little trundle bed that
pops out and then I hung a tapestry I
think that's a face from Urban
Outfitters just for some color because
it was kind of like a box in here so I
wanted to make sure it was really fun so
yeah that's pretty much it and then
finally we make our way back to the door
but that's it for my video I really hope
you guys enjoyed it thank you so much
for watching be sure to give it a thumbs
up if you did and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
