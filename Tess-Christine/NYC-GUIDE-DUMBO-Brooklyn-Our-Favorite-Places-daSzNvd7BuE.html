hey everyone
today's video is a super exciting one
because it's super highly requested by
you guys but also it's a new video
series on my channel which I always get
pumped about so basically if Patrick and
I have been getting a lot of requests
via social media and YouTube to tell you
guys some of our favorite spots in New
York because New York is kind of a place
where a lot of people travel to and it's
huge it's overwhelming and to google
places and figure out where to go is
kind of a nightmare so since we're all
friends here I thought we would do a
video series and kind of like share our
favorites I know a lot of you guys have
been to New York live in New York and we
can kind of like all comment together
and like give recommendations to one
another but we've been here for about a
year now so we have narrowed down some
of our favorite spots where we take our
families and friends when they come to
visit
so we basically turn it into a series
and our section off kind of like how New
York is sectioned off Soho midtown
Brooklyn different areas in Brooklyn
it's going to be super fun I'm really
excited so to kick it off we thought we
would start off with an area we know
pretty well because we film here all the
time and that is Dumbo Brooklyn
definitely a spot you should visit if
you come here so I'm really excited to
show you guys we've nailed down our
favorites and yeah so if you are
interested then just keep on watching
Dumbo Brooklyn is one of our favorite
spots and definitely a must-see if you
are visiting New York fun fact
Dumbo stands for down under the
Manhattan Bridge overpass it sits
between the Brooklyn and Manhattan
bridges and what's great about it is
that it's super easy to get to
Dumbo definitely has a neighborhood feel
that it kind of allows you to escape
from the buzz of the city so it's great
the views architecture restaurants
cobblestone streets and art all make
this place super unique from Manhattan
plus if you're a Gossip Girl fan this
was filmed as Dan Humphreys neighborhood
it's a filming dream so you'll recognize
a lot of spots from my videos and a few
TV shows so now to show you Patrick and
i's favorite places here
if you're looking for a spot other than
Starbucks to grab a coffee a sweet treat
and just hang out for a bit one of our
favorite spots is called one girl
cookies this place is kind of like an
Instagram bloggers dream in here because
everything is super photogenic and
really cute but more importantly the
cookies the coffee everything is amazing
here my favorite is the pumpkin whoopie
pie you guys have to try it because
these are so dangerous because you feed
so many but it's amazing and then of
course the coffee is super photogenic
too so if you love Instagram you'll love
this place but it's also really
delicious plus it's a good spot if you
just need a break if you need a little
inspiration just take a walk around
Dumbo is a neighborhood that was curated
by a bunch of artists and developers
that really value art and realize that
it makes Dumbo unique you're gonna find
it everywhere on doors walls huge murals
like this one which I filmed in front of
you're going to recognize a lot of them
because I think they're so beautiful and
they're always changing which is really
fun but be sure to look left right up or
down because there's art everywhere in
this neighborhood it's really cool
if you're looking for a cool gift or
souvenir that's a little unique head to
the front general store on Front Street
there's a bunch of little shops and
boutiques that are really cool but this
one we found has the widest variety for
anything you could want it's a vintage
shop so everything's super unique and
cool in here it has clothes it has
jewelry it has glasses it has dishware
it has hats it has just like everything
you could possibly want and it's all
super unique and fun so I would
definitely stop in here if you're
looking for some comfort food or two
something quick for lunch you have to go
into Shake Shack there's a bunch of
locations in the city and in Brooklyn
but this one is in Dumbo and it's super
easy to get to and you just have to try
Shake Shack if you're an in-and-out fan
you're gonna love this personally I like
Shake Shack more than in-and-out so this
is kind of like a New York thing and you
have to try it when you're here because
it's so good once you get to Dumbo you
will realize there's no shortage of
photo opportunities but I think the best
place to go is Brooklyn Bridge Park it's
right there it's so easy and you'll
recognize this actually from a lot of my
videos because why wouldn't you want to
film here it's just gorgeous it has the
most amazing views of the city lots of
places to stop and sit it's a park it's
amazing but it looks even better at
night so if you can stick around till
the Sun Goes Down because the city just
lights up it's magical it's pretty you
get the best photos of the city here
because you can see it directly in front
of you it's amazing for a classic New
York bite you think pizza our favorite
is Giuliana's you might think to go to
Grimaldi's right next door but read the
article in the front of the restaurant
to realize that this is actually the
real Grimaldi's pizza it's a good story
but nonetheless the pizza here is
amazing we get a classic margarita but
they have so many other options it's so
good if you come to Dumbo you have to
wait in line to go here if you're
looking for something to do besides eat
walk around and just experience Dumbo
Dumbo has direct stairs right up to the
Brooklyn Bridge this is a really fun
activity to do kill some time plus you
get great views of the city
you can walk directly into men
if you want to but this is a photo-op
like crazy get your family photos ready
because you can get so many amazing
pictures up here plus you get to walk
directly on the Brooklyn Bridge which is
just cool in itself because you can see
all the suspension it's just really fun
plus it's some exercise you know after
you eat so much pizza for a nice dinner
one of our favorite spots is called
atrium it has the best food it's opened
for brunch lunch dinner but our favorite
time to go is definitely for dinner the
restaurant in itself is just really
pretty like how cool is this green wall
those are real plants by the way plus it
has an open kitchen so you can see the
cooks cooking which I love but it just
has really good food it's one of our
favorite spots so I had to recommend it
and mostly how to get here of course you
can take a cab but if you want to
adventure on the subway you can take the
F train to York Street or you can take
the AC train and get off the high street
but that's it for the video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it please
let us know in the comments below where
we should go next we love Soho so I'm
thinking that's the next place oh yeah I
will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
