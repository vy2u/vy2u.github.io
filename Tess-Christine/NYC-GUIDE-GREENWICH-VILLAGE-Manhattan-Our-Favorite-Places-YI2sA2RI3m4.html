be a long awaited New York City guide
and I'm so stoked you guys love the
series on my channel because I just feel
like it's something very different and
it's fun for me to kind of show you
around to new spots especially because I
know a lot of you guys travel here but
if you didn't know I already showed you
guys around Dumbo and Soho but this time
I'm taking you to Greenwich Village and
it's definitely one of my favorite spots
and you will see why so I'm not going to
waste any more time with this intro and
I'm just gonna get started in the video
Greenwich Village known simply as just
the village by locals is definitely one
of our favorite places in New York City
located on the west side of lower
Manhattan south of 14th Street and west
of Broadway this place has been the
epicenter of art and music for years now
it's the home to some amazing
brownstones historic jazz and music
clubs coffee houses beautiful parks and
NYU housing artists like Bob Dylan Jimi
Hendrix and Mark Twain just to name a
few have made their path to greatness by
passing through these streets which
leads me to my first recommendation for
all of you music lovers so you will find
no shortage of music poetry and artist
spots in this area so stop by a place
called Cafe Wha for a little piece of
music history young performers like Jimi
Hendrix Bob Dylan Bruce Springsteen and
Woody Allen all share their talent there
or if you follow me on snapchat and see
my friends and I jamming out at a piano
bar it's at the duplex also you'll find
no shortage of record shops here so we
like to go to a Bleecker Street Records
to find a new one and be sure to read
the guest list on the wall to find your
favorite person because I heat when I
saw Johnny Depp was here and also head
on to Jones and West 4th Street to
recreate a Bob Dylan album cover if
that's your thing Pat and I had a lot of
fun doing that so if you're a music geek
this is a perfect place for you
if you're looking for something to do
that's pretty relaxing you just want to
grab some coffee or some food and just
hang out and kind of break away from the
city for a bit head over to Washington
Square Park this place is absolutely
beautiful there's so many areas where
you can just kind of sit and chill and
hang out with whoever you're with or on
your own um it's a great photo
opportunity - it's beautiful you'll
recognize the iconic arch there's the
fountain there's people playing chess
which is always kind of fun to watch
them battle it out and there's also live
music playing which I always really love
because it's always nice to listen to
that next up for lunch you have to go to
buy Chloe I found this place recently
and I'm absolutely obsessed with it and
lucky for pretty much everyone it
happens to be vegan so it's just amazing
food I absolutely love it my favorite
thing to get on the menu well past
favorite is for sure the coconut but my
favorite is the guac burger the sweet
potato fries and the mac and cheese you
have to try the mac and cheese I think
it's my favorite thing on the menu but
just everything I just it looks amazing
it's so good I'm avoid certain times of
today because it gets really busy I
think a lot of people know how good it
is but it's definitely the best vegan
food I found so far in the city okay so
you guys know I'm a fan girl for pretty
much everything so I couldn't go this
whole video without showing you some TV
and film locations you can go take a
photo at so the first one is on Perry
Street and you might recognize it from
Sex in the City this is actually the
film does the exterior or Carrie
Bradshaw's apartment
so grab your best friend go have a
little Sex in the City photo shoot and
it'll be epic and awesome and we had a
lot of fun doing it
next stand on the corner of Bedford and
Grove Street and you might recognize
this exterior from the television show
friends I absolutely love doing this
kind of stuff when I travel because I
just think it's so much fun you can take
really fun photos and get kind of
creative with it next up is Mongolia
bakery if you're a Sex in the City fan
you'll recognize this but just in
general they have a really good sweet
treats I like to call them I guess I
don't know cupcakes pies my favorite is
the banana pudding that's like something
I would recommend to anyone even if
you're not a banana lover like for some
reason it's just really good if you want
to shop all you have to do is walk up
and down Bleecker Street it's super easy
not much to really say here besides that
they have all of the main shops down
that Street it makes it super easy to
walk in and out even just window shop
for a classic New York fight head over
to Joe's pizza this place is iconic it's
been around for so long it's been
serving the classic New York slice of
pizza for over 37 years it's delicious
it's kind of like a perfect thing to
just grab and go especially if you're
touring around the city you want
something easy and quick and this is a
bonus and it's delicious but that's it
for my videos today I really hope you
guys enjoyed it if you did be sure to
give it a thumbs up especially if you
like this series and let me know in the
comments below we're in New York I
should take you to next so yeah I think
that's it so thank you again for
watching and I will see you next week
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
