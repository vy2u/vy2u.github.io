to be another New York City guide and if
you didn't see my last video about this
we filmed in Dumbo Brooklyn so be sure
to check that out but as you can tell we
are in the Soho this time and Patrick
and I spend a lot of time in Southall
because as you will see shopping is a
huge part of it so we narrow down some
of our favorite spots it's hard to
narrow it down because there's so many
but these are ones that I definitely
think you should visit if you are coming
here and want to go to Soho be sure to
give it a thumbs up if you want more of
this series and yeah let's get started
Soho is a neighborhood in Manhattan
filled with great shopping awesome art
galleries and pretty unique buildings
you'll find Soho in southern Manhattan
below Greenwich Village and since Soho
stands for south of Houston Street you
will find the heart of this neighborhood
between Houston Street and Canal Street
what's pretty cool about this place is
it's one of the few surviving cast iron
districts meaning a lot of the buildings
are built out of cast iron it has a
super unique look to it so I definitely
stop by if you're in town it's a
must-see
but now Patrick and I are going to show
you some of our favorite spots here
starting off with for something to do
and that's definitely shopping on
Broadway you're going to find a lot of
the shops that you're familiar with and
that you'd want to go to but what's
really cool about Soho is all these
shops are kind of lined up and down this
one street or at least the main ones are
so it makes it super convenient
especially if you're traveling here and
unfamiliar with the area they're all
kind of lined up and down so it makes it
really easy to do some shopping hang out
with friends and family and just go to a
bunch of different stores they have so
many here some of my favorites are
Sephora Topshop Reformation HTM forever
21
Urban Outfitters All Saints the list
goes on they're just so many here and
what's cool is if you go on the off
streets on so on like Mercer Prince
Street you'll find something a little
bit more of a high-end shop system of my
favorite are like Paige denim Free
People
so they've literally have everything
here but also a pro tip for you guys is
finding somewhere to use the restroom in
Soho unless you go out to eat
there isn't any except for on
Bloomingdale's on the second floor for
brunch you have to go to Jack's wife
Frieda not only is it one of our
favorites but it's a lot of people's
favorites when I first move
here this is something that a lot of
people told me to go to when I was in
Soho and it's pretty amazing I have to
say it lives up to its reputation super
good the food is amazing lots of
different options and very unique
options to which I love a little tip for
you though go on a weekday we that's the
only time we usually go there because
the weekends fill up so quickly but if a
sit-down is not your thing and you want
to just keep it moving something for a
quick bite is called the smile to go
what's really awesome about this is if
you can just grab and go it's like a
little cafe but they have a lot of
different foods and we've gone to the
actual smile restaurant and it's really
good we tried this and loved it it's
just really convenient and easy just to
grab something you guys know me and my
love for Instagram so I always got to
show you guys a good photo opportunity
so this is definitely on the side street
so when you're on Broadway head over go
down on like Prince
Howard Mercer all of this is over here's
where you're going to see all those cast
iron buildings really prominently
because it's not as busy as Broadway it
makes for really good cute photos you
can take some bunch of different outfit
post whatever your little heart desires
you can do it here I just think it's
really cool and unique and a lot of the
times I post photos on here a lot of you
guys are like oh my god I love it so a
little tip for you go on the side
streets they're less busy and look
really pretty for a healthy meal one of
our favorites is called Chuck point
kitchen it's open for brunch lunch and
dinner and this place is just so good
food is amazing and inside it's just
really really cute it has this kind of
like homestyle feel to it it's super
cozy they have Polaroids all over the
place
but what I did want to mention about
this place it has a huge menu so if
you're vegetarian vegan gluten-free they
have a lot of options for all of you
which is why I really wanted to include
this super big menu really good I think
my favorite is definitely the Brussels
sprouts they flavor them so well and
then the radish toast is really really
good but I definitely wanted to tell you
guys about this place because it has a
lot of options for everybody and if you
are into or if you're of age or like a
good cocktail they make amazing ones
here and later at night they have a
downstairs that's really fun to go grab
a drink at so I definitely wanted to
mention that as well
for the artistic like I mentioned in the
beginning Soho is filled with art
galleries it's very prominent here I
know I mentioned a lot of shopping but
they do have a lot of great art
galleries our favorite is the word Nast
gallery and you're probably thinking you
have a favorite art gallery but I think
it's our favorite because we're a little
biased because Patrick actually has a
few of his photos hanging in here so we
love stopping by and just checking out
the new work because we know a few other
people in here that he's met and it's
just really fun so if you want to stop
by and see his stuff you can go there
now I can't go a whole video without
telling you where to get a sweet treat
so I have to the first stop is a lottery
you might have heard of this place it's
kind of like a famous sweet treat plate
place specifically for their macaroons
they have really really good ones here
but it's really cool to kind of come
here and just take a break if you've
been shopping all day I have some tea
and macaroons my favorite is to stash oh
do you have a favorite I don't know I
think they're all amazing but that's my
favorite but if that's not your thing
you can go over to Georgetown Cupcake
for a cupcake if you're into TLC or the
Food Network or anything like that this
place has been all over that so me and
me being a foodie I have to go check it
out but they really do have good
cupcakes my favorite in case you're
curious is a red velvet do you have a
favorite cupcake because that's always
been my favorite
and lastly where to stay if you're
visiting New York and you're looking for
a place to stay specifically in Soho one
of my recommendations would be no mo
Soho it's freaking cute but I've also
had a lot of friends that have stayed
here and the rooms are great they're
amazing they're really pretty the
decoration is awesome as you can see but
it's a New York room the rooms aren't
like crazy big or anything but in
specific why I like this place is it's
located right in the center of Soho like
it's a block away from Broadway it's
perfect if you're just kind of traveling
here and you don't really know where to
go um but also if you're not staying
here and have another place to stay
just come here anyways because of this
really cool domed green wall that they
haven't take a photo because I love it
but off my video for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it be sure to subscribe
so you don't miss out on any of my other
videos and I will see you guys next week
