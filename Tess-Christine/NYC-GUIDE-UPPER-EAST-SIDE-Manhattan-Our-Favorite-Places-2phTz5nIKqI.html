channel today's video is going to be a
New York City guide and I love these
type of videos because I know that you
guys really enjoy them when you guys
travel here you find them very helpful
so I love to upload videos that I know
you guys really like so today's video is
going to be the Upper East West Side I
kind of combined them because I wanted
to be honest with you guys and tell you
that Pat and I don't spend a crazy
amount of time up here therefore we
don't know a ton of like super unique
spots but we show you around the stuff
that like you should see it's kind of
touristy but it's definitely like if
you're visiting New York you should go
to Central Park type of stuff but you
guys will see we show you guys some cool
spots and we'll definitely keep you busy
so I really hope you guys find this
helpful don't forget that I already made
it in New York City guide for Soho
Greenwich Village and Dumbo so be sure
to check those out and yeah that's it so
let's go ahead and get into the video
the Upper East Side is definitely a
must-see when traveling to New York City
because it's incredibly beautiful and it
will keep you and your wallets very busy
located on the east side parallel to
Central Park it has some of the best
views architecture and shopping which is
why it is one of the most affluent areas
of the city so I'm going to show you
guys some of the must-sees while you're
up here okay so of course starting off
with something to do and that is Central
Park but a little tip for you start at
the Plaza Hotel on 59th Street not only
is it just like an iconic hotel and
really pretty but it's very picturesque
over here so it makes for great photo
opportunities this area is always
awesomely decorated for the holidays but
it also gives you a perfect access to
Central Park so it's just like a direct
walk in so it makes it super easy and
then you'll eventually make your way to
something called the mall which is like
that long strip of road with all the
trees it's probably been in every
rom-com that you've ever seen but it's
really pretty and then you'll keep
walking down that and then you'll lead
to Bethesda Fountain and terrace and
they always have awesome street
performers here they have the bubble guy
which is really cool they also have the
boat house which Pat and I over the
summer took boats out and that was
really fun
basically this area is just perfect to
spend a really nice day with friends and
family you can take cute photos walk
around one of the best things about
Central Park is that everywhere you turn
you find something new like a new
sculpture or a new like pond or fountain
or little area and it's just really
really pretty for a famous favorite head
over to serendipity 3 this has been
talked about for so long now it's
definitely a popular restaurant for
their frozen hot chocolate that's kind
of what they're famous for it's really
good they also have a great menu it's
huge so everybody's gonna find something
that they like I've been coming here
since I've been 16 for his traveling to
New York with my grandma first with me
and it was so much fun so I definitely
would recommend coming here keep in mind
there's gonna be a wait so try lunchtime
like we did now this area is definitely
for the shopaholics because on Madison
and Fifth Avenue it is just full of
shops every shop you can think of also a
lot of the upscale shops so Barney's
Saks Fifth Avenue for Dorf Goodman
Tiffany's you can have a little
Breakfast at Tiffany's moment if you
want to but window shopping here is
great everything is so pretty walking in
and out of these things to kill time
let's say it's raining who knows but
it's definitely something I wanted to
mention because this area is just known
for the shopping and the upscale shops
that they have now a shopping isn't your
thing this area has no shortage of
museums the most common are the Met and
the Guggenheim so the Met is great
because if you've been walking around
Central Park the steps are a great way
to rest your feet but also the men
inside is huge they have such amazing
exhibits my favorite is when they have
the special edition fashion ones but you
can spend days in here this place is
huge it's perfect for if you're
traveling here in one day it rains you
can spend a whole day in here and you'll
get lost and it's amazing
now I couldn't go a whole New York City
guide without telling you where to get
something sleep so you can go to the
famous Dylan's Candy Bar and this is
another place that's just massive over
here it's just full of candy every type
of candy you could possibly think of
this is perfect for families or give
younger siblings they have candy in the
steps they have a cafe a fudge bar just
everything this place is great for
souvenirs I always found that buying
gifts for people from here is a great
way to kind of bring something back for
somebody and another cool thing is that
they have a famous favorite a lot of the
celebrities have been here so you can
kind of creep and see your favorite
celebrity and what their favorite candy
is for all of you Gossip Girl fans at
the Upper East Side was the backdrop for
a lot of the show so it's fun to
recreate some of the areas that they
filmed at the Met steps is a huge one
and this one is always really fun to
recreate the Palace Hotel is another and
is so beautiful in general Gossip Girl
fan or not if you're here over the
holidays you have to go because they
decorate it so beautifully for the
holiday season it's just awesome I mean
look at the tree it's beautiful and then
last is the Empire Hotel and Patton I
stayed here once and then pretty sure
they have Gossip Girl themed drinks
which is awesome but since the Empire is
on the Upper West Side for dinner or for
brunch go across the street to the Smith
this is a restaurant that has something
for pretty much everyone so you're good
to go with that it's delicious and it's
are always our go-to when we have
visitors
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys liked it if you did
and liked this series be sure to give it
a thumbs up and let me know in the
comments below we're in New York I
should take you to next because believe
it or not there's still so much more to
see so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this and I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
