one this one is definitely something
that I would wear the most just because
it involves a lot of simple pieces and I
switch it up all the time whether it's
the top the hat the shoes whatever it
just involves very simple pieces so
starting off with my shoes I'm just
wearing some converse and I've been
loving wearing converse converse just in
the summer especially in New York when
you're walking all over the place these
are like a must-have so I love the
all-black ones just because they go with
a lot of things but I also love the
white ones as well then for my shorts
I'm just wearing some high-waisted
shorts from ASOS and love high-waisted
shorts they're definitely like my staple
essential in the summer for my top that
is also from ASOS I love wearing crop
tops you guys know this it gets so hot
in New York so these are always like
awesome for me and then for my hat that
is from an F and it's just kind of like
a beach straw hat and then my purse is
from Chloe and I just tied a scarf on
that from Urban Outfitters
moving on to outfit number two this one
includes a romper and you guys know by
now rompers are the bomb you just have
to throw them on and you're like good to
go I asked you guys on Instagram what
you like to wear in the summer and a lot
of people said rompers so I thought it
would include one of my favorites
this one is from Lulu's but the brand is
a mink pink and I love it I love the
color this is kind of been my go-to
color this summer I just think it's
really pretty
but in specific I love the embroidery on
this and the details the drapey sleeves
has just been like one of my favorites
um so I have a bunch of rompers get on
your wear them all the time and then how
I styled it is I wore it with just some
basic white sneakers and these have been
my jam this summer I think they're in
three outfits in this video but I wear
them literally every day they're just so
easy those are from Fri definitely
invest in a good pair because you'll
wear them all the time even with dressy
stuff I promise you and then for my bag
I just wore a simple brown one from
Nasty Gal and then for my sunglasses
they're just some weird ones from Ray
Ban you're in the Saudia laughing you
son
everywhere lost in the ocean Scott for
outfit number three this involves at one
of my favorite trends right now I wear
this so much if you called me on
Instagram you know that I wear neck
scarves with pretty much everything so
it involves that I love the tan ones
they just go with a lot of stuff that's
kind of a trend in this video is just
get stuff that goes with everything
because saves you money but you can get
that at like Urban Outfitters I found
mine it like a vintage shop they sell
bandanas all over the place now and then
I wore mine with just a denim dress this
one is from Lulu's I like it it's orange
it's bright it's perfect for summer
again just easy to throw on and then of
course I paired it with my white
sneakers because you can't go wrong with
that and it pulled in the white from the
scarf and I just thought it balanced
everything really nicely
outfit number four includes another one
of my favorite things I love look books
because they kind of just showcase
things that I'm wearing all the time but
this one off the shoulder tops you guys
know I rock those all the time they're
just so nice they're perfect for the
summer because they keep you super cool
and I don't know I just really like it
but this one in specific I thought I
would showcase because it reminded me of
a watermelon it was super colorful you
can get these type of tops all over the
place this one in specific is from a
store called store Rev but I buy off the
shoulder tops from like ASOS Nasty Gal
forever 21 they have them all over the
place now and then I just wore that with
some basic Levi's denim shorts I bought
mine from Urban Outfitters super comfy
they go with everything and then for the
top I just wore some layered necklaces
from various of different places and
then for my shoes those are from Ray the
label often for evolved clothing I
really like them a lot along with my
sunglasses I think the brand is called
illest diva hope I said that right
and for the last outfit you can't go
wrong with just a basic t-shirt and Jean
shorts the summertime you don't have to
dress up all the time it's fun to just
go out like this sometimes and I think
it still looks really cute so in my case
I wore a cropped t-shirt this one is a
vintage one from Tommy Hilfiger I buy
all of these off the side Frankie's
collective it's super awesome but I like
the bright yellow color and then tip for
you if you have a cropped t-shirt wear a
bando under it I'm just wearing a white
one but I think it's really pretty when
it kind of like peeks through if it ever
like you put your arms up or anything
like that and it's not like it's your
bra so I think it looks super good and
then for my high-waisted shorts those
are the same ones from ASOS along with
my belt and also my glasses I've been
really loving this right now and I just
love them those are also from ASOS and
then my shoes again are just the white
sneakers
but that's it for my video today I
