about how I look like Harry Styles and
I'm me not him although the guy has
great style I was in Charlotte over
Halloween with some friends so they were
like oh we should have pretend to be
your bodyguard they put like these fake
earpieces in and we walked it to the VIP
area and they obviously thought I looked
enough like him too like oh come right
