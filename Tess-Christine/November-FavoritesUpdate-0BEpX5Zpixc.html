again and this time I promise I'm back
it's not a pretend I'm back like I was
my last video I think I said I'm back
yay but I'm really I wasn't really I was
sadly mistaken and I thought I was gonna
have way more time to film and I just
didn't and I didn't have my computer so
I couldn't upload but I am NOT going to
go into all of that because I just want
to let you know that I'm back in to the
United States so I am back for Christmas
break until I go back to my University
for school and January so I'm back for a
while now I just flew back into the
United States a couple days ago and I'm
extremely exhausted so sorry for my
throat sounds weird my nose is all
stuffy I'm kind of coming down with a
cold or something my I haven't been
getting very good sleep with the time
change it's hard to adjust back so but I
promised I would film for you guys I
announced on Twitter that I was back and
I was just gonna suck it up through the
jetlag and film for you guys which I'm
doing so I'm gonna do today's video is
going to be a November favorites yes a
November favorites and I know it's been
my last video was August favorites so
that just says how long I've been gone
and I just figured I'd come out with a
November favorites I don't have a lot of
stuffing or a lot of new stuff because I
was gone and so I didn't have like a lot
of time to go out and find new products
and all that stuff for what I'm loving
but so it's a it's a really short
favourites video but I did want to make
this video for you because not only
because I told you I would but also to
have you guys make requests I know I'm
gonna continue with my Vampire Diaries
series and all that kind of stuff
doesn't know you guys really liked that
and wanted me to do that so I will do
that one but I wanted to ask you guys
what else you want to see I've been out
of the loop for four months with this
whole YouTube thing so I don't know what
you guys have seen have have people been
doing on YouTube I don't know any of
that I haven't watched anything so I
don't know what's going on in the
YouTube world right now so please tell
me what you want to see like I said I'll
do the Vampire Diaries but I just want
to know what you want to see from me and
sorry if the lighting is going in and
out too I'm using
natural lighting I'm trying to figure
out where I'm gonna start filming now
because my normal background is a little
bit changed and I got a lot of comments
on my last video saying that they messed
my old background and so I thought I
would show you what my old background
looks like now because I feel like you
guys should see it and know the reason
why I can't film there until the summer
so I will show you that right now
so this is my old background that you
guys are used to and it is covered in
snow and I'm gonna make this really
quick because it's freezing out here but
I wanted to show you guys why I can't
film out here anymore because I don't
know if you guys can see my breath but
it is like zero degrees outside right
now so I'm a he missed super quick
because I already have a cold but yeah
so this is really sad because I loved
this background and it was so nice I
don't know one simple to have and it was
really pretty but I mean it's still
pretty if you guys aren't used to snow
but it's freezing and I hate it so I'm
gonna go back inside but I'm glad I got
to show you that but yeah I'm gonna get
right into the favor so you're sorry for
that long intro I feel like I hadn't
talked to you guys in forever so I feel
like I had to kind of explain myself but
okay so my first favorite is a clothing
item and it's something that I've been
loving not only for November but ever
since it started getting cold out so
like octobrush through November and now
all the time are big chunky sweaters and
I'm wearing one right now and I got this
one at H&amp;amp;M it's just like an open big
chunky sweater and I have two other ones
here right now just to show you I got
this one at River Island for those of
you in the UK still and then this one's
from American Eagle I think I think
they're super comfortable for the winter
I just love wearing them they're so
comfy and just so warm and so I've been
absolutely loving these for November and
I will continue loving these through
December as well so you'll be seeing
that a lot I can do a whole fashion
video if you want I bought a lot of
sweaters and I was over in the UK and
don't worry I will do a haul it's just
gonna be a massive haul because I bought
a lot of stuff when I was over there so
I have to do a haul video and I'll try
them all all the stuff on for you and
all that stuff but I can do a fashion
video for like winter because the last
one I think I did was
so I could do like a winter one I know I
kind of missed fall but I can do a
winter one so I'll do that soon another
thing for I guess not I'm like makeup
items are is the hand food the soap and
glory hand food hand cream again I was
mistaken I guess last video I thought
that you could only get this in the UK
but apparently get them in the States
I haven't seen them so that's why I
assumed that you could only get them in
the UK maybe they're just way more
popular there but I absolutely love this
so if you know I think I heard somebody
say target sells them I'm not for sure
but let me know if you know where they
sell these because I would love to get
more I brought some back but if I knew
where to buy them here that would be way
more convenient so what I love about
this hand cream is that it is non greasy
and it is so moisturizing it leaves your
hands so smooth and I actually really
really like the smell some people says
it smells like baby powder but well like
my friends and stuff but I think it
smells really good and I really like it
a lot and I keep saying really really
like and you guys got on me for that in
my last favorites video I'm sorry I
don't know what other word to use I'll
just say I don't know I'll find
something else to say instead of really
like but I love this product another
thing for lotions is a face lotion and
it's the Saint Tropez the lighting is
kind of it's an everyday moisturizer for
the face and mine is in light/medium and
it's a gradual tan the only thing that I
don't like about this is the smell it
smells very perfume me it's it smells
really really bad I don't like that part
about it at all but I think it works
really good it didn't break me out or
anything which I like because sometimes
self tanners on the face especially like
moisturizers can break me out so but it
doesn't and I like that the only thing I
would say that as a drawback of this
product is the smell and I got this at
Boots but I'm pretty sure you can get it
somewhere in the states I haven't found
it yet
remember I've gotten since August and I
just got back yesterday so forgive me
okay now on to makeup products what I
absolutely love I think it's my new
favorite foundation I still love the
Laura Mercier silk creme foundation but
I think my ultimate
it has to be the Makeup Forever HD
foundation and I would show you guys the
label but in a whole other story I was
on a train going to somewhere in England
and the nail polish bottle exploded all
over the bag that it was in and so got
nail polish all over this so I took nail
polish remover and I removed it and it
took off the label but anyways that's
that's just a little side note but it's
Make Up For Ever HD foundation the color
I am in is I can't even tell you because
I think I scrubbed away yeah I can't
even tell you what color I'm in because
I scrubbed away the thing so that sucks
if I ever figure it out I'll put it in
the bottom bar below but okay yeah love
this foundation it's not greasy again it
doesn't break me out what else do I like
about this foundation it shows up really
really well on camera it makes you look
flawless and I love that I just I love
this foundation overall it it's a little
pricey I think it's like 50 bucks for
this so it is very pricey for a
foundation I absolutely love it it's
lasted me when did I get this I got this
right before I left so I got this in the
beginning of August and I'm still using
it now so I mean it does last quite a
while I just use one pump and it covers
my face it it's a pump foundation the
last makeup favorite that I have for it
this month is a blush and it is a Mac
blush and I seriously have been wearing
this everyday I have it on now I've been
wearing it everyday
probably since October I'm not joking
it's well dressed by Mac and it is such
a nice subtle color and it's just a
light pink color it's really really
pretty and I it goes well on almost all
skin tones I absolutely love this color
it's a subtle pink so it looks like it
looks kind of bright but it's really not
that bright promise that is all of my
product favorite I do have a song
favorite for this month and for all my
England viewers my song favorite for the
month is
of November is by one direction what
makes you beautiful I absolutely love
that song it's such a catchy tune and me
and my friends love dancing to it when
we were in England and so I bought the
CD while I was over there and I am
bringing it back here so all my friends
here can listen to them if you haven't
heard of One Direction you should go
YouTube them they have a music video for
the song that I'm talking about and they
are just so adorable they're so cute I
just love their music it's just so
upbeat and fun I really really hope you

short and sweet and there wasn't a whole
lot of new favorites that you haven't
