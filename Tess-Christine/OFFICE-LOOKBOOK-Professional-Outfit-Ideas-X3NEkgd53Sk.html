channel today's video as you can tell is
a long-awaited one and that is a work
place outfits outfits for your work
professional-looking outfit I don't know
you guys get it I'm really excited for
this video I got a lot of ideas for it
from you guys
not only when I asked you for some
things that you like to wear at work or
that you have to wear at work but also
in a lot of my look books and outfits of
the week a lot of you guys were saying
that you had 9 to 5 jobs and you can't
wear all of that stuff normally and you
wish that you could which I totally get
because all of my friends here in New
York are not youtubers they have
nine-to-five jobs and have to dress
professional so I got a lot of help from
them figuring out what to wear but then
also from you guys so I really hope I
tried my best you guys know that I do
this is a job so this is all kind of
stepping out the out-of-the-box for me
also shout-out to my friend Caitlin who
let me film in her office in New York
because I wanted to make it as authentic
as I could and I felt like I really fit
in there so I feel like I really nailed
these outfit obviously you can modify
them for your jobs I know that so many
different jobs have different dress
codes but I tried to make them very
versatile and you can reuse a lot of the
pieces it's really easy so I will have a
lot of there all of the stuff that I'm
wearing in the description box below
linked for you guys I really hope you
guys enjoy it so oh well alright oh I
got my hair nice probably notice already
but I cut and colored my hair a little
bit darker and it's a huge chop for me I
haven't cut it like this in a very long
time so I really hope you guys like it
I'm obsessed with it so yeah I'm gonna
be done talking now alright let's get
into the video okay so starting off with
outfit number one when I think of work
outfits the first thing that pops into
my head is a good pair of trousers
because they're so versatile and they
definitely pull an outfit together and
they're pretty much encouraged by like
every workplace so for my travel with
trousers in fact a lot of the pieces
that I'm wearing are from Lulu's it's
kind of a one-stop shop they have great
work wear pieces so that's where these
are from
and they're a neutral color again I like
to stick with neutrals because you can
enter change that through the week
next week you can make new outfits it's
a really really easy color so those are
just tan or like a salmony color for my
shirt I stuck with a white t-shirt you
can get these at like Target very basic
and again you can switch out the colors
and do really fun colors or stick with
neutrals and then over it I decided to
wear this coat again which is like as
thick as a sweater but not as thick as a
coat it kind of has a blazer field that
I love that it has pinstripes to add a
little pattern to it and then for my
shoes I just wore some black heel shoes
they're neutral but they're a little bit
more comfortable than stilettos
moving on to outfit number two this one
definitely has a little bit more of a
casual vibe because of the jacket but
this is honestly what I saw most of in
the office that I was filming at so I
definitely think it's okay so starting
off with the pants those are trousers
again they're a black color feel like
this is a staple
I love these ones from Lulu's because
they're tailored they have like a very
slim fit I just find them so flattering
the waist has like a gathering by it
that's just like so nice and comfortable
so I wear those and then again I just
stuck with a white t-shirt this is great
too because if you get hot during the
day it's still appropriate to take off
it's not like a tank top or anything so
I wore that and then for the jacket that
is just like a brown suede again like I
said I love sticking with neutrals but
if your office allows it you can totally
go with something more patterned or fun
colored but this one's great because
it's perfect for this time of year it's
fall you want to stick with this color
and you can interchange it with all your
fun fall outfits later on so then for
the shoes I love these these are from
Sam Edelman they kind of remind me of
the Chanel shoes these are much more
affordable
I love the toe on it but more
importantly I love how comfortable they
are
or outfit number three I wanted to
include a bottom that wasn't pants or
trousers so I looked for a pencil skirt
pencil skirts are really easy to come by
you can find them all over the place
again in black tan white even it just
depends on what you want I found this
one that's a faux suede material so it's
kind of stretchy you can kind of see it
moving on my body which means it's so
comfortable it's very very stretchy
surprisingly so so it doesn't constrict
your legs and it's easy to wear
throughout the day that is again from
Lulu's stuck with the neutral color
because I love that it just goes with
everything but I decided to change it up
a little bit with the top and wait for a
pattern so I have this one it's a maroon
color with polka dots I think it's so
pretty has kind of like a gathering at
the front with a tie that kind of hangs
down I just find it to be a very
flattering shirt especially when tucked
into something like this that's so tight
because it drapes over the top which is
just a very flattering look in general
and then for the shoes I originally was
gonna pair another pair of heels with
this but then I remembered I had these
black loafers which I feel like loafers
is such a staple work shoe
these ones I purchased from Frye they're
definitely more expensive so if you want
to invest in something that you can wear
all the time go ahead but they sell
these similar type of shoe everywhere
and I just think it looks so good with
pretty much everything okay so for this
next look I think this is my favorite
just because I love the tones of it but
I want to talk about the top because the
other outfits that I paired with
trousers I paired with t-shirts but this
is like more of a fitted long-sleeve
almost like turtleneck top which i think
is perfect for this time of year because
it's fall it's a great layering piece I
love the color of this one it's taupe
it's just a really really pretty but I
like how it has kind of like that
striped detail on it to give it a little
bit of texture and how I styled this was
obviously tucking it into trousers I
used the same ones that I used before in
black but this time in Navy they're just
so comfy and be and can be styled with
pretty much anything and then for the
shoes I just stuck with the same strappy
block heel sandal but if you're not a
heels person or you just don't like
wearing heels at work you can totally
pair this like a nude flat and it would
look just as awesome
so then how I kind of jazzed it up a bit
is I wore these earrings from bauble bar
they're like a diamond looking
earing they're just kind of like that
statement piece that make your outfit
stand out without going over the top and
losing those simple pieces and lastly
for a casual Friday look I know a lot of
you guys commented saying you could wear
jeans and I even asked a couple of my
friends and they were jeans a lot to
work as well as long as they're not
crazy ripped or anything so I thought I
would show you guys how to style a work
outfit including jeans
so for my jeans I just wore some from
ASOS they're just like a dark blue kind
of high-waisted I just think that
they're really a classic Jean that you
can wear a bunch of different ways
that's kind of the trend with this video
I'm sound like a broken record but how I
styled it is again with just a basic
white tee like I said before you can
interchange that maybe do something
patterned and fun it's kind of all up to
your personality which i think is so fun
and then for my blazer that's from Zara
I love it it's again neutral it has this
like grey and brown tones and then for
my shoes I just wear some black booties
those are from tony bianco and i think
that black booties are a great way to
kind of still stay classy at work and I
know a lot of my friends wear them to
work as well so I just think overall
this is a really great look and perfect
for a casual Friday because you can go
out in it afterwards but that's my card
