friend Carrie I went to go visit her in
October in New York City I actually met
her online she has her own YouTube
channel so I was really excited that I
finally got to see her so while we were
there we decided to film an outfit of
the day for you guys now my outfit is
definitely more on the casual side I
thought I would keep it simple since we
were kind of exploring Central Park all
day so what I decided to wear it was
this jacket from denim and supply I
really liked it because it was still
kind of on the casual side as far as the
material goes but then the detail on it
was really kind of it stood out to me
and I really liked it so I decided to
pair it with kind of something simple so
what I did was I wore a white t-shirt
from Nasty Gal jeans from PacSun and my
purse from Rebecca Minkoff moving on to
the fabulous Miss Carrie her outfit is
so cute it just screams her personality
and love it so for her floppy hat
that's from Target her necklace is from
loft and also her blouse is from loft
her crazy purple vest which I love is
from DKNY her watch is from Michael Kors
and her purse is from monae the adorable
little booties with the buckles on the
side those are from Zara and that is it
for her outfit I'm gonna have her
channel linked in the description box
below you guys have to go check her out
she's usually the nicest sweetest girl
ever you will not regret it I love her
to death I had the most amazing time in
New York City with her she has made it
the best time ever so like I said go
check out her channel also a special
thanks to Patrick for helping us film
