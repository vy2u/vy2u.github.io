we just kind of drove around and
explored Minnesota so we found some
horses got coffee it was just a really
fun day but it's also been a crazy warm
so I just decided to wear like a tank
top and jeans shorts so for my top I've
had this I think I bought this in the
springtime
it's from revolve clothing I just like
how it ties at the bottom I just think
it kind of adds it get different Flair
to just like a normal tank top and I
love the floral print so with that I
just wore some basic high-waisted shorts
you know these are my favorite they're
from ASOS I think they're called the mom
short and then with it I just wore a big
statement buckle belt and that is from
Urban Outfitters and then for my sandals
I've been loving new Steve Madden ones
because I packed it only brought like
two shoes so you'll see those a lot on
Tuesday Pat and I decided to go to the
quarry's which is basically just like a
giant it body of water that everybody
just kind of swims in it's super fun we
used to do this at college all the time
so we just kind of went to explore it
this day so what I decided to wear was
just an off the shoulder top this one
I've been loving it's from Reformation I
just love the ties on it I love that
it's white white is one of my favorite
colors to wear in the summer just
because I think it makes you look super
tan and then of course I wore the same
high-waisted shorts it's a trend I'm
pretty sure I wear them the next day too
don't judge me and then for my shoes
those are from Frye they're just basic
slip ons
on Wednesday Pat and I met up with some
friends in the cities and just kind of
explored about one of the things that I
featured in the travel blog was
Minnehaha Falls which is just super
pretty so what I decided to wear it this
day was just kind of like this basic tee
but what I absolutely love about it is
the lace-up detailing on I just think
it's super pretty and as kind of like an
edgy look to it so that is from express
love it and then yes the high-waisted
shorts you guys get it by now it's
whatever I promised I packed another
pair and then for my shoes those are
just some black booties from Target and
I also switched into like just some
basic black sandals from Target ooh on
the case I was like over the heels
Thursday we were in Wisconsin now
remember this was a span over two weeks
so some of the days are kind of mixed up
as far as if we were in Wisconsin or
Minnesota but we were at this place
called the pizza farm it's awesome we
used to go there when I was little and I
just loved it so what I decided to wear
this day was very simple and whoa I'm
indifferent jean shorts this is amazing
I literally washed these two jean shorts
non-stop because I just wore them all
the time so those are from Urban
Outfitters they're Wrangler jeans I love
them and then with it I decided to wear
a gray tank top and that is from Topshop
and then you know I love my next scarves
so I just wore this one that I bought at
the vintage shop in Dumbo that I showed
you guys in my travel vlog and then for
my shoes I just wore the Steve Madden
sandals because they're the bomb and I
definitely recommend them so yeah
Friday okay so this is a bonus clip this
isn't in my travel blog but I thought I
would share it because we went to a
winery with my family and it was really
fun we got to go through basically and
just kind of tour it and it was really
pretty and gosh drank yummy why so what
I wore this day was this dress which I
absolutely love it's from ribald
and I just think it's really pretty with
the ruffles and the blue color and the
print on it I just thought it was
perfect for where we were going and you
already know I took photos and posted on
Instagram so I love it and it's just
kind of like a perfect summer dress and
then again I wore them with the Steve
Madden sandals Saturday was a really fun
day because we kind of just chilled at
my cabin and did stuff that I did when I
was growing up so we made smores chilled
by the river and just kind of hung out
with family so what I decided to wear
was an off-the-shoulder top again it was
really warm so these are perfect this
one is from ASOS I love the print on it
I love the flare out sleeves I just
think it looks really pretty and then I
screwed up when I was filming this I
actually didn't wear these shorts I wore
the Wrangler ones um but I'm kind of
like showing you guys how to like pack
through this is I really only brought
like two pairs of jean shorts two pairs
of shoes because I'm wearing the Steve
Madden sandals again and then just a
bunch of different tops to kind of mix
in and lastly Sunday was just a relaxing
day we just chilled by his lake weight
on the hammock uh just did normal
everyday things so what I decided to
wear this day it was just like a basic
top and this one is from ASOS I thought
this one was perfect it's just kind of
like a t-shirt tank top type of thing
they sell so many of these basic tops
tears that's where I get all of mine and
then again I just wore at the
high-waisted denim shorts with a big
buckle belt to kind of like I don't know

outfit and I literally didn't wear shoes
