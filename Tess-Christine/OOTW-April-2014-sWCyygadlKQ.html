another outfits of the week video I
decided that I'm gonna do these monthly
because I thought they would be really
fun and I got an overwhelming amount of
positive feedback on my last one so yes
although next month I am gonna change it
up a bit and actually take you with me
to the places that I go because I
thought that would be more interesting
than a white wall but yeah if you are
interested in this video then of course
just keep on watching
starting out with Monday this was a very
very chill day I wore jeans and t-shirt
but this t-shirt is so cool because it's
like a play off of Nike Air you get it
but it's from Nasty Gal and my jeans are
from PacSun moving on to Tuesday I
couldn't be as chill as Monday but my
style in general is pretty relaxed but I
did have to look a little bit nicer so I
just wore this quilted sweatshirt
sweater type thing from Target and then
these really fun floral printed shorts
that are really flowy and comfortable
and those are from Urban Outfitters and
then for my shoes I wear these really
cool sandals from Nasty Gal I love them
Wednesday was an editing day for me and
I had to run some errands and it was
also kind of chilly so I had to dress a
little bit warmer so for my outfit I
wore these pants they're the American
Apparel's disco pants or leggings type
thing super comfy and they totally
change up your outfit in my opinion and
then for my shoes I wear these awesome
booties from Windsor I love them and
then for my mint sweater that's from H&amp;amp;M
for Thursday I had to go shopping for my

with friends that night so for my outfit
super casual and comfy I just wore this

booties from pepper Mayo and then for my
hair I just threw it up in a topknot

night and then went out for drinks
afterwards so I wanted to look kind of
nice so all I wore was this white skirt

it's so cute in my opinion and then for
my
I wore this gray speckled sweater crop
top type thing from Nasty Gal and then
for my shoes I wear these black strappy
sandals from forever 21 and yeah that's
it
