channel today's video is going to be an
outfit of the week video and I know you
guys love these basically what they are
is I just show you a week of my life in
outfits and I show you what I wore so
this video is in collaboration with
muumuus so a lot of the pieces you're
going to be seeing are from Lulu's comm
so I will have all of that in the
description box below you know I love
them so I'm really excited to show you
guys these outfit so let's get started
okay so Monday was a travel day and we
were traveling at to Nashville this day
so this is what I watched the airport
starts off with the top which is by far
my favorite thing and I've learnt so
much already since filming this video
that is from Lulu's I love the cut of it
I love to open part on the neck I think
that's so awesome and it goes with a lot
of things so how I styled that is I just
tucked it into some high-waisted shorts
which are from ASOS and then I just wore
some grey and slide on mules which are
from revolve and then of course my
favorite hat which is from a lack of
color I love it so I wore that just
because I have that with me and I could
pack it but I thought it looked nice and
wish the outfit regardless
she was saying with our first day in
Nashville so we decided to do some
exploring and I wanted to wear something
that was very easy it was also very hot
this day so I thought this dress from
Lula's would be perfect I love the
prints of it
strikethrough just kind of my gym right
now and I love that it's off the
shoulder but what I think is really cool
about it is the unique sleeves which are
least big bow sleeves which I think it
makes it really stand out and I just
love it so how I styled out was they
basically just left on its own and I
just flipped on some shoes - same ones
from revolve very easy
I added some gold necklaces which are
from Maria Pascale and that's it so
super easy outfit like I said perfect
for the spring in the summer Wednesday
was our second day in Nashville and
regional are walking around this day so
I wanted to wear something easy again so
one of my go-to looks through the spring
and summer is just a tank top and shorts
or tank top and jeans it's just really
easy so my tank top that I'm wearing is
from Lulu's I love this in specific
because it has texture and I find that I
try something that is pretty simple
having stuff with texture makes it stand
out so this is like a knit material
another thing that's really cool is that
it ties where the straps are which I
think looks so cool I got so many
compliments on this top I just love it
so how I filed it was I detected into
into some basic denim shorts from a
girlfriend denim I wore the same slides
as before I know I have to consolidate I
was packing and then again I wore the
same lack of color hat I just think it
tied in all nicely especially with my
friend from fringe bag from Windsor
Thursday was another day in Nashville
but it was raining this day so we spent
a lot of our time indoors so again I
wore something a pretty simple but this
bodysuit can we talk about it it's
probably loose I love it like my new
favorite thing the color of it is
amazing it's like this mauve color which
I don't have a lot of folks really
excited to add it to my wardrobe but I
love the cutout details of this the lace
up on the side of the low back I just
think it was so good and you can wear it
so many different ways so since it was
rainy O's a little bit colder this day
so I just wore some high-waisted denim
jean which are from Sandro and then for
my shoes those are some losses as well
about the brand of Steve Madden they're
just black booties they're amazing I
wear them all the time and then I just
wore the same Maria Pascal necklaces
Friday we were back in in New York City
and this is a day that was kind of
playing catch up running errands but it
was also beautiful out so we wanted to
some a day outside it also while walking
through the park doing that full fun
stuff so I wanted to wear something that
again with easy bail so breezy so I just
cut it through her a dress this one's
from Louise I love it it's the black
flip dress but it's awesome because you
can dress it up or down I actually wore
this on a night out with some heels and
it looks amazing but I decided to go to
more casual route this time and just
wear it with an oversized denim jacket
from Topshop and some converse kept it
really simple again or the same gold
necklaces and I was good to go out the
door I love this type of stuff because
like I said you can dress it up or down
but keep it really simple
Saturday one of our favorite things to
do is go to brunch so that's what we did
and this is what I wore I love this
outfit I honestly think this might be my
favorite because of the jeans I love a
good pair of denim jeans but you know me
and my embroidery obsession right now
and these have little cactuses
embroidered into them and I just think
they're so cute perfect for the spring
and summer you wear anything with it in
kind of kind of adds a little bit of a
flare such ending is so cool so how I
wore that is I just wore a bodysuit
which is from revolve and then I just
drew on an over shirt which honestly
account easy to remember but just
because it was a little bit windy as you
can tell so I just kind of tied that in
because I felt the colors match really
well and then again I wore the same
black booties on which are from Lulu's
my favorite they go with everything and
then again with my necklaces pretty
self-explanatory pretty easy it's just
kind of my go-to look right now for the
springtime
Sunday was another a beautiful day in
the city so Pat and I decided to spend
the day outside and go to the farmers
market so this is what I decided to wear
it was a very spring inspired as you can
tell there's floral there's color which
if you know me you know that I don't
experiment with bright colors very much
when it comes to my clothing so these
mules are step out of the box so these
are from Lulu's and I'm obsessed with
them there's there's this mustard yellow
color and they add the most perfect pop
of color to so many things all of my
dark winter wardrobe looks so good with
it
so what I decided to style it with was
just some high-waisted denim shorts and
then I tucked in this floral top and I
kind of loosely unbuttoned it and had
like a brawl at under it was very casual
but I thought that the floral went
really well with the yellow mules and
the whole thing just tied together very
well and which is very spring the best
thing for my videos today I really hope
