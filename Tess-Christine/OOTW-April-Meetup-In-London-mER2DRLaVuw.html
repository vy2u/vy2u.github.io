outfit of the week video and I don't
usually intro these like this but I have
a couple things to tell you the first
being I didn't film this normally like
how I film vlog style outfit of the
weeks I just kind of spaced and I know a
lot of you guys love outfit of the week
video so I definitely wanted to get one
up for this month plus I had a bunch of
new locations to film so I thought it
would be really fun I kind of did more
of a stylized version than a blog style
but I can definitely go back to doing
blog style the next month if you guys
really like that too second which I'm
super excited to tell you guys is that
I'm having my first ever meet up at
beautycon London and I'm so excited
about this because like I said I've
never done a meet-up before and I'm
super fortunate that it's gonna be
international so I'm gonna be at
beautycon London I will have all the
dates times it's coming up this month or
this coming month in May so have all the
dates the times the links all that kind
of stuff to win my meetup is when I can
meet you guys where all that fun stuff
so I'm really looking forward to meeting
some of you guys I really hope I get to
hug a lot of you guys because I've never
done this before so I'm really really
excited as I hope you guys are too and
I'm really looking forward to doing more
meetups in the future so don't be sad if
you can't come to this one I'm gonna

so anyways yeah had to make a YouTube
video I announced now on my social media
but I wanted to tell you guys on YouTube
of course so you guys knew and had the
opportunity if you wanted to come
so yeah let's set it because let's get
into the video Monday self it was
definitely one of my favorites because I
got to wear overalls which I absolutely
am loving this trend I don't know about
you guys but I love them mine are from
Paige denim I love how they have mixed
patches on it so it's like a mix of
denim I think that's awesome
for my shoes I'm just wearing these
lace-up wedges from Nordstrom super
comfortable underneath my overalls I'm
wearing a white blouse from Topshop
along with some some
Tuesday's outfit is definitely one of my
go-to s because it looks super cute and
put together but it's actually really
cozy for my dress that is from Free
People and what I like to do is felt it
mine is just a belt from Target just
gives me a little bit more shape and I
paired it with an override oversized
sweater from American Eagle along with
my Stuart Weitzman a lowland boots
wednesday's outfit is super casual
perfect for just running around the city
which is exactly what I did so for the
outfit I just wore the simple gray
t-shirt from I don't even know where
Maya green bomber jacket that is from
Topshop and with it I decided to wear
some boyfriend jeans cuz they're super
comfortable mine are from gasps and then
for my shoes I just wore these oxford
shoes from Jeffrey Campbell they're
white and have little studs all over
them I think they're cool and add a
different touch to the outfit
Thursday apparently I was feeling very
Footloose inspired because that's what
this outfit reminds me of I just started
out by wearing some denim shorts from
denim and supply along with a white tank
top from Zara and some layered necklaces
from Windsor for my really fun fringe
jacket that is from Nasty Gal
and then I just wore some Brown boots
from Aldo Friday I went for a very clean
look
apparently it's kind of all white but my
favorite thing about this outfit is
definitely this blouse from hmm I love
the strikes on it and how flowy the
sleeves are for a little bit of color I
paired it with this clutch from Target
along with some white jeans from denim
and supply and then my all-time
favourite booties from Sam Edelman
saturday was my comfy-cozy / I brought
my blanket with me on my shoulders look
this jacket that I'm wearing is like one
of my favorites is this basically knit
coat and that is from revolve clothing I
paired it with just a simple white tea
from brandy melville along with a really
fun a choker necklace from Topshop for
my pants I just wore of some black
high-waisted jeans from a rag and bone
which are one of my favorites and then
for my shoes I wore these are really
awesome leather black heads and lastly
for Sunday I started out by wearing just
some simple blue jeans from PacSun and
my all-time favorite to converse which
are just the white ones and I paired it
with just a blouse from Zara that's
super flowy and comfortable along with
an All Saints leather jacket just for
some warmth but overall it's a super
casual look and then right now I've been
obsessed with these sunglasses I bought
both of the ones that I showed you at
Topshop recently but you can see the
brand here I love them and they're just
some gold Sony's
but that's my video for today I really
hope you guys liked it and found some
fashion inspiration for your own a week
of clothing thank you guys so much for
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video
