be an outfit of the week video if you
don't know what that means basically I
just pick a week out of the month and I
showed you guys my outfits
sometimes I combine them it just depends
I try to do these monthly and I do the
vlog style so it's a little bit more
personal so be sure to let me know if
you like it and let's get started
starting off with Monday one of the
things that I did this day was I babysat
this little cutie her name's Grayson
she's one of my good friends little girl
and she is just too cute not to put in a
video I kept my outfit pretty casual
like I usually do but I also decided to
throw in color which is actually super
rare for me in the wintertime but for my
boots these are just from Target they're
just lace-up combat boots I wore some
black high-waisted skinny jegging type
things from ASOS they're super
comfortable one of my favorites my
floral bomber jacket that is from Kohl's
at super-lightweight so it's awesome to
layer and then for my gray tank top
underneath that that is from made well
to keep warm when I go outside I'm just
wearing an olive green coat from forever
21 and my all-time favorite knit scarf
from Zara
moving on to Tuesday it was time to pack
my bags and head to the sunny Los
Angeles California
so I guess here's a little airport
fashion for you how I like to dress
obviously very comfortable my favorite
part of this whole outfit is definitely
this huge coat again I guess you would
call it just this big fluffy sweater
from Urban Outfitters I love it it's
like a blanket I'm so perfect for the
plane underneath that I'm just wearing a
black peplum top from Topshop some
high-waisted jeans from brandy melville
and then some black shoes from Target
and a bag from Aldo now on to Wednesday
when I was actually in LA for and that
was a shoe with a Windsor and we got to
shoot in all these amazing Coachella
inspire outfits that are coming soon I'm
so excited for you guys to see them but
what I was mainly wearing when I got
there was this romper and you guys a lot
of you guys commented on my blog and it
is from PacSun the Kendall + Kylie
collection I love prints like this for
accessories I pair it with a hat from
Regan bone and some booties from far
fetch
these next two days are actually
supposed to be combined but I wore two
different outfits so I thought I'd split
them up so it was back on a plane I
scooped up Patrick from Minnesota and we
were off to New York now here's some
more airport attire for you but I also
wanted to include this because I post my
Instagram with this sweater on and a lot
of you guys wanted to know where it's
from so starting with the sweater I
guess that is from Topshop I love how
it's like speckled blue for my jeans
those are just some high-waisted skinny
jeans from rag-and-bone and then for my
shoes I'm wearing my all-time favorite
booties from Target
now if you watch this on my actual vlog
you know I was wearing a scarf and a
jacket so I'm wearing my all-time
favorite Zara scarf along with a forever
21 textured pea coat
if you watch me on my vlog Channel you
know that the only reason I went to New
York City was to surprise my best friend
Carrie who goes to school there for her
birthday and it was just so much fun
so for Carrie's birthday we went on to
dinner and then we had to go of
experience in New York nightlife for her
22nd birthday so this is what I chose to
wear starting off with my leather jacket
that is from All Saints I'm absolutely
in love with it underneath it I'm just
wearing this white kind of chiffon I
don't know
flowy blue tank top from a Topshop I'm
wearing the same rag-and-bone jeans and
rag-and-bone duties weird oh my gosh
if you guys want to see this entire vlog
along with the one from LA with Windsor
I will have my vlog channel linked below
if you guys want to check it out you
should Saturday was a jam-packed day in
New York we hung out all day together we
went to brunch went to the Chelsea
Market we went to her dorm to hang out
we made dinner we watched Fifty Shades
of Grey we did a whole bunch of stuff so
for this day I have on my favorite
target booties that are just so
comfortable to walk everywhere if I'm
wearing a sews black jeans because black
jeans seem to be my favorite this season
for my sweater that is also from Topshop
and it's just kind of like a cowl-neck
super soft warm sweater which I
absolutely love and then over it I wore
this jacket that I purchased at All
Saints that I really love it's like this
drapey gray color and I was wearing a
red lip which I think tied the whole
look together
and Sunday always my boring days it's
either lazy or jam-packed full of work
so this is the outfit that I wore just
classic sneakers jeans and a sweatshirt
this watcher that I'm actually wearing
is from a clothing line that one of my
friends started and I love to support
local people like that doing awesome
things so I will have his links below
for my shoes those are just heads and
then I'm just wearing some the basic
skinny Levi's jeans
but that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you miss
these OoT W videos then go ahead and let
me know by either liking this video
