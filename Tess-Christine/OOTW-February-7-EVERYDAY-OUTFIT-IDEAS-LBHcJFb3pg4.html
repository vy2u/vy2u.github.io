today's video is an outfit of the week
video I know you guys love these videos
it's basically where I just film my
outfits for a whole week and to show you
guys them so I really hope you guys get
some fashion inspiration from it and
yeah let's get started
Monday's look it definitely is simple
and easy something that I'm constantly
doing a mess it's throwing on a sweater
and jeans during this time of year it's
still chilly in New York so this is kind
of my staple and go-to so all of this
outfit in fact most of the outfits
you're going to see are all recycled
pieces for my fall and winter look books
and that's because I don't get new
clothes every time I show a video so
it's kind of showing you how I restyled
up so for my sweater is that is from
Elliot and then I wore some jeans from
Lulu for my coat about it from JOA I
love it it's super warm and the colors
definitely add a different flare to it
and then I'm wearing my Speed Madden
booties with some clear frames from
forever 21
kuna Facebook incorporates one of my
favorite pieces that I bought this year
and that's my velvet bomber from ASOS
I'm always wearing this thing it's so
easy just to throw on and I get so many
compliments on it so I absolutely love
it like I said that's from ASOS and
under it I just wore a white wire which
is from revolve and those are one of my
favorite things to do to kind of add a
different bit of flirting outfit when
really all you can dress is super warm
is to add a belt with jeans so I'm
wearing a belt from Urban Outfitters and
then I'm wearing some maten bow black
high-waisted jeans definitely a staple
for me and then you know I got to have
my Steve Madden booties I've worn these
things down so much this year but
they're definitely worth it for
Wednesday's outfit I wanted to show you
guys how you can style a sweatshirt
because it's probably the easiest thing
to wear and it's perfect for running
errands getting groceries doing whatever
you need to do and you just want to like
hang out so that was my Wednesday and I
just wore this sweatshirt from Topshop
over it I wore one of my favorite coats
that I've had for years now and that is
from Regan bone but any type of longline
coat I found looks really good with just
plain hoodies makes it super easy and
then for my jeans those are Mountain bow
just denim jeans they're super comfy and
stretchy they feel like leggings they're
amazing and then I just wore some steam
Madden slip-on shoes
Thursday was a date night and Pat and I
went to a movie and dinner and this is
something that I should going to a
fairly casual place this is good and I
wear this pretty much all day and it was
really comfy so for my sweater that is
from hmm I love the pattern on it I
thought it tied really nicely with my
forever 21 sock booties so I wore that
and then the same motton Bou denim I
want to say leggings but they're jeans
that so comfy they are over it for some
warmth I wore this Urban Outfitters
jacket which I've had for you know I
think I featured it in my last year's
winter video but I absolutely loved it
and I yeah that's it this was a pretty
casual Friday and I wanted to show you
guys what I wear pretty much on a daily
basis and that's a t-shirt and jeans
with the belt any type of belt
the one I grabbed at this time was my
same Urban Outfitters one it's super
easy and then I wore a gray t-shirt
which I'm pretty sure is from booboo it
was super affordable again with my high
waisted at black denim jeans because
they're my go-to and then of course
gotta have a speed mount in booties just
like slip ons they're amazing but then
what I thought would be really fun is to
add this coat by JOA I thought it added
a really fun flair to it and stuff that
I'm not used to wearing it's a denim
color or denim fabric and it looks
really awesome I found paired with black
skinny jeans and then any type of shirt
you want I love it so much Saturday was
a brunch day so coziness is key the
piece that kind of stands out in this is
definitely the coat or the jacket
whatever you want to call it it's super
fluffy it's a big teddy bear coat I love
it it is from revolve I especially love
the color of it it's definitely more
fall but I think it's super fun and it's
also really warm which is kind of
defeating underneath it I wore a striped
shirt which I think I featured in my
fall style video but that is from Lulu's
it's a great layering piece I love it
and then for my jeans I just wore those
from the page denim of course I had to
have my blessing cut in booties it's
just
and then for some fun I added my Garrett
light frame for Sunday very casual had
to be honest I didn't leave my apartment
so this is what I wore it's basically
just a sweatshirt in leggings where my
sweatshirt that is just a vintage Tommy
Hilfiger one and then for my leggings
those are some from strut to this that
we wore what question I love the lace up
I think it's really fun and then from
Congress if I was going anywhere but
that was basically just a film well
that's different my videos today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
did be sure to give it a thumbs up and
let me know in the comments below which
outfit with your favorite or which one
you would most likely wear but I will
you guys next week for a new video
really awkward so goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
