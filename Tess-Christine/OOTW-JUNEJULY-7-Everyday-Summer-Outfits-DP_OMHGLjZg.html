ok so on 4th of July we spent most of
our day on the beach and that our
friends a backyard for a cookout and it
was super fun but I didn't wear that
much obviously because we were on the
beach so I thought this was the perfect
outfit because I could go from the beach
and go to the barbecue and I didn't
really have to change from a swimsuit
and not a swimsuit so I thought it was
perfect so for my high-waisted shorts
you guys know that these are my favorite
and those are from ASOS and they're just
high-waisted ones and then for my
bandeau top that's from Tommy Hilfiger
and I thought it was perfect because of
the colors for fourth of July but it
also kind of acted as like a swimsuit
top so I could just kind of lay out and
not get too more
Tuesday was a work day we went around
and we filmed and took photos this one
is from a celeb spiration post and I
ended up wearing this all day because I
ended up really liking it with super
comfy um so for my shoes those are just
some lace-up ones and those are from
Topshop they're really comfortable they
have a little heel on it but it's like a
sandal so it works for me for my shorts
those are just some basic ones from
Levi's and then for my top that is from
Windsor I think it's really cute I love
off-the-shoulder you guys know this and
this one's super fun I love the color
Wednesday was mainly an editing day but
Patrick and I decided to go out to
dinner so this is what I wore so
starting off with my skirt that is from
Topshop I got a couple years ago but
they have these all over the place I
just love the color of it goes with so
many things and then for my top I am
wearing a star top from Reformation I
really like it super lightweight and
airy so underneath it I wore a bando
because it was a little see-through but
it's perfect for like a cooler summer
night and then for my shoes those are
from ASOS I've been wearing the crap out
of these they are like my go-to slip-ons
I love them
now this is a little out of order but I
really wanted to include the two outfits
that I wore on my birthday so this one
we wore or I wore during the day we just
went to like a cool restaurant we hung
out pretty much all day and just chilled
and talked and had drinks and it was
like perfect so I just wore something
super simple my off-the-shoulder flowy
top is from forever 21 I love it and
then my high waisted shorts those are
Wrangler but I've autumn at Urban
Outfitters and we're the same slip-on
mules from ASOS and then for my glasses
those are again from ASOS I've just been
loving where he knows I wear them like
crazy
now for Friday yeah it's my birthday so
we went on to dinner and I got an
awesome s'mores cake and then we went to
one of our favorite bar club type of
places that plays like the best
throwback music if you follow me on
snapchat I was like going crazy with it
but I got so many questions on Instagram
what the heck I was wearing especially
this gold slip dress so that is from
Reformation I really like it a lot I
thought it was perfect for a birthday
because it was so kind of dressed up but
me I like to make things super casual
and very wearable so it was a little bit
chilly this night so over I wore an
oversized denim jacket I liked how it
made the dress a little bit more casual
and a little bit more comfortable to
wear all night you'd like to worry about
it um and then for my shoes I wore those
those are from Topshop
they are like a sandal shoe but they
kind of look like a dressier strappy
sandal but they don't you don't have to
deal with the heel so I was all about it
Saturday was just a chill day when one
said these ladies at new apartment I'm
actually filming in it so it's not mine
don't get excited um but I helped carry
set up her room and we just kind of
chilled so what I decided to wear it
this day was just this off-the-shoulder
flowy top from Windsor I love the black
and white and like that neck detailing I
think it's really pretty I just wear it
with some basic denim shorts those are
the same ones from Levi's and then for
my shoes I thought I would kind of jazz
up the outfit a little bit and have like
some studded sandals these ones are like
my all-time favorite I bought them a
while ago they're from Isabel Marant but
now they make cheaper alternatives so
don't splurge like I did I saw some that
look identical at like forever 21 and
Steve Madden so protip for you
and last but not least Sunday was brunch
day super chill day editing chilling
with Patrick eating good food so what I
decided to wear this day was just some
of my favorite high-waisted denim shorts
you guys know this from ASOS and then I
wanted to wear this top I had it for a
while now and I kind of forgot about it
so I wore that with like a bra let just
because it's kind of a low top it's more
of like a beachy top so I thought it
would make it more wearable by having
that underneath there and the top is
from Flint's guy and then the bra WA is
from forever 21 I wore it with just a
choker from stargaze jewelry my all-time
favorite glasses from ASOS and then for
my shoes I wore some white sneakers from
Frye but I ended up changing them for
some just like basic black booties but
that is it for my video today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did be
sure to give it a thumbs up and to let
me know in the comments below if you had
a favorite outfit if you're one of the
people that really wanted these videos
