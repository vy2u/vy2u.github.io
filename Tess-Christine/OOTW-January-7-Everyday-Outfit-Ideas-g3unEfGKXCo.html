channel today's video as you can tell by
the title is going to be an outfit of
the week
I've gem used so many times but it's
been a minute since I've done one and I
know you guys love these videos so I
thought I would bring them back
addressing me obvious I cut my hair
significantly more than the last time I
was like I cut my hair I am obsessed
with it I think I've been wanting to
like take the plunge and do this big
chop for a long time and just kind of
all the factors kept adding up and I'm
like yes let's do it so I just did it
I'm in love with it I'm still getting
used to styling it so when I can master
it I'll make a video for all you short
haired ladies out there so yay quickly
though before I get into the video I
wanted to just do a little disclaimer
because every time I do fashion videos
around these type these months these
winter months
the weather police like to come out in
the comments and tell me how cold it
actually is and what I should be wearing
so quickly these outfits are not for
frolicking the snow sledding when it's
freezing out when it's blistering out
you wear a big puffy jacket scarves hats
mittens the whole nine yards and there's
really no outfit variation for all of
that these outfits I filmed when it was
warmer in New York you can tell by most
of the clips the Sun is out the people
around me are dressed similar
similarly Wow so anyways I wanted to
pick days that I could actually play
around with different outfit styles
they're still warm like I wear them and
I go to how to eat go out at night with
my friends go from here to there point-a
to point-b outfits type of thing they're
not for walking long distances outdoors
but they definitely will keep you warm
on your journey let me know which outfit
is your favorite I love hearing that
kind of stuff from you guys it gives me
ideas and helps me you know know what
you guys like also but yeah let's get
into the video
okay so we're outfit number one this one
is super fun because it involves a
statement jacket which I love to
purchase this one is actually pretty
deceiving because it's pretty warm
it's from store ruts it's like a padded
really puffy jacket and then it comes
with a really cool belts that kind of
stitches at the waist and I just think
it's so flattering plus the color is
really fun so what I wore underneath
that is just a gray really thick knit
sweater which is great for layering and
then for my denim jeans those are from
Urban Outfitters and then my shoes which
you're gonna see a lot my booties my
go-to ones are from tony bianco i
absolutely love these boots I probably
wear them too much but they're just so
sturdy and nice now for the next one
that this one is super fun I always like
incorporating as much color as I can
into a winter wardrobe so starting off
with my green sweater that is from
lovers and friends from revolve it's
just a big chunky mint if those are
always super warm and really easy to
layer in the winter if it is colder over
it I wore a jacket from Zara I bought it
last year I love this I love the moto
style of it it's really warm and usually
I'll have this zipped just FYI and then
how I styled it is I just wore some
basic denim jeans which are from
Reformation I love the light wash with
it I wore a belt from ASOS I love the
vintage feel that it has to it it's a
little big for me as you can tell but I
still love it and then again with the
black booties tony bianco my favorites
so comfortable to wear even walking
around New York and then for my
statement earrings those are from mango
love them gold easy
alright next outfit I absolutely love
because it involves a few new pieces and
some statement he says so what starting
up with the blouse I love this this is
from storage it has a plaid pattern
which i think is really cool with the
ruffles I button it all the way up it's
actually a pretty thick material so
surprisingly just this and then my
jacket kept me pretty warm one zip
speaking of my jacket that is from my
MGH super big teddy bear coat I love it
it's just like wearing a big blanket
which is perfect for the season and then
for my jeans those are from Sandro I
love these I got these a couple years
ago I just love the embellishments and
studs on them I just think it adds a
really unique look and then again with
my black booties don't kill me I'm
pretty sure they're in every single
outfit I just love them and they're easy
to wear
for this look I wanted to show you guys
how I layer because going out at night
you want to take off all those big heavy
things because usually it's warmer so
underneath my outfit I'm just wearing
this top from ASOS it's a long-sleeved
kind of cropped turtleneck top super
lightweight and easy to layer under big
sweaters so that's exactly what I did
over it I wore this chunky knit cardigan
from revolt normally I would button this
up if it was a little bit windier and
chillier over it I just wore a green
jacket from Urban Outfitters these are
great because you can really bundle them
up and they have a hood and they're
usually pretty warm so that my denim
jeans are just skinny jeans I guess
they're kind of different with the
button closure and the seam down the
front those are from Sandro and then
surprised I'm not wearing booties and
wearing tuck Martens these are great if
there's a little bit of snow on the
ground and you're gonna trekking through
the neighborhood they're super sturdy I
love them and then for my beret that is
from Windsor I love Berets especially
this season you can put them over your
ears they definitely keep you warm so I
think they're a great accessory
this next look is definitely more casual
I wanted to be realistic and show you
guys that some days I really do just
Harris lectured and jeans this letter it
very wrinkly that is from ASOS it's just
a white one I like getting plain ones
because they're fun to just add like a
cool belt with or something just to kind
of flare it up and then for my denim
jeans those are the same ones from
Reformation over it I just wore this
like big wool coat that I got in a
sample sale a long time ago from
rag-and-bone and I layered it with a
huge scar from Zara Zara has the best
winter scarves you can kind of wrap this
around your face that's super cold I
wear this a ton and then again with the
black hoodies from tony bianco and then
i just wore some of the same statement
earrings from mango which would quickly
become my favorite this next look I love
because I'm not afraid to mix brown and
black I just love the color combo with
the yellow and the blue and everything
like that it's just really fun for me
so let's get the booties out of the way
you already know I'm wearing the same
tony bianco booties get yourselves a
pair as good hug booties if you like my
outfits cuz you'll wear them a ton for
my denim jeans they're from a girlfriend
denim I love these denim jeans are so
comfy for my belt that is from mango I'm
pretty sure I said was from ASOS before
but it's definitely from mango wear that
and then for my sweater I wore this
yellow sweater from Topshop I love the
color I just think it's fun to add a
color into your wardrobe especially in
the winter so over it I wore this like
brown jacket that's surprisingly warm
it's a moto style it's from Macy's I
love it and then I just wore some
leather gloves from ASOS to keep me a
little bit more warm
whoo-hoo last day you are caught up to
my haircuts so this look I love it's
pretty simple pretty self-explanatory
but I love the mixing of the prints and
the studs and the textures of the
clothing so starting off again
with the booties okay you get it for my
jeans I wear the same ones from a couple
outfits ago they're from Sandro love
love love the studs and then for my
sweater that one is a striped one from
Urban Outfitters this one is super comfy
and has a turtleneck so it definitely
keeps you a little bit more warm and
then over it I layered this faux fur
Reformation jacket I love this because
these jackets tend to keep you pretty
warm for the most part this was a warmer
day but I always find keeping your hands
warm helps to so I wore the same face
those leather gloves and that's it good
right and left this one
and that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did it
