monthly outfits of the week video I
decided to film this a little bit
different this month and film it more of
a vlog style because I thought it would
be a little bit more fun and a little
bit more interesting so let me know if
you liked it in the comments below but
basically all I'm gonna do is that take
you through a week of June and show you
the outfits that I wore I hope you guys
enjoy so basically for each day I'm just
going to show you a clip of something
that I did that day it's not my entire
day just a clip of something so of
course Monday I had to start off with
really good coffee so Patrick and I went
to Starbucks and it was delicious but
basically what it wore this day where
these moto shorts from Topshop a halter
top from PacSun and then a super comfy
black cardigan from Target because as
you can see the weather was kind of
smoky out so had to wear something my
necklaces are both gifted and then my
shoes are just from TJ Maxx so Tuesday
was a super rainy day as a lot of the
day's seemingly are in June lately so I
just curled up and I watched some of my
favorite television shows the
Bachelorette guilty-pleasure and a new
girl I recently started watching it on
Netflix and I'm in love with it so I
just wore something super comfy these
pants I'm wearing are beach pants from
Volkl and my top is from Topshop but
let's be honest these cozy days are the
best right moving on to Wednesday I'm
pretty sure I filmed this day like I do
most days but I decided to go out for
lunch with some of my friends so I
decided to take you along so that'd be a
perfect opportunity
so all I'm wearing is just this green
vest from Topshop and then for my crop
top is just a gray sweater crop top from
Nasty Gal
I just wore basic high-waisted denim
shorts from Zara and then of course my
converse because they're so comfy and
then my sunglasses are club masters by
Ray Ban
now Thursday was spent most of the time
shopping for my Blake Lively get the
look video which has been such a
challenge you guys but I'm so excited
for you to see the video so nonetheless
I just dress super comfy one of my go-to
outfits is just a maxi skirt this one
that I'm wearing is from Urban
Outfitters I bought it last year my top
is from American Apparel and my shoes
are just old lady flip-flops and my bag
is a recommend goth okay so this Friday
was spent most the day filming for my
4th of July outfit video which is going
to be out a couple days after this video
so while you're watching in couple days
July first look for it so I'm not going
to tell you where anything is from
because I want you guys to watch this
video this is just a little behind
scenes action yes yeah it's Saturday
it's my favorite day and I decided to
take grocery shopping how lame am i I
could have taken you to the bar
something fun but of course not all I'm
wearing is just this top from Topshop
and my Scorch skirt type thing is again
from Topshop and my really awesome shoes
are from Urban Outfitters and this is
Patrick being so sneaky with the Oreos
even though I love Oreos but I thought
that was so funny cuz I didn't notice
until checkout but yes how exciting
and now we're up to date with Sunday all
I wore was this crop top from Topshop
and some shorts from Nasty Gal super
chill I basically just plan out my Blake
