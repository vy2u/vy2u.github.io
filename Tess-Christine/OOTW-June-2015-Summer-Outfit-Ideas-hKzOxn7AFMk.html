be an outfit of the week video for June
basically what that means is I just show
you guys a week full of outfits I do
these monthly and I do these blog styles
so you get a peek into my week instead
of just my outfit these are probably my
favorite videos to film because I really
can show you guys what I do in the week
my friends my family it's just me and I
just love showing you guys this stuff so
if you're interested then just keep on
watching starting off with Monday of
course something that I had to do this
day was I had to go get stuff for mine
you get the look video for Vanessa
Hudgens I'm always on an outfit hunt for
when it comes to these things so I
brought my two favorite people ever
since they wanted to come which was
actually really fun and we went to a
bunch of different stores trying to find
cheaper outfits or the sick of the look
video so it's one of my favorite things
to do so that's what we did this day
so for my outfit this is what I decided
to wear it's definitely been my go-to
especially these booties they are the
Sam Edelman Louie booties and I
seriously wear them more than ever since
moving here I absolutely love them for
my skirt that is from Nasty Gal and then
for the white top underneath that is
from Windsor my denim top that I tied is
from Gap and then my bag that is from
Chloe and my necklace is from Planet
Blue on Tuesday I had a meet-up which
was so exciting at gap and Birchbox
hosted a meet-up for me at the Gap store
in Herald Square and it was so much fun
Birchbox and gap partner to launch a
store and store experience in seven
locations around the country which is
basically why they had me here was the
first launch at the New York City store
but there's also one in Houston San
Francisco and a few more which I will
have listed in the description box but
basically it's really awesome if you're
familiar with Birchbox it's a $10 per
month and it sends you five deluxe
beauty samples all tailored to a profile
you fill out and the five products span
across different categories and once you
find something you love can buy it
either at the Gap store or on Birchbox
comm so if you want to learn more about
Birchbox head over to my Instagram I'm
having a giveaway so if you want to look
you can enter for a chance to win some
of my favorite Birchbox products I
really love it even Patrick has a verge
haha um but anyways now it's made of
time and after all of that I had so much
fun meeting you guys honestly I'm so new
to meetups that is actually really
awesome to be able to take photos with
you guys have conversations hug you and
just see you in person I just think it
was so much fun and I was so happy how
so many of you guys came out last minute
like this it was just amazing and such a
cool experience
you
for my outfit I kept it pretty casual
like usual I went to the Gap store
beforehand and picked out an outfit to
wear to the meetup so this is what I
chose starting off with my wedges
they're super comfortable there from Gap
and I thought they went really well with
the chambray romper which is also from
Gap and then I just had the whole look
together with a cream blazer and layered
necklaces
Wednesday it was raining actually it's
been raining a lot in New York so we
kind of had to kind of look up places
and things to do inside so starting out
I went with obviously my faith people
Carrie and Pat and we went to go get
acai bowls which are my new favorite
thing and then we went bowling because
who doesn't love bowling especially on a
rainy day right so this is actually
super fun we did this like midday and it
was awesome
so this is what I decided to wear this
day and even though it was rainy it was
super hot and humid still so I had to
dress really summery um for my shoes I
just wore some studded oxford shoes is
that what they're called those are from
Jeffrey Campbell my skort skirt is from
Topshop my bag from ASOS and my key
sunglasses for my top the Aloha top is
from made well and then with my favorite
layered necklaces from Nasty Gal
Thursday was another cool day style haul
invited Patrick and I to see the
premiere of fresh dressed which is
actually a really cool movie Pat and I
didn't know much about it before but
it's actually really awesome it was
about how hip-hop has influenced fashion
which was right up my alley I loved it
and then afterwards they had this really
cool after-party where you got to talk
to a bunch of people and of course dance
that was like the most fun I got to meet
some other style halt influencers too
which was really cool um so yeah overall
awesome night for my outfit I actually
really didn't know what to wear to
something like this so I defaulted to a
romper which this one is actually one of
my favorites I wore it last year to
Fashion Week
I just always default to it it's from
Finders Keepers I absolutely love the
print of it and then for my shoes I just
wore some lace-up shoes from forever 21
but I definitely think it was a safe bet
but I could have gone more casual but I
really liked outfit overall
Friday was a pretty chill day I did a
lot of editing this day I filmed a bit
for a video but then Patrick and I just
kind of walked around this Dumbo area in
Brooklyn um and just kind of explored we
took some photos which we really like to
do together which is really fun we got
lemonade it was just a really nice day
to just be outside so that's what we did
it was incredibly hot this day if you
guys live in New York or in the area you
know just how humid and just
uncomfortably hot it's been so this is
what I wore starting off with my shoes
you guys know this from the Shea Mitch
you'll get the look video my favorite
dr. Scholls sandals they are so
comfortable for my dress I wore this one
from mango really light and airy which
was perfect my belt that is from H&amp;amp;M and
I just paired with some simple
accessories my necklace being one of
them is from Nasty Gal and then for my
sunglasses I wore some key sunglasses
which I got from Topshop and that's it
Saturday Carrie and I had a girls night
a during the day I was filming and
editing which you guys see all the time
so I thought it would be a little bit
fun and different to show you a few
clips from our night out starting out we
took a cab into the city which we
normally take the subway because we it
was just really fun to go over the
bridge um so we did that and then went
to like a rooftop bar club area and just
danced met some people and just had a
really rad girls night so for my outfit
this is what I decided to wear I
actually don't know why filmed with the
leather jacket cuz they wore a jean
jacket but I totally spaced and forgot
that I wore that so starting out with
the shoes those are just Isabel Marant
sandals umm and then for my romper
that's from Topshop I've had it for so
long now but it's definitely a really
awesome going out piece and then for my
bag that is from Target or clutch or
whatever you want to call it and then my
necklaces Nasty Gal you guys know this
and then yeah like I said leather jacket
in the video which is from all paints
but I wore a jean jacket that night so
yeah
note to self if you want passion
inspiration from this
lazy Sunday time but Kari and I went
grocery shopping so we took you along to
that instead of just our like chillin on
the couch so we did a bunch of grocery
shopping I actually have visitors this
week not in the video so my brother and
Patrick's friends so we had to shop a
lot for it so this is what I decided to
wear I kept it super casual actually
post a photo on Instagram and a lot of
you guys liked it so now you'll know
where everything is from so starting off
with my shoes those are just classic
converse I love them they're my go-to
for my overall short Orvil overalls I
can't talk though that is from Eritrea
