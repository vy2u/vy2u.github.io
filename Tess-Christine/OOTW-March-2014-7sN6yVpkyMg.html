more of these videos from me then just
hit that thumbs up button so I know
basically if you don't know what they
are I just go through the week and show
you guys what I was wearing each day
also some of the jewelry that I'm
wearing in this video is from bauble bar
I've been getting a lot of questions on
my Instagram and some previous videos on
certain jewelry that I've been wearing
and they've all been from bauble bar I
really enjoy their jewelry so I thought
I would put it all in this video to show
you guys in case you were interested and
since I know some of you guys expressed
interest in the jewelry and really liked
it I wanted to do something for you guys
so if you go to bauble bar comm slash
test you guys can get 20% off your order
but yea if you're interested in this
video at all then of course just keep on
watching alright guys so starting out
with Monday I'm keeping it very relaxed
and she'll just a t-shirt in the jacket
super easy all I'm really wearing is
this really dorky printed shirt from
forever 21 I think it's so fun and cute
I just love it and then I'm wearing a
leather jacket from karma some Levi's
jeans and then for my shoes I decided to
get spicy with it and wears some lace-up
wedges from Target and then my necklace
is just an initial tee necklace from
bauble bar and yeah that's pretty much
it it's pretty chill moving on to
Tuesday I can't remember what I did this
day but I know I had to look a little
bit nicer so all I really wore was just
the sweater from brandy melville it's
super super comfy and soft and it's kind
of relaxed but you can totally dress it
up which is kind of what I did I just
wore these really cool plaid leggings
from Topshop they're kind of leggings
but more like trousers I don't really
know and then I wore this really cool
pearl necklace from Bob avoir which I
absolutely love and then for shoes I
just wore basic black booties from
Express and yeah that was it
now onto Wednesday and Wednesday I'm
pretty sure was an editing day but I did
get dressed because I'm pretty sure I
had to run a couple errands so I made
sure to be the comfiest as I could so I
wore this really really cozy comfy
sweater from forever 21 I loved it and I
love the pattern on it as well and then
underneath it I just wore some leather
shorts from forever 21 and then socks
and booties from ASOS and yeah I
probably won't wear the socks otherwise
but I just did because it was cold
moving on to Thursday this is another
casual outfit but actually for where I
live this is a little bit more dressed
up so I wear this on a casual night out
with my friends nothing too crazy
nothing club --is-- just casual fun
night out all I'm wearing is this really
fun printed sweater from BB Dakota I
just love the colors in the print of it
it's super comfy and cozy and then for
my white crop top that's from forever 21
it's just very simple but I just love
the cut of it for my James I'm just
wearing these high-waisted jeans from
Nasty Gal
and then for my shoes and just wore
brown booties from TJ Maxx for
accessories I love using gold jewelry so
this first one is a leaf printed gold
necklace and that's from hmm and then my
simple gold chain with the rhinestone in
the middle is from bauble bar a lot of
you guys were asking me where that was
from and it's from there
woohoo it's Friday yay I went out with
friends this Friday I'm pretty sure um
this is what I usually wear out I'm
pretty casual but I like to kind of edge
it up it's like totally more my style
I don't usually wear this much black but
I did for this reason so voila I'm
wearing this really cool jacket from
ASOS I'm obsessed with it and then the
shell top from Topshop I just love the
jacket on the top together and then for
my jeans I wear these from Topshop as
well there's kind of a leather look pant
and then for my accessories I wore this
brace from bauble bar
I think the rhinestones added a little
bit more of a girly touch since my
outfit was a little bit edgier
and then booties from Steve Madden and
that was pretty much it now it's time
for Saturday's outfit and this was a
little bit more girly for me because I
went on a dinner date so I wanted to be
all feminine and cute so I wore this
really really beautiful top from Zara I
love it I love the lace on it I think
it's so pretty and flowy and it was just
so comfy and then for accessories of
course I wore this bangle from bauble
bar it's just a simple gold bangle and I
thought it worked perfectly with the
outfit and then for my jeans I wore
these high-waisted jeans from Nasty Gal
because the top was cut a little bit
shorter and then my booties are the same
from earlier this week and those are
from Express last but not least it's
Sunday and Sunday equals lazy Sunday for
me I eat either film or I added
something hour this really awesome top
from forever 21 and it says you've got
to be kidding me
right now how freaking cute is that I'm
obsessed with it mostly because I love
kitties and then I'm wearing this
sweater from brandy melville super comfy
and then my same jeans from Levi's
because I'm obsessed but that's it for
