Green
hi guys today's video is my outfit of
the week for November what I do for
these is I pick some the best days I had
in the month and compiled them into a
week long video and show you guys my
outfits I also include some blog clips
so you can see exactly what I did just
make it a little bit more fun so let's
get started okay so starting off with
Monday this outfit was actually Tuesday
but Tuesday had two outfits so I
combined them but regardless as you can
see I'm backstage at the Victoria's
Secret Fashion Show
what like the only reason why I was even
here is because hue guys voted me
sexiest social style this year for
Victoria Secrets of what is sexy so I'm
so forever thankful for that because
this experience was amazing um so
basically what I did it I blogged with
the models asked them some questions so
be on the lookout for that vlog and this
is what I wear backstage the main thing
I wanted to wear wear my hmm balm on of
hands yes I actually went out and fought
the crowds to get something it was
madness um but I really like them
they're perfect for the holidays I love
the texture on it so I wore those with
some strappy sandals and then I wore
just a simple crop top from Nasty Gal
and then for my blazer that's just from
Topshop okay so moving on to Tuesday
Tuesday night in specific was the
fashion show and I can't even express to
you guys how excited I was for this I
remember sitting on my couch with my
roommates for years and years just
watching this it was an event for us so
this was totally surreal for me plus I
got to meet some YouTube friends out of
it it was just so much fun and I didn't
fall on the pink carpet you guys know me
but you guys have to tune into the show
on December 8th because it's just
amazing as you guys know it just is
incredible show so then moving on to the
after-party I have to show you a little
clip because BAM Selena Gomez I died
she's my favorite and amazing I love her
okay so now for what I wore I'm not
kidding you guys when I got the phone
call I actually panicked because what
the heck do you even wear to the fashion
show so I looked on revolve clothing and
I found this dress that I thought
matched the vibe of the show really well
it fits amazing and I just really love
it
I wore that with just some nude heels
that I bought at Nordstrom moving on to
Wednesday this is another surreal day in
my life because I was on The Today Show
and this was like what the heck how did
I get here a moment for me um I did four
DIYs with the host this was so much fun
my first time on live TV so if you guys
want to watch the full segment I will
have it linked below but it was just
amazing so this is what I decided to
wear I wanted to be very classic very
simple with my outfit
so of course I reached for my over the
knee boots from Stuart Weitzman just
because they're my go-to I think I wear
them most of the rest of the week in
this video um with some black jeans or
my top I wore a lace peplum top that I
purchased at Zara czar as kind of like
my go-to for anything kind of like
formal or nice and then over it I wore a
long gray coat that I bought last year
that's just like my favorite from All
Saints and then my scarf from Urban
Outfitters
and Thursday was a Thanksgiving yay but
none of us went home and by none of us I
mean at Patrick myself and Carey so we
decided you have a friendsgiving where
we made food and Kerry did all of the
cooking can't take any of the credit but
I did vlog this day so if you want to
watch the full blog I will have my vlog
channel linked below but this is what I
decided to wear we were inside most of
the day so I kept it pretty chill um so
yeah I just wore of course over the knee
boots my Stuart Weitzman's are just like
super comfortable and then for my skirt
I wore this suede one from Topshop I
really love it it goes with everything
and then for my sweater crop top that is
from forever 21
okay so moving on to Friday Patton and I
just chilled in the morning but then
later in the day we attempted Black
Friday which was absolute madness I've
never obviously been done it in home let
alone New York and so we stayed out for
about an hour too and then gave up went
back and got some dinner and yeah it was
just kind of like a relaxing night went
for a walk and that's pretty much it so
this is what I wore super comfy this is
probably a classic outfit for me when it
comes to day today especially right now
so again I know I wore the over-the-knee
boots you're getting sick of it but when
you spend a lot of money you want to
wear them all the time so they're just
like my favorite um and then for my
sweater dress I bought that at H&amp;amp;M super
comfortable and really warm and then I
wore the same All Saints jacket that's
kind of layered in grey and it just goes
with everything saturday was a pretty
relaxing day a pat and I went for a walk
into the park and took some photos we
also went out to lunch but these kind of
days are when I'm like editing maybe
filming something they're really casual
these are more of like my everyday is
not like Victoria Secret and Today Show
um so I had to include it obviously
because it's what I do the most so this
is what I wore another classic outfit
for me just really comfortable it's like
the perfect weather right now in New
York I'm I'm in love with it um so yes
again over the knee boots there you go I
wore some black jeans from Reagan bone
because my favorite and then I wore a
plaid sweater from Nasty Gal and then
over it I wore a really fluffy ivory
coat from Orencia
and last but not least Sunday now this
is nearly every Sunday for me it's lazy
Sunday to the max I usually hang out and
edit most of the time go over some video
schedule that kind of stuff whatever it
be I just kind of have a chill day so
I'm wearing a white sweater from forever
21 it's super comfy I've kind of been
living in it and then for my socks they
are just some over the knee socks from
Free People super warm and cozy um
definitely something I like to children
but that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it be sure to give
it a thumbs up if you like these videos
and I will see you guys next time
