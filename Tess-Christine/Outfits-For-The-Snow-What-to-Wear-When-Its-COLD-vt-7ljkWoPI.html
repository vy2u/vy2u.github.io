today's video is going to be a styling
video and I'm pretty pumped for this one
because if you guys watched my winter
style video you would know that I was
really frustrated with New York weather
for the winter because it was super warm
super cold super all over the place and
then we had a blizzard but I was really
excited about that because it allowed a
bunch of snow which means I could film
this video for you guys so I show you
four outfits that are perfect for the
cold weather or if you live with a lot
of snow this is perfect for you because
I show you guys a bunch of things that I
love wearing during the winter when it's
super super cold you have to truck it
through the snow I live in New York so
you have to walk to the subways it's a
lot so these keep you super warm your
feet super dry everything's great so I
really hope you guys get a lot of
fashion inspiration from this whether
you own a few of the items already or
you can go to the store and stock up for
next year everything's on sale now I
hope you enjoy and let's get started
starting off with outfit number one I
love this one because of all of the
neutral colors it incorporates it has
kind of a muted feel to it so it has
like hints of mob and purple which I
love so starting off with the most
important thing in my opinion and that's
shoes if you live in a snow climate or
cold climate warm feet is essential so I
have these these are timberlands but I
love them because they're like this
neutral tan color which match a lot of
things in my wardrobe plus they're super
warm and can handle the snow they're
waterproof they're awesome so what I
also paired with that was just some
black jeans am i essential I buy mine
from Paige denim I love that and then
over it what I love to do is layer so
you're gonna find a ton of sweaters or
just big thick comfy sweaters underneath
my jacket so I have this white one from
forever 21 and then over it I wore I
layered it with this big fluffy coat
from rag-and-bone layering is key and
then for my scarf that's from Target is
just a big blanket scarf I can wrap it
around my face a bunch of times if I
need to and then of course I topped it
off with a hat hats in the cold or the
winter in general is just super
important so that's from Topshop
for outfit number two this one
incorporates something that I think is
crucial for the snow or the cold and
that's a big fluffy down jacket I think
they're super important just because
they keep you super warm they're also
really really comfortable my dad
they feel like a big down comforter is
on you the whole day but these are for
those extra windy days or when you want
to play in the snow with your friends or
go sledding or something I always have
one of these these are awesome this one
is from Macy's you can always find these
on sale so be on the lookout for my
shoes those are of boots you guys have
seen these in winter look books
throughout a couple years now they are
kind of like my staple and go to super
warm they can truck it through the snow
and all that fun stuff
then for jeans I just wore some basic
denim jeans from Levi's and then my
sweater is from Urban Outfitters as well
as my little cute ear muff hat and she
put over my head yeah
this next outfit is to show you guys
that you can still be stylish and cute
while also still being warm so I'm going
to start off with the boots of course I
only have two pairs of winter boots and
they're the ones you've already seen so
I'm wearing the same boots as before a
tip for you when buying winter boots is
to buy a neutral color so like black or
brown just so you get the most use out
of them
of course I'm wearing some black jeans
and then underneath my jacket I'm
wearing a black knit sweater from
forever 21 super warm super thick and
then over like I said my coat I'm
wearing that from all things you guys
saw that in my winter styling video
layering is key it allows you to wear
more of your jackets as well another tip
for you is to buy pattern scarves this
one that I'm wearing is from Zara
I always think they add a little bit of
texture to your outfit and they always
just make it look better so it's kind of
a tip to still stay cute and stylish but
also scarves are super warm lastly for
my hat that is from American Eagle I
love wearing beanies or knit hats
because they keep a lot of the heat
inside and they also save for a bad hair
day and lastly I love this one because
it incorporates a lot of your classic
winter colors super comfortable like all
of these are but I love this one I find
myself wearing this one the most so
starting off again with the boots those
are my timberlands I love them so much
go buy them they're on sale right now
actually - then of course I'm just
wearing some classic blue jeans I bought
mine at Paige denim but blue jeans are
just essential underneath I'm wearing
this sweater which is from loft thanks
Carrie um and I love that then I'm
wearing a scarf from Windsor I love
adding scarves you guys know this this
one's like a maroon color so it's a
super fun way to add color and then over
it I'm wearing this jacket which I
purchased from Urban Outfitters I love
this one super warm and it's just really
fun to kind of bundle up with then
lastly of course I'm wearing the beanie
again from American Eagle I love this
one this one has been my go-to this year
actually super warm and really cute plus
it goes with a lot of stuff
thank you guys so much for watching I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
