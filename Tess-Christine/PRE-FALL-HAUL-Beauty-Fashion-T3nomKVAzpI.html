today's video is going to be a prefault
haul and why I titled it a pre-fall haul
since because it's not technically fall
yet it is still super hot in New York
all the stuff that I bought except for
the beauty items I can't really use
slash wear yet because it's just not the
weather for it yet but if you've been
shopping recently you know that's pretty
much all you can buy now unless you buy
a bunch of summer stuff on sale so I
thought I would share with you guys in
specific the fashion my items that I'm
using to transition into fall with and
then some new beauty items that I'm
really excited to share with you guys a
few new stuff that I picked out and that
I tried a few of so yeah let's get
started so as always I'm gonna start off
with beauty and the first item that I
bought is this Clinique take the day off
balm I think I'm not sure I just seen it
all over I've seen so many people talk
about it as I'm sure you guys have too
I feel like it's a an OG product meaning
like it's been around for a really long
time a lot of people have liked it so
I'm really anxious to try it I have not
tried it at all so stay tuned on this
because I'm gonna show you guys or I'm
gonna let you know if I like it but
basically it's just a balm that you use
to take off your makeup before you
cleanse I found that really really
really helped out my skin I wasn't doing
that like a year ago and that's probably
why I had a lot of breakouts it's
because I wasn't getting all the dirt
and grime off my face so I'm really
pumped to try this so the next product
is the foundation and I'm super excited
to share it with you guys because I've
given you guys a few sneak peeks once in
my last get ready with me video I used
the foundation there have it on my face
now and if you follow me on Instagram on
my Instagram stories I kind of did like
an unboxing first impressions and it's a
bare minerals fresh face liquid
foundation made to fit for a test me so
it's really awesome it's a foundation
shade that's custom made for you and
you're probably thinking what how so
basically I teamed up with bare minerals
to kind of share this new technology I
went to one of their
and they showed me how to use this app
it uses the camera on your phone and you
put it all over your face you do your
forehead cut on your cheeks on your chin
really easy and then through the app it
will custom make your shade your custom
foundation color and then it puts your
name on it which is really cool and it
ships to you within like 48 hours or
something like that and it has the date
on it when it was made it's super handy
and so I kind of did a little unboxing
for my Instagram story and I test out
the shake so I was like does this really
work and it matched really awesomely I
freaking love it it's super lightweight
and it has a matte finish but it's not
super drying like most matte foundations
it's very moisturizing and I definitely
need matte because you guys know I have
oily skin combination so it's perfect I
freaking love it it's great and it feels
good on my skin so thumbs up really
excited to share this with you guys
alright so since we're talking about
skin I bought a new cleanser that I'm
really excited to try out I just ran out
of mine I was using a Dermalogica one
and now I'm gonna try this goop one it's
goop by Juice Beauty and it's a luminous
melting cleanser it kind of looks alike
the Clinique take the day off like it's
like a pressed bomb almost and you kind
of scoop it out and it melts into your
face and it's a cleanser like I said
before I'm gonna make a skincare video
for you guys soon because I feel like
I've mastered at least through my skin
and hopefully give you guys tips soon so
be on the lookout for that
and then last for beauty you guys know I
don't buy too many beauty products all
at once I kind of slowly get them so I'd
only have a this last thing and their
lashes which is kind of random I don't
think I've ever mentioned lashes before
but I felt the need to because I wear
them all the time now they come in a
pack like a ton they're so awesome these
are Christina lashes by WSP I think I
don't like I said I'll have them linked
below but basically what I like to do is
cut them up and then disperse them on my
lashes or I'll just put them on the ends
and it's so easy it just makes my eyes
look bigger and they pop better and I
just like it I've kind of given up on
the eyelash extensions
I love viologic except with it
I love eyelash extensions but they are
just one really freaking expensive to
keep up with and to kind of high
maintenance so I wanted to give this a
try because I love how eyelash
extensions make my lashes look and these
are just as easy and I find that they
look super natural and they're not heavy
on okay so yeah alright that's it for
beauty products so and now let's move on
to fashion so I'm gonna grab the first
thing I see which is a t-shirt I've worn
this in the intro for my Selena Gomez
video and a lot of you guys are asking
me construction edits from ASOS it looks
like this it's a rolling stones teeth
dig on it and the only thing that I wish
it was a little bit shorter it's super
long like I could maybe if I was ariana
grande where this has a dress so it's
just really long and I like to tuck
these t-shirts in so that kind of makes
it difficult when you have a lot of
extra fabric going on down here but
other than that I really love it it's a
rad t-shirt and I love t-shirts as a
fall because they're great for layering
alright next up we have a pair of jeans
and you know me and jeans especially mom
jeans high waist jeans whatever you want
to call them jeans high-waisted duh and
what I really liked about them is the
side detail they're like lace up on the
side with this like black ribbon it's
really cool really unique I think it's
really fun to have stuff like this in
your closet because I definitely think
it makes you stand out but they're just
jeans they're really easy to wear and
style you just wear this like a t-shirt
a tank top a jacket whatever you want
next up we have Zara and I'm so excited
because
first item that I'm going to show you
guys is this laser I've been looking for
a blazer jacket type of thing like this
as soon as I started thinking about fall
fashion I was like yes I need one of
these it's such a staple it makes your
outfit look super put together like you
could dress this hella up or held it
down wear this with some sneakers
high-waisted jeans and a t-shirt or you
can dress it up like business it all
depends on what you're using it for okay
next is kind of unconventional for fall
I feel like I wouldn't normally buy
these but I saw the mom Zara and at Zara
and I really liked them they do kind of
have a fall tone to them like the colors
are bright and pastel which kind of
reminds me of like spring and summer so
this has a little bit more of a muted
tone it's got this like salmon base
color and then the rest is like this
dark floral and their high-waisted
trousers they fit really really well I'm
really excited to style these I have a
few ideas in mind this shirt I'm really
excited about okay
see these string lights are really cute
and you know but they're just not
practical because they get stuck on
every single hanger I'm struggling today
this shirt I'm really excited about
because I've been looking everywhere for
like a lightweight striped shirt because
one of my favorite things to do is get
shirts like this and tuck them in to
jeans with a belt it's like the easiest
outfit on the planet even even I know a
lot of you guys have normal jobs and are
not youtubers that can dress however you
want all the time so I feel like stuff
like this is really good to buy
especially here in the workplace because
it's definitely you know business
appropriate and you can tuck it into
some trousers but you could also wear it
with like shorts or some cool denim
jeans or anything like that and make it
more relaxed alright then the last thing
from Zara is kind of unique but I'm
really excited to wear it it looks like
this and you're like is that a skirt I'm
not sure well I wasn't either when I saw
it but then I realized it's a top it's
like a tube top but it looks like it
should be a blazer or something like the
material of it is so different for what
it is I don't
it has buttons all along here and I just
think this is gonna look so cool with
some high-waisted at the last skinny
jeans and some boots okay so before we
get into the Loulou stuff I'm going to
show you guys this other thing that I
got it's kind of miscellaneous meaning I
only have one thing from there but it's
by the brand Flair the label and there
are these striped pants and I'm so
excited because I've been looking for
striped pants everywhere and they're
sold out or they're just not the style
that I want or they're like cropped and
these are like full-length striped pants
they feel so lightweight and airy
I'm so excited they kind of feel like
something you can just like lounge in
but they also look really nice on like
you totally dress these up okay so now
to Lulu's the first thing I have is this
blouse which again I'm really excited
about kind of the whole same spiel as
the striped shirt from Zara love these
things just just tuck in this is kind of
like a satiny material it feels like
next up from Lulu's we have the most
comfiest sweater I've ever gotten in my
entire life and it looks like this uh oh
my god I wish you guys I wish I could
just like have you feel this during the
screen because it just is so soft oh
it's got these huge like kind of fell
almost sleeves but it's crunches here
you can tuck this in and like just be so
cozy okay so next removes these are kind
of hanging on the same hanger so I'm
going to mention them both one is not
from Lulu's the other is so what when I
saw this belts online I was like yes yes
yes first it's gold you know me and gold
pretty much stick to it I love it
but it has a very vintage look to it
like something you would find at like a
cool vintage shop or like a secondhand
store it just looks so it's gonna be so
cool with just jeans and a tee and
adding this is just gonna add such a
flare to the outfit and I'm so excited
so then sidetrack from Lulu's I bought
one thing from Urban Outfitters and
there were a pair of jeans setting out
there
I love Levi's I think they're great
jeans they fit me really well and make
my butt look good kind of everything
that you want and
pair of jeans right I usually have to
shop in the petite section to get jeans
that I don't need hemmed or that I like
don't have to rule so first for like
this being a crop Jean it hits me right
at the ankle like perfectly like right
where I want it so that's the main
reason why I bought them as well so
because I didn't have to get any
alterations to them next it's a leather
skirt and I'm really excited I found
this again from Lulu's you can tuck
things into it you can tuck a big
sweater into it even work with over the
knee boots it's just it's just a staple
I had to get one of these it's a fiddler
cap I love these you guys know I do I've
had that black one for forever so I
wanted to get a brown one because I
thought it would be really fun so this
is what it looks like oh I love it and
you want to know who steals it it's
Patrick the unisex hat and he loves it
probably more than I do but lack of
color just has really great hats if
you're a hat person I definitely
recommend that store okay so the one
thing I wanted to mention is a pair of
shoes they're not super new I got them
like a couple months ago they're from
the brand tony bianco let me show you
yeah why I want to spend your knees is
because I know this time of year comes
around where if you're like shopping for
a new pair of boots because I had a pair
last year that were from Steve Madden
that looked almost identical to this and
they're pretty much worn to the bone and
I had to get a new pair so these are
from tony bianco I really love them and
they're really good quality so I will
link these below just as a
recommendation for some new fall booties
so yeah that's it I really hope you guys
like this video give it a thumbs up let
me know any fall videos that you guys
want to see this year and I will see you
guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
