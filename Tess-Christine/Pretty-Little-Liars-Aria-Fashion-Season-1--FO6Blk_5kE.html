its Tess and today's video is going to
be another fashion video for you guys
but this time it's gonna be themed which
I thought would be really fun and this
seriously has been my like most highly
requested video of all time ever and it
is from Pretty Little Liars aria her
character to do a look inspired by her
so I was kind of looking on YouTube and
I noticed there are a ton of hair and
makeup tutorials for her and so I kind
of like I was gonna do a whole get the
look video for her and do her hair her
makeup and her outfit but I figured it
would be kind of more fun to do a whole
fashion video inspired by Aria and
Pretty Little Liars because I feel like
the reason why people are so drawn into
her character is because of the way she
dresses so I thought I would put
together some inspired looks these
obviously aren't her exact looks in the
movies but they are or not movies TV
show but they are very similar so I
tried to put together as best as I could
and I tried to reuse certain objects of
clothing because I find that you can
take a simple piece like a leather
jacket and put it over a ton of
different things and they all look very
different same with shoes so I used a
lot of the same shoes and I used this
particular leather jacket in almost all
of the looks I really really hope you
guys liked this video
I kind of I was really excited about it
because I watch Pretty Little Liars as
well and I love her character but I was
kind of thinking of doing a whole
fashion series on the characters of
Pretty Little Liars so obviously this
would be my first one this would be aria
and I thought I was good I thought about
doing Hanna Emily and Spencer I don't
know if you guys are interested in that
if you guys like this fashion video or
end up liking this fashion video for
aria
let me know in the comments below one if
you liked it and two if you want to see
the other characters Tube arias look is
very very simple I'm kind of just gonna
talk about it for a little bit just a
little bit and then I'll let you see
them but basically all you really need
to get arias look are some sort of a
black boot or some sort of a leather
rustic looking boot big statement
earrings she's known for you know
putting
together a simple outfit and then making
it stand out with a big bold earring a
leather jacket is a must-have for Aria
she seriously is seen in the leather
jacket in almost every episode the thing
about Aria style is she's very unique
with the way she how she puts things
together so she'll take a very feminine
floral dress and pair it with big bold
earrings a leather jacket and like biker
boots so you know what I mean she's very
she takes something very cute and girly
and kind of throws an edge on it which i
think is awesome and I love her style so
that is the four main things you need to
achieve for Aria style boots a leather
jacket statement earrings and floral
dresses I really really hope you guys
liked this video again let me know in
the comments below if you want to see
more Pretty Little Liars fashion videos
for the other characters and again let
me know if you think in the comments
below and as always see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
