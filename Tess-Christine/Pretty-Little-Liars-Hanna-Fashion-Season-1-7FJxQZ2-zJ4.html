today's video is my third part of my
pretty little liars fashion series and
today's look is Hannah and this look was
actually pretty easy for me to do
because I feel like I kind of have some
of Hannah's style qualities when it
comes to her outfits I kind of am a mix
between Hannah and Aria so this was a
pretty easy look to do for me so I put
together a few more outfits than I did
for Spencer and Aria so I put together a
few more in Hanna's look because I
thought I found hers to be a little bit
more easier easy for me to do sorry I'm
getting like tongue-tied but yes that is
the video for today a brief explanation
of Hanna style her style is very very
girly it's not so much on the preppy
side as is Spencer's and it's not so
much on the edge of your side as arias
it's kind of a mix between aria and
girly if you know what I mean and so she
kind of dresses a little bit with an
edge but more of like with a girly feel
very feminine and very girly I mean
obviously if you guys watch the show
she's supposed to be kind of like the it
girl especially in the first season
after Alison died she kind of goes under
Alison's wings she kind of grew up being
under Alison so that's why I feel that
Alison and Hanna's looks are very
similar so they're kind of you know
dressed very put together and very
stylish that is the look for today I
really really hope you guys like all the
looks that I put together again let me
know if you think in the comments below
and my last part of my pretty little
liars fashion series will be Emily and
that will be the next video so make sure
you stay tuned for that
and leave any comments you have or
questions in the comment box below and I
will see you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
