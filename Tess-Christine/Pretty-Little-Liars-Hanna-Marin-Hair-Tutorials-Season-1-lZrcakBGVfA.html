Little Liars inspired hair tutorial and
the character I chose to do today was
Hanna Marin I had a lot of requests to
do a Hanna inspired hair tutorial so I
decided to do her kind of like everyday
hair I know she's been changing it up a
lot in this season but I kind of did to
her just everyday loose kind of fun soft
curls that I know I think a lot of you
would want to see and then I did a fun
hairstyle from last this last episode
father knows best the father-daughter
one a very kind of tricky hairstyle so
it might take a little bit of practice
but it's this one that I'm wearing right
now obviously and it has a fun braid
right here and then it comes it kind of
droops to this side
and then brings it into a fishtail braid
and that kind of lays over top of the
hair and it's very different from
anything that I've ever done
so that's why I wanted to do it so I
threw that into the end I know I'll have
a lot of comments so about the other
characters and I will eventually do the
other characters Spencer and Emily are a
little bit iffy because they do wear
their hair straight a lot so if you have
specific photos or anything where their
hair is a little bit different other
than straight please send it to me
either on Facebook or Twitter because
I'll be able to see them a lot more and
kind of know what you guys are talking
about but I really hope you like this
tutorial please let me know what you
think in the comments below and I'll see
you guys next time bye everyone
to begin I'm going to split my hair into
two sections and I'm going to start
working from the back to the front so
I'm going to grab a section from the
back and start curling that using a
clipless curling iron now you don't have
to use a clipless curling iron you can
just use a curling iron and just make
sure that you don't use the clamp the
reason why I'm not using the clamp is
because they want the curls to look kind
of messy at the end and not so put
together and if you were to use a clamp
with the curling rod you would get more
of a precise more formal curl and that's
not how Hannah's hair is so I'm just
gonna do this every other process
throughout my whole head so basically
all I'm doing is one strand I'm curling
away from my face and the other student
I'm curling to my face this will prevent
the curls from sticking together and
creating more of a uniformed look this
this will just keep the look messy and
look a little bit more natural which is
what Hannah's hair looks like so again
I'm just going to repeat this process
until I finish this side of my head now
once you have finished curling this side
do not touch it don't really play with
it just spray it with hairspray don't
run your fingers through it yet you're
just gonna let them cool like that while
you do the other side of your head so
that's what I'm going to do now I'm
gonna do the exact same thing on this
side curl it every other which way and
just repeat this throughout this side of
my head
now once I'm finished I'm going to
finish by spraying this side of my head
with hairspray very lightly because you
still want to be able to work with it
now Hannah's hair isn't crazy teased but
I am gonna give my hair a little bit of
volume because hers definitely has some
volume so with the teasing brush I'm
just going to lightly tease the crown of
my head and next I'm just going to very
lightly run my fingers through the curls
just to give them more of a softer
texture and make them look a little bit
more natural and that is it now time for
look number two for this look I'm gonna
start out by combing out all the curls I
just created obviously went through
these both in the same day I just did so
I'm just gonna make sure they're not as
precise as before now I'm going to take
a section of my hair next pretty close
to my bangs and I'm gonna begin French
braiding Matt and I don't have a
tutorial on how to French braid your
hair I kind of assume most of you guys
know how but if you are interested in
that please let me know
now I'm gonna French braid this down
just about to eye level and then I'm
gonna stop French braiding it and just
regular braid it all the way down the
Strand now once I'm finished with that
I'm just gonna pin it and kind of get it
out of the way it's not gonna stay
exactly here but just to get it out of
my way to work with the other side so
now I'm just going to take a little bit
of hair down just to make it look a
little bit more messy and her hair was
actually braided quite intricately back
here but I decided to just twist it and
make it a little bit easier for everyone
because you can kind of achieve the same
look that way and with that I'm just
going to twist that hair all the way
down and I'm going to bring it
underneath the hair that I have and with
that section of hair I'm going to begin
fishtailing now again I don't have a
tutorial on fishtailing hair if any of
you are unfamiliar with what that is I
can definitely make a tutorial for it
but I'm basically just going to continue
fishtailing
fishtail braid this all the way down
that strand until I get to the very end
next with a little elastic I'm just
going to secure that at the bottom once
I have that there I'm just going to
unpin the braid that I had before gather
them both together and I'm just going to
take another small plastic
elastic and basically just tie those
together until it kind of feels tight
and secure on your head then I'm going
to pull those two strands apart and lift
the tail over and underneath the loop
that I just created this will allow the
fishtail braid to lay directly on top of
your hair and that is the finished look
it'll take some practice a little bit to
get the fishtail quite right but at
least for me it did but that is the
finished look I really hope you guys
liked it and I will see you all in my
next video thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
