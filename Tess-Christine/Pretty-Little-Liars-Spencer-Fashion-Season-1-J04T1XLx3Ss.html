is going to be my second video of my
pretty little liars fashion series the
last video I did was Aria so if you
haven't seen that one you should
definitely go check that out and I'll
link it in the description box below
but today's video is going to be Spencer
and I have to admit I had a little bit
of trouble putting together a look for
Spencer because she dresses nothing like
me she dresses very preppy very New York
preps little kind of a Gossip Girl kind
of feel and I don't dress like that at
all she just is very kind of like she
went through her mom's closet and got
her mom's old Chanel shirt or something
so she dresses very like old-school
old-school glamorous I guess but I did
put together some looks that were
inspired by her I had a things in my
closet that I kind of put together that
kind of looked like something Spencer
was where she kind of has an equestrian
feel to her as well so I definitely had
some of that so I'm very excited for you
guys to see this because it's very
different from my last Pretty Little
Liars fashion video which is Aria that
one was very very different from this
but yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video I got a lot of good comments
and a lot of good feedback from my Aria
fashion video and a lot of you guys
wanted to see more of the girls so
that's why I am doing Spencer and I'll
do Emily and Hanna next so and a lot of
you guys were saying you wanted to see
Alison I'm not sure if I'm gonna do her
because I don't see her enough to kind
of know what her style as she dresses
very similar to Hanna I feel like so if
I can't think of stuff I might do Alison
but I'm not sure I really really hope
you guys enjoy this video please let me
know what you think in the comments
below and leave any comments questions
anything like that in the comments below
and give me a thumbs up and I will see
you in my next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
