and I will see you guys in my next video
bye guys to begin I'm starting out by
priming my eyes using a shimmery eye
primer and I'm just going to place this
directly onto my lids to make sure that
my eyeshadow stays on all night next
taking a very gold shimmery color from
The Naked 2 palette I'm just going to
Pat that on my lid
and I'm just going to focus this
directly onto my lid and build it to the
intense color of gold that I like next
taking a matte soft brown color I'm just
going to use that in the crease as a
transition color to my brow bone
next I'm going to be taking a piece of
tape and I'm just going to kind of press
that on my hand a little bit just to get
the sneaky stickiness off of it and I'm
just going to create a sharp line from
the end of my eyelid out to create a
very sharp outer V shape next I'm taking
this shimmery dark brown color and with
a flat top I shadow brush I'm just going
to Pat that into my outer corner having
the tape there will ensure that the
Browns not going to smudge outside of it
and I'll give you a very defined line
when you take the tape off now I'm
taking a matte black color and I'm just
going to place that on the very outer
corner of my lid just to darken the look
a little bit more make sure you focus
this on the outer corner just to give
them more smokey effect and it's not a
big deal if you get it on the tape
either that's what it's for so now with
the same brush that we use that soft
brown color you're just going to smoke
that out a little bit or kind of blend
it out and you're going to keep the tape
on it while you're blending it just so
it kind of doesn't go on your face
anymore
now you're going to remove the tape and
you're going to get this very nice
defined line and so now taking a matte
beige color I'm just going to take a
fluffy brush and put that onto my brow
bone and use it to kind of smooth out
that harsh line a little bit you don't
want to smooth it too much because then
the tape was kind of pointless but just
enough to where it's not very harsh now
going in back with that gold color I'm
just going to take a pencil brush and
focus that on my inner corner and then
taking the dark brown color again I'm
going to focus that on the outer corner
of my lower lash line and I'm also going
to use the black to do it on the very
outer corner of my lash line just to
darken the look a little bit more now
I'm taking an eyeliner and I'm just
going to line my waterlines
now with a felt tip liquid liner I'm
just going to line my top eyelid very
very softly with this eyeliner so I'm
just going to create a very small line I
don't want it to be too intense but I'm
definitely going to do it enough to
where it defines my eyes and I'm also
going to slightly wing it out at the end
just cut just to kind of match the line
that we created with the tape now I'm
going to curl my eyelashes in
preparation for false eyelashes
obviously these are optional I just
think they're kind of a fun excuse to
wear them at prom so I chose to use
these dummy eyelashes that I purchased
at Target and I'm just going to place
that onto my upper lash line
once the lashes are dry I'm just going
to apply a couple coats of mascara to
blend in my real eyelashes with my fake
ones now taking a soft pink blush a very
kind of muted blush I'm just going to
place that on the apples of my cheeks
I'm keeping the blush very light because
I'm going to add a bold lip later now if
you're going for more of a nude lip you
can definitely go more intense with your
blush so now for the lipstick I'm taking
this bright fuchsia colored lipstick
from Revlon and I'm just going to place
that onto my lips now I'm using the
patting technique so it's not as intense
as as it would be if you are swiping it
I'm also going to use my finger to kind
of blend it out a little bit more now
taking a kind of glossy lighter pink
color I'm just going to place that with
my finger directly over to the over the
fuchsia to give it a little bit of shine
and kind of mute the very bright pink
that I have on my lips now once you're
finished with that that is the finished
look now let's move on to hair for the
hair I'm using freshly showered and
blow-dried hair and I'm just going to
protect my hair by spraying it with some
heat protectant and then once the heat
protectant is distributed I'm just going
to use a brush to kind of comb out any
tangles now I'm going to section my hair
off in two parts starting from the
bottom to the top I like to start at my
ears for this one and I'm just going to
basically clip that section up
the crossbows antonova the signs
splitting the hair into two sections
from the back I'm just going to split
those next two sections into two and I'm
going to be taking the conner infinity
wand which is a curling wand that gets
skinnier towards the bottom and I'm just
going to wrap the pieces of hair around
the barrel away from my face this look
is going to give you kind of a very
tight spirally curl which i think is
really fun for a formal occasion or
anything like that I think it's really
fun and you can do a lot of different
things with your hair curly like this
and another thing it works great on any
hair type that's why I really like this
curling curling iron because it works
great with thick hair thin hair and also
short versus long hair as well so now
the curling process that I'm using for
this is very very simple
all I'm doing is the same thing on both
sides I'm just wrapping it away from my
face letting it into two sections I'm
taking fairly large sections because I
don't want to have the local be very
super curly but I do want it to kind of
have that wave-like effect and by taking
bigger sections of hair it will give you
that more so than taking smaller
sections because the curls will be
tighter in that way so now I'm just
taking my hair down and splitting it
into another section and I'm just going
to basically do the same thing
throughout my entire hair
bring it down
I say
now to give my hair some volume I am
going to tease the crown of my hair I
think this is really important when
you're kind of going for kind of a
formal setting because you want your
hair to be kind of big and full and you
can do a lot more with it and do
different kind of updos with it as well
so I'm just taking a wide toothed comb
and I'm just going to gently comb up the
girls just to kind of blend them in
together I just think this gives a very
pretty and natural look now if you want
to you can leave your hair like this and
just kind of keep it down if you want to
I think this is very pretty as well
otherwise I'll show you kind of a
different way to change it up so I'm
just taking a small section from one of
the sides of my hair and I'm just going
to basically just braid that all the way
down starting from about eye level now
all I'm going to do is bring that back
to the middle of my hair and simply
secure it with a bobby pin
now another section of my hair I'm just
going to do the exact same thing so just
take kind of like a medium section from
your hair and begin braiding it I
leveled down and then once you're done
with that you're just going to meet it
in the back with the other one and just
kind of simply pin that in place as well
this is kind of just like a simple twist
to just your hair being down I think
it's really pretty and I think this kind
of look looks great with strapless
dresses so as you can see the braid in
the back gives it kind of a nice little
formal touch to it
and that is it for the hair now let's
move on to the dress this dress is
seriously one of my favorites favorite
dresses I wish I had owned it when I was
in prom because I think it is seriously
the cutest dress ever I love the gold
detailing on it I think it's really
really pretty and it is very comfortable
I just feel like so fun and girly in
this dress and I absolutely love it
night like I said before I love the gold
detailing mixed with the cream I just
think it is so pretty
so yeah that is pretty much it for this
tutorial I really hope you guys liked it
and helped you out for prom ideas have a
very happy prom and I'll talk to you
guys next time
