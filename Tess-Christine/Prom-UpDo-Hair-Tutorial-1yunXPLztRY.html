in today's video is going to be a prawn
hair tutorial this is my model Jenny
hey guys she is my other roommate she
was in the broom move dance with me if
you guys saw that video but I decided to
do the hair look on her today because I
thought it would be a little bit easier
for you guys to see what the hair look
is and instead of me doing it on myself
with like hands getting in the way and
that sort of thing so that would be
easier for you guys to see because this
look is very very easy all it is is just
you wanna turn yep it's just a French
braid on the side and it leads them to
you know like a up do curly updo that I
pinned up with tons and tons of bobby
pins hey Enzo is very easy for you know
you and a friend to do at home because
it really all it is is a French braid
into a ponytail you curl the ponytail
and then just pin the curls in so
obviously you'll be able to see it a
little bit better in the video but um
yeah and I did this look actually on
Christina my other roommate for one of
her formal events that she had here at
the University so um I thought she
really loved it and I thought it was
really cool too so I decided I wanted to
share it with you and this look would be
very easy and all for you and a friend
to do or even if you liked it to take it
to take a picture of it you know to like
a hair salon I'll put a picture in the
bottom bar if I can figure that out and
you can print it off and bring it to you
know your hairstylist or whatever and
she can do the look on you cuz it's very
very easy um but yeah I guess there's
not much else to it I really really hope
you guys enjoy this tutorial let me know
what you think in the comments below and
yeah let's get into the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
