exciting video for me and as you guys
can tell by the title I'm gonna be in
the next issue of girls life magazine
now I was super excited about this
because they asked me if I would create
kind of like a nighttime or a smoky eye
look for like a homecoming dance or even
just a night out so I came up with this
smokey purple eye look that I thought
was super fun and this is the look
that's gonna be featured in the magazine
that you can purchase next month girls
life kind of wanted me to just make a
video in general recreating the eye look
should go along with their magazine
article so I really hope you guys like
this look it's kind of stepping out of
the comfort zone for me because you know
me I'm not the type of person to use a
ton of color but since purple is my
favorite color I thought I would use it
for this look and I thought it would be
kind of perfect to change up kind of
your everyday kind of night out look or
even just for a dance kind of to change
it up and add a little bit of farm-in
color to it so I really hope you guys
like it I want to give a huge shout out
to you guys and thanking you guys
without you guys watching my videos and
subscribing to my channel girls life
never would have you know found me on
YouTube so it really means a lot to me
that you guys are watching my videos and
helping me and kind of supporting me and
on success like this this is really
awesome for me so thank you guys so much
love you guys please keep on watching if
you're interested and I will see you
guys in my next video bye guys
to begin I'm priming my eyes to ensure
that my eyeshadow doesn't crease or come
off throughout the night next I'm taking
this light lavender shade and dusting
that onto my lids and extending it a
little bit into my crease building it up
until I'm satisfied with the purple
color that I have now taking a purple
plum color I'm just gonna use a crease
brush to place that into my crease I'm
going to work this shadow into my crease
by using windshield wiper motions and
extending it outwards to create an outer
V shape I'm also using this brush to
blend to make sure that the colors get
kind of a gradient effect and I'm also
going to take that same plum colored
shade and sweep that onto my lower lash
line
now I'm also gonna take that light
purple shade and sweep that on the inner
half of my lower lash line to balance
out the look now to deepen the look even
more I'm just gonna take this matte
black color and with a flat top I shadow
brush I'm just gonna create kind of an
outer V shape with it and kind of blend
it into the two purple colors that I
placed before this is obviously optional
but this is just gonna deepen the look
if you want to have your eye shadow give
a more a smokier effect I'm also gonna
go back in with that same crease brush
and blend it in together to make sure
that the colors all blend together next
I'm blending the shimmery neutral shade
on my brow bone and into my inner corner
to soften any harsh lines created with
the plum color that we placed before if
you would like you can add eyeliner I'm
just taking this black eyeliner pencil
and lining my top eyelash line as well
as my waterline I'm also gonna blend in
that top eyelash line with a flat top
eyeshadow brush and I'm just going to
kind of smudge it into my lashline to
give a smoky effect
lastly I'm curling my eyelashes and
applying mascara to my top lashes as
well as my bottom lashes and after
you've completed that the look is
complete I really hope you guys liked it
don't forget to check out girls like and
thank you all so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
