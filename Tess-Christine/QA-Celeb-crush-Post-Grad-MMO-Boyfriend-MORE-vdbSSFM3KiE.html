you're new if you're new welcome this
video is perfect for you guys to watch
if you are new because it's a
question/answer video I love these I
asked you guys on my Facebook Twitter
and Instagram
just send me questions of things you
wanted to know about me all the beauty
fashion related questions that you guys
asked me
I'm gonna save four different videos
because I'm doing like a whole favorites
video on that with giveaways and stuff
so it's gonna be really fun so just look
out be on the lookout for those but
today's video is just kind of like
personal questions I love these I think
they're really fun for you guys to get
to know me more and for me to get to
know you because you guys comment and
tell me things that we have in common or
just general questions and then I can
answer them I just think these are so
much fun I got my handy-dandy laptop
here for all my questions so I'm just
gonna kind of like pick some off of here
and how I picked these questions was I
just kind of picked like the ones that
were asked the most frequently cuz a lot
of you guys ask the same questions okay
so the first question is how do you feel
about hosting make me over on
awesomeness TV did you move to LA to
film with them or are you going to fly
there all the time I thought this person
hurt I thought this was a perfect
question to start with because I got a
ton of questions about this if you did
already know I am going to be the new
host of make me over on Ausmus TV you
don't know what that is it's a really
really cool show on there where guys and
girls that send in video submissions
asking to be made over and the reasons
why they want to and then myself now and
then Taylor and Robbie the hair and
makeup glam squad we give them a
makeover of kind of like the look they
were going for it's a super fun show so
if you haven't watched that you
definitely should so a lot of you guys
were asking me how I was feeling about
hosting it and I'm so so so so so so so
excited I think it's an amazing show I
love it but I was terrified like I am so
nervous you guys don't already know
Bethany and Ingrid Mac Barbie and
missglamorazzi were the previous hosts
before me so as you guys can probably
imagine those are very large shoes to
fill so I kind of
was like oh my gosh I cannot believe I'm
doing this ah it's a very very scary to
kind of come into a show where you know
you're not as well known on YouTube as
the previous two hosts so coming into a
show with viewers that may not know who
I am is very nerve-wracking because you
know like I I develop a relationship
with you guys you guys are my friends I
love you guys and then it's like going
in somewhere new where had nobody really
knows you or your personality it's just
kind of hard you know so I'm a little
bit nervous about that but overall and
really really excited to be the new host
I think it's gonna be so much fun and I
really hope you guys all support me over
there and comment and say hi and give me
a thumbs up and everything I could
really really use your support well the
second part of that question was did you
move to LA to film with them or are you
gonna fly there all the time and the
answer is that I am going to fly there
when I need to film more episodes I live
in Minnesota in case you were unaware of
where I live and that is where I live
and that's where I'm staying for right
now moving on to the next question it is
did you ever think you would be this
much of a success when you first started
making videos I never thought I would
get as many viewers as I have now to
some I may not have a lot at all but to
me when I first started this thing I
never thought people would really take
the time to watch and find me
interesting at all so did I ever think I
would have this many viewers and this
many people supporting me absolutely not
if you would have asked me that two
years ago I would have laughed in your
face I would have said no way this next
question is what is your new year's
resolution and that for sure is YouTube
I definitely want to get a more
consistent flow of videos I want to
start putting them up more during the
week I love making videos no matter what
I just want them to be entertaining for
you guys and I want to do exactly what
you want to see so I think my new year's
resolution is definitely making my
YouTube videos better and more frequent
this next question is from Brooke and
it's when you go to the mall what are
stores you must shop at and if we're
going off the mall that I have where I
live
for sure packs Sun I love pack Sun I
just love the style of clothes there
they're definitely my style Macy's and
then Target we have a target at our mall
so definitely Target Macy
son are like the three stores that I
would probably choose to go to first so
this next question is from Karen and it
is tell us more about your boyfriend so
instead of me blabbering on about him I
finally convinced him to do the
boyfriend tag yay so all of you guys who
sent me boyfriend questions on all of my
social networking sites I'm just gonna
kind of take those and bring those over
to the boyfriend tag and we'll answer
those together they'll be really fun
you'll get to find out how we met how
long we've been dating that whole fun
boyfriend tag stuff so that's gonna be
coming very very soon this next question
is what is your must-haves that you
cannot leave your house without that for
sure is my cell phone besides that
probably my wallet I mean really I'm a
pretty simple girl so I don't need like
a ton of stuff I don't even really have
makeup in my purse ever so it's usually
usually just my wallet and my phone and
my keys all right now this was a really
really popular question from a lot of
you and it is hey Joss I would like to
know now that you have graduated from
college what are your future plans the
main thing that I'm gonna do since a lot
of you guys were asking is YouTube um
YouTube has just been so amazing for me
it's opened up so many doors and on top
of that I really really love it not only
do I love just kind of like talking to
you guys but I love filming I love
editing like stuff like that is I'm
really really passionate about so I just
kind of want to hone in and advance my
skills and all of this and kind of like
figure out my niche and make these
things better but I did go to school for
public relations and marketing I'm
pretty sure that's another question so I
do eventually want to get involved with
that field I can't say exactly when coz
I'm not really sure I don't have a plan
set up but as of right now YouTube is my
main priority and later on I will find a
more steady permanent career this next
question is from Lizzie and it is what
is your favorite thing to wear are you
more of a winter or summer person do you
prefer summer clothes or winter clothes
definitely summer I'm so much more of a
summer girl than a winter girl I
appreciate the snow I love the snow I
think it's fun for a little bit but then
after a while I'm just kind of like over
it and love summer weather I mean
that's kind of why I want to move
somewhere with warmer weather because I
love the warmth and the Sun and the
beach this next question is what is your
favorite music movie or TV show of the
moment so I'm just gonna pick one
because I'm pretty sure somebody else
asked me the TV show but my favorite
movie of the moment I just recently
watched frozen I think it's so so cute
and it's just the one that comes to the
top of my head right now because I
recently just saw it but I'm such a
movie buff I love all different types of
movies so but at the moment I've been
having frozen music stuck in my head for
the past couple days so I've really been
liking that one right now this next
question is do you have brothers and
sisters and yes I do I have one brother
he is younger I posted a photo or two on
Instagram of him he is 19 but he is in
the Navy so I don't see him as often as
I would love to but he's in the Navy
right now and he's doing what he loves
so I'm so happy for him but I don't get
to see him as much so that's probably
why you guys don't see him very much so
those are all the Facebook questions
that I picked now I'm going to move on
to Twitter the first Twitter question is
what is your favorite Disney movie like
the Disney movie classics
I love Aladdin and Little Mermaid I
remember when I was a little girl I
would always want to watch either of
those two Little Mermaid I think was
topped Aladdin just a little bit I loved
Arielle I loved her so much
oh and Lion King by far Lion King I
can't believe I almost forgot that one
this next question is have you ever
wanted to make funny videos or just hair
and makeup videos um I don't find myself
very funny and I don't think I could
attract a audience that would be
interested in my humor so no I would
never probably do that only because I
only kind of started YouTube because I
love hair and makeup so it's kind of my
thing I kind of want to stick with it I
think it's really fun and I don't even
know what I would do for a funny video
so the next question is do you like to
play video games haha I think the only
video games I really enjoy playing are I
love playing just dance I don't know if
you can really count that as a video
game
I would say yeah and then at my
boyfriend's house I play Mario Kart I'm
always Yoshi because he's my favorite
because he's so he cooked this next
question is best advice for someone who
just started a YouTube channel or wants
to start a YouTube channel I think my
best advice would probably be to make
sure that you're doing it for the right
reasons and also a huge thing is that
you want to make sure that you're
staying true to yourself I know that
sounds so cliche and over said but if
you're not being yourself it's gonna be
really really hard to handle criticism
or negative comments handling negative
comments is always hard but I think it's
especially hard if you're just kind of
trying to figure out who you are so I
think if you're really confident with
who you are as a person and you just
kind of want to share your personality
and your talents with the world then I
think you should but this next question
is from Kara and it's best life advice I
think the thing that I've learned is
that you can't please everyone and
sometimes if you're kind of the
personality that I am you really want to
make everyone happy and you just want to
do everything right and you kind of have
to accept the fact that you're not gonna
be liked or somebody's gonna have a
certain opinion about you if you can't
please every everybody with everything
that you do in the end you have to do
what makes you happy and what makes you
a better person and if you think that
what you're doing makes you a better
person then that's really all that
matters this next question is from
Jessica and it is a favorite hair style
natural straight or curled um my hair is
naturally up right now it's just kind of
thrown up in this messy bun but I really
love curling my hair I've always really
loved it this next question is from
Michelle and it is was it hard balancing
college and YouTube definitely a hundred
percent yes it was so challenging to
kind of get on the schedule because if
you guys are in college and you know
your schedule changes by semester at
least in my college it did so it's kind
of hard to create a youtube schedule for
yourself like an upload schedule when
you're when your class schedule is
constantly changing I'm so glad I did it
um but I'm really glad that now I don't
have to worry about balancing both this
next question is from Haley and it is
what are your favorite videos to make by
my favorite videos to make our fashion
videos or get the look videos they also
are my most challenging videos to make
because they take the most time I'm so
sorry you guys look son keeps going in
and out of the clouds fits awful this
next question is what was your favorite
thing about studying abroad in Europe
and my favorite thing by far was getting
to travel to different countries and
just trying new things there and like
experiencing culture every place I went
I loved that you guys didn't know I
studied abroad while I was in college my
junior year and I made a whole video on
it so I will have that linked below this
next question is from Savannah and it is
have you ever been to a concept before
and if so who did you see yes I have
been to a concert before I went to Jesse
McCartney when was my first concert ever
ever when I was in like middle school
like seventh grade and then I did Jonas
Brothers concerts they were my favorite
in high school I kind of explained that
all in my draw my life video but
definitely I loved boy bands but I still
do that's my faith this next question is
from Sophia and it is how old are you
and if you are unaware of how old I am I
am 22 which I get chuffing comments all
the time like oh my god you look so much
younger so I know I probably don't look
like 22 to you guys but I am 22 this
next question is from Kyla and it is if
you could switch closets with one
celebrity who would it be
my three favorite celebrity styles are
Kendall Jenner
Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande so if I
could switch closets with one of those
three or all of them I'd be one happy
girl this next question is are you a
team Stellina or team Delana and who's
your favorite character on the Vampire
Diaries
um yeah I love The Vampire Diaries it's
one of my favorite shows and I'm
definitely team stelae and I love Stefan
and Elena together they've always been
my favorite but then the second half the
question is who is your favorite
character and it's Damon
I think he's hilarious I also really
like Bonnie too
this next question is can you sing no I
cannot I think I can sing in the car or
in the shower so I belted out like I'm
Ariana Grande
something like you should see me singer
sounds like I think they I think I can
sing like her oh my gosh it's awful if
anyone heard me it would be bad it would
be so bad okay so that is it for Twitter
now I'm going to move on to Instagram
and Instagram was the one that I got so
many questions on so I had to really
limit them down this first question is
is there a quote that you live by
yes I love the quote everything happens
for a reason
I always like to live by that I don't
know why I just think it brings me peace
if anything ever happens to go wrong or
something that just happens in my life
it's kind of like this was meant to be
is just a really kind of like positive
one to live by next question is how tall
are you and I am five four and a half
moving on it is what inspired you to
start YouTube we love you in England by
the way and I love you guys in England
so shout out basically I loved always
doing hair and makeup I've always really
enjoyed it and so I watched YouTube
videos before and I was kind of like you
know what I feel like I can do what
those girls are doing like I feel like
they can do that and so my roommate was
just kind of like you should just upload
a video so I did and then I got a lot of
positive feedback and so then I just
kept uploading them and uploading them
and then now I'm here are you planning
to do a bikini ready or workout video
and yes I'm doing a health and fitness
video very very soon I get so many
requests for that video I think it's a
great idea for video health and fitness
is very very important to me I'm just
kind of tuning out the fine details and
I'm gonna get that up very very soon for
you guys what are your favorite TV shows
Vampire Diaries yes I love that show
Pretty Little Liars you guys know those
two for sure
I love Modern Family I also just started
watching the Carrie Diaries on Netflix
which I really really enjoy guilty
pleasures is the next question
Disney Channel shows I still watch
Disney Channel and I'm twenty-two years
old so that's a guilty pleasure and The
Bachelor this next question is if you
had a chance to move somewhere which
country would you choose and that's a
really really hard question to answer
because I love to travel like traveling
is my favorite things so if I could live
somewhere where I could just easily
travel to different places and like go
experience new things that would be
amazing
who is your fave
actor actor as in male definitely
definitely definitely Leonardo DiCaprio
and Johnny Depp both of those two blow
me away every time I see them in the
movies I love them so much oh my gosh
they are amazing actors and for female I
love Rachel McAdams can you say hi to
Mira hi Mira what was your favorite
childhood TV show definitely when I was
a kid I loved Lizzie McGuire and that's
a Rain Man I still would love those if
they were still on TV this one I thought
was super funny and random but it was
favorite High School Musical movie and
it is the second one for sure when
they're all at like that Country Club
working in the summer that was my
favorite childhood celebrity crush and
current one I loved Justin Timberlake I
loved Nick Jonas and now I'm loving on
Harry Styles
so I celebrity crushes have always been
from a boyband I've always loved them um
so yeah but I love like Johnny Depp has
like a mysterious like attractiveness
about him or like Channing Tatum because
who doesn't love him maybe a lot of
people but I love him a lot of celebrity
males are attractive to me so they're
all up there if you could spend a day
with a celebrity who would it be
I'm gonna be pretty pretty generic with
this answer because I could go on about
many different celebrities but One
Direction I love them they're adorable
they look like such fun guys I could
hang out with them for a day and that
would be so easy like how much fun could
you possibly have with One Direction it
would be awesome yes please and then
after that which is so weird that I just
slipped to this question that's if you
could meet someone from one direction
who would it be
but I can't answer that because I've
already met them I met them a year and a
half ago at Mall of America my friend
and I waited in line for a CD signing
and we got to meet them they were super
super nice and they ain't even called me
pretty so I'm taking that to heart but
I'd love to meet them again because it
was it's been a while since I've met
them they've changed significantly in
appearance
they were always cute but they look so
much different now so I would love to
see them but Harry
my favorite I love him this next
question is what you should you start
wearing makeup in middle school so
seventh grade I would never wear like a
full face of makeup
I don't always just kind of experiment
with eyeshadows and lipsticks and lip
gloss I never really wore that much
until high school and then I started
getting into more makeup this one I
thought was really really funny it was
if you could get offered a cookie by
anyone of choice who would you like it
to be I thought this was super funny and
it would definitely be any of my male
celebrity crushes I could get handed buy
a cookie buy any of them and it would be
amazing and I bet it would be the best
cookie I ever ate only because it was
handed to me by Harry Styles there
Channing Tatum or Justin Timberlake or
any of those hot nails this next
question is what kind of superpower do
you want to have I think it'd be really
fun to have the superpower I don't even
know what it's called but you could like
teleportation you could like take
yourself somewhere else that could be
like snap my fingers and be like I wanna
be in England and I could just like go
there you know what I mean like you
could that'd be so cool if you have the
superpower with like the snap of your
fingers you could just go anywhere you
wanted and you didn't have to like take
an airplane or anything crazy or drive
or anything you could just stab your
fingers and you be there I think that'd
be so cool if you could be best friends
with one celebrity who would it be
umm it would probably be either Jennifer
Lawrence or Ayanna Grande I'm Jennifer
Lawrence would be hilarious like she
would be the best best friend ever like
how could you not want to be best
friends with her she is so funny every
time I see her either in an interview or
on the red carpet I just love her she's
awesome and I feel like we'd be best
friends if she wasn't a celebrity um
she's just so fun she looks like such a
fun person to hang out with and then
ariana grande she just seems like a
super fun and she'll girl to she seems
so just fun to be around her and her
family like Frankie oh my god they just
seem like so much fun and she it just
seems really down-to-earth then yeah so
the last question is I'm starting
college in the fall do you have any tips
for me and I think my biggest tip would
be to have fun obviously make time to
study and be organized and get your work
done but don't forget to have fun who
says you have to grow up just cuz you're
in college you're a kid like it's still
so much fun and as long as you're
responsible
get your work done and you know be a
good student just have fun don't rush
through it travel meet new people be
open to new things that's my biggest
advice is just to be open and excited
and just willing to have fun so that
concludes my question answer video I

friends here so it's always fun when you
