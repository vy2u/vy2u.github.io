channel today's video is going to be a
Q&amp;amp;A as you can tell and it's been about
a year since I've done a Q&amp;amp;A video so I
figured I was probably doing for anyone
especially because I was seeing a lot of
frequently asked questions on my
Instagram and on YouTube comments and
things like that so as always I posted a
photo on my Instagram and asked you guys
to leave all the questions you wanted
answered in the comments below and I got
quite a few and quite a quick pillow I
got quite a few of the same questions
which is awesome made my life so much
easier because I can narrow down the
ones you guys really wanted to know and
I'm gonna answer them for you guys today
I'm literally sat on the floor so if it
looks a little weird and not normal
that's just because I felt like standing
felt a little too formal for a Q&amp;amp;A and I
just wanted to sit and chill and answer
your questions so let's get started so
the first and the number one question
but I'm not even a click beat you guys
to the end of the video and I'm just
gonna answer it right away
this one got asked so much every other
comment this one was asked so much in so
many different ways meaning like when's
the wedding are you getting married in
New York or Minnesota have you started
planning are you gonna film any of it
all of all of the questions so Pat and I
have always said that we want to get
married kind of like end of fall or end
of summer early fall and when we came
back from Ireland after we got engaged
and started looking at venues we
realized that planning a wedding for
this summer and of summer even fall was
gonna be pretty tight because there's so
many things you have to do in advance we
really wanted to enjoy the wedding
process and one wedding planning process
being that we only plan to do this once
in our lives and something that I really
wanted to do was take you guys along
with the planning process and it was
just gonna be too rushed because
answering one of the other questions we
are planning on getting married in
Minnesota so when it comes to the
question of what we've planned so far
the venue check that's like the main
thing the venue and the date we got that
zeroed in squared away our names are on
it a lot of the questions were am I
thinking you guys along with me on the
way
planning process and yes that was my
main thing I really wanted you guys to
not only selfishly so I can look back on
the memories but also because I know
stuff like that is very intimidating as
a new bride especially so having tips
and tricks on like what I did so I'm
gonna take you guys along as bridesmaids
my dresses stress shopping at least cake
tasting finding all of that fun stuff
it's gonna be really fun for me to vlog
but also show you guys so this summer
you guys will see us ask our wedding
party in a really fun creative ways
which I will do a whole video on which
I'm very excited for so that's the big
question
we are movin and shakin and gettin all
the wedding stuff sorted but a question
relating to the two wedding and
engagements that I really wanted to
answer because it's a little bit more
not about me and just in general my
opinion you are still in your 20s do you
consider being 26 as engaged young if
you do how do you handle it it's
something that I want to say it's like
everyone's on their own timeline and
just because maybe like your closest
friend has a really committed
relationship and they're really close to
being engaged but you're like super
single like you shouldn't feel bad about
that because you're just like your
timeline is like you're just not ready
yet
and so I feel like everybody has
different timelines and I just don't I
don't want anyone to like look at my
life and like me being gay engaged at 26
and like planning a wedding to be like
oh my gosh I'm super behind on my life
because no you're not I wanted to really
put that out there because I know social
media can show a lot of like the
highlight reel and I know there's a lot
of things that aren't said with that
kind of stuff and I just feel like I
really wanted to to say that like don't
feel bad girl if you're single like a
lot of my friends are and then a lot of
my friends have babies like everybody
has their own time that make sense
we both kind of said we want two kids
and we're very excited to have kids
we're not gonna rush into it right after
we get married but we've definitely
talked about soonish after we get
married but you know it's along the
lines is the timeline thing that I was
talking about like I might have trouble
getting pregnant I don't know how it's
gonna go maybe it'll happen right away
who knows but that's something that
obviously I share a lot with you guys or
at least I try to for the most part and
I think once you know that part of our
life starts happening I think my channel
will definitely switch up a little bit
you know I'm gonna be showing you how to
rock a pregnant belly and like cute
outfits so yeah you guys definitely will
know as far as raising kids in New York
City this is stuff Pat and I had
actually serious conversations about
because it's something that it's very
different from how we grew up we both
grew up in the Midwest very different
than New York City I feel like it's not
one of those things that it's like a
definite yes or a definite no we have
friends like my friend Caitlin she has
an older sister that has two kids and
they live in an apartment and the two
boys have a bunk bed and it's so cute
and they're like such a unit I don't
believe you need like a really big yard
in a really big house to have a good
family and like in eat like it's it's
just something that I don't I I'm okay
with raising kids here it would
definitely be a challenge but I think
we've also talked about moving out of
the city but staying on the East Coast
so it just kind of depends as far as the
clothing line goes I definitely have
moved along a little bit more on that
I've reached out to a few clothing
brands and it's just kind of something
that I can't share too much about I'm
just the type of person that if I'm
gonna have a clothing line I want a lot
of control I don't want to slap my name
on something and and tell you guys it's
mine when I had nothing to do with it
like that's just not something I'll do
so I really want to have a lot of
control and actually design pieces and
create things that are affordable and
awesome
guys so that's something that's
definitely a goal I really want that to
happen so hopefully brands can really
believe in me
if that really how it sounding corny but
it's really it's a lot for a brand do
you take that risk but it's also like
there's a lot of collaboration that
needs to happen to make that work so I
really hope that that's something that's
out in the near future for us it was a
little bit different because we had
YouTube as a platform when we moved so
we knew we had like a definite job while
moving here I know - my friends Carrie
and Julia they went to fashion school
out here and then from the dorms they
just moved into an apartment after they
got jobs but I definitely think the
biggest thing would be to have some sort
of a plan when moving out here as far as
like where your income is coming from
and your job because it is really
expensive there's no beating around the
bush with that like there's like
apartments are so expensive and I saw
one girl ask you know a lot of them look
super rundown when looking for
apartments and they do like I remember
Pat and I looking online and like this
apartment that we're in right now with
all of without all of our added stuff
that makes it feel like a home it just
is like empty walls you know it has a
lot of like cool features but definitely
when looking for apartments Carrie and
Julia's apartment for instance like
Carrie's like it's so ugly but then they
get all their stuff in there and
decorate it really huge and you get kind
of creative and it works now I will say
for Pat and I the hardest thing about
moving to New York was leaving all of
our friends um Pat and I moved straight
out of college basically we both had
separate friend groups because we did
meet in college and then when we just
kind of randomly up and moved to New
York be literally new Carrie and that's
it it was a lot it was a strain on our
relationship for sure that was something
that we really had to overcome because
not only do we see each other a lot for
work but we see each other a lot just
day-to-day especially without having
friends to go to that was really really
difficult and so it took a while it took
almost like a year a year and a half to
make like a solid friend group here so
keep that in mind you're not going to
move here right away and like have like
best friends it's gonna be a little bit
challenging but just
that it's so worth it because New York
is literally the best place to live in
my opinion I love it here I did graduate
from college both Pat and I did I
graduated with a degree in public
relations and marketing so if I wasn't
doing YouTube I can't say I used to
always be like I'd probably be doing
something in that but like you really
don't know especially if like you are
just graduating college you know how
hard it is to apply for jobs I'm only
speaking because a lot of my friends
went through that are still going
through that like to get a job in the
field that you studied is really really
difficult so who knows what I would be
doing if I had my pick I would love I
would have loved to work at something in
fashion whether that was an advertising
company and PR company like anything
with fashion also I always had this like
weird fascination with wanting to be a
chef I don't think I could do it just
because I would have a hard time like
handling meat bad days are really really
shitty honestly Pat really helps he's
really good at making me feel better and
not overthinking I feel like that's one
of the things that I do really like to a
fault
i overthink almost everything and it
really gets me upset and he's really
good about making me feel better I
usually dive into like a show or I
listen to like a good album or something
like that because for me my biggest
thing that has always helped me is like
being distracted I get into my head a
lot and if I sit there and I just like
keep thinking and thinking and thinking
like I'm gonna go crazy but I would love
to have people comments on what helps
them I feel like that's something that a
lot of people deal with and I feel like
it would be really helpful for everybody
is kind of take on that so leave a
comment on what you do when you're
having a bad day
this one for me probably would be that
I'm learning to embrace because I
haven't mastered it I'm not like the
most confident person in the world but
it's definitely me being shy and that
might sound really weird cuz I feel like
you would think I would say like
something physical but for me it's like
I've always hated being the shy girl I
always wanted to be that girl that like
if you walk into a room and like
everybody wants to talk to you you're
like the life of the party like I'm
around like when I'm around people that
I really really love and it's like a
small group like I thrive but when I'm
like out meeting new people I feel like
I go through like these like I get by
clam up I get really nervous it's
something that I've always struggled
with ever since I was young I remember
it really being really bad in high
school I just like hated being the one
starting the conversations I hated going
up in front of class I just always
really really shy and it's something
that I was always insecure about because
it's something that I wanted to change
but it's like so deep-rooted
into me that I can't help it sometimes
and I think I'm learning to just accept
the fact that I am a little bit more
quiet especially around big settings and
I'm working on it and I'm working on not
only like you know being a little bit
more outgoing but also embracing the
fact that I'm not going to be a certain
personality type that I want to because
you can't change that my favorite is the
one he just got would you guys sign my
week in my life those when I last
uploaded it's the Gypsy hand-holding the
Jack of Hearts it's just very Pat for a
lot of different reasons but I
absolutely love it and it was school
because he was really nervous to put
something on his arm and he did it and I
admire him a lot I look up to him for
how much he steps out of his comfort
zone so that's pretty cool and yes I do
want to tattoo I'm really nervous about
it but I definitely want one I love the
look of like single needle like really
tiny tattoos so I think this is the year
that I really want to do it I just got
to send it and do it and if I do I'm
gonna take you guys along with
so if you guys don't know a brief story
of how Carrie and I met she had messaged
me on Twitter I think oh my gosh I'm in
Minnesota you're in Chicago we're so
close and then we just like randomly
decided to like meet up and go shopping
in Chicago like it was such a weird
thing because that was so long ago I
feel like the Internet is so different
now like for instance we met Caitlyn I
think you've seen her in a couple vlogs
we met her on a subway train and she was
like I loved your videos and I was like
cool like we started chatting and then
um yeah then we just kept hanging out
and so it's yeah it's very random how
that happens but it does definitely
still open to it but it's kind of weird
how followers and stuff can like taint
how people think of you and like if they
talk to your and I I'm not to be so
weird at such a weird age that we're
living in now because that exists I
don't know it's weird to me we can all
say it together Vampire Diaries I
absolutely love that show I want to live
in it even though I would probably get
killed I feel like everyone got killed
on that show thing I would have to say
Emma Watson I think she'd do a really
good job being me hopefully and I love
her so yeah this one has been my
favorite for quite a minute and that is
the ace family they are so fun I feel
like everybody knows who they are they
grew so quickly I remember I first
subscribe to them and they had like 1
million maybe are just about to hit 1
million and now they have like 7 they're
insane they're so cool I love them I
want to be best friends with them but
yeah they're awesome
by far at least right now the greatest
showman
I love the greatest showman I also love
zendaya so much I want to be here I
think she's like at the moment my girl
celebrity crush it's always nina dobrev
but I love India she's cool she's really
cool then I also really like the movie
pen I've been going crazy listening to
the soundtrack it's just a good like so
that is it for my Q&amp;amp;A I really hope you
