another Q&amp;amp;A video but this time I
decided to only ask questions on my
Facebook and Twitter so if you want to
be a part of the next Q&amp;amp;A video or want
me to answer your question then just
head over to my Facebook and Twitter and
check out those and I'll definitely
announce it on those when I decide to do
another one and you guys can definitely
take part if I didn't answer your
question today or something like that so
the first question are both from my
Facebook and Twitter and even YouTube
because they're like the most popular
questions asked and that is my age and
my height and my nationality so I'm just
gonna ramble off those right away so my
age I am 20 years old but I'm turning 21
on June 24th my height I am 5'4 and a
half and my nationality I am Irish
polish french-canadian those are like my
main ones but I'm also Norwegian and
Dutch this next one comes from Facebook
and it is who is your favorite youtuber
and that is Daily Grace or grace Helbig
I love her videos and I'm so sad I
didn't find her sooner but I'm super
glad that I found her because I only
found her like a month ago and I was
super excited when I did she is my
all-time favorite her humor is just like
the humor that I enjoy I think she's
hilarious and awesome this next question
comes from Facebook as well and it is if
you could star in a movie with anyone
who would you want to be in it with you
and this one they didn't I guess specify
either if it male or female but I'm just
gonna because my male list would be like
ooh this long and so I couldn't ramble
on but if I could work with one female
actress that would definitely be Rachel
McAdams because she is my all-time
favorite I love her I love every single
movie she's been in pretty much so yeah
she's awesome I would love to start a
movie with her this next question is
another pretty popular one and it came
from both Facebook and Twitter and it is
what is your major and I mentioned this
a few times before in other videos and
in comments but I'm majoring in public
relations with a minor in marketing this
next question comes from Twitter and it
is if you could only shop at one store
for the rest of your life where would it
be if I had unlimited money and it was a
clothing store oh definitely shop at
Topshop I love that store it's like my
favorite store ever if I could afford
everything in there to buy things there
all the time I definitely would but if
I'm just like as I am now it would
definitely be H&amp;amp;M however if it's
everything for the rest of your life not
just clothing it would definitely be
Target this
question comes from Facebook and it is
do you have any pets
and yes I have two cats well technically
they live at my parents house but
they've run my cats since I've been six
years old so they're pretty old this
next question comes from Facebook and it
is were you scared that people would
start making fun of you for posting
videos on YouTube and the answer to this
question is yes at first I was terrified
of it I was very nervous of people
finding out about my YouTube just cuz
it's not the like most I guess normal
thing to do it's not the most typical
thing someone would do is you know post
videos of themselves doing the kind of
stuff that I do on YouTube the people
that have found out about it now love it
and they're really supportive of it so
I'm not too worried and if you're like
worried about starting videos because
people would make fun of you I wouldn't
like keep that from doing what if you
want to do this because I mean you're
not doing anything embarrassing like
thinking about it you're just talking
about makeup and hair and stuff on
YouTube so if you want to start beauty
videos and stuff like don't let that
hold you back cuz it's not like you're
dancing around and underwear on the
computer screen so that would be
embarrassing but this isn't so I
wouldn't worry about it
so this next question comes from Twitter
and it is what is the job of your dreams
and I guess the job of my dreams would
either be to be an actress and I've
always wondered what it would be like to
be in a movie or on TV or something like
that but other than that my other dream
job would be to be do what Giuliana
Rancic does and be like an e
correspondent I love that channel I love
everything about it so I just think it
would be really fun to do her job and
kind of report on news and stuff like
that I just think that would be so much
fun so I'm definitely like doing matter
some sort of like interviewing people
that would be super fun to me so
anything like that this next question
comes from both Facebook and Twitter and
it was what was it like studying abroad
and I have a whole video on this on my
blog channel that I just posted a couple
days ago so if you were interested in
seeing about my experience studying
abroad definitely go check out my blog
channel have it linked in the
description box below so you can
definitely go check it out this next
question comes from Twitter and it is
who is your favorite One Direction
member and I definitely love all of them
I think they're all adorable and cute
and just great I love the whole band I
love them all but I do happen to agree
with these comments a little bit more
this next question comes from Facebook
and it is how many years of college you
have left and I have one and a half
years so I
a year left and a semester left of
college this next question comes from
Facebook and it is any advice for people
who want to start a YouTube channel and
my probably number one advice tip would
be to make sure it's really something
you want to do because it's a big time
commitment and this was actually from
the same question but I'm just gonna
like keep reading on it and it is how to
become successful on YouTube and this is
kind of a tough question because I don't
really know what deems you successful on
YouTube it's kind of hard to like judge
that I guess one thing to maybe get more
views and more subscribers and things
like that is to listen to your viewers
because they're the ones watching your
videos so I always try when I get a ton
of requests I don't ignore them at all
like I've tried to do them that's like
how I make my youtube channel I listen
to requests because obviously there's
things that I want to do you know that
weren't requested that I think you guys
would enjoy but I also make a lot of
time to do the requests that you guys
ask definitely make sure to do that
because I feel like you would get a lot
more views and become I guess a little
bit more successful on YouTube if you're
doing videos that people want to see
this next question comes from Facebook
and it is how old are you when you got
your first job and what was it and I was
16 when I got my first job that's when
we're legally allowed to get a job I
guess and I worked at TGI Fridays as a
hostess this next question comes from
Twitter and it is what is your favorite
place to shop for makeup or wear I think
she might wear but um where's my
favorite place to shop for makeup and
it's definitely Sephora I like don't get
me wrong I really like Mac products and
everything but my favorite place to shop
is Sephora they have an abundance of
makeup you can't go wrong there I just
think they have so many options and so
many good choices there that I love
shopping there but I also really love
drugstore products too still so I really
love target as well or like Walgreens
this next question also comes from
Twitter and it is what was it like
meeting One Direction it was really
really awesome meeting at One Direction
I mean that was the first celebrities
that I've ever met so I was definitely
you know like starstruck and stuff
because that like I said I've never met
a celebrity before besides them so it
was really cool it was a really fun
experience
I guess did like a brief overview of
like what happened we waited in line
that whole day they came out around like
1:00 in the afternoon and you basically
just run through the line it was a CD
signing so that's how I met them and it
was pretty quick pretty I mean you can't
really say much to him I I basically all
I really said to them was like hey how
are you
thanks for coming they like just kind of
said the exact same thing same
compliment to me which I got so excited
about they were so cute in person so I
really liked that it was fun do you have
any advice to get through college and
that is pretty much my number one tip is
time management because in college no
one's kind of like pushing you to do
your homework and one's pushing you to
go to class I wouldn't be too worried
about college you kind of get the hang
of things once you get there this next
question comes from Facebook and it is
would you ever do a meet-up and of
course I would do a meet-up totally I
would totally be interested in that I
just don't live in like a very big area
where most people do meetups if you live
in Minnesota or near Minnesota and would
be interested in doing a meet-up I would
definitely be interested in that so let
me know in the comments below if I ever
decide to like go somewhere and let you
guys know it'll all be through Twitter
what celebrity style do you admire or
relate to the most and this is like
hands-down Selena Gomez she is pretty
much my style in a nutshell I really
like that she dresses casual which is
kind of what I do she dresses casuals
sometimes but then she can get really
dressed up which I totally relate to I
think everything that she wears I would
wear what is your favorite food and this
is hard to narrow it down to one because
I seriously love all foods like I love
food so much so they're not like super
picky with foods but if I could like
narrow it down or like pick some of my
favorites it was definitely something
with chicken in it I love chicken I love
tacos it's probably like the only really
Mexican food that I eat I love tacos I
love pasta and I love grilled cheese
what are your favorite TV shows or what
were they growing up and this is
probably hands-down I mean I was a
Nickelodeon Disney baby I loved the
Rugrats I loved anything like that when
I was in elementary school I loved like
Lizzie McGuire That's So Raven even
Steven's all that kind of stuff I loved
the Disney Channel shows that was my
thing I loved those as of now I really
loved like Pretty Little Liars Vampire
Diaries I loved Modern Family I just
started getting into that recently
that's a hilarious show I love that this
next question comes from Facebook and it
is if you could wake up somewhere
tomorrow where would it be and I think
just because I'm in the whole like
travel bug right now from coming back
from England this last year I think
would probably have to say I would love
to wake up in England just cuz I miss
everything there a lot recently so I
would love to wake up there
tomorrow and stay there for a little bit
I think it would be really fun to go do
that whole experience again this next
question comes from Twitter and it is
would you ever be interested in starting
a blog and yes of course I was actually
thinking about starting one this summer
so if you guys are interested in maybe
like checking out a blog or something if
I would start one I would definitely be
interested in it it would be a lot
easier for me to kind of show you guys
like small stuff or like things that I
wouldn't necessarily make a whole video
on but just like things I find out
through the week or like different tips
and tricks that I discover and I just
want to kind of do like a short little
thing about it and like post pictures
and stuff I'll definitely do that on a
blog and I think that would be a lot
easier to and be able to give you guys a
little bit more information and get like
all your requests out there and kind of
every all your questions answered and
stuff through that too that would be
really cool so yes those are the
questions that I decided to answer from
the questions that I compiled from
Facebook and Twitter if I didn't answer
your question I'm terribly sorry and I
will try to answer it into my next video
if you asked that when I do another one
so yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video got to know a little bit more
about me I hope you all having a
wonderful day and I will see you guys in
my next video
