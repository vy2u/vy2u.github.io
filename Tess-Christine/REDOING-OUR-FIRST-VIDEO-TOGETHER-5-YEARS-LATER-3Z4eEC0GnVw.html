channel today's video already is gonna
be a fun one because you know when it
involves him it's some sort of challenge
video and for this one I thought it
would be really fun we were trying to
think of a new challenge video to do
because a lot of you guys are requesting
it and I was kind of looking back on my
channel to see all the challenges that
we've done and it is just about been 5
years since we found our first ever
video together which was the boyfriend
does my makeup hey everyone today I'm
gonna do the boyfriend does my makeup
day this is my boyfriend Patrick hello
so we thought we would not recreate it
but like redo it and kind of just like
chaps one thing I've learned in these
five years is well I think I've learned
foundation starting with that I feel
like foundation of the solid foundations
is a good place to start
yeah good job and I'm not a painter now
I'm gonna just put it right on here cuz
it's a blending Bowl tool supposed to go
I don't know if you watched a pot I went
back on it this morning when I was like
prepping for this video and we look like
babies
I remember when we were doing that video
well first of all I was so nervous you
can when you see the video I'm like
shaking when I talk also because I was
like just really nervous to have you in
it and I felt like you were
uncomfortable and I was like oh my god
he's gonna think this is so weird
okay what did you think when I told you
I'd make youtube videos and I certainly
didn't think like ooh this is weird if
anything I was like I've never heard
that before that makes you a lot more
interesting than you know something else
not that other things aren't interesting
it was just like this was before like
YouTube was what it is today so I was
like oh wait what like how does how does
this work yeah it's funny because now
when you tell people are like they asked
you like Oh what do you do and I say I
make youtube videos but they're like oh
my god that's so cool how many college
do you have blah blah blah
whereas like when we first met it was
like what even is that like I just
remember being I hid it from all of my
friends question for you are there
multiples of everything here I threw in
a little extras just to like throw you
off but um yeah I think it that's the
point
well it says this is a soft focus
highlight of her face so I mean like
when I'm editing I know like typically
we're kind of those things go so like I
would probably put some like here in
here like on the cheeks although I don't
know if I'm doing this in any correct
order people put it on the nose but
editing need you like try to highlight
that a little bit I had some nice little
bit of I think this is plenty I would
imagine
just kind of taking it down that was
probably like a little too wide I'm in
control of this video man if it make you
look like a cloud that should be kind of
okay just for you I'm gonna try extra
hard right super cute
that video was the first one we ever
filmed together and then what would you
say probably a few months or about a
year after that you started helping me
films yeah maybe did like the pie in the
face well that was fun yeah well enjoy a
pie you in the face yeah sure but we
were like dating for a while then huh
yeah yeah this video we weren't living
together I was still living with my
roommates I think one of my roommates
was like hiding in the other room while
you're filming this like totally making
fun of us and it's funny because you can
tell in my videos when Pat started to
help me because as that video is proof I
did not know a thing about cameras let
alone lighting that video is so
overexposed and my videos still aren't
like when I'm just sitting here like
this they're not like professionally
would I just use the windows but like
you can see specifically when Pat starts
to help me this either for cleaning your
nose or your eyelashes you years up you
would use the tool like that for
cleaning your nose I shouldn't be doing
that is it cheating if I have you put it
on your eye cuz like I don't I just do
you think this goes like if there's an
eyelash curler on the end I would assume
that it goes on your eyes
and I'm supposed to do with this oh no
no no no wait eyebrow the goof proof
brow pencil it apparently isn't goof
proof because I just goo days way you
know you know for some reason I feel
like I'm not putting this in the right
spot
what your eyes I'm gonna I'm gonna brush
this all the way
can I go against your eyebrow should've
put some on what's going on over here
sick way too dark okay at least even go
through glass in the first time we
filmed this you literally put me black
eyeshadow on it this is a super heavy
like almost your name with a black black
just dark it up just a little bit okay
how do I take this off don't like that
at all uh is there a makeup wipe around
here these are like an edit undo button
here you know you just got to go with it
let's go a little bit lighter because we
can always go darker
perfect good do you think you would be
doing YouTube now photo video no didn't
think that far ahead
no it was just kind of like we'll take
it day-by-day and week-by-week
on Sundays like we're still heading it
up and I can tell you this much during
that video we definitely didn't think we
would be living in New York know anytime
soon we were literally just focused on
graduating I don't even think I was
going to be doing YouTube for as long as
I have this sparkly cell
okay awesome is that is that is that it
you're just gonna like oh wait isn't do
that little thing that girls do
and we'll this is not the color I wanted
I'm not even close do you think Oh to
pick them up from the from the color of
the can it fully looked down to it's
tighter so you like a fine line there is
that not a thing anymore
I can do that great bet that you want I
think it'll make it easier for me so
we're just gonna don't want that
altogether sir thank you
is there a preferred removal process for
this just know if I'm gonna do this I'm
gonna do it like I just don't like how
it looks it's not about this bronzer
heck yeah let's bronze your face start
up here
you just accentuated my birthmark like
you're like oh I'd see like I don't know
okay yes this so here isn't like a heat
one under your cheek trying to make you
look pretty
I think this the makeup setting spray is
to make sure doesn't like smudge and do
weird things so close your eyes and miss
for a three to one and a little more on
the other side three two one and just
stay like that for the next half an hour
45 minutes and uh a little bee rack I
went for better than last time
whoops right on your face very natural
we didn't attempt the mouth here this
time huh yeah in besides like I like
your lashes I don't think they need a
whole lot of help I hope you had a fun
time going down memory lane the memory
lane with us thank you for joining us
and watching me struggle through this
makeup reenactment four years ago but we
will see you in our next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
