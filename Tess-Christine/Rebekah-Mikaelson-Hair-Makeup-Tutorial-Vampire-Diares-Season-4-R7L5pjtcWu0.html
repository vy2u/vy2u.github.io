my Vampire Diaries hair and makeup
videos and today is going to be Rebecca
and I'm super excited that I'm finally
able to give you guys a hair and makeup
tutorial for Rebecca because a lot of
you guys have been requesting this for
the past year so I'm super happy that
I'm finally able to get it out the hair
was probably my favorite to do because
I've never shown you guys how to curl
your hair this way before which is like
I have so many videos on how to curl
hair that it was like awesome that I was
finally able to show you guys a
different way to curl it but obviously
Rebecca she's had some episodes where
she's worn it straight and some episodes
where she wears it like this which is
kind of like a loose very loose curl but
it's almost kind of looks like straight
with a little curl at the end and then
these kind of like big wavy curls that
like frame her face and then for the
makeup I chose one of her more dramatic
looks I know and some of the recent
episodes she keeps it a little bit more
natural but I decided to go with
something that was a little bit more
intense and she is kind of like this bad
vampire that just like wreaks havoc on
everybody in the show so I definitely
wanted to do one of her more intense
looks because I thought it would be more
fun don't forget to check out my other
vampire diaries video as well as my
style video that I did for them a while
back so yeah let's get started to begin
with my interpretation of Rebecca's
makeup I'm going to begin by priming my
eyelids of course to make sure that my
eyeshadow stays and next I'm applying a
creamy beige color to my lids is kind of
a base color for this look and I'm just
going to build that up until I'm
satisfied with the color that I have on
my lids now I'm taking a lighter brown
color and placing that into the crease
as kind of a transition color and also
to define my eyes and give a little bit
more of a balance when we're adding the
darker color now to get that dark
defined look that Rebecca has I'm just
going to be taking an eyeshadow pencil
brush and with a black color I'm just
going to be creating an outer V looking
shape this is going to be a kind of a
guideline into how you want to shade the
color into your crease and into the
outer corners of your eyes so now all
I'm doing is here I'm interchanging a
shader brush or the crease brush that I
used and I should have pencil brush to
create a gradient color that I like
keeping the outer corners darker of
course
now here I'm just taking a white
shimmery color into the brow bone and
the inner corner of my eye and then
taking the brown color that I used for
the crease and placing that onto my
lower lash line now of course we can't
forget about eyeliner so I'm going to
line my eyes with a pencil just a basic
black pencil eyeliner and then of course
taking a flat top shader brush and
smudging that into my lashline for an
even smokier sultry look here I'm just
taking a brown eye pencil and lining my
lower lashline to define my eyes even a
little bit more and of course balance it
out now I'm just curling my lashes and
applying a couple coats of the
Maybelline falsies mascara now of course
Vampire Diaries looks won't be complete
without some individual lashes so I'm
going to add some individual eyelashes
to the outer corners of my eyes to give
a little bit more fuller look and a
fluttery effect that rebecca has moving
on to the face I've just applied some of
my own concealer and foundation so
whatever you normally use is just fine
but of course we're going to add some
definition to our face so I'm going to
contour with a matte bronzer this one's
by Benefit then I'm just going to do the
3d motion on my face to give a more
defined structured look to my face and
of course I'm going to highlight to get
add some shimmer to my face so I'm going
to highlight above my cheekbones the
bridge of my nose and my Cupid's bow for
the blush I'm keeping it kind of natural
looking by adding a coral blush to the
apples of my cheeks now moving on to the
lips I am just going to take this nude
lip liner and basically trace to my lips
and fill it all in this is going to give
kind of the exact color at least for me
that Rebecca has or as close as I could
match it and it gives kind of a matte
look which is perfect for Rebecca so now
we're finished with the makeup let's
move on to the hair I'm starting out
with second day hair just because it's
the easiest for me to curl I like out of
the shower hair but this is just the
easiest for me for it to stay all day
for this curling technique I'm starting
from the back to the front like always
but I'm actually starting from the top
of my hair this time and I'm using a 1
and 1/2 inch curling barrel because I
just find that this gives the exact
curls
that I want for Rebecca so as you can
see here all I'm doing is I'm just
taking the curling iron and I'm wrapping
it around about one inch maybe a little
bit thicker sections of my hair and then
instead of letting it fall down I'm
going to catch it in my hand be very
careful because your hair is going to be
hot and I'm just rolling it back onto
the top of my head with the shape of the
curl that the curling iron created and
I'm just simply pinning it with a bobby
pin now the reason why I'm doing this is
pretty simple it's just so that the
curls gravity it doesn't take the curls
down and have them fall out completely
this is just going to give that bouncy
texture that you want at the ends of
your hair which is what Rebecca has so
that's what we're going for obviously
this is kind of takes some practice I
kind of struggled a little bit with this
to get master catching the curls and
rolling them back up but it's super easy
once you get the hang of it now
obviously to achieve the tighter curl at
the front of your face like Rebecca has
I'm just going to take a smaller curling
iron this one is a one-inch and I'm just
going to curl that section the same as I
did with the big curling iron and I'm
going to catch it and pin it up with a
bobby pin this is just going to make the
curl tighter obviously because you're
using a smaller curling iron so now you
can see I finished that side of my head
and I just did the exact same thing on
the other side of my head always curling
away from my face don't forget that you
won't get the look unless you curl away
from your face so now all I'm doing is
finishing up by pinning this last
section of curl to my head and you're
going to look super silly walking around
your room like this but all you're going
to do is wait I waited for about 10 to
15 minutes until I felt like my hair was
completely cooled and then all you're
going to do is simply take out the bobby
pins this is super easy you're going to
get these curls they're going to be
completely cool so you don't have to
worry about ruining them but you can
shake out your hair a little bit it's
kind of necessary because they've kind
of formed to your head and what I'm
doing here is I'm just taking the
curling iron and fixing any pieces that
may have fallen out in the process and
now I'm just taking my teasing brush
which has very very small tight bristles
which is how you're going to get this
exact wave that you see that I just
created on the side of my head you're
just going to lightly brush the curls
together and kind of like form them into
this like unison wave and curl as you
can see here obviously this did take
some practice but the teasing comb
really did help by having those tight
bristles it was made it really easy to
create that big kind of chunky wave that
Rebecca has in the front and then smooth
down the sections in the back to like
achieve her exact look so now all I'm
doing here is finishing with some
hairspray and kind of fluffing up any
areas I think need some extra volume
playing with it a little bit shaping it
and you have completed the look I really
hope you guys like this video thank you
all so much for watching and I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
