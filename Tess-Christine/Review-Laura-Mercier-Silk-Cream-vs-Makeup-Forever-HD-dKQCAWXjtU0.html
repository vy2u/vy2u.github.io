going to be a review and I haven't done
a review in a while and I kind of wanted
to change up my videos because I
realized that I've been doing a crap ton
of hair tutorials and I wanted to change
it up a little bit just for a little bit
because I have a lot of requests from
when I asked you guys in my Vanessa
Hudgens video what you wanted to see and
I got like a huge range of requests so I
put them all in my little notes on my
iPhone and which celebrities you guys
want me to do so they're all on my list
it's just when I get to them so but I
kind of wanted to change it up in case
you guys were getting sick of hair
tutorials and all that so I decided to
do a review today and this is actually
been requested for a while but I'm going
to review two different foundations and
I'm going to compare the two
so the first foundation I'm gonna talk
about is the Laura Mercier self cream
foundation and you guys probably have
heard a ton about this because this has
been around YouTube for a really long
time
but um I did start using this I want to
say when was this probably last year
like right when I started doing YouTube
I started using this and then just
recently before I went to England during
the summer I switched to the Make Up For
Ever HD foundation
okay so first for the Laura Mercier self
cream foundation this one you apply with
your fingers I don't really know of a
different way to apply this the texture
of it is very very thick and creamy I
mean it's not too thick but it's very
creamy to where you would need to rub it
between your fingers and apply it on
your face so if you're a type of person
who doesn't like applying foundation
with your fingers this foundation is not
for you because I found that with a
brush it will waste the product because
the brush will gather a lot of the cream
because it's a thick consistency so that
would be a waste of a product and with
your fingers it's a lot easier to spread
it evenly throughout your face you don't
need a lot of this foundation you need
basically like a pea-sized amount you
need so little I remember when I first
bought this foundation I would put a
good amount on my hand and find that I
wasted a lot of the product so another
good thing about this product is that
you it is expensive it's 42 dollars at
Sephora but you it lasts for a while
because you don't need that much of it
another thing is the smell to me kind of
smells like coffee I don't know why but
I really like the smell of this
foundation I hate putting foundation on
my face at the smell is weird because it
is going on your face and it's like
right by your nose too so
I really like the smell of this while it
is a cream foundation and you think that
it would be kind of thick because when
you put it on your hands it feels kind
of thick almost like a sunscreen kind of
a thick sunscreen it's not at all it it
blends very very evenly and it is very
light on your skin so it doesn't really
feel like you're wearing a whole lot of
foundation and it doesn't cake either so
it's very very buildable so you can do a
light layer if you want to but if you
need more coverage you can build it up
and it won't cake which I really really
like about that probably one of the
drawbacks is that it doesn't have a lot
of colors for you guys interested the
color I am in is beige ivory but it is
very easy to find your skin tone still
because the foundation is very blendable
and very easy to kind of blend into your
natural skin tone I do have oily skin
and this did not make my skin oily when
I put it on it is very not I won't want
to say dry foundation but it's a very
matte foundation so when you put it on
it gives you a very luminous coverage
and a very like an airbrush effect but
then I found that towards the end of the
day during on my t-zone it kind of fades
away so that's kind of a drawback for
this another thing I like about this
foundation is the packaging I think it's
very very convenient
it's spill proof it won't spill anywhere
because it is obviously a cream
foundation so it's not like a liquid
foundation where it'll spill all over
your bag if you're traveling it's a
really really convenient size it's small
and compact which I really like because
traveling and taking it places is really
really easy and you won't have to worry
about spilling it anywhere because it is
packaged so nicely so now onto the Make
Up For Ever HD foundation the color I am
in in this is right now 123 and I switch
between 123 and 120 the shades they have
so many different shades and that's what
I really like about this foundation is
you cuz you can pretty much find your
exact skin tone on in any of the
foundations what I like about it it has
a very runny consistency but not too
runny it's a it's a liquid foundation so
it's not a cream like this one so when
it it's nearly impossible to put this on
your fingers and wrap this through your
face it would just be a waste of the
product and it wouldn't work so what I
like to do with this on days
as I pump usually one-and-a-half pumps
onto my hand the back of my hand and
then I take a flat top brush and I buff
it onto my face so that's how I you
apply this foundation I really really
like this foundation I think it gives a
very flawless look especially on the
camera and especially when you take
pictures I like the consistency a little
bit more than the Laura Mercier sub
cream foundation because it's not a
cream and I don't have to use my fingers
I found that I didn't really like doing
that with my face at all or applying
foundation with my fingers it didn't
bother me as much to where I wouldn't
repurchase it I just prefer this I like
the packaging I like that it has a pump
I think that's really really handy I've
never had a problem with this I carried
this all through England all through my
travels around Europe and it did not
spill at all so that was really really a
plus while this one is a liquid
foundation it does not make my skin oily
I was kind of worried about that it does
not make my skin I have a very oily skin
so I was kind of worried it was gonna
give me a shine but because it is an HD
foundation made for photography or
filming it gives you a very matte look
and American a matte effect on your face
the main reason why I switched from from
this to this is basically just to change
it up a little bit I just didn't want to
I was just kind of getting bored of this
and wanted to try something else that
I've heard is a really good foundation
so I kind of just switch it up a little
bit a lot of you guys were asking I
think these are both worse worth
purchasing it's just I guess what you
prefer more how you like to apply your
foundation how you like the consistent
consistency of your foundation it all
depends on that next time you're
shopping at Sephora or online or
anywhere where you have these
foundations just test them out find your
exact color and see which one you like
more do like maybe this one on this side
of your face and this one on this side
of your face and see which one feels a
little bit better to you which one you
think you could be more comfortable
using every day I really really hope it
helped you guys figure out which one you
wanted to buy next time because I know I
had a lot of you guys commenting asking
if you think this one's worth it or if
you think this one's worth it that is it
for the video today I really really hope
you guys liked my video please let me
know what you think in the comments
below if you have any other questions
about the foundation I'll be more than
happy to answer them I will see you guys
next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
