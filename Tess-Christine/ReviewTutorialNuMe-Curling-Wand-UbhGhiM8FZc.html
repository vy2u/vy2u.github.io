be a review slash hair tutorial and the
product I'm going to be talking about
today is actually by new me and it is
the 25 millimeter curling wand that I
would do a review on it for you all to
tell you how I like it
what I don't like about it and if I
recommend it and I also decided to throw
in a little bit of a hair tutorial at
the end so you guys can see how the
product works and if you really want to
buy it so as you guys know I love
curling my hair around the barrel
meaning I don't use the clamp so super
excited to find out that new me had a
clipless curling wand so I definitely
wanted to get this one as you guys know
I do own the Connor infinity you want
but if you can notice a difference
between that one and this one this one
the barrel is just a straight shot all
the way down the Infinity one gets
skinnier at the end so I really wanted
to try out this curling wand because I
wanted to see how the curls shape
differently around different barrels so
this is the curling wand I got I got the
25 millimeter curling wand and I picked
it in this fun zebra pattern which I
thought was really fun because I don't
have a curling iron that has a fun
design like that so I really liked that
I picked the 25 millimeter because I
liked the size of the barrel and now
they have a ton of different sizes of
barrels for this clipless curling wand
but I chose this one because I feel like
this is the most versatile curling wand
size you could get really small ones and
you could get a bigger one but I decided
to get this one because if you were to
get a smaller barrel you wouldn't be
able to really control how big or how
small you want your curls now with this
one if you take smaller strands of hair
and hold it on a little bit longer
you're going to get tighter curls but if
you take larger strands of hair and hold
it on less or maybe even the same length
you will get looser curls so you can
kind of create multiple different looks
with this which is why I really liked
the size the one thing I really like
about this curling iron is the
temperature now is a really skeptical
when I opened up the box and found that
it did not have a heat temperature if
you can notice there's no heat setting
on this at all which I did not like at
first to be honest I was already like
I'm gonna hate this product because it
doesn't have a heat setting and I didn't
like that at all because you can control
how hot your curling iron is I've been
trying this out for about two weeks now
and I found that the heat temperature is
actually perfect I was like I said I was
a little skeptical that you couldn't
change the heat setting but I turned it
on and let it heat up all the way and
put
on my hair and I found that you don't
have to leave your hair on the barrel
Islam which I really liked
now with a curling iron that has a lower
heat setting or the one that you can
control and make it go lower you're
gonna have to keep your hair on the
barrel a lot longer because it is not as
hot as this one is so this one you only
have to hold it on for a couple seconds
and then let go I really like that
because the less time your hair is on
high temperatures is obviously better
for your hair again I would probably
prefer to have a heat setting but I'm
pretty okay with the temperature that it
is another thing I really like about it
is the rotating cord now if you can
notice the cord rotates and it doesn't
take the curling iron with it which I
really like because especially with a
clipless curling iron and even sometimes
with not a clipless curling iron I think
that all curling iron should have this
because if you're wrapping it around
your hair or even just curling it this
cord if it didn't rotate it would get
wrapped up in the curling iron and be
such a mess for you and it would just
cause you so much frustration so I
really like that it has a rotating cord
I'm pretty sure all curling irons have
that now but if they don't they
definitely should because I think this
is a really great feature on the curling
iron it does have an on/off switch just
like this and this is probably one of
the features I dislike about this
curling iron the one thing that I don't
like and this may sound really stupid
but there's no red light and I know that
sounds super weird and super stupid but
I just think that it should have some
sort of notification that it's on now
you would think that yeah once you turn
it on you know it's on but sometimes
like I like to turn my curling irons on
do my makeup and then come back to it
and if I forget or something that I
turned it on there's no really indicator
that tells me that it is on or that is
off so I would prefer this to have some
sort of red light or some sort of
blinking light to let you know when it's
heated up or when it's on because you
can't really tell when it's heated up
you kind of just have to wait it takes
it's really quick heat up process which
I also really like about this it doesn't
take very long to heat up but then again
you still don't know when it is fully
heated up because there is no indicator
I know my Conor wands they have a
blinking light and when it stops
blinking that
means that it's all heated up so I would
prefer for spread that this to have
something like that on it so that's
probably the one thing that I dislike
about this curling iron the curling iron
itself comes in a box like this when you
order it and it has a fun little zebra
print if you get that pattern the
curling one also comes with the glove
now I don't really prefer to use this
because I think it's just a little bit
too bulky and a little bit too weird to
grab on to your hair with the fingers at
the end are a little too big and it's
just kind of hard to like grab pieces of
your hair with this material but I do
think it is very important if you are
not familiar with using a clipless
curling iron and wrapping it around the
barrel because the last thing you want
to do is bring yourself on 410 degrees
so I just think that this is something
that it should include and I'm glad it
includes it
I don't like personally like to use it
because I've had a lot of practice using
my hair and wrapping it around the
barrel or around a clipless curling iron
so I've had a lot of practice but if you
haven't had a lot of practice I would
definitely suggest using this just to
prevent any burns because burns aren't
fun and they do really hurt so that is
really all I have to say about the nume
curling wand again I really really do
enjoy this and I'm super excited that I
got it because I don't have this type of
a clipless curling iron and I've always
wanted one like this I do think it works
out really good I did do my hair today
and that is where I come into the hair
tutorial because I decided to throw in a
hair story at the end just so you guys
can see how I use it and all that stuff
so these are the curls that I got today
I took very large sections and wrapped
around my hair and kept it very ah I
didn't hold the curl or the hair strands
on very long so it created these kind of
loose natural-looking curls which I
really wanted for today so that's what I
created today with the curling wand now
again you can create tighter waves in
one of my videos I will have it in an
annotation somewhere down here so you
guys know I did use this and I held it
on with smaller strands and did it like
every other way and it created very
different curls than these so you guys
can see if you go check back on one of
the other videos I'll put it in an
annotation like I said and you guys can
see other ways that I've curled my hair
with this again I will probably be using
this in future hair tutorials so look
out for that if you are interested in
buying this curling iron I will have a
link to new Me's website below and you
should definitely go check out their
website they have a ton of different
other

straighteners hair products all that
stuff so you should definitely go check

interested in buying this curling iron I
will have that linked in the bottom bar
below and I also have a coupon code for
all of you guys that are interested in
buying it you should definitely go
utilize that because coupon codes are
always nice if you are interested in
seeing the rest of this video and seeing
how I got these curls please keep on
watching let me know what you think in
the comments below and I will see you
guys next time bye guys
to begin I am splitting my hair directly
in the back in two different sections
and I'm going to start using the curling
wand from back to front so I'm just
going to be taking fairly large sections
from the back and working my way forward
by wrapping obviously the strands of
hair around the barrel and I'm holding
it on for around three to five seconds
and I'm just going to repeat that
process on this half of my head and on
the other half of my head
now I am going to teach my hair just to
give it a little bit of volume with the
loose curls obviously this is optional I
just chose to tease the crown of my head
and to use the sides of my head as well
lastly I'm finishing with Guarnere
forties flexible hold hairspray and that
is the completed look I really really
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial with
the nume wand I loved it a lot and I
know you guys will too thanks for
watching bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
