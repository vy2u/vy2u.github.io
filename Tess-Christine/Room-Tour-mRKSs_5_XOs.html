is a very highly requested room tour as
you guys know I did a room tour before
and but that was back in my parents
house in my hometown so most do you guys
know that I moved back to my college
town now where I'm going to school so my
room is completely different as I moved
into a house with some of my friends so
I will show you my room so this is my
door isn't it cute that's all you guys
get to see no I'm kidding okay so this
is my door so when you walk in my door
you see this now okay so I don't really
know where to start I guess I should
just start from here and work my way
okay so next to the door are these like
handy-dandy hangers if this would like
focus there we go so omni's I have all
my winter jackets as you guys know if
you follow me on twitter it's been like
negative degrees so I have various
amounts of jackets so this is just where
I hang all my warm jackets and then my
two towels just because there's not
enough room in our bathroom for me to
hang my towels so I just hang them here
and then just grab them and go when I
want a shower so it's just handy to
happen there and then over here I have
my coat rack well it's not a coat rack
it's a scarf rack so on here I just have
scarves and scarves and scarves and
scarves and then on the top I've had
this kind of looks like a Santa hat
because it's like red and white but okay
there's a white hat black grey hat and a
red hat so those are just sitting on top
of a hanger and then the rest are
seriously all scarves scarves scarves
scarves I don't know it's just easier
for me to hang them there because you
guys didn't notice when you saw the scan
out of my room there's no closet how
traumatic right but don't worry I made
do and then over here is my little
nightstand I've had this forever I don't
know I brought it from my house or my
parents house because I'm cheap and I
don't want to buy a new nightstand then
onto my bed so this is what the bed
looks like you guys see this in my
background of my videos all the time but
um the bed is a full size bed if you
guys are wondering what kind of
I bet it is it's a full-size bed this a
duvet cover I got at Target it's cool it
has like these little flower lace
details and then this cool lace detail
on the corners and then it came with
these pillows you get purple sheets I
have this really comfy body pillow
that's like dark purple if you guys
couldn't tell my favorite colors purple
so umm my pillows I got these two I got
at Target and then this one I got at
Pier one oh and then over here is in hey
cute it's my little stuffed dog I've had
him since I've been like oh gosh like
five or six years old over here now um I
have a mirror that used to be hanging
there's me um I'm in pajamas and it used
to be hanging like straight up but it
fell so I haven't taken time taking the
time to rehang it so that's what it is
right now okay and then I have this mini
fridge and I have this mini fridge and I
was in the dorms and then my room last
year because I lived with five girls
last year and there was enough room in
our fridge to fit everything so I had to
get a mini fridge but I don't use it
this year because um we have enough room
this year so there's nothing and I think
there's coconut water on top I have
laundry detergent and then this my
friend got for me it's a build-a-bear
and he just looks really cool too I like
it and then batteries then a printer
vitamins it is just like a wooden
basically like a wooden desk I guess
like a TV stand I don't know my dad made
it so he painted it black and on top of
it I have my camera tripod I'm just like
organizing stuff for like bills and
checks and all that stuff I have this
vase with flowers in it from like Target
or something all my movies a candle that
is mahogany teak wood I got this at Bath
and Body Works if you ever have smelt
this it smells like Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch
um it smells good but I didn't put two
and two together until I got home so and
when you light this it smells like a boy
so when you like this
I guess have boys over because it smells
like a boy so then over here I have a TV
it's a giant TV like this is in my room
too at home it's like massive look at
that thing I don't know but it still
works so I figured why not still use it
down here I just have organiz organized
stuff I guess this is like my accounting
stuff back there's travel cases for like
makeup this is my camera case some
computer and phone chargers then in here
I have my nail polishes it's just like a
plastic container that I got it like
Target and inside I just hold nail
polish stuff back there like extension
cords nothing special down here I have
sweatshirts just kind of stacked in this
area here is like school stuff so I have
books binders highlighters pencils all
that boring stuff over here I have a few
sweaters big bulky sweaters that I
didn't want to hang or shove in my
dresser so I have that there and a few
extra hangers and then over here is my
desk where I do all my filming so you
guys will recognize this I sit at this
all the time and film so in the back
you'd see that but um yeah I might ask
my computer usually isn't on my desk
it's usually where I do my makeup and
hair so that's usually there just
chillin on my bed or on my dresser over
there so that's just kind of hanging out
there for now so I can show you my
dresser but on here I just have basic
stuff I have this magnifying mirror a
few hair stuff back there I have Kleenex
brushes and eye shadow palette all of my
makeup right here I did do a makeup
collection a few stuff has been updated
but not enough to make a whole new video
so I have a makeup collection video so
if you want to go check that out either
I'll link it in the description box
below or I will or just like look
through my channel and it's not that far
down so um but anyways this desk I got
it IKEA like couple years ago and then
same with the mirror as well so I think
it's a really fun mirror it's really
cute it's got like little spirals on it
I like it a lot over here is my dresser
and my dresser um if you it's from the
kids section actually at Ashley home
furniture um
I was if you guys have ever gone dresser
shopping they are so expensive I knew I
needed a dresser because I didn't have a
closet so I was like I need to get a
dresser it's just a necessity I need to
fit all my clothes in here somehow so
his dresser shopping and they're like a
thousand dollars for a nice dresser so I
went into the kids section because I was
like I cannot pay that much for a
dresser and I found this really cute one
for like 200 bucks I think 250 bucks I
don't know it was so cheap compared to
the other ones and it's really good
quality and it's so cute look at the
design on it I like love it and the
dancer that I have is a little dancer
girl she is holding my bracelets some of
my bracelets so she's pretty handy over
there and then here I have a jewelry box
it's kind of a jumbled mess but inside I
have earrings rings bracelets down here
necklaces my friend got this from me at
targets and over here I have a bunch of
lotions I'm not really going to go
through all of them but these are my two
hands food lotions that I really really
like and then a few other Bath and Body
Works lotions on Victoria Secret lotions
um yeah they're pretty self-explanatory
oh really that's why I just keep those
and over here I have a giant frosted
cupcake handle I really like the smell
of this some people don't like the smell
of like food candles one of my roommates
doesn't I don't know why cuz they smell
so good
but yeah I have another one of those
there this flower little vase thing that
I got it IKEA I think it's really pretty
I think it adds a little bit of color to
my room and then over here I have a
perfume tray I got this at icing or
Claire's whichever one I think they have
them at both and then look at this this
is a problem for me these are my
necklaces and I have been too lazy or
just I don't even know to find a hook to
hang for my necklaces so I'll probably
either hang them up there where those
holes are already from the girl who
lived here before or somewhere else I'm
not quite sure so this is just kind of a
mess right now it's all tangled and I
haven't taken the time to untangle it so
that's that up here is really really
cool this is actually when I was
studying abroad I was in Rome and this
girl was painting these there were
watercolor and it's just different
scenic photos that
painted herself so I thought they were
really really pretty so I bought three
of them and put them in like a shadow
box frame and it looks really pretty on
my desk cuz my flowers that I have right
there like bring out the colors and that
so I really really like that a lot then
over here is my makeshift closet um a
lot of you guys are commenting they'll
saying that you liked it so that made me
feel a little bit better because I was
kind of bummed I didn't have a closet
but anyways this rot or this like
hanging thing I got it I Kia on the size
of it I just have a few purses a few of
you guys commented asking where this
purse is from this runs from t.j.maxx
I think the brand is like Alison Olivia
it's really cute and a lot of you guys
were commenting asking me about it
so yeah I got at t.j.maxx um but anyways
this is just where I hang all of my
clothes not all of them just the things
that need to be hung over here on these
hooks I have belts so I have all those
hanging on this side and then this is a
problem these are my shoes and they had
it had a shoe rack on the bottom but it
only holds up into those these this line
so then like this line extends out and
so they're just kind of all stacked
around here um so it's kind of a mess
but I mean it works so I think that's it
that is it oh I didn't show you this
picture this if you live here you'll
recognize it but my mom got this from me
when I got back from studying abroad
because I loved it so much and I want to
like move to England I seriously want to
move to London so bad so yeah I really
really hope you guys liked my room tour
and liked my room if you have any
questions about anything that I showed
you in my room where I got something if
I didn't mention it in the video or
anything about my room please let me
know in the comments below I really hope
you guys liked this give it a thumbs up
and I will talk to you guys next time
