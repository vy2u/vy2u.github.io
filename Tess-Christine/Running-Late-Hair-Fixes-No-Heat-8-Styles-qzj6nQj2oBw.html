all too familiar where you keep hitting
that snooze button and realize you've
slept in way too long and you're running
late and don't have enough time to get
ready however I bet you didn't wake up
with makeup on so if you want a running
late makeup tips video then just hit
that thumbs up button but this is
seriously how I woke up this morning and
how my hair looked and how it looks most
days so I have about 9 different ways
that I like to fix my hair that
seriously only take like 3 minutes or
less so it's super easy and quick and I
hope it helps you guys out now let's get
out of bed and get started and also
don't judge me because I am going to do
this whole video in my PJs shirt so
starting out of course you got to take
out that nasty bun that I have going on
and see what my hair looks like it's a
mess it's probably curled from the day
before or my natural wavy texture but my
biggest tip for you if you have curly
hair like me is don't brush it out
because you'll ruin all the curls that
are usable so I like to spray in some
dry shampoo or a texturizing spray to
help it out so the first thing and the
quickest and easiest way out are hats
they're just super easy to kind of cover
up if you have like greasy roots or
anything super super easy so I'll just
throw on either a beanie or a really
cute knitted hat depending on kind of
what you're dressing up for if it's a
super casual day hats are always an
option for me and what I also really
love doing is throwing on like a
snapback that's totally a personal style
thing but I think they look really cute
and kind of tame down your hair a little
bit which is a bonus because it really
does help but for actual hairstyles the
first three I'm going to show you are
half up and half down for this first
look I am teasing the crown of my head
for a little bit of volume that's
totally optional on your part depending
on how your hair is and all I'm doing is
taking the front sections of my hair and
twisting them back and connecting them
with bobby pins in the back middle of my
head this is super easy it gets your
hair out of your face and kind of tames
down any craziness that would be in the
front of your head and you can also add
a bow to make it a little bit cuter and
more put together but I love this
hairstyle I think it kind of just makes
it look like it took a long time but it
kind of tamed down your crazy curls or
messy hair that you might have
this next one is very similar to the
first one but it's kind of a little bit
more bohemian because we are throwing in
braids so I'm doing is taking those
front sections of my hair and braiding
them all the way down I really like
messy hair so when I have Bed Head I
actually kind of use it to its advantage
so for this one I really like so all I'm
doing with the braids is I'm pulling out
the pieces to make it Messier and kind
of flatten the braid a little bit more
it does not have to be perfect the
Messier the better in my opinion because
it'll match your crazy messy hair that
you have but so all I'm doing is doing
that on both of the braids and then all
I'm going to do is take that section and
pin it back and basically just pin it in
the back middle of my head or at least
until the braid ends and then all I'm
going to do with the second one is kind
of layer it over the first braid and
kind of tame any flyaways that I may
have but I think it's just a really cool
like bohemian look and I really really
like messy hair like I said so I think
this is really cool and kind of like
emphasizes it a little bit more this
next hairstyle is for all you ariana
grande fans because it's a very loose
version of her hairstyle not exact by
any means but it kind of reminds me of
her
so all I did was pull back from my ears
back the top section of my hair and tied
it off with an elastic I find that when
I wake up late and my hair is just kind
of messy the problem areas are on the
top of my head because that's where it
kind of shows that your hair is kind of
like old and not been washed so I like
pulling it back because I find that it
really helps so all I did was kind of
mess up the curls a little bit and I
think it's just a really cute hairstyle
you can add like a bow to the top of it
and it actually looks like you took the
time to get ready but for those of you
that have to look a little bit more
polished and put together and can't have
your hair so messy I have two different
hairstyles for you that I enjoy doing
the first one is really easy and very
self-explanatory all I'm doing is
pulling my hair back to the top of my
head and I'm just kind of twisting the
hair around itself and then securing it
with an elastic
basically it's just a bun on the top of
your head some people like to call it a
top nut I don't really know I just kind
of call it a bun super easy to do and
it's really really quick you can dress
this up or down depending on what you're
wearing and how you kind of mess up your
hair you can totally mess it up and make
it more casual or you can keep it
slicked back and more professional
this next one is another one that you
can dress up or down depending on how
you style it all I'm doing is gathering
all of my hair to one side of my head it
doesn't matter which side you choose and
I'm just doing a basic braid a braid is
always an easy way for you just to kind
of pull your hair back and make it cute
and still look like you took the time so
braids are always an option but to vamp
it up a little bit all I'm basically
doing is just wrapping the braid around
itself to create kind of like a braided
bun I think it's super cute and like I
said you can totally make this
professional by like what you wear and
how you style it so you can pull your
bangs back or leave them down and make
it very messy I just think it's a really
cute version of just like a regular bun
um so like I said I decided to pull my
bangs back for more of a polished look
but you can totally leave it down and
messy and kind of just like do your own
thing with it moving on to the next
category which is ponytails
I love ponytails I think they're so cute
on just a casual day that I will
probably normally have I will just throw
my hair up into a ponytail if I have to
be ready really quick I think they're
just like a cute casual way to throw
your hair up especially if you have
really bouncy curls I think it's super
cute but it can be kind of boring and if
you want to like vamp up your ponytail
style I have two different options for
you this first one I call it the Jasmine
braid like the Disney Princess Jasmine
because I seriously think it looks like
hers um but basically all I'm doing is
gathering all of my hair to one side and
putting a small elastic around it and
then I'm going to go a little bit down
my ponytail and put another elastic and
then what makes us different is I'm
going to separate the top section of my
hair into like a little hole and I'm
going to put the rest of my hair through
and pull tight it honestly kind of looks
like a fishtail which i think is super
cool because it takes way less time than
a fishtail braid but I still think it
looks really cute so all I'm doing is
going all the way down my ponytail
depending on how long your hair is will
determine how many pony tails you use I
use three I think it's super cute and
kind of jazz's up just a regular side
pony and I think it looks like jasmine
like doesn't it I think it's so cute
this next one is another way to kind of
jazz up just a regular ponytail I'm
basically gonna put three ponytails in
my head this first one is just going to
be the top layer of my hair so I'm going
to go from a little bit above my ears
back
and put a ponytail then I'm going to
take the middle section and put a
ponytail and then the last section into
a ponytail so I'm going to have three
now basically all I'm going to do is I'm
going to make a hole at the top of the
ponytail and flip it through and then
I'm going to make another hole at the
second one and put that extra hair
through and then flip that one through
and then the last ponytail I'm going to
make another hole and I'm going to put
all the hair through that and then flip
the last section of hair through it like
so basically all I'm going to do now is
just kind of pull tight and like loosen
the hair to make sure that all the
ponytails are evenly distributed down
the back of my head it's very very cute
it's a very different version of a
ponytail but it kind of just kind of
jazz's it up a little bit and makes your
hair look a lot fuller and thicker at
the bottom which i think is really
really cute and it kind of just makes it
a little bit different and a little bit
more fun but that concludes my running
late hair fixes I really hope this was
helpful for you guys thank you all so
much for watching and if you do any of
these hairstyles be sure to send me a
photo and I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
