in the morning looks a little something
like this
after hitting the snooze button for a
million times I just about have no time
to get ready so this video is hair quick
fixes in the morning when you have
absolutely no time so let's get started
this first look is just a basic ponytail
but I'm going to show you a quick trick
just to make it look like you have a
little bit more volume with your second
day hair so I'm taking the front section
of my hair and pulling that back towards
the middle upper part of my head
pinching it between two fingers pushing
it up and securing of the bobby pin this
is just going to give the front of my
ponytail look like I have a lot more
volume than I actually do so once i've
pin that in place I'm going to gather
the rest of my hair and place that
directly over the bobby pins that I just
placed then with a hair tie I'm just
going to secure it into a ponytail and
as you can see because I added that
extra pouf it looks like my hair has a
lot more volume in life than it normally
would if I would have just pulled it
back so that is the first look add some
earrings that'll look like you actually
took the time to get ready this morning
the total time it took me was less than
2 minutes for the second look I'm just
going to start by teasing my hair I'm
going to be teasing the back section of
my hair in 3 different sections and I'm
also going to be teasing the sides of my
hair reason why I'm teasing is because I
don't know about you but when I wake up
in the morning my hair is very flat to
my head and it just doesn't have a lot
of life so I feel like teasing is
necessary for me so I'm just going to do
that and then tease the sides of my head
I forgot to mention but all of these
looks do work well with curly hair as
well so your hair does not have to be
straight for this look any apple looks
really so once I finish teasing I'm
going to gather my hair to one side it
doesn't matter which side whichever side
you want to and I'm going to start at
the opposite side that all the hair is
on and start twisting and while I'm
twisting I'm going to start picking up
sections of my hair and working it all
the way around so as you can see it
creates this really cool twist like
effect so then I'm going to take a clip
and I'm going to secure that down just
for right now so I can start twisting
the front section on my head so I'm
going to do the same thing on this
until I need the other twist once I meet
the other twist I will remove the clip
and then just pick up the rest of that
hair secure it with a ponytail and pull
tight and you have that second ponytail
look this is just not a simple ponytail
it has a little bit of extra Flair
because it has the twist and you can
also pull your hair out and pull little
sections out to make it little look a
little bit more relaxed as well so that
is the completed hairstyle that's what
it looks like from the back this is
super fun and very easy the total time
it took me was only three minutes this
third hairstyle is your basic everyday
side braid that I'm sure you all know
how to do but I decided to throw it in
here just because it's something that I
always do when I'm running late for
school or have second day hair it's
something that is a look that still
looks really cute but I just do it all
the time so I decided to throw it in
here so I'm sure you guys all know how
to braid your hair but basically I'm
only braiding it about half way down the
Strand and then securing it with the
ponytail I like that it doesn't go all
the way down my hair I just think it
looks a little bit more messy and a
little less put together and that's also
why I'm pulling out strands around my
face just to kind of frame it a little
bit more and that is the completed look
this one's super easy and it only took
me less than one minute so definitely
worth it so this last look is the ever
so famous top knot bun now I'm sure you
guys have seen many different ways to do
this just this is just the way that I do
it so I thought I would throw it in
there so I'm doing is sectioning my hair
back into a ponytail I'm gathering it to
the upper middle part of my head and
securing that with the ponytail next
with the ponytail that I have I'm going
to begin twisting that until it starts
to turn around the ponytail now once I
get about halfway I'm going to pin that
side that starts to come up down I just
found that this creates a fuller look to
the bun instead of keep wrapping it
because it'll look more like a ballet
bun if you don't start pinning it
halfway through while you're wrapping I
just found that that's how it works on
my hair so again the last Ram and
pinning half way down taking it that
around and pinning it again and then I'm
just going to pull the bun out again to
make a more fuller look to the bun
instead of so tight to my head and then
any pieces that come out I'm just going
to pin back into the bun
and that is how I get my topknot bun I
also like to pull out strands around my
face to frame them and make it a little
look a little less put together and this
look took me less than two minutes to
complete now that is the completed video
I really hope you guys liked it and I
hope it helped you out a little bit and

below and I'll see you guys next time
