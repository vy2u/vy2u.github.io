running late video but this time it's
all about makeup we all have those
mornings where we sleep in a little too
long and don't have time for our normal
makeup routine so I have some quick
makeup tips that will help wake your
face up that only take a few minutes
throughout this video I only applied
makeup to half of my face so you could
see exactly how these simple steps
really make a difference from your point
of view the right side of my face will
be with no makeup and the left side will
be with makeup so let's go ahead and get
started
all right guys there are a total of six
steps and the first step is concealer
concealer is really really important
especially when you're running late
because you really can skip foundation
altogether unless your comfort zone is
you want a full face a foundation then
you can skip a different step but
concealer is really important because it
really hides the under-eye circles and
covers up any blemishes and it really
makes a difference so I use two
different concealers one is a salmon
based color that kind of eliminates the
dark circles and then the other one is
more of a flesh tone to blend everything
in and as you can see from the left side
versus the right side it really makes a
difference with my face and really
covers up the under-eye circles and the
bagginess moving on to the second step
which is your eyebrows I really do not
understand the importance of this until
a few years ago when I started filling
them in it really makes a difference
with your face and this benefit gimme
brow tool is so easy especially when
you're running late all you have to do
is swipe it over your brow and it just
fills it in and makes it look so much
better as you guys can see from the left
side versus my right side it's just so
much fuller and it just frames my face a
lot better and just kind of makes it
look more awake and polished
now blush is the third step and this is
super easy and quick I always thought
this is really important because it adds
color to your face and just makes you
look more alive and awake now this step
as are all of the steps optional I love
adding highlighter to my face I just add
it to the top of my cheekbones my brow
bone and my Cupid's bow and I just think
it adds such a nice glow and a pretty
effect to my face and it really just
makes it look more awake in my opinion
and it only takes a couple seconds now
moving on to the eyes because this is
where it's going to show that you're the
most tired and didn't have the most time
to get ready my biggest tip for you is
to add a nude eyeliner some people like
to use white but I think nude is a
little bit more natural it just opens up
your eyes and makes them
whiter and brighter now for my favorite
part eyelashes this really does make a
difference I will do this honestly on a
normal occasion that will just curl my
eyelashes simply just curling them
really makes a difference as you can see
this i just looks wider and brighter and
this one looks a little bit more tired
and sleepy but of course if you have
time you might as well add mascara
because i really think it makes a
difference so I just added a quick coat
of mascara to my lashes to my top and
bottom lashes and it really just makes
your eyes look so different as you can
see here my left eye versus my right eye
in your point of view looks so much
different and it just makes it look more
awake and pretty so now that I've
completed all six steps I did the other
side of my face and then another thing
you can do is grab a chapstick to go
this is just a chapstick that has kind
of a gloss to it so it makes my lips
look all nice and pretty it also kind of
has a pink Sheen to it so I don't know
it's easy and quick but that concludes
my running late makeup tips video I
really think these six quick steps made
my face go from dreary and droopy and
tired to a little bit more alive and
awake and fresh also if you're looking
