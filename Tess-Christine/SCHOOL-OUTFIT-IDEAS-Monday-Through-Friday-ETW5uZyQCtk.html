remember in school they were just awful
but for me it was a fun way to show off
my outfit if I bought anything over the
weekend went shopping that whole thing
but comfort is key pretty much Monday
through Friday so that was the trend of
this video so I thought I would show you
guys how to dress up a sweatshirt the
one I'm wearing is from forever 21 it's
a tan color and yes I know it is cropped
so an option for you is to wear some
high-waisted mom jeans like mine from
ASOS or you can wear a tank top
underneath it or just buy a regular
sweatshirt it really doesn't matter and
then for my shoes I would have gone with
sneakers but I decided to show you guys
loafers because I feel like they're
underrated and they make an outfit look
so good and so much more put together
than it normally would for Tuesday I
decided to incorporate leggings because
when I asked you guys what you like to
wear a lot of you said layings
so I'm just wearing some that I have
authority from beyond yoga I wear them
with just some white sneakers those are
from Reebok
I love the white sneakers trend I just
think they make everything better I
don't know and then for pop of color I
decided to go for a tank top mine is
from Topshop and a fun tip for you if
you have tank tops you want to wear but
obviously dress code you can just throw
a jacket over it I just did that with a
denim jacket from Topshop and then added
a fun little flair with a choker from
ASOS
Wednesday I wanted to show you guys how
to style a skirt in a super comfy way so
a lot of you guys were requesting
dresses and skirts like that
I don't know how crazy the dress code
has gotten but our rule was the
fingertip rule you hold your fingers
down and if it goes to that you're good
to go so that's what I have I have this
suede skirt from Topshop and then over
it I wore a sweatshirt because you can't
go wrong with a sweatshirt mine happens
to be cropped but why I wanted to
feature it is because it kind of looks
like a university sweatshirt or like a
school absalom sweatshirt which I
thought would be perfect after she
needed to wear your own schools if
that's your thing it's just a way to
make a skirt even more comfortable and
then of course I had to have my converse
I've loved wearing converse especially
in school it was just my favorite back
to school shoe
for Thursday this is usually the time of
the week where things are picking up and
you get excited for the weekend so why
not be more adventurous with your outfit
and it would be too easy for me to show
you another jeans and t-shirt look so I
thought I'd show you guys how I style
overalls because I feel like again these
are something that's super underrated
and a lot of you guys are asking me to
show you how I style them so I just have
these ones there from Paige Jenna I like
the patchwork on it looks super cool and
normally I would style it with a crop
top but since dress code that's not an
option graphic tees are a great way to
add flair to it so I have this one which
is a Johnny Depp one bonus that's from
forever 21 and I just pulled a strap off
of it to give it a little bit more of a
stylized look and make it more casual
and then I wore a choker with it because
I love that that's from forever 21 as
well and then I'm not against booties I
think they're really comfortable but of
course you can go ahead and just wear
some basic sneakers and it'll look
awesome
yeah okay Friday save your good outfit
for going out if you're in college or
you know jeans and a t-shirt just in
general is just a really comfy thing to
wear to school and it's easy and you
don't want to put a bunch of effort into
it so graphic tees band tees school tees
whatever you want to wear it just throw
it on tie it a cool way if your school's
like a little bit more chill or you're
in college or tuck it into some high
waisted pants I have these ones from row
vise denim love them I love the tears in
it just super casual and laid-back and I
just wore some slip-on shoes from fry
vans are a great option anything like
that those are the type of shoes I
always wore in school and then again
with the choker but I just think it
makes makes t-shirts look so much more
put together for whatever reason I'm
like in love with the trend so go for it
and yeah that's it
so let me know in the comments below
which outfit was your favorite or which
one you would most likely wear to school
I really hope you guys got some cool
ideas and to help make back to school a
little bit more fun and yeah thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
