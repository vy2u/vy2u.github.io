be a haul I haven't done one of these in
a while and I figured I was probably
doing for a new one sometimes it's kind
of refreshing to just hear me talk about
the clothes I got and then show you guys
it is gonna be a try and haul and know
y'all like that so I'm just gonna get
started um let's see I have like this
pile of clothes I got this stuff over
the past like month all of it still
should be around and available hopefully
ASOS is one of those places that I'm
just always on like online I'm always
shopping on there it has the best stuff
for all of my look for Less videos it
has just everything so starting out
should I start with
let's do jeans um I've worn these jeans
so I'm just gonna flip them back normal
if you don't already know
ASOS has a petite section which I'm not
short um but when it comes to pants I am
5'4 when I buy like regular jeans they
always tend to be a little bit longer on
me
and these technically were called like
ankle something this actually goes up to
me on my ankles and I really like them
and I've worn them a ton already next up
we have a shirt looks like this um love
off-the-shoulder crop tops and things
like that especially in the spring
they're just so easy to wear I wore this
one at Coachella which you guys will see
in my next video which is a travel blog
um but I also love the color I don't own
anything this color so when I saw it I
was like need it plus I just dyed my
hair darker so I'm kind of liking the
the bluish colors with it I don't know
next up I got a body suit and I'm all
about the body suits they're so easy you
guys like literally throw on a body suit
with jeans and a belt and you're
literally good to go actually you know
when they're not convenient is when
you're using the restroom that kind of
sucks because you literally have to take
everything off unless they have like
this convenient snaps at the bottom on
line it show like something underneath
like I thought it was built in but it's
completely not and it's completely
see-through so when I show you guys on
the side or whatever hopefully I figure
out a way to show you how I'm going to
cover up the goods next I got a belt and
I was really excited when I found this
it's studied it has like a belt buckle
here but in specific I really liked it
because I was looking for something very
similar from below the belt I'm sure you
guys heard of them they're the ones with
the big belt buckles they're just crazy
crazy expensive and I just like I bought
one and I was like oh like kind of like
regretting that I did that but when I
saw its good thing is called the
Barcelona belt or something like that I
don't know I could be wrong it looks
almost identical to this and it was like
over $100 and this was like $30 on ASOS
so awesome this goes with so many things
this is like one of my go-to belts when
I'm wearing like just a simple shirt or
a bodysuit it just makes the outfit look
more like you tried when you're just
wearing simple pieces next up I got
booties and I'm really excited about
these now these are really kind of crazy
they look like this um but in specific I
really liked them because I thought the
shiny material was really cool but I
thought it'd be kind of fun to add color
I don't usually go for like super
colorful things so I thought this would
be kind of fun to dress up an outfit or
make it different not for everyone
because they're a little bit out there
but I think they're sweet oh oh
next thing is from Zara I got a bomber
jacket and if you know anything about me
you know that I love my bomber jackets
um everything that I'm showing you guys
I like I've worn and it's like inside
out but I just couldn't wait you know
when you buy stuff and you're like I
want to wear it now that's me looks like
this it has a bunch of flowers all over
it's kind of this like shiny material
was a little bit on the pricier side but
a perfect should just kind of like throw
on when you want to look cute and put
together and it's pretty lightweight for
the most part so yeah dig it next from
Zara a bodysuit dun dun dun um it looks
like this it's kind of confusing just
looking at it like right here but you'll
see it better
um it's white it's easy it's like a
t-shirt which I thought was kind of cool
because most body suits I have I have
and have seen our leader long-sleeve or
they're like tank tops so this one's
short sleeve and I thought that that was
kind of cool
a Windsor is awesome super affordable
and they have some super cute stuff the
first being this dress it's an off the
shoulder dress super lightweight airy
it's like this I don't even know what
material I'm horrible at describing
things perfect for the spring because I
love the color and the flowers and
really cute next up from Windsor is this
thing it's as a romper and it's pink
you know but it's all lace and it has
like lace up here think it's really
pretty next is a jacket springtime is
still not like super super warm yet so I
wanted to get one that was this color
because I had been looking for awhile
Topshop had one and so did all saints'
crazy expensive this one is from Express
and I really like it I like the color I
originally bought it for a celeb
spiration post for Nina Dobrev I really
like it it goes with a lot of different
things and it's easy to throw on over
like a lot of the stuff I already
mentioned like a romper or a dress next
from Topshop about a dress it's a blue
I'm blue as like a trend for me right
now and I don't know what that's about
it's roughly on top as a tank top it's
super cute it's just super cute it's
like a rap it's a rap style so that's
why it's kind of like flowing all over
the place uh yeah love it
and lastly I got some things from
revolve and the first one is this top
again it's freaking blue deep v it's
kind of like a roughly or like a peplum
style at the bottom super cute it's a
tank top really easy to wear for the
springtime and I'm down with that and
then the other thing is a romper and it
looks like this it's a super spring Kosh
floral it has like lace on the bottom
here that's basically it rompers are
just like awesome because you can wear
them so many different ways throw a
jacket on it if it's not that warm like
this with this BAM you know what I'm
saying and then lastly we've got some
shoes and I got these from revolt as
well they're by the brand Rey and they
look like this I don't know what type of
shoes these are I'm sure there's like a
name for them just kind of one of those
shoes you can just kind of throw on with
anything and like go out the door and
they're really easy so I was all for
them but that's everything I never know
until editing if this was super long or
super short so let me know in the
comments below if you what you liked and
