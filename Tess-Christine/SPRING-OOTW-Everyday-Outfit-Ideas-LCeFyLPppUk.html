channel today's video is going to be a
spring outfit of the week and I do these
all the time on my channel so you know
how they work I just wanted to give you
guys some spring outfit inspiration
even though spring kind of snuck up on
us really quick and now it's almost
summer I don't know if it's like that
where you guys were but in New York it
was so cold and then it got hot real
quick so what's left is spring I hope
you guys enjoy but a lot of these can be
transitioned over to summer so also this
video is in collaboration with Lulu's
calm so a lot of the items that I'm
wearing can be found on Lulu's so have a
lot of those items linked below so yeah
I hope you guys enjoy and let's get
started
starting off with outfit number one that
this one the main piece is a maxi skirt
I've definitely been loving these at
this spring and upcoming summer you're
gonna be seeing a lot more of them I
just think they're really easy to wear
and really comfortable so the one that
I'm wearing is from Lulu's I love the
blue floral print I like that it's
wrapped it's really flattering and it's
definitely breezy so how I styled that
was I just wore a gray tank top that is
from Topshop
and I belted it with a belt from Urban
Outfitters I like the belt it adds a
little bit of it kind of breaks up the
tank top and the skirt but if you're in
a hurry you could just wear the skirt
and I think it would look just as good
and then for shoes I just stuck with
something simple and wore some sneakers
from sin so I like these because they
have little star prints all over them
and then they have the neutral stripe
down the side
this next outfit I love because it
incorporates polka-dots which has been
one of my favorite prints recently
through the fall winter and now spring I
just love it I think it's really dainty
and pretty so this blouse is actually a
cropped blouse you can't really tell
because it's tucked into my high-waisted
shorts but the blouse is from Lulu's I
absolutely love it for my short I was
lucky enough to find some vintage
high-waisted leather shorts like a year
or two ago off of Etsy and they just are
my staple I love them in the winter I
wear them with tights I just think that
they're so cute and then for the rest of
it for my shoes I just wore these from
superga I like how they kind of break it
up with the woven detailing on the
bottom of the platform I think it makes
it a little bit more spring in summary
and then lastly for my jewelry and my
necklace is from five and two and then
my earrings are just basic hoop earrings
from Lulu's this next outfit is one of
my favorites because I love love love
the color red lately ever since I got
this bodysuit I've been wearing it so
much it is from Lulu's I love the red
color it's a really cool like lace-up
bodysuit but what makes it unique is it
has kind of like a texture to it it's
almost like a lace detailing which i
think is really cool add some dimension
to the outfit and then for my pants I
just decided a to keep it simple white
pants are huge for spring so I have
these ones from meow I really like them
they have some floral detailing on it
like embroidery I think it's really
pretty and then for my shoes I kept it
simple again and just were some woven
slip-on slides from Lulu's and then of
course kept my jewelry simple I'm
wearing the necklace from five and two
this next one is another one of my go-to
I love just a simple look with jeans on
a top so I'm just wearing these Levi's
jeans from Lulu's I love them they're
really good high-waisted cut I also like
the rips in it since it's spring and
summer you can finally bring out your
ripped jeans again if that's yours
style or my top I just stuck with
something simple so I went with this
from Finders Keepers it's just a striped
off the shoulder top for my necklace
that is from ASOS and then for my woven
sandals those are the same ones from
before and those are from Lulu's and
then just kind of add some fun different
stuff I guess the outfit I wore a red
lip which is just like classic but I
also think it can totally change up an
outfit this next look is one of my
favorites this color palette is kind of
my go-to so starting off with the
bustier top or like crop top that is
from Lulu's I love it I love the white
color I think perfect for spring and
summer it always makes you look a little
bit more tan but with chops like these I
always try to wear something that's
super high-waisted so I have these genes
from lioness and I love them I think
they're super unique Pat likes to say
they have a collar on them which is true
they're kind of like these fold-over
jeans but they're very high waisted so
when pairing with a super cropped top
like this this is what I usually tend to
do I've been over it I just wore this
like suede I want to say jacket but it's
more like a shirt because it's not very
thick that is from Urban Outfitters I
like how it kind of breaks up the outfit
a little bit and adds a little bit of a
different color and then for my shoes I
just kept it simple were some converse I
love them they're easy to wear and turn
around a New York in and then for my
glasses those are from ASOS along with
my necklace
and then for this last outfit this is
another one of my favorites something
you'll definitely see me in a lot more
starting off with the jeans are just the
same not Levi's ones from Lulu's love
the reps they're high-waisted so they go
really well with this crop top again
from Lulu's I love the color mustard
color is like one of my favorite things
right now so I love this one I love the
lace ups I love that it's off the
shoulder so that's one of my favorite
types of top so how I styled all of this
was I basically just wore some
espadrilles or like wedge sandals and I
will have those linked below I can't
remember where they're from and then for
my hat that is where is that from I'm
not sure I think ASOS it's just a beret
you can get those anywhere and then I
wore the same ASOS glasses and the same
essence necklace and that was pretty
much it very very easy but that's my
video for today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did be sure to give it
a big thumbs up and let me know in the
comments below which outfit was your
favorite and I will see you all in my
next video
