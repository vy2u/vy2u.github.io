channel today's video is going to be a
try on clothing haul it is spring themed
because that's what is in all the stores
now which is really fun it's still a
little bit cold in New York so most of
the stuff I'm gonna be wearing in LA in
the next two weeks is Pat and I will be
there visiting my brother and fun stuff
like that so make sure you're following
me on my Instagram to get a head start
on seeing all the VIPs items styled and
outfits after this so I really hope you
guys enjoy it and let's get started
first favorite love a so see you guys
know Asus is just I think it's one of
those stores that I could you were only
had to choose one store to shop in for
the rest of your life I feel like when
it comes to clothes and fashion and all
that I would pick a so I just love it
so the first thing from ASOS is this
shirt dress and I like was good to say
shirt but it's a shirt dress it's polka
dots which I'm kind of newly loving I
absolutely love the polka dot print I
feel like every time I see something in
a store that's polka dot I immediately
gravitate towards it I absolutely love
this it kana is a little intimidating
looking because it just kind of hangs
there but when I saw this online I kind
of envisioned myself belting it with
like a huge chunky belt and then like
wear it with boots and like a beret I
just think it's really cute next up is a
jacket that I'm really excited about I
always find that in the spring and
summer jean jackets are just great but
they are kind of one of those things
when you have one that you really like
like I've had this oversized denim
jacket for so long from Topshop you just
that's like all you need but I saw this
one and it was a little unique it has
this like quilted floral pattern
throughout it so to be honest it's only
denim on the collar
unlike the lining otherwise it's like
this quilted but I just think it's so
cute it's so soft and cozy and I feel
like this is going to be great for those
chillier night especially since spring
it's like starting to become summer but
it's still a little cold so this will be
really good to just throw on over and
just like a basic t-shirt and jeans
and then the last thing from ASOS are
these sunglasses
yes I absolutely love these they are I
almost didn't put them in here just
because I went online and they are sold
out even though I just bought them but
they're just by ASOS they're not like a
special brand or anything like that so
they were like super affordable but I
will link some similar ones down below
they're just oval shape with a tortoise
gripped the next thing is from Zara I
only produced one thing and I really
liked it because of the color it is a
little bit more on the fancier side so
I'm something like super chill but I
definitely love it because I think this
mustard color is perfect for spring and
I'm not gonna lie I saw Emily
Ratajkowski wearing this and I love how
she styles things so I kind of just had
to have it
it's a blazer but it's kind of a longer
version of a blazer and what's awesome
is I love that it has a tie because you
can really cinch your waist and you know
make it look super nice the next items
are from a Reformation and my love I
love a Reformation so much I just think
everything that they come out with is
just perfect I wish my whole closet was
Reformation but I have two tops to show
you both of which are very spraining the
first one is definitely more spring
because it incorporates floral it looks
like this
I love the ruffle sleeves and I love how
it kind of accentuates the bust area but
these are just really great tops you
just wear with jeans I think it's really
cute and it's a very feminine flattering
cut and I absolutely love it I also love
the color blue really pretty so and then
the next thing from Reformation is more
of a corset style top I love it I still
think it's really classy and really
pretty it's not too over too over the
top with the corset detailing it just
kind of laces up in the front it's
definitely more of a thicker material so
it has kind of like a sweater I don't
know I really like it it's really soft
and comfy and I just think it's perfect
because it's one of those tops that you
can dress up or down meaning you get a
lot of use out of it the next place that
I went to is Topshop and it's been a
minute since I bought anything from
Topshop but what I've been loving it
lately are four
essentials basics basics so I have two
things right here the first one is a
sweatshirt it's kind of cropped but I
absolutely love it I also love the color
these things are really great to just
throw on it I mean it's easy it's a
sweatshirt but I love that it's just
kind of a solid color again it's cropped
so it'll look really good with my
favorite thing ever or high-waisted
jeans so excited about that and then the
other thing that I've been loving is
just like basic tees and I used to be so
into buying all these like crazy
intricate tops but recently I've been
loving just wearing a basic tee or even
just a graphic tee and layering on a
bunch of jewelry maybe some hoop
earrings and then tucking it into jeans
with the belt I just think it's such a
simple yet really really cute put
together outfit and it's just kind of
been my go-to lately especially when I
don't really want to think about my
outfit next up we have Lulu's and I
absolutely love Lulu's they just have
the most wide range of things on their
site and I absolutely love it so the
first thing is a pair of jeans they're
Levi's but why I specifically wanted
these because you know I own a lot of
jeans and I probably don't need any more
but the one thing I really wanted to get
is like a darker wash denim yeah in like
a darker blue I have black I have a
lighter wash black and then I have like
a bunch of light wash denim jeans but I
have none that's like this shade and
again they're high-waisted they're the
wedgie fit Levi's I believe but I love
them they're so comfortable Levi's are
definitely don't have a lot of stretch
to them but I just think that they're so
durable next up is more of a I guess
girlier top it's floral off the shoulder
you know another one of my faves but I
love this one because it's definitely
more of a muted color like the the
colors are very faded it is floral it
has like pinks purples mustards but I
love this because even with the jeans I
just showed you I just think this is a
really cute simple outfit next is
another one of those like basic
essentials it is a very very very soft
sweater sweatshirt type of top I love
this kind of stuff
because for spring like I was saying
especially in New York it's not full-on
summer weather yet even though you want
to dress through summer because all of
these floral if tops are coming out and
you just are sick of the cold but it's
definitely important to have something
like this because these are really easy
next up is another basic simple tee
again I'm loving this especially for
spring because you got it was still
layered like a little bit but I love
this because it's white white is just
such a good color but it has cute little
flowers right here
they're embroidered I just think it's
really simple it's not over-the-top I
just think this would be really cute
with jeans this next item I saw
immediately on their site and I
absolutely loved it I love tops that
kind of tie right here I just gives off
a very retro vibe and I saw this one
that just looks like a giant scarf but
you basically just wrap it around and
tie it like here when I do the cutaways
you guys will see but I have these huge
paper bag waisted pants from ASOS that
go up super super high and that's pretty
much the only way I feel comfortable
wearing tops like these that kind of
give off like you're wearing a swimsuit
if I have a super super high waisted
pair of pants that kind of cover a lot
of the midriff because otherwise I can
think or I think it can look a little
bit too revealing for like day to day
unless you are an abhi setting if you
watched my vacation packing guide you
would know you would probably see this
coming so for the spring and summer I
suspect a huge trend is gonna be woven
bags I think they're so cute and they
definitely give off a summer vibe Lulu's
has a ton of them and they're amazing
this one is a square which i think is so
cute I love these I think this is so
good it fits my style perfectly I love
to dress a little bit more on the
vintage II side so I feel like bags like
this are totally a throwback and then
the last thing is a pair of shoes and
this is definitely more of a splurge
item that I don't don't do too often but
they are a pair of heels or I guess like
sandal heels I love this I think they're
so cute this style of shoe is one of my
favorites but in specific I really like
the style of how these are made
basically they kind of not
at the top oh my I can't talk they not
basically where the Thais are which i
think is really cute they have different
floral prints on the top and on the
bottom of the shoe I just think they're
really cute they're gonna go with a lot
of those basic tops that I show you guys
but then this also adds like a total
different flair to your outfit and add
some print some color so I absolutely
love these these are from Nordstrom so
that is it for my spring clothing haul I
really hope you guys liked it and found
some know inspiration to either pull
from your closet or when you're out
shopping to look for but yeah like I
said in the beginning of the video make
sure you head over to my Instagram to
see all of these items styled within the
week or so by the time this goes up I'm
sure I'll already have some of it posted
so make sure you check that out and yeah
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
