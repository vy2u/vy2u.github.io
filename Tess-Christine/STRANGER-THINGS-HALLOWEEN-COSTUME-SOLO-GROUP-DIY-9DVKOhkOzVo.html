channel today's video is going to be
another Halloween video and as you can
already tell it's for stranger things
which is a huge show on Netflix this
year and yes I'm doing a lot of very
popular costumes because I thought it
would be helpful for a wide range of
people you feel me so I start off by
showing you 11 then I show you guys how
to make it a really cool group costume
and then if you're not feeling that and
you want to be the house saw this on
Pinterest it's an easy awesome DIY quick
last-minute you can throw it together 15
minutes before the party your
trick-or-treating and you're good to go
they're also perfect for school because
they're not too revealing and yeah it's
just an overall great costume and
everyone's going to think you look bomb
so I really hope you guys enjoy it and
let's get started okay so if you want to
dress up as 11 this year for Halloween
this one is super easy it's super
recognizable and everyone's gonna know
who you are
plus it's perfect for school and if you
live in a colder climate because it's
pretty warm and you can layer it which
is awesome so starting off with the main
pieces of the outfit the main one is the
pink dress that's kind of like your
signature look so I couldn't find a pink
dress with a peter pan collar on its own
so I went to Amazon and both bought
those pieces separately so I found a
pink baby doll style dress which is kind
of what she wears and then for the peter
pan collar that's a detachable necklace
so you can kind of put it into any dress
to make it look like it already has that
collar which is perfect super affordable
I'll have everything linked in the
description box below for you guys then
for the tube socks I found some on
Amazon that actually are like 11 socks I
think it was under some sort of costume
thing but the main thing for her socks
is that the tube socks are a green and
yellow you can go ahead and wear
whatever tube socks you have if you
don't care about matching perfectly but
just a tip for you I wore just some
converse and then I went to my local
thrift store for a navy windbreaker to
match hers that was super cheap and easy
to find at the thrift store and then for
the wig you can get that at on Amazon
that's where I got mine mine's a lace
front wig and then of course you've got
to carry around Eggos and put some blood
in your nose
now if you want to make this an epic
group costume you have endless of
options and it'll look so cool so I
rounded up my friends and made them be
Mike Dustin and Lucas but you don't have
to have guy friends to do this either
you can have girls do it and they look
just as sick so for Lucas the main
things are having a bandana some sort of
striped t-shirt and some sort of
corduroy jacket or shirt then for Mike
the main thing is a striped polo or
plaid button-up something with a collar
and then some sort of khaki jacket for
Dustin the main thing is his hat which I
will have linked on Amazon any type of
bright colored t-shirt or anything
printed and then some sort of jacket
after that add your 11 costume and you
have the most epic group for Halloween
it's going to look sick and if you have
more people you can even add Nancy and
barb so if you can't decide on what
character to be or you just need
something super last-minute and easy and
kind of funny it you can be the house
like I said I saw this on Pinterest and
I thought it was so fun so all you're
going to need is some sort of
button-down shirt you go to a thrift
store for this but make sure it's
light-colored I got a plaid one because
I thought it matched the shows by really
well plus it kind of looked like the
walls wallpaper you're also going to
need a fabric marker and some
battery-powered colored lights so after
laying the shirt flat on the ground I
just put some cardboard cutouts
underneath it so that the fabric a paint
wouldn't go through the shirt and get on
the floor or just on the backside of the
shirt so all you're going to do is start
spelling out the alphabet onto the shirt
and actually I found that having this
plaid print helps me out a lot because I
didn't have to kind of like measure
anything out or do any like lines
because the plaid kind of lined it out
for me so I could make sure that all the
letters were super straight so that's
kind of a tip for you if you're kind of
looking through a thirst store to find a
shirt that works so this is pretty
self-explanatory and the best part about
this is you can be super messy because
when she writes the letters it's like
all crazy anyways but you can do them
however you like so after that the shirt
is done super easy and then for the
lights I found those at Target and I was
really excited about them because
they're battery-powered so you can just
kind of walk around with them actually
lit up instead of just sitting you know
buy an outlet
whole time so I just took those lights
and I basically just wrapped them around
my neck like so kept them super loosely
so that they matched up with some of the
letters and then I turned the batteries
on and just stuck that into my back
pocket and it was so easy so then for
the rest of my outfit I just wore some
black jeans and black booties just to
keep it simple and not distract from the
rest of the outfit and then after that
that's it I love this one it's perfect
for those of you who want to steer away
from being 11 out of fear that many
people will this is kind of a fun
creative way to do it differently but
that's it for my video today I really
hope you guys liked it if you did please
give it a thumbs up and let me know in
the comments below if you've already
decided on your Halloween costume and
you're just watching these for fun cause

couple costumes video and that'll be my
last of my Halloween videos here so I'll
