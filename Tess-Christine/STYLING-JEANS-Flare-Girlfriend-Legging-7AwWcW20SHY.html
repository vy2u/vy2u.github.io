what's up guys today's video is going to
be a styling video I'm super excited
about this one because jeans for me are
a staple in my wardrobe they're so
comfortable and you can style them a
bunch of different ways I definitely
wanted to get this video up now because
if you've been shopping recently you've
noticed that in stores fall stuff is
coming out already
so I thought this video would be really
helpful for some style inspiration for
your upcoming back-to-school shopping or
fall shopping in general I'm also super
excited to say that this video is in
collaboration with express for they're
fit for you campaign so I'm going to
show you guys three key new styles Flair
girlfriend and legging so I really hope
you guys enjoy this and let's get
started starting off with the flare
jeans I went for a very 70s vibe with
this first outfit because I love the
fact that fashion is getting recycled
and this is a huge trend right now plus
you guys know I love my boho style so
this is honestly one of my favorite
looks from the video but starting off
with the jeans of course I'm wearing the
light wash distressed slim the flare
Jean from Express and a tip for you if
you think that they're a bit long is to
wear them with some chunky heels to not
only avoid alterations but also to
elongate your legs so for the rest of
the outfit I wore this embroidered
fringe top from Free People paired with
a necklace and a brown leather jacket
from Express
moving on to outfit number two I decided
to tone down the 70s eyes in case that
isn't for you because I want to show you
guys that you can still wear flare jeans
without going full 70's style so I
decided to use the same distressed flare
jeans from before but in case these are
ear style they do make a sailor style
flare Jean which you can get a
completely different look from but for
my look I decided to wear an olive color
blouse from All Saints and my go to
layer jewelry with of course my favorite
club master sunglasses and since you
guys know I love fringe I decided to
wear a fringe black jacket from Express
and then I wanted to add some light
color with my cream-colored bag so I did
that but overall I think this is a look
I'm definitely going to rock this fall
okay so now on to the girlfriend Jean
the jeans that I'm wearing are the light
wash to stress girlfriend Jean and what
I specifically love about these is that
it has more of a tapered fit than a
boyfriend fit does so it's a little bit
slimmer in the thigh which I love
because then it doesn't look like I'm
drowning in them so overall this Jean is
actually perfect for me since I'm a
little bit more petite so how I styled
it was pretty simple I just wore a black
bodysuit from American Apparel and then
a belt from shop up for a little added
texture over it I wore a poncho from
Express and a tip for you when wearing
something as heavy as something like
this is to wear something a little bit
tighter underneath it like I did so it
doesn't look like you're swimming in
your outfit and then lastly since you
know I love booties and they're my
favorite I wore to some simple black
ones from rag-and-bone for this next
outfit I thought I would keep it even
more simple so again I wore the same
girlfriend jeans from before but this
time I kept it casual with the super
comfy expressed 111 v-neck tee and since
she's like this are simple and easy to
wear you can really start of anything so
I thought it would look cool some
studded sandals like these ones which
are a huge trend right now a layered
tassel necklace from Express and one of
my favorite black floppy hats from rygan
bow and one of my favorite things about
keeping it outfit simple like this is
that you can layer it really easily so I
did that with an army jacket from Target
now moving on to the legging style Jean
the style of jean has always been my
go-to because it's so versatile and you
can style it a bunch of different ways
so the jeans that I'm wearing are the
white mid-rise legging
these are super comfy and I've been
loving them so again it kept it simple
by wearing an Express 111 v-neck tee
over it because it's super comfy and who
doesn't love just a t-shirt and jeans
it's probably my go-to way to style
things so I definitely wanted to include
it in here and for shoes I thought I
would make it a little bit dressier by
wearing some black strappy sandals and
then lastly for a fun layering element I
added this a black and white fringe
sweater from the Koopas overall this is
something I would wear on a dinner night
out or a casual day if I switched up the
shoes
now this last style of gene is still a
legging but what's different about this
from the last one is that it is
performance stretch so what that means
is it's basically made with a new fabric
that's supposed to retain its shape
throughout the day and not stretch out
like normal jeans so I actually put it
to the test and wear them throughout the
day and film this last outfit just
before sundown so I guess you can be the
judge
so for my night look I wore this floral
top from intermix it's very light and
flowy I love it and I paired that with
my go-to layered necklaces over it I
wore a green utility jacket from Express
and then lastly for my strappy sandals I
purchased those at shop
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it if you
