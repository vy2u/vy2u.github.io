channel today's video is going to be a
favorites or essentials video whatever
you want to call it just things but I've
been absolutely loving and using a lot
of over the summer so first I'm going to
start off with beauty products I only
have three and they're things that I've
been absolutely loving so the first is
this thing right here and that's the
tatcha luminous dewy skin mist you guys
might have seen this well you well yeah
you might have seen this if you watched
it a haul video i bought it and i was
kind of skeptical about it i thought it
was going to make my face look too dewy
you know that whole thing but i
absolutely love it it's just like the
perfect setting spray after i put on my
makeup the next product is a tanning
product and it is the vita Liberata
self-tan dry oil and i actually teamed
up with them on this to show you it
because i absolutely love it but in
specific why i love it is that it's
actually SPF 50 so it's a broad-spectrum
protection coverage whatever you want to
call it so it's like a bonus
two-in-one thing so it gives you the tan
and it also protects you you can apply
it before the Sun after the Sun just
kind of maintained that tan it gives you
a gradual tan too but it kind of
enhances it and makes it a little bit
easier so you don't have to wait all
summer to get the tan you just kind of
like apply this and you're good to go so
I really like it it's super easy to
apply so a couple drops into my hand rub
it in circular motions and I just kind
of rub it into my skin until it's all
evenly distributed and yeah it works
awesome I really like it you can get it
at Sephora the next product is one that
I'm not sure you guys will have heard of
but it's the Kelly Kuan pocket Spa I
actually worked with Kelly Kwan herself
on set and she was using this on my face
and I just like fell in love with it I
like had to have it but basically it's
just like a hydrating mist that you kind
of disperse all over your face and it
keeps your face super well moisturized
and hydrated I'm really excited because
I'm going on a plane here at the end of
the week so I'm really looking forward
to you sitting on there and just kind of
like seeing how it works I've been using
it this past month and I really love it
but I'm going to kind of
I put it through the ringer and see how
much I really liked it moving on to
fashion the first thing that I know you
guys could probably guess and that is
the off the shoulder top I have so many
of these I've been accumulating them all
summer this one is particularly my
favorite right now and it's by
Reformation I can't talk today but it's
just a white off the shoulder top super
easy I really like just like simple off
the shoulder ones that you can wear with
a bunch of different things
the next is a denim dress I just think
it's an essential to have and this one
in specific I've been loving because
it's super easy to just throw on it is
off the shoulder imagine that but this
one's from Lulu's I really like it it's
a denim obviously but I think the style
has just become really popular this
summer so I think a lot of people really
love it I think it would look good on
just about anyone and it's definitely
one of my essentials next up is the
graphic tee and I've been loving these
because if you live in New York or just
live anywhere that it's been hot you
know when it gets so hot and sticky you
don't even want to attempt to try to put
on a cute outfit you just want to just
have it easy
so just throwing on just like a t-shirt
and some denim shorts makes your life so
much easier and comfy and I just think
it looks really good so I've been trying
to figure out a lot of different ways to
kind of dress them love wearing them
with like thick belt I think that looks
really good so just kind of
experimenting with that has just been my
jam this summer next up are high-waisted
denim shorts just I mean come on that's
essential for just about anybody right
but I've just been loving these in
specific these are from ASOS I
specifically love the wash of these
because they're just like this light
medium wash denim and they go with a
bunch of different things I have these
ones as well that I really love but
they're more of a bright blue so I can't
wear them with as many colors whereas
these you can wear with any color of the
rainbow and it'll look good then is just
a basic slip-on shoe and I don't know
why I haven't been wearing a lot of
sandals this summer I don't know if it's
because I'm in New York and I walk a lot
or what the deal is but I've just been
loving just like a basic sneaker or
slip-on shoe the white ones that I wear
all the time which you guys saw in my
summer lookbook and then also these I've
been loving these are like some suede
taupe colored shoes but I like these
color goes with again pretty much
anything they're just so easy to slip on
and go both of them are by FRA super
heavy-duty good quality shoes that I can
count on next up are some glasses
so the first are some just traditional
sunglasses that I've been loving the
first are just these fun mirrored ones
by ray-ban I like these because they're
just really fun they're like a pink
color but they kind of jazz up any
outfit make it a little bit earlier but
then if I want something that's easy
that I can just grab and it'll go with
pretty much anything I've been loving
loving loving these these are sunglasses
that a lot of people ask me about I
think the brand is called illest Eva I
think so yeah um and I just love it it's
a tortoiseshell the black lens and then
um gold detailing it's I love it and
then you already know I got these these
are like my go-to I don't know what it
is but I just absolutely love them
they're just a clear frame glass just
glasses I guess I got them off of ASOS
for like $15 I just think they're really
fun fashion statement and they kind of
jazz up an outfit or make it different
and fun and I've just been loving them
if you guys have noticed I post nearly
every other day in these babes and then
my last fashion essential or favorite is
definitely next scarves I'm obsessed I
think they're great
I go for the bandanna type or I go for
ones that are like more printed and like
slouchy if you guys watch my Dumbo
travel guide the vintage shop that I
showed you guys in that that's where I
get all of the scars they're amazing but
any thrift shop or I mean if you want to
go to Urban Outfitters they over priced
them so you can find some killer one set
some thrift shops but they're just so
fun I add them to pretty much anything
like I'm just wearing a basic tank and I
just think it makes the outfit look
super cute and the last thing are some
lifestyle favorites so the first thing
is a Polaroid I got this big one but
this one I just in specific have been
loving recently because it prints up the
bigger format Polaroids and I just think
it has a little bit of a nicer quality
of but I just love it I brought us a
fourth of July and then we took some
really cute photos Patrick and I love
just kind of like goofing off and taking
some and the second is a portable
speaker looks like this and it's the UE
I think it's called we got it for
Christmas from Pat's family and we just
love it we use it all the time like I'm
not even kidding you it hooks up by
bluetooth it's portable it's waterproof
and we listen to it in the morning
making breakfast making dinner we take
it outside on the roof to parks like you
can control the volume it goes pretty
low it goes pretty high so it just
depends what you want it for but this is
just awesome it's small enough to even
put in a purse so some are essential yes
and the last is a television show and I
thought I would include this because I
always love to hear you guys commentary
on it Patrick and I have just recently
caught up and been loving Game of
Thrones we watched like the whole series
and caught up to what it is now in like
a month and it was amazing and I'm
obsessed with it so without leaving any
spoilers tell me some of your favourite
things about it if you watch it if you
don't wash it or what shows you're super
into I love talking to you guys about
all the stuff but anyways that's the
video for today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and yeah enjoy listening to
me talk about my favorite things so I
want to hear yours now so let me know in
the comments below what you've been
loving and yeah I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
