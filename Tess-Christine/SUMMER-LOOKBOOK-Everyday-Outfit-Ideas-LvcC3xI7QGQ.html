video and starting off with outfit
number one all the outfits you're going
to see are stuff that I would wear on a
day to day basis I love all of them so I
really see guys do too so this first one
involves a 2-piece set which I purchased
from Urban Outfitters I love the color
of it it's like the terry cloth material
so it's perfect for the summer over I
just layered a denim jacket which is
from Topshop super easy to throw on on
my chili or summer night and then for my
shoes I'm just wearing some white
sneakers which are a staple for me for
the summer and those are from Superga or
accessories I just wore some cat eye
glasses from Urban Outfitters this next
outfit incorporates one of my summer
essentials and that's off the shoulder
tops or crop tops this one that I'm
wearing is from Windsor super affordable
I love the zig Ingham print that's kind
of taking over the summer so I had to
feature it so I'm just wearing that and
then I tucked it into some high-waisted
denim shorts that you guys have seen
from four years now and those are from
ASOS I'm wearing the same white sneakers
as before from Superga and then to kind
of throw a little bit of a different
twist to it I'm wearing this really cool
fiddler hat from lack of color
this next one is more on the dressy side
but I definitely made it more casual
with kind of the sandals on the top that
I chose to pair it with so starting off
with this outfit my favorite thing ever
is the skirt that is from revolve the
brand majorelle I love the floral print
it kind of has a vintage feel to it
which kind of goes with the whole vibe
of the video and then for the top that's
from Windsor mixing high and low pieces
is something I love to do so that's
exactly what I did and then my sandals
that I'm wearing our also from Windsor
very summery and very easy to wear this
next outfit is something you'd probably
catch me in the most especially when
it's super hot out because it's the
easiest to wear and the simplest put
together it just involves a body suit
and some denim shorts so the body suit
I'm wearing is from Windsor it's a white
color I love wearing white this summer I
always think that it makes you look
tanner and then for my shorts both our
girlfriend denim they're just some
cutoff shorts definitely a staple for me
and then for my shoes I just decided to
throw on some mules from tony bianco
they're just a neutral color so they
work really well and then my earrings
are from Lulu's
this next one is definitely more on the
put-together side I always feel that if
you don't just throw on denim shorts it
always tends to look a little bit more
put together so that's exactly what I
did was one of my favorite bodysuit the
bodysuit that I'm wearing is from
privacy please by Raval this is the
neutral color but I love the bell
sleeves and how I kind of dressed it up
a little bit more as I wore this white
denim skirt that has kind of a late bit
detailing on it from Windsor
I love the white and the neutrals
together I just think it looks so pretty
and then for my shoes so they're also
from Windsor my go-to Faithfull sandals
I love them I featured them in my summer
essentials video and then for my bandana
that is from a target but that's it for
my video today I really hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did it be sure to give
it a thumbs up and let me know in the
comments below which outfit was your
favorite I'll see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
