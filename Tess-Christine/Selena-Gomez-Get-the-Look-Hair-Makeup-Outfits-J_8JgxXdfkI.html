highly requested get to look video for
the lovely Selena Gomez you guys all
voted on this photo for her hair and her
makeup so I wanted to do that it's from
her come &amp;amp; get it music video it's a
little bit outdated but you guys were
all still asking me for it so of course
I was gonna do it and then I get the
look video would not be complete without
the outfit so I went on her Instagram
and I picked out about six outfits from
her latest tour that I thought were kind
of comfy cozy and different and kind of
screamed Selena Gomez so if you're
interested please keep on watching
starting out the makeup of course I'm
going to prime my eyes and then apply a
very pigmented bronzy gold color I
really wanted to make this look very
easy and simple for you guys at home so
I only used a couple of shadows to kind
of mimic Selena's and kind of this
inspired look it's definitely not exact
but it's as close as I could get with
making it very easy for you guys so all
I did was take that gold shadow for the
base of it and put it on basically all
over my eye and then I'm taking a light
brown color and mixing with a dark brown
color and placing that into my crease
using windshield wiper motions and on my
lower lash line to create that smoked
out look at the corners of my eye on
taking a black eye shadow and creating
an outer V with a flat top I shadow
brush making it very dramatic and
flicking it out almost past my eyebrow
and then of course connecting it onto
the lower lash line to give some
highlight and blend out any harsh lines
I'm taking a beige color and placing
that onto my brow bone with a large
fluffy brush to match Selena's look even
more I'm taking an eyeliner and I'm
basically flicking it out at the end
matching it with the wing that I had
created with the eyeshadow and then
heavily lining my eyes cuz Selena in
this look has her eyes very lime still
lining both of my water lines and then
with a smudge brush kind of smudging it
all in and connecting it all to give
this kind of smoky effect and then
lastly applying a couple coats of
mascara you can finish with false lashes
I chose not to today but definitely your
call on that moving on to the face I
applied Foundation and concealer but
next I'm going to bronze because that's
very important for the Selena look I am
using a matte bronzer and I am basically
doing it on the contours of my face to
give me kind of a bronzy glow and then
for the cheeks I'm just using a coral
because you don't want anything
overpowering because you are going to be
wearing red lipstick so now I'm going to
show you guys how to get Selena Gomez's
hair now keep in mind that Selena Gomez
has very thick hair it kind of curls
it's easy to get that big messy grow
like look when you have thicker curly
hair so I'm going to show you guys how I
achieved it with my hair type which is
not curly like that at all
I'm going to show you guys how to do it
it's not going to be exact but it's
going to be as close as I can get so how
I'm doing it as I'm sectioning the top
half of my hair up to keep out of my
face this is just how I like curling my
hair you guys can do it however way you
want but how I'm doing this is I'm
taking the Conner infinity wand and I'm
wrapping sections of hair around the
barrel every other direction what I like
about this is it's great for creating
waves because it leaves the end part of
your hair out and it doesn't curl it
under which is perfect for this look so
after I've curled my whole bottom half
of my head I'm going to leave it and you
don't want to touch it because you want
to make sure that the curls hold in the
form they were just curled in you don't
want to comb it out you want them to
cool completely so when you comb it out
later to get that big look on that
Selena Gomez has they're not going to
fall out or anything crazy like that
so I sped this up for you guys so you
don't have to watch me curl my hair
because it's very easy I'm doing this on
my whole head just curling the curls
every other direction but the front
pieces away from my face keep in mind
you want them away from your face so
after that I'm just going to take a
teasing brush and I'm just going to
basically kind of comb it out once the
curls are completely cooled you not
forget that part because you don't want
your hair to fall out um not literally
the curls fall out but anyways I'm just
taking the teasing comb and I'm just
kind of back combing it to kind of give
that frizzy look I'm looking at Selena
Gomez's photo as I'm doing this and she
does kind of have a frizzy look to her
hair and it's very big and messy so I am
just kind of taking the teasing comb and
doing the crown of my head and the sides
of my head and then also a big part of
selena gomez's hairstyle in this is that
the end parts of the curls are straight
so if you need to go over with any with
the curling iron with any parts that
aren't straight you can go ahead and do
that that's what I did to give kind of a
more exact look that she had and voila
it's done now of course we can't forget
the red lips
I'm using this one by Mac it's called
Russian red it's a matte red lipstick I
thought it matched her perfectly and I
tried to look up what the exact lipstick
was and I thought it was this one I
could be wrong and got it off of a bad
site but I heard that it was that one so
hopefully it is but that's it for the
hair and the makeup now let's move on to
the outfits this first outfit is from
one of her meet in Greece actually a lot
of these outfits are but I like this one
because is very cute and casual and
super comfy the pants those are from
Topshop as well as the shell top that
I'm wearing that's also from Topshop but
any white top will work both of them are
exact this next one is another one from
her meet-and-greet I found the exact
Harlem pants that she's wearing those
are from forever 21 she was wearing it
with a white t-shirt in that photo but
she was also seen wearing it with a
white sweater which I actually preferred
the one that I'm wearing is from H&amp;amp;M
this next outfit is from her tour it's
very scandalous because she was wearing
as a black bra but you can go ahead and
wear it with a black tank top the exact
shirt that she was wearing is from
forever 21 and then I paired it with
black jeans like she did so next one is
super fun I found it off of her
Instagram it's a onesie from forever 21
leopard print I love it I wanted to
share with you guys because it's so
comfy and cozy and inexpensive these
last two are definitely more on the
fancier side this one she was seen
wearing a couple different times it's a
jumpsuit from Topshop I really love it
obviously because it's Topshop it's a
little bit more on the pricier side but
it definitely can be dressed up and it's
super comfortable for this last look she
was seen wearing another jumpsuit at the
Mall of America recently I really love
this one a lot because it's kind of has
like a fancier feel to it I love the
glitter enos and the fluffiness part of
the top and then the sleek look of the
bottoms I just think this looks so
sophisticated and put together but that
is it for my Selena Gomez get the look
video I really hope you guys found this
helpful and fun to watch everything I
said will be in the description box
below and as always thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
