going to be a Selena Gomez inspired hair
and makeup tutorial and I love Selena
Gomez and I always think she looks so
gorgeous so I was looking through
pictures to try to find one to recreate
that I haven't really seen here on
YouTube and it was her from the Grammys
this year and I thought she looked
gorgeous and it was actually quite a
bold look for her usually she sticks to
very natural you know colors and bronzes
and stuff so I thought it would be kind
of fun to recreate this and I loved her
hair so I thought I would do that for
you girls today I really really hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial let me know
what you think in the comments below and
yeah let's get into the tutorial alright
so the first thing I'm going to do is
prime my eyes using Mac's painterly
paint-pot next with a large shadow brush
I'm going to be picking up soft Brown by
Mac and this is just a matte light brown
color and I'm just going to put that
just on my lid next with a dome shader
brush I'm going to be picking up
expresso by Mac and this is just a matte
chocolate brown color and I'm just going
to do that in windshield wiper motions
on in the crease of my eye you really
want to define your crease
all right and then from the BH Cosmetics
88 cool shimmer palette I'm going to be
taking a red dark red color you can also
use a dark reddish brown color and I'm
going to be focusing that on the outer
half of my crease this is just going to
deepen the look a little bit and then
with a fluffy brush I'm going to be
picking up that soft brown color I'm
going to be putting that sort of on my
brow bone to kind of transition into my
brow and then with a angled brush I'm
going to be taking that red color and
then that expresso dark brown color and
I'm going to be kind of creating a V
from my lash line up into my crease and
this is just kind of by using a small
angled brush this is just going to
define the crease a little bit more
alright next with a flat shader brush
I'm going to be picking up soft Brown
again and I'm going to be putting that
back on my lid to kind of soften the the
outer V that you just made
next with I'm using a sponge sponge
brush I'm just going to be taking Brule
by Mac this is just a matte beige color
and I'm putting that on in the corner of
my eye and underneath my brow next with
that angled brush again I'm going to be
picking up that expresso color that dark
brown color and I'm going to be lining
my lower lash line with that next with
the NYX felt tip eyeliner pencil or
eyeliner marker I'm going to be lining
my upper lash line keep this line very
slim and not too thick
next with a angled brush I'm only
picking up carbon by Mac this is just a
matte black color and I'm going to be
kind of smudging out that liner to kind
of create a darker look next I'm going
to curl my eyelashes and apply mascara
I'm just using the Maybelline falsies
mascara and you're going to coat your
top and bottom lashes with this alright
and that is it for the eye look it's a
very nice subtle dark brown smokey eye
and I really really hope you guys
enjoyed it now on the face so for her
face makeup you know she always kind of
has a bronzy sort of look so um and
that's what she had in this look -
because her lips you know were kind of a
bright pink color and then her eyes are
kind of bold so it would kind of be over
the top to do a pink blush so she had a
very bronze II sort of look on her
cheeks so the blush I'm going to be
using today is the mitts by Mac and it's
basically just a bronzy and has some
pink undertones but not over-the-top the
color is light over dark and this blush
is a mineralized blush so it has that it
has sort of a highlight and then that
actual blush but when it swirled
together it creates a very pretty color
so that's what I'm using so with a blush
brush I'm going to swirl that on and in
the picture she doesn't have it right on
her cheeks it's sort of bath
a little bit so that's where we're gonna
put the blush so start like halfway
about your cheekbones sometimes what I
like to do is if I suck in like that you
can kind of see where you know you want
to put it
all right so as you can see it's sort of
bronzy but you know has a subtle color
to it so it's not like full bronzer on
your face so now on to lips and for her
lips she has a fairly bold pink lip but
not too bright it's very subtle and it
looks very pretty on her so the color
I'm using is it's a lipstick by Revlon
and the color is temptress so all I'm
going to do is just put that all over my
lips and don't go too crazy and do it -
you know thick just kind of lightly pat
it on your lips
all right and then obviously her look
has some sort of a sheen or a gloss over
it so the lip or the lip gloss I'm going
to be using is by Korres and it is the
cherry lip glass I've featured it in a
lot of my videos the number or the color
is light pink
all right and then you're done that is
it for a makeup I really really hope you
guys liked the makeup look and now on to
hair alright for Selena's hair her hair
has kind of a wave to it but yeah it's a
little curly so um I'm gonna recreate
this look by using the Conair infinity
curling iron the hairspray I'm going to
be using I ran out of my other one so I
picked up a new one and the one I'm
trying is the redken quick dry 18 I'm
not quite sure they were having a sale
at one of my salons and I'm also I just
picked it up and then you're gonna need
a teasing comb and that's basically it
and obviously in the picture of your
hair is parted down the middle so I kind
of I mean I didn't part it straight down
the middle I wanted to try something
different
but if you want to get the exact look
part it down the middle alright so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to have my hair blow-dried and I spray
heat protectant on it already and all
we're gonna do is kind of I usually like
to section my hair off but this time I'm
not gonna do that I'm just gonna take
chunks of hair from I'm going to start
underneath and take chunk
chunks of hair and her hair isn't curly
all the way to the top of her head
it's just curly kind of halfway down so
I'm going to start curling kind of
middle of this hair then I'm going to
hold it there for a few seconds and then
release and you're gonna get this this
kind of wave curl and so I'm going to do
is repeat that on this half of my head
now all I'm going to do is repeat on
this side but one thing I want to make
sure you guys do so um for this side I
curled my hair using my right hand and I
went away from my face switch hands and
then do the same thing so I'll show you
so take it and wrap it over your head
and then wrap it away from your face yep
and then all I'm going to do is repeat
that through this half of my head and I
will see you when it's done
alright so now that this side is done
I'm just going to spray my whole head
with hairspray just make sure you just
get the curls all right so Salinas hair
usually has a lot of volume because I
have a feeling she has fairly thick hair
so I'm just going to tease the crown of
my head
all right and that's the finished look I
really really hope you guys liked it and
can recreate it yourselves and until the
next video see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
