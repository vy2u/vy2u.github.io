celebrity inspired hair and makeup
tutorial and today's video is inspired
by Selena Gomez at this year's Kids
Choice Awards a lot of you guys were
requesting for me to do this on my
Facebook and Twitter and I happen to
miss the whole red carpet so I wasn't
able to see her look super up-close only
when they like showed her throughout the
whole wart show so I decided to Google
her and get a super close-up image and I
saw that she was wearing blue eye shadow
know you guys know me and I am such a
neutral girl I am Browns bronzes all
that kind of stuff so I thought this
would be a really fun video to do
because I don't have a lot of tutorials
using color and I loved this blue
eyeshadow look surprisingly you know
blue eyeshadow can be kind of scary at
first but she did it in a really cool
way and made it smoked out and really
really fun I know I've showed you guys
how to curl your hair plenty of times
but Selena's looking this is very messy
and the ends are straight at the end
which is kind of different for a curled
hair style so I decided to throw in the
hair tutorial of course as well because
a lot of you guys are requesting this
look and I just didn't kind of want to
gyp you out and just do the makeup and I
wanted to just do the whole thing for
you guys so if you are interested in
seeing my Selena Gomez from the kids toy
swords inspired hair and makeup tutorial
please keep on watching let me know what
you think in the comments below don't
forget to check out my Facebook or
Twitter if you want to see your requests
become done into a video I'll be more
likely to see it on one of those social
networking sites versus a youtube
comment I do see all my YouTube comments
but I just it's just more easy to see
what you guys actually want when you
guys can post an actual picture on my
Facebook or Twitter so be sure to check
those out if you have any requests that
you're dying to get done and I will see
you guys in my next video bye guys to
begin I'm going to start by priming my
eyes with an eyeshadow primer just to
ensure that my eyeshadow stays on all
day
for the eyeshadow I'm using the
Maybelline quad and sapphire smokes
starting with the lightest shade in the
quad I'm just going to be using an
eyeshadow brush and placing that
directly onto my lid next taking the
second lightest shade in the quad I'm
just going to place that directly over
the top of the lightest color that I
just placed next with the very dark blue
color you're just going to be taking a
flat eyeshadow brush and patting that
directly onto your lid you're gonna use
the patting technique to ensure that
there's no fallout when you're applying
this dark blue color make sure you focus
it directly onto the lid and not into
the crease at all next you're gonna be
taking that last color in the quad and
with an angled crease brush you're just
going to be focusing that directly on to
the crease to ensure that the blue is
blended out and there are no harsh lines
you don't want to go too crazy with this
you just want it to be smoothed out next
with a matte cream color I'm just going
to be focusing that directly into my
brow bone to blend out any other harsh
lines and to highlight my eyes a little
bit more next with an eyeliner pencil
I'm just going to start by lining my top
lashline
I am also going to line both of my water
lines to darken the look a little bit
more and make your eyes look a little
bit more intense next with the same dark
blue that we used before with a pencil
brush I'm just going to line my lower
lash line with that this is just going
to darken the look a little bit more and
make it look a little bit more intense
with the blue on the bottom to finish up
the look I'm going to curl my eyelashes
and apply mascara I'm using two
different mascaras and I will have them
listed in the description box below now
that completes the eye makeup now let's
move on to the cheeks for my cheeks I'm
using a peach peachy pink tone blush the
color is warmth of coral by Mac and I'm
just going to be focusing that on the
apples and hollows of my cheeks lastly
for lips I chose to keep them very nude
as selena has them very nude in the
picture and the color I'm using is hue
by Mac it is a nude pink color and I'm
just going to be focusing that directly
onto my lips and then with my finger I'm
just going to kind of blend that into my
natural lips to give it more of a
natural look now let's move on to hair
for my hair I'm using freshly showered
and freshly blow-dried hair but that is
obviously optional I'm going to begin
curling from the back to the front so
after I've split my hair into two
sections right down the middle
I'm just going to start from the back
and take the Conner infinity one and
wrap the strand of hair around the
barrel away from my face now to get
Selena's messy loose curl look you're
going to leave the curl out at the end
so I'll show you again and just to
remind you guys this clip is in real
time so you guys can see how long I'm
holding each strand on top of the barrel
so all you're gonna do is take a section
of hair and wrap it around and leave
probably a couple inches off the end or
maybe like an inch inch and a half off
the end of the barrel so that's not
curled so what will remain straight and
then all you're gonna do is release and
you're gonna get this curl that's
straight at the end which is what you
want and you're just gonna repeat this
on your whole head so that's all you're
gonna do and you're not going to
alternate directions or anything you're
all going to keep it going away from
your face but don't forget to leave the
strands of hair at the end
of the curling so they don't curl
underneath
keep in mind that while you're a curling
you're gonna want to take medium sized
chunks of hair every time you're
wrapping it around the barrel you want
don't want to take too little of strands
because then you're gonna get these
tight curls that is not going to give
you the same look as Salinas so you
don't want to take huge strands of hair
but you want to take about medium sized
strands of hair and wrap them around the
barrel because then you're gonna get
these big curls on the top section of
your head and then with a straight piece
at the end it's just gonna look a lot
fuller like Salinas hair is in the
picture or at the award show so just
keep that in mind when you are curling
your hair
since Elena's hair is a lot thicker than
mine I am going to tease my hair so I'm
going to start by teasing the crown of
my head and I'm just going to section
this off into three sections and just
tease two however higher big you want it
obviously this is optional but since
Selena's hair is thicker that's what I
chose to do so lastly you're gonna
finish with hairspray and the hair look
is complete and that completes my Selena
Gomez inspired a hair and makeup
tutorial from this year's Kids Choice
Awards I really hope you guys enjoyed
this video please let me know what you
think in the comments below thank you
all so so much for watching and I will
see you guys next time
