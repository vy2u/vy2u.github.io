spring of beauty and fashion haul and I
feel like this is some old-school
YouTube stuff so I don't even really
need to explain what a haul is but not
many people do them anymore so I figured
I bought some stuff that I wanted to
show you guys so I thought I would you
know throw it back a little bit and do a
haul so starting off with makeup the
first thing that I got is this and I put
this back in the packaging for you just
to kind of show you what it looks like
for a haul purpose but I've actually
used this I actually wore it and it's on
my face right now but you guys know that
I use the makeup from our HD foundation
which is actually a super heavy
foundation I like it for the winter and
for filming but for spring and summer I
like to wear something a little bit
lighter so I thought it would try out a
new foundation make naked skin um Ultra
Definition powder foundation anyways it
comes in a little compact like this it's
already dirty cuz foundations it's got
obviously the product over here with a
sponge applicator and what I like about
it it's kind of like a creamy
consistency when you put it on sort of
and then it really gets matte like this
kind of powder finish next up I wanted a
powder compact for my purse so I got
this by Makeup Forever HD and it is just
the high definition pressed powder I
have this stuff in the loose powder
format and I really like it so I thought
I would get the pressed powder for my
purse my only complaint is that it
doesn't come with a little something in
there to apply it so I bought this
little mini kabuki brush to keep in my
purse with it next up is a lip gloss and
I know it's kind of been the trend to do
the whole matte lip liner but I thought
it would get a little give lip gloss to
try mostly because my friend Carrie
recommended it she really likes it in
its the buxom lip gloss and this is in
the color white Russian have it on my
lips right now I really like it gives
you kind of a tingly feeling apparently
it's supposed to plump your lips up a
little bit I don't know next up is a
skincare product or product this is the
clear skin one two three acne solution
system by Olay fresh effects and if you
guys have been watching my videos
recently you know guys know that I've
tried out all three of these what it
comes with is step one and that's the
acne hater deep scrub and that has
silicic acid in there to obviously help
get rid of breakouts it's just a
medicine obviously you guys have heard
of it
step two is the spot singer again with
silicic acid in it definitely helps
reduce it overnight that's when I
specifically like using it I'll wake up
in the morning
and my pimple will be significantly
decreased step 3 and that's the swirls
mattifier and i have not seen a
three-step system with something like
this and I absolutely love it it's by
far my favorite basically it's a swirled
mattifier kind of is self-explanatory
with the title in a sense mattefies your
skin gets rid of redness and reduces
pores I like using it as a primer you
guys know I've been working with Olay
fresh effects and so I'm really excited
that I get to try out all these products
recently because my skin care products
that I'm using right now for my acne uh
are very expensive so I'm liking that
I'm getting the opportunity to try out
something that is drugstore price
because it's much more affordable and I
really like it so far now on to the
clothing part I'm going to show you guys
the least spring thing that I bought and
that is a sweater I'm going to show you
guys it looks alike on us and its
massive it's just this big cowl-neck
turtleneck type of sweater it's like a
sweater dress so it goes down low enough
to where I can wear some like over the
knee boots which i think is so cute why
I bought this for the spring is well
because of the price it was $10 on sale
at H&amp;amp;M and I really like the color it's
like this beige oatmeal type of color
and I just think it's gonna look so
pretty with my over-the-knee boots and I
love wearing sweaters I'm like the
sweater Queen I wear them all the time
because they are so comfortable
and I feel like you can dress them up or
down and you guys know I love that next
up I'm gonna show you guys something
completely opposite from the sweater I
just showed you and show you this it is
just a sheer lace detailing kind of
crocheted on the sleeves
it's from Windsor and I really liked it
it was super super long so it goes down
almost to my ankles for me because I'm
kind of shorter if you guys follow me on
social media you guys know that I'm
going to Coachella this year so this is
definitely something that I'm going to
include in one of my outfits I'm totally
filming my outfits for you guys so you
guys will be able to see it when it's
over in fact when this video is up I
might be at Coachella so fun fact follow
me on instagram if you want to get a
head start on my Instagram are my
outfits shameless plug fringe I should
just say fringe because if you walk into
any store for the spring they just have
fringe everywhere and I absolutely love
this trend I'm a huge fan of Fringe I
think it's awesome friend I have fringe
booties I now have a fringe vest which
I'm going to show you right now
um it's from forever 21 and I really
like it it's like this burnt orange
color but has fringe all over it I think
I'm gonna wear this at Coachella as well
I'm not sure yet but that's the plan I
think but it's just a vest it's kind of
this suede like material super soft and
I just think it looks so awesome I just
love this whole style so I'm really
excited to make outfits out of this
moving on to another fringe piece I
purchased this ad Nasty Gal and it is a
fringe jacket so this is definitely a
little bit more intense than the vest
this has fringe all up and down the
sleeves all on the back this is like
fringe
I mean business fringe can't wait to
style this I think it's gonna look so
good with some like high-waisted shorts
and like a white tee oh my gosh I just
can't wait this is from Nasty Gal as
well but the brand is for love and
lemons one of my favorite brands if you
weren't so expensive I'd buy more of you
but it has an open back right here it's
kind of like a shorter dress but of
course what I love about it it seems to
be the trend that I say a lot is you can
dress it up or down but I don't know it
was definitely a splurge item I like
buying stuff like this though because
you guys know I'm a really casual simple
girl when it comes to my outfits so when
I have like a fun piece in my closet
like this and I get the chance to wear
it I just get so excited so I really
like this a lot next is an accessory
piece and it is this little miniature
backpack and I love it it's from Target
I really like this it's the perfect size
it's not too big it's not too small but
I really like the whole backpack thing
going on instead of carrying like an
actual first it's kind of nice for like
the spring and summer if you're like
super active doing stuff to just like
throw in a backpack as a purse and you
don't have to worry about it you're like
hands-free pretty much right it's
definitely a different shoe haul for you
guys that usually haul like cutesy shoes
but I saw these Nikes and I was like I
need some new tennis shoes because I've
you been using the same pair for so long
and I wanted a pair that weren't
necessarily just for a workout that I
could actually wear and like dress you
know like everyday or like something
just like a casual shoe that you could
wear with like jean shorts or something
like that so I saw these and I thought
these were really really cute I love the
color I love the color of them they're
this gray color it has this um I don't
know kind of fabric material here and
then like a typical sneaker tennis shoe
mesh fabric here overall they're just
super
comfortable they're really lightweight
and they're not like super clunky like
normal tennis shoes I feel then they
weren't that expensive they were like
$75 which I think is a pretty
inexpensive for Nikes usually Nike
tennis shoes are like over 100 um so I
thought that was a pretty good deal but
that's it for my video today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it I feel like it
was kind of short and sweet I don't feel
like I held that much stuff I'll find
out in editing
stay tuned for really awesome things
coming up some exciting life changes and
new channel things and I'm just excited
overall to just blurt it all out to you
guys and tell you and yeah that's it um
but I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
