really fun essentials video I've never
done one of these before but since it's
almost March which means Spring Break
for a lot of people I thought it would
be super fun to do a Spring Break
essentials video whether you're going on
a crazy College Spring Break like I did
last year um
or if you're just gonna have a relaxing
Spring Break with your friends or family
this video is gonna help out all of you
they are just things that I think you
should definitely pack when you're going
on a spring break typical beach vacation
so starting out this one is definitely a
given and that is swimsuits you
basically live in that for a week you're
constantly wearing swimsuits and love
Victoria's Secret swimsuits these are
really nice because they're like a bando
I got this one last year but it's super
nice because if you plan on being
outside the whole time you want
something that's not going to give you
like crazy tan lines beach bunny
swimwear has a lot of great swimsuits I
just got this one um it's like a bright
neon coral and then also I really like
boys and arrows swimsuits I like them
mostly for their bottoms this is one
that I got the bottoms look like this
they're kind of scrunched so they make
your booty look really good which is my
favorite part because you know you want
to look good in a swimsuit and you want
to feel good too so if you find
swimsuits that make you feel really good
buy them and then also Miko swimmer I
think that's what it's called um this is
a super cool top that I got this one
will probably leave you with a funny tan
line but when I think it's super cool is
it like goes high neck and then it
straps down here so yeah some suits are
just like clothes pick the ones that you
feel like you look the best in and that
you love there's so many different
colors and types of swimsuits out there
that you're not going to have a problem
finding one but besides swimsuits you're
obviously going to be wearing some type
of clothing eventually depending on
where you go it tends to cool off at
night so it's always good to just have
something to throw over your swimsuit if
you're still outside it keeps you warm
but it's not too heavy obviously a
hoodie just a zip up hoodie is a
definite must-have like I showed you in
my last video so it's just like this
just pull over sweatshirts are really
really nice they're super comfy or if
you want to get a little bit cuter this
one I purchase from Nasty Gal last year
it's just a coral sweater it's super
super cute the next clothing item that
you must pack for spring break are
cutoff shorts or just some type of jean
shorts honestly I can't even tell you
guys how often I would wear these
because they're so easy and that they're
so quick to just throw on and pair with
anything these I just purchased from
Tsavo skirt they're just kind of like an
acid wash that I'm short any Jean short
is a definite essential to bring for
spring break because I can promise you
you
where them all the time the next is a
shirt and this one I purchased from
Target just recently as you can see it's
cropped so it has this little tight
bando area right here um these are just
super super comfy to throw on over your
swimsuit it's going to be perfect to
just throw on with jean shorts and you
can go into a restaurant or something
like that just something very easy and
casual whether it's something like this
or just kind of a casual crop top or
some sort of denim shirt that you can
just tie around yourself really quick
over your swimsuit definitely have
something like that because you will
need it
the next essential is an all-purpose
dress the one that I have to show you is
this one it's really good to have
something like this because it's
something that you can throw on over
your swimsuit which is perfect but then
you can also pair a jean jacket over it
and make it something that you could go
out at night with this one is from
Windsor it's super cute I just got it
actually the next thing are shoes and
depending on where you go wedges are
definitely a good thing to pack as if
you're going to a nice dinner with your
family or are you going out with friends
wedges are just super comfy and they
definitely dress up an outfit so bring
some wedges otherwise just basic
sneakers are always good to have to just
throw on whether you know it's getting
to your spring break location or just
kind of bumming around the town wherever
you are
sneakers are good I love my converse so
I would definitely bring these but by
far the thing you must bring our sandals
these are just kind of boring old Navy
ones but to be honest I'm so glad I
brought these over any nice sandal that
I had the next thing for sure is a beach
bag if you're going to like a crazy
College Spring Break on the beach you
probably won't need something this big
you'll probably just bring like a clutch
or a fanny pack because spring break
fanny packs are totally cool
but know if you're just going to just
hang out on the beach all day a beach
bag is definitely necessary because you
can put books magazines your iPod in
here and you just like are good to go
plus your towel you definitely want to
bring a towel which is my next essential
I thought I'd show you this one because
beach towels are beach towels but
definitely bring some sort of towel
along with you on spring break
next thing is hats and I would probably
bring my snap backs because I love snap
and I think they're so cute but you have
to be careful because one of my friends
he wore a snapback on the beach and he
had such a gnarly tan line right here
it was awful so be careful with that so
my thing that I would probably wear too
which we did were these hats they're
just kind of what are these like fedora
hats Beach hats you guys have seen these
before they're super super cute the next
thing is if you want to accessorize and
be a super girly girl on the beach and
want to look good going out and
sometimes on the beach I would wear
these type of bracelets they're just
basic beaded bracelets they're really
really cute and I think they definitely
kind of jazz up your swimsuit if you
want to get a little bit fancy with it
the next obvious thing is sunscreen this
probably should have been mentioned
first but sunscreen is a huge essential
you want to protect yourself from those
strong UV rays and you want your skin to
stay healthy so you gotta put sunscreen
on I can't even tell you how much
sunscreen I went through the next thing
is a tumbler just like this I logged
these and we brought them when we went
to Spring Break they're super nice to
put in a refreshing drink inside or
anything you want because you can bring
them on to the beach because it's
plastic the next thing is similar to
sunscreen but it is for your lips
this one is an EOS lip balm but it has
SPF in it which is perfect my lips get
super dry and burnt when I'm out in the
Sun so I definitely have to have some
sort of chapstick so this is a must-have
next is for all you girly ladies that
want to look super cute for all those
boys on the beach um mascara if you want
to just kind of make your eyes pop a
little bit more mascara is always a good
way to go obviously you should make sure
it's waterproof especially if you're
going to be swimming I don't wear makeup
on the beach who really does it's hot
you're gonna be in the water but if you
want to look a little bit nicer
especially in your eyes um
mascara is good to have it the next is
for your hair and it is some sort of sea
salt spray or this which is a
texturizing spray this is really handy
to have because when you've been out
outside all day in the water you're
gonna have crazy wavy beach hair which
is awesome but you want something to
kind of tame it and make it work for the
night time when you go out to dinner or
go out to bars or something like that
next
obviously sunglasses since I just showed
you in my last video I just bought you
sunglasses so I would totally bring
these if I was
going on like a crazy College Spring
Break like you did last year I would
definitely not bring such expensive pair
of sunglasses target has really great
ones that are still super cute and give
you that same style but you wouldn't be
devastated if you accidentally broke
them or you lost them or something like
that and last but definitely not least
if you're just going on a casual spring
break and you're going to be chilling on
the beach bring a book and bring music
so that's it for the video today I
really hope you guys liked it and for
those of you going on spring break I
hope you guys found it helpful please
let me know in the comments below some
things that are your vacation essentials
because I would love to hear from you
and yeah I hope you guys are all having
a wonderful day and I will see you guys
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
