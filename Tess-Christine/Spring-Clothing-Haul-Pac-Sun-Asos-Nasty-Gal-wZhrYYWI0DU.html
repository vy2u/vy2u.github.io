clothing haul I was shopping a while
back and kind of recently and purchased
some things that I thought I'd share
with you guys cuz I know you guys really
like haul videos and I don't do them all
too often so the clothing stores that I
purchased stuff from were from PacSun
Zara ASOS and Nasty Gal
so I'm just gonna get right into the
video and show you guys what I bought
so the first store that I purchased from
was packs on and that's let me show you
guys now I went online when I usually
shop in store for PacSun but I wanted to
check out the new Kendall and Kylie
stuff because their new line had just
come out and the store that I have we
don't get very much of their stuff and
it's always sold out so I decided was
easier to go online and check out stuff
I'm gonna start with Kendall and Kylie
but I bought some other stuff to you but
for the Kendall + Kylie collection the
first thing that I bought was this denim
uh skirt I am really really picky when
it comes to denim skirts because I don't
know they were a thing when I was in
middle school but it was very different
than it is now and I'm not a huge fan
but when I saw this I loved this one I
thought this one was super cute I love
the buttons down the front I would tell
you guys the price but since I ordered
online like Paxson doesn't have the
prices on them which is so weird so the
next thing from the Kendall and Kylie
line that I purchased was this crop top
um I don't know how much this is gonna
show on camera because this is so bright
it didn't look as bright online as it
does like in person it's like a neon
yellow e green color
what I liked especially was the back its
like curved it's just super cute I
really like it a lot
like I said it's really bright but I
think I'm gonna try it okay I almost
forgot to show you guys this because I
just looked at my pile and I was like
that's all from Kendall and Kylie which
is not true because I thought I bought
more than that which I did I thought
this shirt was so cool I loved it I
loved the print on it where it looks
like it's kind of like blurry I don't
know you guys can kind of see it it's
super cool and then the back is really
really fun it's like knotted with this
moon on it I don't know I just thought
it was a really really cool design and
it's totally my style but for the rest
of the stuff at PAX on the first thing I
got was this crop top love this I love
the whole like plaid trend that's going
on right now I've always kind of loved
it but I don't know it's just popping up
more lately because I think a lot of
people really like it some more stores
are coming out with like this print
which I love the next thing from PacSun
I got is kind of boring it's just like a
basic tea like this I don't know I
always wear these especially in the
summer I love the black on the collar
and then it's just white like I said
it's kind of just a boring t-shirt but I
always wear this kind of stuff the next
thing that I purchased from PacSun wear
overalls and I'm super super excited
about this because the last time I wore
overalls was probably when I was really
really little like nineties child for
sure and overalls were the thing but
they've kind of disappeared and come
back now so I'm really excited that
they're kind of like popping up in
stores now because I think you can style
them so cute so I'm really looking
forward to like making outfits with this
and making these look cute and not like
frumpy you know what I'm saying the last
thing from PacSun that I purchased was a
hat and I love snapback hats it's like
my thing especially in the spring in the
summer this one is by Billabong in case
you're wondering but I don't know I just
think they're so cute I just love them
and plus they are perfect if you're
having a terrible hair day and you just
want to get it out of your face
hats are where it's at so that's
everything that I purchased from PacSun
I kind of went a little bit crazy but I
love that store that style is like
totally me I love it so much so I also
went online shopping a few other places
so I'm gonna show you that now the first
one being nasty yell I love nasty yell
so much but I only purchased one thing
and there were shoes and these are new
for me and I'm so excited because I
loved it and when I saw these I was like
oh my gosh I have to have them they're
so cute I just think these are gonna be
so cute for the spring in the summer
with like dresses or shorts I don't know
I think they're gonna be really really
fun to style so if you want to see me
style like some weird things that I just
bought like new trends I guess like the
overalls and like shoes like this
let me know by liking this video or
something or commenting I don't really
know so the next thing that I purchased
is a swimsuit and I went on my favorite
swimsuit side at the moment which is the
girl in the water I think it's called I
saw these and they're just like lime
bottoms I really really liked the color
of these they were super bright I think
they're gonna make my skin look really
nice and tan in the summer but when I
saw this color I was like I don't really
want like a full-on lime swimsuit so I
wanted to kind of change it up a little
bit I was trying to think of what color
would look really good with this and I
thought like this color would I just
thought this was like such a cute combo
it kind of reminds me of like a
watermelon I don't know that's just my
brain thinking weird but like when I saw
these two colors together I'm like
watermelon that's so cute
the next place that I purchased
something from was Zara I love Zara so
much and I don't know they're coming out
with really like tropical things like
prints right now so I'm really loving it
and when I saw this skirt I was pretty
much sold like I had like another color
I'm pretty sure but I really liked the
gray one with all of like these like
Hawaiian flowers on it I just thought it
was so cute I love the cut of the skirt
and it really wasn't that expensive for
Zara either yeah it was only 1990 which
is really really good I think and it's
super comfy it's like a cotton e
material love it the last place that I
purchased from was a sells there is a
couple things I wanted to get the first
one being a white skirt and I had a lot
of trouble finding a white skirt
actually they're kind of selling out
everywhere
so it was really hard to find one but I
found one ASOS that I really liked I
don't know I thought it was super super
cute I love the zipper details and like
the cuts on the bottom the next thing I
purchased which I was meaning to get
last spring because I really liked it
it's another denim skirt which is crazy
but I saw this one on top shop that I
really liked but it sold out like right
away and my size so I was like great
when I saw this one on ASOS I was like
yay it's just a denim skirt it's like
there's a fuzz on it but I don't know
it's really there's not much to say
about it besides that it's like a denim
circle skirt okay so then the last thing
that I purchased from a sauce is I bet
you guys can guess a crop top but I mean
how do you turn down pineapple
I loved it I thought the colors were
really fun and I don't know the
pineapples were really really cool on it
and I just couldn't pass it up so yeah
but that's it for this haul I really
hope you guys enjoyed it let me know in
the comments below what stuff that I
bought was some of your favorites
because I want you guys to comment
because I love hearing from you guys I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
