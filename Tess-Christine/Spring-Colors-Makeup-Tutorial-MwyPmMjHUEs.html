be a makeup tutorial and I haven't done
just a plain makeup tutorial in a while
now I've always kind of incorporated
makeup looks into either my celebrity
inspired or something like that so I've
never really done just a plain makeup
tutorial so I thought it would be really
fun to do one and since its spring and
spring I makeup tutorials are everywhere
on youtube i thought i would add mine
you guys kind of know that my comfort
zone are neutral colors so Browns blacks
beiges light pink colors you guys know
that I love those and I've always only
really shown you guys I makeup tutorials
using those colors so today I decided to
make my own spring I makeup tutorial for
you guys because I thought that would be
really fun and I figured a lot of you
guys would want to see that and kind of
know how to use color and kind of a tone
down way because I'm not the type of
person to go out with like crazy colored
eyeshadow so I thought I would show you
guys my take I'm kind of like a neutral
colored spring tutorial if you guys are
interested in seeing how i did this
spring inspired makeup cereal please
keep on watching let me know what you
think in the comments below because this
is my first kind of using color eye
makeup tutorial so if you guys liked it
please let me know and I'll definitely
think of more I makeup looks using color
to do in the future so please let me
know in the comments below and I will
see you guys next time bye guys to begin
and taking the Maybelline colored
24-hour color tattoo in the color fierce
and tangy and I'm just going to be using
my ring finger to place that directly
onto my lid now it's not a big deal if
you get it in the crease but just mainly
focus it on your lid
next from the bhcosmetics 88 color
shimmer palette I'm just going to be
taking this kind of moggy pinkish purple
color and I'm just going to place that
directly into my crease now you don't
have to be too precise about this either
but make sure you focus it on the outer
areas and mainly in the crease but it's
not a huge deal if you get it onto your
lid where the oranges because you want
to kind of have it look all blend
together anyways next I'm taking this
copper toned brown color now this is
optional I just chose to do this to kind
of mute the pink a little bit because I
thought the pink was a little bit too
bright for me so I'm just going to place
that over the pink color just to kind of
tone down the pink a little bit but
again if you like the pink as bright as
it was you can definitely leave it that
way next I am taking with a fluffy brush
I'm just taking a shimmery kind of beige
more so on the white color side and I'm
just going to be placing that into my
inner tear duct just to kind of brighten
up my eye a little bit with the colors
and kind of blend it into like a
gradient effect and then I'm going to be
taking a beige color and placing that on
my brow bone and kind of blending out
the harsh line that I created with the
pink
next I'm taking this light muted green
color and I'm just going to be taking a
small pencil brush and placing that
directly onto my lower lashline next and
taking a matte black color and with a
pencil brush I'm just going to be
placing this over the green now this is
just going to tone down the green look a
little bit more as well so that's why I
chose to put a little bit of black over
it next with an eye pencil I'm just
going to line my top lash line my
waterline on the bottom and tightline
next with a flat top pencil brush I'm
just going to kind of lightly smudge out
the top eyeliner just to create a more
natural effect next I'm going to curl my
eyelashes and apply mascara the two
mascaras that i'm using are the Orioles
millions of lashes mascara and I'm just
going to apply one coat of that on to my
top lashes and then i'm also using
Revlon's grow luscious mascara and i'm
just going to hold that over my top
lashes and apply that on my bottom
lashes as well
and that is the completed look I really
hope you guys enjoyed this spring
inspired makeup tutorial thank you guys
all so much for watching and I'll see
you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
