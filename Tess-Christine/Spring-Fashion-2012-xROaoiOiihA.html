spring fashion video and I'm super super
excited about this video and I know you
guys are too I love putting together
outfits like this it just takes a lot of
time and I need a lot of space for it so
since it's Easter weekend and I'm home
at my parents house where you guys
normally see most of my fashion videos I
just decided to film one for you guys
I'm sorry it's taken so long but I
finally got it out and I'm really happy
to tell you guys that most of the
clothes in this fashion video are fairly
recent like a week if not a week to like
a month is when I bought most of these
clothes besides like the staple items
like jeans and pants and stuff that is
accessible like anywhere but um most of
the tops and stuff I've gotten really
recently which is super exciting so that
way if you guys like any of it I'll have
all the information obviously in the
video where I got everything so you guys
will be able to go look and see if you
if you want to buy anything that I had I
know this video has been long awaited so
I'm not gonna waste any more time in the
intro but I did want to give a huge
shout out and thank you to all you guys
because if you haven't noticed in my
little video counter this is my 100th
video and I'm super excited that I've
made it a hundred videos and it has been
a year so far of me on YouTube I know a
lot of you guys are asking if I was
gonna do anything special for a 100th
video and I couldn't think of anything
more uh more fun and exciting for you
guys but a fashion video because I know
you guys all really enjoy those and so I
wanted to do that for you so I really
really hope you guys enjoy this spring
fashion video please let me know what
you think in the comments below and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye guys
this first outfit is one of my favorites
because I'm absolutely loving the
high-low skirt trend for the season I
think he gives off the illusion of
looking taller and adds a fun twist to
just a regular skirt this high-low skirt
I purchased at forever 21 and I'm
normally not a huge print person but I
love the Aztec and urban ass feel that
the skirt gives off I chose to pair the
skirt with this light pink collared
shirt from TJ Maxx and I chose to tie it
in the front to make the look a little
bit more casual I also decided to belt
the skirt and this belt is from forever
21 and these lace appeals are also from
forever 21 and despite the heel they are
surprisingly very comfortable this next
outfit is simple but cute I like it
because it's comfy and not too
over-the-top perfect for just a casual
day this loose employee blazer cut shirt
is from the Lauren Conrad collection at
Kohl's to add some color and wear the
zigzag pattern not headband from cotton
on the basic skinny jeans that I'm
wearing I bought at PacSun they're super
lightweight and comfortable which is
perfect for spring weather I added just
a simple studded bracelet from forever
21 to add a little edge and these shoes
are my absolute favorite right now I
bought them at H&amp;amp;M and because of the
wedge they are super comfortable to walk
in and match just about anything
this next outfit is my version of color
blocking I normally wouldn't wear heels
on a everyday basis but if I had
something fun or in fancier to go to I
probably would wear this
since mint is all the trend this season
I had to buy this mint colored blouse
from H&amp;amp;M the color is not too bright but
still adds a fun color to my wardrobe to
match the gold buttons on the shirt I
wore these gold earrings from Target the
white skinny jeans I'm wearing are from
Macy's and the brand is Levi's these
bright magenta colored pumps are my
first colored shoes I own and I bought
them at Target I love them the hair cell
phone if you're not a heel person you
could achieve the same look with colored
flats or fun sandals
since maxi skirts are everywhere this
season I decided to add a look
incorporating one since I'm not on the
taller side I found this one that was
cropped at the end which worked perfect
it is also pleaded which is another huge
trend so in this case it's a twofer
I bought this green with a white floral
patterned skirt at forever 21 to add
some more color I wore this coral color
tank top from American Eagle and to add
some length to the skirt I decided to
pair it with some wedges these are from
Charlotte Russe to accessorize it a
little bit I wore a brown leather wrap
bracelet from Target the skirt did come
with a belt so that is what I'm wearing
with it I would recommend belting your
maxi skirts because it defines your
waist and elongate your body a lot more
this outfit is more of an everyday
outfit for me it is very casual yet
still very girly and cute this light
pink blouse is from forever 21 my
favorite part about it is the tie bow at
the front it is light and airy which is
something I loved during the spring
these light wash destroyed high-waisted
shorts are from forever 21
I love the highways to trend and these
shorts are just perfect for it I also
decided just to wear basic flip-flops
but I think flats would look even better
for this look this next outfit is all
about the colored jeans that seem to be
all the rage for spring I have to admit
I was a little bit skeptical but I tried
it out and I loved it I would say these
jeans are a mix between coral and hot
pink they are insanely bright but I love
them I bought these pants at Target
since the pants are so bright I wore a
white shirt from forever 21 I am
obsessed with the peter pan collar so
this is one of my favorite shirts I
decided to stick with neutral colored
shoes and wear these wedges from H&amp;amp;M
like I said before these are my favorite
and I would highly recommend them
all right now for the last outfit this
outfit is super comfortable and
something I would wear on a day-to-day
basis
the lightweight white sweater I'm
wearing is from H&amp;amp;M and sticking with
the colored pants trend I chose to wear
these maroon colored pants from new look
now that's a store in England but since
colored pants are all the rage you can
find them pretty much anywhere nowadays
the shoes again are the same wedge
booties from H&amp;amp;M and the floral headband
is from River Island this outfit is one
of my favorites because it's not
over-the-top but yet it's still very
cute and stylish this brings me to the
end of the spring fashion video I really
hope you guys all liked it thanks so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
