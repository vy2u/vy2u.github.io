spring haul video if you live where I
live you know that it's nowhere near
spring and it's freezing cold still but
when you go shopping this time of year
all the spring stuff starts coming out
so it's kind of inevitable that you're
gonna buy spring clothes so over the
past month I've been doing some shopping
and I thought I would share with you
guys some things that I bought so the
first place that I went to was Target
and I only bought two things one being
this really comfortable sweatshirt
sweater type thing I absolutely love
this it's so comfy if you guys recognize
this sweater you know that it looks
exactly like the ones from Topshop I
have one let me show you it it looks
like this it's the same pattern and
everything it's just gray this one cost
me like a hefty amount because it was
Topshop and this one hardly at all and
they are literally the exact same thing
maybe this one has a little bit better
material I don't really know they feel
the same so if you're looking for a
jumper sweater sweatshirt type thing
that looks just like this that's way
cheaper go to Target cuz they have I
think two other colors besides this one
so comfy and really inexpensive then the
next thing I bought were these booties
they look like this they're super super
cute I love this color for spring it
matches all my floral prints that I'm
obsessed with plus I love booties
because they are super comfy and you can
wear them with just about anything they
match a lot of things in my wardrobe so
I thought these were really cute so
that's it from Target so now the next
place that I ordered from was Topshop
the first being a sweater and I thought
this color just like screamed spring
because it's just this bright yellow
color this bright color is something
that I need in my wardrobe instead of
all these neutrals I really like this
one because it's kind of a cropped it's
not super cropped but definitely is what
it'll look great with like high-waisted
shorts or even just jeans to like the
sweater is so comfy and cozy and I
absolutely love it the next thing that I
bought from Topshop was a crop top
surprise surprise it looks like this and
I think it's so cute mostly because of
the palm trees on it I love it so much
and it has a really cool neck design and
so like your boobs would sit like right
here and then it would come up like
above your neck
I have inserts of all
stuff on but it's so cute it sips up in
the back I love it wearing it with high
waisted things and skirts and I'm so
excited so the next place is Windsor and
I got a bunch of stuff from here the
first being a tank top and you guys have
known that I always loved buying tank
tops especially in the winter because
you can wear them underneath jackets and
sweaters and cardigans and all that
stuff but this one I thought was super
cute it's black obviously and it has
this really cool lace cutouts like all
throughout the tank top stuff like this
is just like a staple to have in your
wardrobe already but then because it has
like the lace cutouts it's just kind of
something different and a little bit
more fun the next thing I got were
shorts and they look like this they're
super fun and colored and I just love
these so much I'm such a lace girl and
you guys know that about me so the fact
that I has lace on the ends of these
shorts I'm obsessed with seriously I
love you so much plus the colors it's
like a floral pattern which you guys
know pretty much sold me but it's so
colorful and it's just gonna be perfect
for the spring the next is another
sweater it's a lighter sweater which is
perfect this one I saw is just kind of
like a basic cream color but what's
super cool about it is on the back has
this lace cutout like here you guys can
see it here but um yeah it's just
basically the back and then it's
obviously see-through but just at the
bottom how cool is that
the next thing is a kimono and I love
kimono so much but they're really hard
to come by and find very affordable ones
so when I saw this one I loved it it has
a floral pattern duh but it's like black
and white so it's not as noticeable that
it's floral but it just has a really
cool pattern design like when you look
at it but then of course it has the
fringe on the bottom like kimonos mostly
do I love it I think it's so cute and
I'm doing a music festival lookbook so
for like all those music festivals that
have been like around April and in the
spring I'm gonna do a music festival
lookbook because I've never done that
before but I love that style of like the
boho feel I'm super super excited about
it so if you haven't lookout for that so
I forgot to mention one other thing that
I got from Windsor and they are these
booties like I told you guys with my
target booties
they are my favorite thing to wear in
the spring and in the fall but these I
thought they were so cute and they're
black which will match a lot of thing
black and brown but what I liked about
them was the detailing with all of these
like straps on them I thought they were
so cute they're so comfy to when the
heel isn't too big so you can wear these
like all day if you want so the next
place is Urban Outfitters
and I love Urban Outfitters in the
spring so much they have like the best
clothes I feel like in the spring with
florals and just comfy stuff I just love
it so when I saw this I was like yes I
need it it's this romper which I
absolutely love it's floral obviously
the colors are really earthy and fun
it's not very constricting in the shorts
like they're really flowy so it almost
looks like a dress but it's not it's a
romper um it's so cute I just love it so
much the next thing I got was a crop top
and it looks like this it's white but
it's textured so it has like a really
weird feel to it
I love crop tops because these are so
casual and comfy and you can like style
them any way you want but they're not
boring like they add super fun stuff to
it that just makes it a little bit
different which is what I loved about it
and I'm pretty sure they have different
colors in this top as well so if you
liked it check it out so the last thing
for Urban Outfitters were shoes and I
feel like I guess I showed two shoes in
this hall already which is kind of a lot
for me so they look like this they're
booties
super cute what I liked about them was
that they are lace-up in the front and
have buckles on the side I thought they
were really different and fun I think
I'm gonna get a lot of use out of them
because I'm always wearing shoes like
this and they don't have anything like
it already so I think it's gonna be
super great to add to my wardrobe and I
just thought they were just perfect for
spring the last thing that I purchased
was my splurge item and I was so so so
excited to get these because I had been
wanting these for so long they are the
club masters um seriously obsessed with
these so look at how cool they are I'm
just loving them they just have like a
certain style and flare about them that
I just think are so awesome I did go
ahead and buy the foldable ones that
like fold like this the reason why I did
that instead of just like the regular
Club masters was that the lens was a
little bit wider since I have kind of
like a rounder face I wanted a lens that
wasn't gonna make me look like I have
bug eyes if you know what I mean so I
wanted to
the ones with a little larger lens so it
kind of matched my face shape a little
bit more so that's why these were a
little bit more expensive but that's it
for my Strank haul today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it and found some new
things that you guys want to try out for
the spring season if you want to see any
of the clothes that I featured today in
a spring lookbook then just go ahead and
thumbs up this video telling me that you
want to see it but yeah I hope you guys
are all having a wonderful day and I
will see you guys in my next video
