sorry it's been forever since I've
uploaded video seriously time literally
like went past like I had no idea it's
been a month since I've uploaded that
ariana grande video like oh my goodness
I've been putting all of my time and
energy into this Vampire Diaries outfit
video and if you guys follow me on
Facebook Instagram or Twitter you know
that I just uploaded a sneak peek
picture for you guys and I'm so excited
about it and I've been like getting all
the outfits together filming it editing
it and like doing it with all my friends
and like it's been awesome but I totally
forgot to like keep uploading videos so
I'm sorry it's been a little bit but in
the meantime while I'm editing that
video I thought I would upload a haul
for you guys because I did some online
shopping and some in-store shopping all
spring/summer related so I thought I
would show you guys some things that I
got so I'm gonna start with online
shopping just because why not so the
first place that I went online shopping
is new for me I love online shopping and
I'm always looking for new places to
online shop because it's just so easy
which is dangerous but it's so easy to
online shop the new online store that I
found new for me I guess I feel like
it's been around awhile but for me I
just started using it and it's called a
little black bag basically it's really
fun and it's very different from like
normal online shopping basically all you
do is you scroll down on their website
and you pick anything you want and
whatever lit catches your attention you
can add that to your bag and then
stylist will add two other things to
your bag so whatever the price was of
the item that you picked you'll get two
other ones in your bag right away and
what's really cool about it is that if
you like it you can go ahead and just
purchase it or you can trade with other
people online so like some people might
have gotten two items that they don't
want so they'll trade it with other
people and you can just trade items it's
super fun and so I tried it for the
first time last week and my items
finally came and I'm so excited so I'm
going to show you guys what I got so the
first thing that I got when I was like
scrolling down the webpage and picking
out what I wanted I found these wedges
and you guys know that my favorite print
is floral like I absolutely love the
floral print and so when I saw these
wedges I was like yes I want these cuz I
don't have any floral wedges I just have
like tan wedges so these are super fun
like to wear the white dress or some
that's just kind of like plain and
simple and then like have it pop with
these I think is awesome so I definitely
added these to the bag and then I went
in and the stylist added two other items
to my the egg now I can't quite remember
what they were cuz I was a while ago but
I traded both of them because I wasn't
really feeling them so I wanted to trade
it for somebody else so the first thing
I traded for were these earrings that
I'm wearing right now somebody else was
giving him away well wanting to trade
them and I was like these are so me I
want these um they're kind of like their
little feathers dangling off their
silver and then have like a turquoise
bead in the middle I just think they're
super fun and totally my style and
they're not too dangly and I'm not just
either which is perfect and then lastly
I traded one of my items for a nail
polish just because I thought that would
kind of like change it up a little bit
and because it's summer I love wearing
bright nail polish it gives me an excuse
to wear it so I found this like bright
glittery pink nail polish and the name
is so cute it's called hula girl and the
brand is Michael Marcus cosmetics I had
never heard of it before this but it
seems pretty nice so I definitely added
this to my bag - I wanted to trade it
because I thought it was fun and summery
and yeah another thing that's really
great about this is that it shows the
original price so if you're a TJ Max
fashionista like I am you love getting
good deals on like designer clothes or
at least markdowns from like prices so
that whole site does that which is super
awesome you can get up to 70% off retail
price which i think is really really
nice because who doesn't like sales and
mark downs and all that stuff for those
of you who haven't tried little black
bag I definitely would go check it out I
have a link in the description box for a
free trial basically all you have to pay
is 595 for shipping shipping and
handling but anything you want you can
do it all for free so if you want to
just give it a shot and see if you like
it definitely go do that the link is in
the description box below okay so then
the third place that I ordered from was
Billabong and I wanted a long maxi dress
but I'm kind of on the shorter side I
mean I'm 5'4 which is not short compared
to some people but sometimes it's hard
to find maxi dresses that really flatter
me and don't make me look even shorter
sometimes it
it's me which I really liked especially
this one this one is by Billabong and I
really like it it's got kind of the C
throat see-through chiffon material and
it's black but it has this like white
kind of like a geometric print on it I
don't know I thought it was really
pretty what I liked about it is that it
is chiffon and then underneath it has
like a little black short slip so it's
Airy enough to where you could wear it
in the summer but you can also throw a
jean jacket over it or something like
that and it could be perfect for night
now the last two things I went in store
and it was at Urban Outfitters and I
don't know I'm like crazy obsessed with
crop tops like the bustier or bustier
crop top things I love them especially
wearing them with like high skirts or
high-waisted shorts oh it's like my
favorite trend ever and be on the
lookout for a fashion video like that
because I'm gonna make a whole crop top
fashion video I'm so excited about it
but the two that I recently picked up
well this one is from Urban Outfitters
it looks like this it's this coral color
with this lace detailing on it I love it
it has a zipper down the front
it was $39 which is kind of pricey for a
crop top like this but I think it's
really unique the back is super fun too
I don't know I had nothing like it and I
really liked it and it looks so cute
with high-waisted shorts and yeah so
cute now the other crotch app that I got
was from forever 21 and this one I got
in particular to go with a blue skirt
that I've been meaning to find a top
four so I found this one it was fairly
inexpensive it was like $15 which again
seems kind of pricey for such little
material but it's really pretty I like
the buttons down the front and then the
lace are kind of like the eyelet
detailing around the whole thing so
these are perfect for summer they're
nice and airy but you can still kind of
keep them classy and not looking like
trashy looking if you know keep it high
waisted and not show off to up too much
of your midriff or anything like that so
like I said I'm gonna do a whole styling
video on that so be on the lookout for
that so that's it for my haul I know
it's kind of short and sweet not a whole
lot of things that I bought I haven't
really been shopping lately I'm in a
summer class right now so I have that
and then videos that I want to do for
you guys so I haven't been doing a ton
of shopping but I thought I would share
with you some of the things that I
recently bought and
been loving please stay on the lookout
for more videos from me I promise I
didn't go anywhere I just kind of got so
involved in my minute prior Diaries
video I was like oh my gosh I'm so
excited and then I was like looked at my
channel and I was like oh no I haven't
uploaded a video in like a month
ah I miss you guys sorry it's been
forever I love you thank you so much for
watching and I will see you guys later
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
