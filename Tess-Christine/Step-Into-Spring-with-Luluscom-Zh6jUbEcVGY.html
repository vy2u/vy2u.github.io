a fashion video it's kind of like a mini
fashion video because normally in my
fashion videos I do a lot more outfits
but today's fashion video is actually
featuring Lulu's calm and if you've
never heard at this site you should
definitely go check it out because they
have the cutest clothes today's video is
actually going to be featuring three
different items from lulu's calm that
are actually still on the site that you
can go by it's kind of like a sneak peek
into fashion because obviously here
where I live it is nowhere near for me
to be able to wear any of the outfits I
show you because it's still snowing but
it's kind of like a jump into spring
video because I know if you've all been
shopping at all lately a ton of the
spring stuff is coming out so this is
kind of giving you ideas on what to
purchase what's new I know that um very
big bold bright colors are in for the
spring so I tried to incorporate that a
little bit into this fashion video but
again I really hope you guys like it let
me know what you think on any of the
outfits or which one's your favorite in
the comments below and if you have any
questions about anything relating to the
Lulu's calm pieces that I show you
please leave them in the questions below
and I will answer how things fit all
that stuff so if you are interested in
watching this video please keep on
watching and I will see you guys in my
next video bye guys this first outfit is
featuring a bag from lulu's calm since
the bag is a bright rustic orange color
I decided to pair it with something that
had a little bit of color into it so
that's why I picked this skirt the skirt
that i'm wearing is from pacsun and i
thought this skirt would be perfect to
throw in a spring sneak peek video
because i feel like this type of skirt
the style of the skirt at least is
something that's very in for spring it's
kind of cut in the front and goes down
towards the back and I really love this
style and I think it's very flattering
on almost any figure like I said before
the bag itself is a rustic orange color
so it's not a super bright orange it has
kind of a rusty look to it the strap as
you can see has a chain connecting to a
leather strap it's long enough and
adjustable to where you could wear it
over the shoulder or just directly on
your shoulder like I chose to wear for
this outfit
the bag is a fairly large bag it would
fit about a wallet and a cell phone
basic things you need in a purse and the
front opens up in a class the shoes that
I'm wearing are from charlotte russe I
chose to pair it with some wedges just
because I thought it was really
practical for that and the top that i'm
wearing is from target this next outfit
has spring written all over it the
colors are very bright and vibrant and I
absolutely love this dress the color of
the top is TL and the bottom of the
skirt is a peach color it's very very
pretty and I absolutely love it it's
super flattering and it's very
comfortable and the back as you can see
is super unique and super awesome and
that's why I absolutely love this dress
the shoes that I chose to wear with it
are the same wedges as before from
charlotte russe this next outfit is
featuring a top from lulu's calm the top
itself is a collared button up shirt and
it has a tie closure at the bottom of
the shirt it has it's a teal color and
it has orange polka dots all over it I
love this top and I think it looks very
retro and really fun underneath it I
have just worn a black basic tank top
now if you can't have your midriff
showing wherever you go you can always
pull the tank top down and it will
eliminate the problem the genes that I'm
wearing are from dorothy perkins and the
shoes are from pacsun and that completes
this mini spring fashion video I really
hope you enjoyed all the outfits feel
free to leave any comments below and
I'll see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
