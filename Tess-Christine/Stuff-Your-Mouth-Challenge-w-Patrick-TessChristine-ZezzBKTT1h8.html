one ready please don't stop okay hi
what's up guys I'm here with Pat we
can't really get it to her for this
intro so just whatever as you can tell
we're doing the stuff your mouth
challenge and if you don't know how
you're gonna throw so basically if you
haven't seen it what it is is we just
have you know the standard marshmallows
which normally it'd be like a chubby
bunny situation but basically we just
stuff our mouths both of us right away
and we have to describe a character I've
seen like zoella do it and she they
described youtubers but he doesn't
really watch YouTube so he would have no
clue what I'm talking about so we
figured you would do like actors
musicians characters and shows whatever
you want to do and it'll still be the
same effect so I think it'll be fun yeah
