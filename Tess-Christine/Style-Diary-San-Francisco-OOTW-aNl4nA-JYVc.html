today's video is going to be a style
diary I uploaded a travel blog for my
recent trip to San Francisco which you
can watch here or in the description box
below and a lot of you guys were
commenting on my outfit so I figured I
would put it into a video and show you
guys my four outfits that I wore on my
trip go to Denton up for the week but it
wasn't a full week so you guys get the
gist of it
so I really hope you guys like it also I
wanted to let you guys know that I'm
doing a segment on style coleye but with
Amazon fashion so if you guys want to
watch me style some panama hats i show
you guys a couple different ways to wear
them they're really fun perfect for
summer so if you guys want to check that
out I will have the link in the
description box below but otherwise you
can tune in tonight's live which is
awesome um but anyways I hope you guys
enjoy this video and let's get started
starting off with outfit number one this
is the one that I wore the first day to
a lot of tourist attractions it was
really comfortable and super easy to
wear so starting up with the white
bodysuit that is from Zara I love this
thing you can wear it a bunch of
different ways I just wore some basic
jeans from ASOS along with my favorite
tan booties from Urban Outfitters and my
flannel that I tied around my waist is
also from Urban Outfitters and then over
it because it was a little chillier this
day I wore a suede jacket from Express
for outfit number two I posted this one
on Instagram and this is the one I think
I got the most comments about so it's
super easy this one was like my grab and
go because it's super comfortable so
starting off with my tank top that is
from Topshop it's just a bright colored
one I like throwing that on because it's
super easy but then I wore some leggings
which actually wore on the plane tip for
you wear jackets and like leggings and
jeans and stuff on the plane if you want
to save room in your suitcase those are
from beyond yoga and I wore those just
with some Nike sneakers and then over it
I just wore a denim jacket from Topshop
moving on to outfit number three I think
this one was my favorite just because I
just think it was super cute is actually
really easy to wear but I got a lot of
compliments on it so starting off with a
dress that is from revolve clothing the
brand is privacy please I believe it's
just a really pretty striped dress it's
actually was actually perfect for where
we went because we went to Sausalito
which was just super photogenic so
overall I just loved it and over it I
just wore the same Topshop denim jacket
and then I just wore a bucket bag from
Urban Outfitters and then my shoes were
the same ones from Urban Outfitters as
well and then lastly outfit number four
this was the last day and this one is
another super easy one so I started off
by wearing off the shoulder top from
Topshop I love off-the-shoulder tops
lately they're like my favorite thing
and it actually was like super warm this
day so I had jeans on which were from
ASOS but I switched to shorts from ASOS
as well and then just wore some lace-up
sandals from a Topshop
but on my video for today I really hope
you guys enjoyed it if you do and want

this video a thumbs up I'll see you guys
