what's up everyone today's video is
going to be a style diary for my recent
trip to Turks and Caicos which by the
way shot out to all of you for such the
amazing feedback on my travel vlog I am
really excited because it was Patrick
and i's new year's resolution just
travel more this year and so I'm really
happy you like that type of video
because I definitely want to do more but
of course while I was there I filmed an
outfit video that I figured some of you
guys would want to see I don't know if
you have an upcoming vacation or just
some outfit inspiration in general
thought you guys might like this so I'll
show you guys five outfits that are
perfect for vacation summer spring
weather that's coming up yay
so I really hope you guys enjoy this and
let's get started let's just watch it
okay so starting off with day number one
this outfit is actually like a typical
vacation outfit for me because it's
super easy to pack and super easy just
to throw on because you don't want to
spend all your time picking out your
outfits so starting off with my sandals
those are from Steve Madden I like them
because they're comfortable but there
are neutral colors so they match a lot
of different things so I don't have to
pack as much for my shorts those are
from American Apparel super comfy and
then for my top it's like an
off-the-shoulder top and that is from
revolve clothing and that's it
okay so moving on to day number two I
worn this outfit in the evening if you
guys watch my travel blog you know that
there was like a bonfire barbecue and
this outfit was perfect for it kind of
like a chillier night so these pans are
perfect so starting off with the pants
but those are from amuse Society super
comfortable jogger style so just like
sweatpants but cute
and then for shoes I just wore some
sandals from ASOS and then my floral
wrap top is from revolt clothing moving
on to a day number 3 this is a typical
outfit I would wear if we were like
exploring in town or I don't know if you
guys go on vacation and you kind of like
do family fun activities this is what I
would wear because dresses are super
easy to just throw on so the dress that
I'm wearing is a super human I was happy
that I found it it's from forever 21 so
it's super affordable it looks like a
more expensive one that I wanted but I
was so glad I found this and then I just
wore some sandal heels from Steve Madden
I would probably opt for flat shoes if I
was going about all day but otherwise I
would pair it with this I was like
styling it
now on to day four this outfit is
perfect for a day in the Sun or if you
want to dress a little bit cuter for
dinner or something like that
it's super light and airy so you're not
going to get super hot in it but what I
love about it and it involves a
statement piece and those are the shorts
I don't go too adventurous with my
shorts too often it's usually just denim
so when I found these they're from
lovers and friends and I thought they
were super cute perfect for like a
vacation with like the fringe on them
and then I wore it with a top which is
from forever 21 along with my hat and
then my sandals are the same ones from
Steve Madden
and lastly day number five this outfit
involves of romper and I'm actually
surprised this is the only Bramber I
packed this truck because robbers are by
far the easiest to pack and we're on
vacation so the one I'm wearing I really
love it has a bright red color which is
so cool and that's from Tularosa and I
just wore that with my Steve Madden
heels that I already showed you guys but
that is it for my video today I really
hope you guys liked it if you want more

outfit was your favorite and I will see
you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
