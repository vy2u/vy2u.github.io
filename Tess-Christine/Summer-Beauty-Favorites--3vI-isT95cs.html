today's video is going to be a summer
favorites video I have a few things that
I want to show you guys that I've been
really loving right now for the summer
season and I think you guys would all
really enjoy them too first I'm going to
start off with face products because I
only have two and these are products
that I've been using for a little bit
now especially this one I'll start with
this one it's a clean and clear morning
burst skin brightening facial scrub it's
obviously yellow it's I use this in the
morning I absolutely love the stuff i've
been using it for so long now I've
repurchased this probably four or five
times and I really like this in the
summer because it smells really fresh
and really fruity and it feels really
good in the morning when you're just
waking up and want to wash your face
this totally helps with like waking up
your face like I know that sounds super
stupid like when you see the commercials
and stuff you like think oh really but
it really does i really like it feels
super fresh on your face and it's a
really really good product so I've loved
this for a while now but especially
right now in the summer i'm really
liking this the next base product that
i've been using um pretty recently like
throughout the summer because I've been
trying out a new kind of like at-home
facial kind of thing that I'm going to
make a video on really soon it is a
facial clay mask with avocado and
oatmeal and the brand is free men and it
looks like this and I got this at Ulta I
really really like this stuff it smells
really good and if you can actually feel
it working on your face which I actually
really enjoy some people steer away from
that because they think it's like not
relaxing but I find this to be actually
really relaxing on my face and it really
feels like it's doing something to your
face and it's not just sitting on there
and just kind of thinking it's doing
something like I can really feel this
doing something so i really like the
stuff a lot and i've been using this
like I said along with my facial routine
that hopefully I'll have a video up
really soon for you guys because it's
really fun to do with your friends the
next product is kind of sticking along
with like face and body I guess you can
say and that is the beach sexy tan
enhanced shimmer lotion with tint after
sun from Victoria's Secret and I get
questions on my skin tone a lot of you a
lot of you guys are asking if I fake tan
and I do not tan in a tanning bed at all
I don't use that kind of stuff I'm
naturally kind of like tanner in my skin
tone I mean obviously now with summer in
the Sun always being out and stuff I
definitely get a tan from the Sun
and so that's why I really like using
this because every time I go outside or
make an effort to go outside and um
there's a place where we can go floating
where I live so if i do that then
afterwards i will obviously i use
sunscreen but then afterwards i will use
this and this is not something you use
while you tan it's not something to make
you chant it's just like an after sun it
just enhances the tan that you've
received from the Sun the smell of it
isn't bad either um I wouldn't the smell
is kind of iffy like I don't think it's
bad but I definitely don't really enjoy
how I smell like it's not a bad smell
but it's just a different smell if that
makes sense I don't mind it to where i
would use it so i really like using this
in the summer a lot the next product is
for hair and typically in the summer I
like to keep my hair away from heat
because it is in the Sun a lot and I
don't it's kind of like the season where
I don't like to do a lot with it
obviously with filming different
tutorials for you guys I definitely have
to keep using heat on it for when I film
but other than that in the summer I like
to either put my hair up or I like to
keep it down natural somewhat natural my
hair doesn't cooperate with me as well
as I would like to just like straight up
natural so I really like this product
and this i've been using in the summer
and i really really like it so far it's
one of those products that i don't use
every day because i don't think it's the
best for your hair every day and it is
the hair KMS California hair place sea
salt spray and it looks like this and i
bought this at Alta as well I really
really like it because it gives you like
a tell tousled textured look to your
hair and it makes it very beachy and
very wavy and just very very natural and
my hair is kind of like that already but
this definitely enhances it I should
have my roommate Alex try this out
because she has very thin straight hair
and so I can always do i'm gonna get a
blog soon so i can all do a blog post on
this once i tried on her hair too
because my hair like i said is naturally
curly and so i really like this stuff a
lot because it just enhances that it
makes it look better but i haven't tried
it out on straight straighter hair i
guess you could say so i'll have her try
this out and definitely let you guys
know if it works on her hair but for my
hair if you have my hair type kind of
curly wavy textured hair after you
shower um i would
we recommend this I've been really
loving this right now I think it's a
good product it doesn't smell like salty
or anything like you think it would it
smells pretty good the next our makeup
products and the first makeup product
that I'm really liking right now and
it's mini but it is the poor
professional pro balm to minimize the
appearance of pores by benefit and I got
this in like a gift with purchase kind
of thing at Ulta and it's really tiny
but it's less to me for probably a
little over a month now because you only
need a little bit of it but I really
really love this stuff because I have
kind of larger pores especially right
here and I really love using this it
kind of smoothes down my face a little
bit more and it makes it way easier for
me to apply makeup or anything else and
it feels really light on your skin and
I've just been really liking this right
now um I'm gonna go out and buy the
bigger portion once I run out of this
the next thing our lip products and I
really really have been liking these
lately they're called the Revlon just
bitten kissable balm stain they're super
smooth I've tried out a different lip
stain by i think it was by revlon i'm
not sure and it was very hard to get on
my lips like it kept drying out my lips
and just felt like it was just kind of
like sticking like I don't know I just
didn't really like it but these go on
super smooth they basically look like
giant crayons I actually kind of like
this color more than this color this
color is it's called honey but it's very
similar to like my natural um lip color
I would prefer this one over this one
just because this one is a little bit
more intense this one is called lovesick
it's a little bit of a darker pink which
I think this one complements my skin
tone way more than this one so i would
definitely if you have my skin tone oh
definitely recommend the darker pink
ones because don't be afraid of the
packaging because it looks a lot darker
on the packaging than it actually is on
your lips so keep that in mind too but i
really like it because they glide on
super smooth and then they literally
stay on all day so you don't have to
worry about them coming off or anything
because it is a stain so it'll keep on
all day and yeah they're just really
really good products so if you haven't
tried these out yet I definitely would
recommend them because they're super
good the next product is a blush that
I've been really loving for the summer
just because I think it complements my
skin tone especially when I'm getting
kind of a little bit more tan on the
face it's a coral
it's called coralista by benefit it's
just a really really pretty um peachy
corley color and I just think it
complements my skin tone really well I
really love it i've been using it every
day in this hour pretty much i would
definitely try out this coralista blush
because i honestly think that this would
look good on almost any skin tone so if
you are looking for like a perfect blush
I would definitely try this because
seriously I've I've been in love with it
lately the last things are nail products
and they're basically just like my
favorite nail color of the summer I'm
wearing one of them on my nails now and
it's just basically like a bright pink
or like fuchsia pink color is my
favorite color to wear in the summer I
just love it I think it looks so good
especially when I'm can I keep saying
that but like in the summer that's what
happens my skin I get Tanner so I like
to wear bright pink or like fuchsia
nails I just think they're really really
fun and so the two colors i'm really
liking right now are the butter london
one which is in the color snog i really
like this but this is a little bit
overpriced i have about two or three
butter london nail polishes i really
like them I like how they apply on your
nails and they stay on really really
long time and they don't chip or
anything so I definitely think they're
like worth money but I don't think
they're like as worth is how much they
pay for so I don't know if I'm gonna buy
any more of these because I am really
happy with like se colors that's
probably my favorite type of nail polish
but this is a really really cool color
until I can find like a dupe for it i
really like this one again this one's
called snog it's just this like really
pretty bright fuchsia pink color and
then the other one I'm really liking
that I have on my nails actually right
now is called Jolene yeah Jolene and
it's one of the soya colors and I really
like this one a lot on this is my first
time trying out his way color and I
really like them so far they tend to be
not very opaque when you apply them so I
had you have to apply like two or three
coats which is not like the best thing
in the world but I do really like the
outcome of the colors afterwards that's
what all the things that I'm loving
right now for the summer I really hope
it helps you guys find a few new
products that you want to try out for
the summer I'm going to be starting a
blog very soon it's in the works so I
will definitely do more like i'll write
more about these products and give you a
little bit more detail about them that
way you can go you guys can get a better
idea for it so Stan
look out for that I really hope you guys
like this video again and yeah hope you
all are having a wonderful day and I
will see you guys next time bye everyone
oh I'm gonna sneeze no okay alright
alright so hot yeah this is happening
right now Oh Oh everything is falling
