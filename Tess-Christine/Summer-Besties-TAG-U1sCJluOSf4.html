to be doing the summer besties tag and
speaking of summer it is a hundred
degrees today and I'm not exaggerating
it is legit 100 degrees so I'm going to
do this video really really fast so I
can get inside and I would film inside
but my whole family's inside being loud
so I couldn't film inside but um yeah
it's like 100 degrees here so I'm like
sweating it's so hot so I guess it's a
perfect time to do a summers summer
besties tag so the first thing is my
favorite summer lip product and that
would definitely first off have to be
some sort of chapstick or lip balm
because on my lips at least get really
chapped and really dry especially if I
get sunburned god forbid but if I get
sub moon then chapstick is my go-to i
love the EOS lip balm that's my favorite
but if I'm looking for you know a subtle
color in the summer without having to
apply lipstick my favorite thing would
definitely have to be the elf
conditioning left lip balm in the color
peacefully pink I absolutely love this
lip balm I have it on right now it gives
my lips a nice subtle color without
being too over-the-top now on to blush
in the summer I don't like to wear a lot
of ton of look I can't talk in the
summer I don't like to wear a lot of
pink blush because I do tend to get a
little you know subtle color on my
cheeks and my cheeks tend to be the one
that burns a lot so um so I definitely
put sunscreen on my face but if I were
to get red anywhere in my face it would
be my cheek so I don't like to overdo it
with a bunch of pink blush so my
favorite blushes in the summer are some
sort of bronzy blushes and so the one I
absolutely love is by mac and it is the
light its color light / dark and it
gives you a bronzy glow on your face
without being too over-the-top but
another one I'm living right now is an
elf blush and the color is peachy keen
and this isn't it has some pink in it
but not crazy amount like a normal pink
blush would have and this doesn't really
count as a blush but I'm going to throw
it in there anyways it's um big by
victoria secret it's called bronze raise
it's like a highlighting stick all I do
in after I apply my foundation and
powder is I apply this just kind of on
my cheeks on my nose and a little bit on
my forehead and I kind of just rub it in
and it gives you that awesome summer
glow that you want so I definitely would
recommend
as well however be careful with this
because you don't want to go too crazy
on the shimmer and your whole face will
be like sparkling my favorite nail
polish in this summer would have to be
some sort of pink color I don't know why
I just really like pink in the summer or
some sort of bright pastel color and the
to paint colors i'm loving right now are
ones by a sea and it's van to go i just
got this recently and i painted out my
nails to test it out and i absolutely
love it it's a light pink color it's
very very pretty love it and then this
other one called chapel of love by OPI
have it on my nails right now and it's a
really bright pretty pink color
absolutely love this color so I love
painting my nails bright colors in the
summer and also if I don't want to paint
my nails a color but I want to have some
sort of a clean look on my hands I paint
it sweetheart by OPI it's just a very
light light pink color now on to liquid
face product um yeah liquid face product
my my definite favorite would have to be
a tinted moisturizer the 1 i'm loving is
by gemma kid and it's a the Jemma Kidd
moisture tint pro finish um has SPF 20
in it it's really good for the summer
and I'm in the color medium and I love
this because in the morning I can just
put it on like kind of like a
moisturizer and I'm good to go and it
won't be cakey foundation sweating off
my face so that's really nice now on to
powder face product I don't like to wear
a colored powder face product so i love
the translucent powders in the summer
especially because again like I don't
want to have caked on makeup face in the
summer to have to sweat that all off
it's just not comfortable so I love
using a translucent powder and the one I
love is the laura mercier translucent
powder this one is a bit pricey but the
other one i have used is by NYC it's a
translucent powder I really like that
one as well so either of those would
work my favorite is just a trance
translucent powder alright I'm looking
down at the list if that's what your
eyes are wondering but for hair product
something I love to use is the macadamia
leave in Conditioning cream in the
summer especially if you're going to the
pool or where I live a river your hair
can dry out very very easily and I love
to keep it conditioned by using a
leave-in conditioner some sort of
conditioning treat
it because the Sun can dry your hair out
and that sort of thing so definite
favorite hair product must have in the
summer is some sort of conditioning
treatment for your hair next thing would
have to be an eye product product and my
favorite thing is a mascara and I love
using mascara in the summer because
especially if you're you know going to
the beach or the pool or something like
that and a definite waterproof mascara I
don't have one yet then they need to get
one because I want to do a summer look
for you guys and I don't have one yet
but my recommendation be a waterproof
mascara but this one's just the
voluminous millions lashes mascara and I
love using a mascara because if you
don't want to you know put all makeup on
your eyes you can just throw mascara on
and it'll brighten up your eyes for the
summer and then that's all you really
need the next thing is a self tanner or
some sort of tanning product and I've
never been a huge fan of tanning
products I guess like I don't know I've
always been kind of scared to do one I'm
trying to pick out a few because I'm
gonna do kind of an experiment thing and
then tell you which one I liked the best
or which one worked for me the best but
what I love right now is it's from the
victoria secret it's the beach sexy tan
enhancer lotion with tint and I love
this because it is not a self-tanner
it's kind of a it's at an enhancer so
what you do is it's like SS after Sun so
once you've been out in the Sun all day
you put this on just like a lotion or
anything like that and it is a very dark
thing like you would think it was a
tanner just kind of enhances your tan a
lot more and gives your legs and nice
shimmer and it says it has moisture rich
shea butter and antioxidant vitamin E
and so the self-tanner the other self
tanner that is actually that of the
self-tanner of the same brand sorry does
not have that so I loved that about it
that is actually is kind of a lotion on
it helps blur the look of imperfection
and it is instant shimmer and bronze
tint so it will give you that nice glow
you want after you've been out in the
Sun all day now on for fashion accessory
I'm something I love to do is play at my
hair a lot in the summer and my definite
favorite would have to be flowers I love
these little flowers I got these at
target their orange they're really
bright and pretty they look super pretty
in your hair and then bigger ones you
know
I love using flowers in my hair for the
summer gives you a pop of color and it's
super easy just to throw in your hair
make any you know day after hair cute so
if you wake up in the morning and throw
your hair in a ponytail but then add big
giant flower to it it'll just make it
look so much more done up and like looks
like you actually tried to get ready
next thing is clothing piece and my
go-to clothing piece in the summer would
have to be jean shorts it is something I
throw on every day I'm wearing them now
I absolutely love them it's the
something that I go to all the time my
favorite shorts are American Eagle
shorts for those of you watched my
videos you know that i love American
Eagle shorts they fit just right for me
and they have tons of different styles
and I absolutely love them and concludes
my summer besties tag I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and stay tuned because
I'm going to do a whole summer face
makeup all that sort of stuff look for

one may be next I don't know it'll be
