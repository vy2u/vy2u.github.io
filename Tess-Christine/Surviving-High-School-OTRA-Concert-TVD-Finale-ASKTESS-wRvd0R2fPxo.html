video is going to be a Q&amp;amp;A video and I'm
super excited about this because I
haven't done a Q&amp;amp;A since I was living in
Minnesota so it's been a little bit and
I asked you guys on Twitter if you
wanted a new one and all of you guys
said yes so I'm really happy to do this
for you guys also some of the questions
that were asked I asked you guys a while
ago on Twitter it wasn't like today and
I saved the ones that were most commonly
asked and then I finally got around to
filming it now so some of them one in
particular to do with One Direction is a
little outdated now but you'll
understand when I get there you know how
these things work so I'm just this hour
answering questions now first question
is what is your favorite thing about New
York so far and this one is pretty easy
I think I love everything about it
honestly um New York is just awesome
it's just so different from the town I
was living in in Minnesota
wasn't even living in the biggest city
in Minnesota I was living in a small
town and I'm from a small town in
Wisconsin so coming to New York and like
moving here is just amazing I think the
people everyone's so different for
filming it's awesome because there's so
many different places I can go if I want
a beach I have a beach if I want to go
to like an urban style area I can do
that if I want like super heavy city
vibes I go into the city because I live
in Brooklyn so I don't know I just love
it I have like a piece of hair oh that's
gonna bother me in editing no probably
the hardest thing about moving to New
York was the fact that we didn't know
really anyone here we knew like two
people shout out Carrie and Julia and
that's it so we kind of left like all of
our friends from back home which really
sucked so it was a lot of Patrick and
Tess time which we loved but like we
also love our friends too so that was a
really huge road bump we had to get over
but overall we love it next question is
from Anthony and he's actually a
youtuber I know him he does men's
fashion and he's super nice you guys
should check him out but anyways he asks
if you were forced to wear one designer
for the rest of your life who would it
be and I'm taking this as like high-end
designer I hope that's what you meant
for shoes purses
and jacket purposes I'm gonna have to
say Saint Laurent because they're
amazing and it's like probably one of my
favorites season finale of The Vampire
Diaries Season six reaction that was so
bad not in like baddest finale but like
for my heart because I love that show
more than a lot of things and the fact
that nina dobrev is not on the show
anymore you guys know she's like my
ultimate celebrity girl crush I love her
and I was sobbing I was actually crying
through 90% of them soda I was just
crying and it was just really awful and
that's probably my only reaction is just
tears out of the Seven Dwarves which one
are you okay I might have to look this
up but I think there's one there's happy
right happy of course I was I would like
to think I would be the happy one but
then there's I think there's bashful I
think if I was like assigned a dwarf to
be it would be the bashful one because I
am kind of shy at first so probably say
that which Starbucks drink is your
favorite during the summer in winter I
have like one only that I really drink
and it's just a soy latte it's pretty
simple it's nothing like crazy but I
drink iced in the summer and it hot in
the winter at what age did you start
getting into fashion this is actually a
funny question because I feel like a lot
of you guys aren't gonna believe it or
maybe well but I started getting into
fashion like three years ago
like not even in college because I
remember my freshman year of college
my wardrobe consisted of v-neck t-shirts
and converse and jeans and that was it
I'm not even kidding you I had nothing
else I dressed that was just my simple
wardrobe and that's all I did and then
it was wasn't until honestly like
Instagram and YouTube stuff getting into
fashion and seeing other things that I
was like I got more into it and then I
just started to develop you know I guess
my own fashion I don't know
how did you and Kerry meet each other
this is funny because we get this
question all the time and we have yet to
really answer it a lot of you guys
probably won't believe this but she's
was actually subscriber really early on
in my youtube days she messaged me on
YouTube and was like three flows
probably like three years ago maybe less
than that I don't know and she messaged
me asking advice for her blog and I
didn't really blog so I was like I love
it I think it's awesome I'm giving my
opinion and I think you're doing great
and blah blah blah so anyways we follow
each other on social media sites and I
saw her tweet one day that she lived or
like was going to a Chicago One
Direction concert and I was like oh my
gosh she live in Chicago I lived or I'm
from Wisconsin I live in Minnesota and
we were like no way and so then one day
we just decided to meet in Chicago I
took the train from Milwaukee Wisconsin
and we basically hung out all day and it
instantly became best friends and that's
how we met so favorite cereal if I had
to pick up junk food one it would be
peanut butter Captain Crunch how long
have you and Patrick been together by
the way you two our relationship goals
thank you um we've been together for
just about three years it'll be three
years in November what is one food you
can't live without uh whoo that's hard I
would probably say I mean I don't hope
it's not like a basic thing to say but
I'd be fruit I feel like I don't notice
how much I like and eat fruit but I feel
like if it was gone I would be really
sad favorite pair of shoes my summer
shoes it would probably be oh the shame
it show ones that I bought for her
videos that gets a look video there like
the doctor Scholl's sandals I wore those
honestly every day in the summer and
it's still kind of the summer in New
York it's so hot but um love those but
otherwise it would be any pair of
booties they're always my favorite okay
so this is the question I was talking
about at the beginning the video that's
gonna be outdated now but it says how
are you feeling about you're on the road
again concert okay so when I asked it or
when I asked you guys for questions it
was right before I was leaving for my
one direction
with Kerry and AH it was awesome but I'm
gonna leave it up to I've logged the
whole experience so I will have that
linked here or in the downbar if you
guys want to watch the whole thing
because it was awesome advice for senior
year of high school okay this one is
pretty simple and that is from my
experience don't worry about the drama
that happens senior year because as soon
as you guys graduate it's like it never
happened and you just go on to your
lives and it just yeah just don't stress
just don't stress about all the like
stupid drama that happens in high school
especially your senior year because it's
irrelevant at the end of the year anyway
where do you see yourself in ten years
ten years I will be 34 personally I hope
to have I hope to be married and have
kids that's ultimately what I want
especially at 34 and dream for my job
would be to be like the off as awesome
as the Shaytards and sekolah Jolie's and
be vlogging with my children and via
YouTube family that'd be kind of cool or
work on some sort of set what are your
top 5 at TV shows at the moment ok this
doesn't make sense because all of them
are not going on right now I'm pretty
sure my top 5 I can just think of it
right away because in my favorite these
are no in particular order by the way if
they're just all equal so Vampire
Diaries
Pretty Little Liars Dexter American
Horror Story and Modern Family was your
dream job as a child and what is it now
if it couldn't be YouTube okay so as a
child it was Disney Channel Disney
Channel was gold
oh my gosh and now I just want to keep
doing YouTube next one I got this one so
much and it's when are you going to do
an apartment tour and really soon I'm
really shooting for fall if I can get an
apartment tour up during the fall time
that will be awesome if you could meet
any other celebrity other than Nina of
course who would it be
I just love how you guys know me how
obsessed I am with her
it would probably be Johnny Depp only
because he's just I really admire him
and I think he's really cool I'd be
really intimidated at first meeting him
but I would want to talk to him hang out
with him be best friends and have him
help me with all my Halloween videos on
YouTube ever think of starting a
clothing line I love your style
um yes everybody does um but more
specifically I'm really into look for
less stuff I really like that and I
think it would be cool to do you know
how I'm like always searching for like
perfect pieces for a look for less
outfit it'd be like my own line and I
really wouldn't have to look I'd be like
yeah my line is like the less but you
know what advice would you give your fam
with low self-esteem I love you I love
you too um definitely I think my biggest
piece of advice would be I don't want to
say it gets better because that's like
very cliche and I know that's like said
a lot but um well for one it's because
it's true but second off is I think it's
just really comforting to know that
everybody is going through the same
things you might think that somebody is
most perfect person but they have their
own self-esteem issues they have their
own problems in life that I think it's
very comforting to know that people are
going through similar things and that
nobody's perfect and if you just kind of
find comfort and knowing that one it
gets better and you just over time just
become more and more comfortable with
yourself but that - everybody's
struggling with it you're not alone and
yeah you'll figure it out I'm still
figuring it out like it takes time but
um yeah just know that everybody's in
your same boat and we're all in it
together hey who's the next get to look
video you're doing that comes out this
weekend I'm pretty sure I'm finishing it
filming it tonight actually um and
Selena Gomez have like eight or nine
outfits for her I'm so excited to show
you guys but those are the questions I
decided to answer in this video I really
hope you guys liked it thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
