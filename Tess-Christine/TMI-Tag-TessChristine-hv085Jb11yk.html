the TMI tag I got so many requests from
you guys to do this video and I watched
so many online and I just absolutely
loved it I think there's so much fun to
watch I don't think I was tagged by
anybody but that's okay because I'm
still gonna do it anyways I thought it
was really fun so why not I'm not
wearing anything special I have this
necklace on that is just like a little
like rhinestone thing in the middle of a
gold chain
that's from bauble bar you guys seen
that before wearing this white like
quilted top from Topshop and then I'm
wearing shorts they look like this
they're really boring but I don't know I
just wear that because it's comfy yes I
have no I've never had a terrible
breakup um breakups kind of always suck
but I've never really had one that was
like super bad and super crazy I am 5'4
and a half
and yes the half does count ah this is
getting personal
mm TMI for sure I think the last time I
weighed myself was I can't even remember
but I think I'm between like 110 and 115
I think like around there nope no
tattoos do I want some yes do I know
when or what absolutely not so I
probably will never get one but I kind
of do want one eventually yes I have my
ears pierced just one hole just regular
ear piercing I think I got that when I
was like seven and then I had my belly
button pierced a couple years ago and
then I took it out after like a year I
was just kind of like over it Rose and
Jack from the Titanic Noah and Allie
from the notebook and Stefan and Elena
sorry all you've Delana fans
I'm always team Stefan you guys know
this it's like Pretty Little Liars
Vampire Diaries I don't really watch
that many television shows
I love like supernatural I love I'm
starting to watch house of cards on
Netflix I like that but my favorite show
probably would be like Vampire Diaries
for sure I just recently got into the
dirty heads and I've been listening to
them a lot and so they're a really sweet
band and I like them I would say the
biggest thing as I miss my brother
because he's in the Navy and I never
ever ever get to see him I miss my
family and I miss um
like some friends that I don't see very
much anymore that all have moved away
and gotten big girl jobs that's so hard
I don't even know what to say for this
um but I think one that I think I've
played the most on my iPhone's is um
Vienna by Billy Joel love that song 22
years old turning 23 in June believe it
or not I'm a cancer definitely kindness
honesty and silliness I love to be silly
it's like my favorite thing honesty
that's obvious
and then kindness it's always great to
be around kind people and especially in
a partner you want them to be kind and
generous and I don't know just overall
good person I love the quote everything
happens for a reason it's super cliche a
lot of people say that but I just really
do like it I think it's a very positive
quote to live by Leonardo DiCaprio hands
down love him or Johnny Depp I like him
too
my favorite color is purple I really
like soft music certain times and I like
loud music other times it just depends
on kind of what mood I'm in my room I
think is where I've always gone after
since I can remember like when I've been
upset about something I always go to my
room and then yeah and that's it if I'm
washing my hair and all that jazz it'll
take me probably 15 to 20 minutes if I'm
just kind of washing my body probably
like three
I would probably have to say like an
hour especially if I'm getting out of
the shower if I'm not starting from
scratch and getting out of the shower I
would say it probably takes me like half
an hour nope and I hope to never be
because I would be the worst fighter
ever someone who is really happy and
goofy and likes to make jokes you can
just tell just as like a happy
personality and they're just fun to be
around because they always I don't know
do funny things and are always just
making you smile or making you laugh
love that people who are really really
full of themselves and you can just tell
and they think they're better than
everyone else
but this was because I had just always
thought about it and my roommate kind of
encouraged me when I was like watching
girls on YouTube and I was like I feel
like I can do this and then my roommates
like do it and so then I upload a video
and plus I was always really really shy
so it was really kind of fun to do this
and like be able to talk to you guys and
kind of have like another life almost I
don't know it was just really cool I
hate snakes hate them and my boyfriend's
roommate actually had a snake and I held
it and I don't know what the heck I was
thinking and I actually it's on my
Instagram I post a photo I mean holding
this huge Python oh my gosh I don't know
how I did that but I am actually really
really really really terrified of them I
don't even remember I can't I don't know
I don't know this morning my youtube
name is my name
Tess Christine Christine is my middle
name and Tess Christine and a while ago
it was 1 2 3 I don't know why I had the
1 2 3 at the end I did and yeah but now
it's just has foreseen

what all the buzz was about I hadn't
read it yet and I really wanted to so
that's what I'm currently reading and
I'm almost done with it um Fifty Shades
of Grey before that it was a text book
because before that I was in school

so bad I was at my boyfriend's house
earlier but if we're talking about
locations I was a couple weeks ago I was
in LA filming more of make me over

crushes like Harry Styles or Leonardo or
Johnny Depp yeah this morning probably
like five minutes ago
I'm the computer somewhere on a youtube
comment who knows something I'm insulted
like every day Kent sucks
chocolate YUM back when I was a youngin
I used to play piano which was fun I
also used to play flute when I was in
band in like middle school fun times I
would really like to learn how to play
like the ukulele or like guitar or
something fun like that but I don't
really wear jewelry all that often like
I really don't I if you guys watched my
fashion videos you know that I like
hardly ever accessorized like I do with
like little things um but I guess my
favorite type of jewelry cuz I can I
cheat and I do that would be rings I
love rings yes I'm saying dance as a
sport so I was in dance the last one I
did was dance um like freshman year of
college so like three and a half years
ago or it was probably something from
frozen now that I think about it um yeah
slight obsession there's only a few that
I can think of off the top of my head
that make me giggle there none that like
as I have ever been used on me like I
would be like okay funny I don't have my
library card but is it okay if I check
