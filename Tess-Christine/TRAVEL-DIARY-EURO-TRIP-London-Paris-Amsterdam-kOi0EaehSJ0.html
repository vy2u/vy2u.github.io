trip travel diary I tell you it many
year old trips because we definitely
didn't go to every place in Europe we
went to Paris Amsterdam and London and
we were only there for a few days in
each so our first stop was Paris and
like all of the places we're going to I
haven't been back as a tourist
since studying abroad in college in like
2012 I think it was so needless to say I
was freaking excited to go back or plane
was super delayed so we landed a lot
later than we thought basically this
means when you land you have to make
sure you stay awake jetlag is a killer
so we just kind of walked around we got
to did a few touristy things we walked
around we took photos anything just just
kind of like stay awake we try to just
really entertain each other and like
just make sure that none of us got tired
we went in and out of cafes like crazy
to drink coffee so the next day the
first thing we had to do was go to the
Eiffel Tower Alex wanted to go to this
like upper area that's like you guys can
see obviously in the clips but it's like
a flat surface and has like a square
tile design on it but you get such great
views of the Eiffel Tower and the
pictures turned out amazing there so
after the Eiffel Tower we went to the
Arc de Triomphe I hope I said that right
but this was really fun again
photo op like crazy syphilis it's cool
so that's going to cast out our first
full day and then our second day we
decided that we wanted to go back to my
cycle power on the other side because
actually I pleaded out a few places
where I would be really cool to meet
some of you and I was so able to which I
was so happy in the meantime I got a
Nutella crepe which is exactly what I
wanted to get because that's what I got
last time it was snowing like crazy but
it made the Eiffel Tower look really
pretty and again we took some cool
photos and then after that we left and
we went to Notre Dom which I was really
excited because I hadn't didn't go with
my study group and we didn't go last
time so I was really excited to see it
so we did decide to go in it I didn't
film anything just because I wanted to
be respectful and they didn't want to
film a bunch of clips inside the actual
church but we did go inside and explore
that it was really cool I definitely
recommend it and that pretty much
wrapped up our Paris experience I know I
did it in a nutshell with all the clips
but to be honest with that travel day in
there it didn't feel like we were there
is very long so I think if I were to do
it again I would stay a little bit
longer in Paris just to explore it a
little bit more but we were really
excited because the next up with
Amsterdam
so you're exciting if we wanted to go
the traditional route and just get a
flight but then Dan came up with a
really good idea to rent a car and drive
they aren't emotional second
which of it thought they were
but we did wake up because we made a
stop in Belgium which I was really
excited about it never been we had a
really quick stop there like maybe an
hour but we wanted to try the waffles
it's like sweeter yeah I think it's
really good the sugars yeah like right
on the top there yeah it's really good
no waffle in Belgium so after that we
got back in the car and we finally made
it to Amsterdam we were so excited where
we stayed in Amsterdam again we had a
thought we would do something different
and we would do the air B&amp;amp;B instead of a
hotel and the air B&amp;amp;B is different in
the sense that it's a boat with a
boathouse
it was so friggin cool I will have the
exact boathouse linked below for you
guys in case you want to stay there
because I highly recommend it was the
coolest place ever it was decorated so
great the woman who owns it was such a
great host she had all these fresh
pastries and croissants and like stopped
fridges and like it was just such a
great day the place itself was so cool
and so charming and it's very different
from where we stayed before and also she
was telling us when we checked in that
one of a great thing you can do is throw
any scraps of food that you have outside
of the window because the Ducks eat it
and that was something that she told us
that she does all the time and that her
neighbors do so that we should do so we
had a lot of fun doing that they were so
cute so anthurium itself one of my
favorite things about it is it just
feels very laid-back you don't have a
pressure to do a bunch of super touristy
things you can kind of just walk around
rent a bike do whatever you want and it
just feels so homey there the whole time
I don't know maybe it's just me but it's
one of my favorite things about
Amsterdam so the first day that's kind
of what we just did we just kind of
walked around Rome up and down the
streets just kind of took it all and
looked at the buildings I mean simple
things that you would think are like so
cool here or where you live is actually
so cool to people that don't see all the
time so we just kind of walked around
and saw that one of our favorite things
to do was go into vintage shops and like
you know me in fashion like I love
fashion and the vintage shops there were
so amazing I mention it in my haul but I
was able to score a jacket from one of
them from 20 euros
where that back at the next day but I
was obsessed with it another thing
Amsterdam was the place where I got to
meet the most of you I was really
excited I mean I swear every single day
I was running into multiples of you and
you guys are the coolest people like I
can't even we had so much fun
so after we have to hang out a bunch of
you guys for a bit we decided to go grab
a drink into in a hotel that I had been
familiar with I've seen photos on
Instagram and stuff like that just
looked pretty and we wanted to check it
out I think it's called the Pulitzer
Hotel I hope I said that right it's
really good this guy we got to know he
actually lived in New York for a while
so it was kind of cool getting to talk
to him and he made amazing drinks if you
are of age you drink alcohol I would
definitely recommend the cocktails there
are no good then the next day the first
thing we had to do was find pancake
house for breakfast so we found this a
really great place that had pasta cheese
I think it's what it's called so I got
mine with Nutella and bananas and then
the pancakes you'd get sweet or savory
up so good and then after that we
decided to go to the Rijksmuseum what we
all had it kind of picked exhibits we
wanted to see because museums like that
are always so big and you can spend days
hours and years in there and like not
see it all and then after that kind of
protic we wanted to do a canal to earth
like on a boat but we didn't know like
where to go for that so we kind of just
walked out of the Rijksmuseum and went
by the water and there is literally a
sign that said canal sewers and realized
that so we bought to get to the canal
tourists great to hop on and hop off you
can buy tickets accordingly and we got a
result and we just kind of were on the
boat listening to the guide and he kind
of explains there in things which is
really fun it was also a good way to
kind of rest their lives because we've
walked everywhere in Amsterdam we didn't
take one car so it was awesome to just
kind of hang out and just take a break
but also like learn a bit while you're
doing so so then the last thing I wanted
to feature is this the amazing
restaurants and cafes that we went to in
Amsterdam one in particular was so
frigging cute and it was so good we got
breakfast there and it was so good I
don't know it's just such the fun we all
sat at like a big picnic table and we
just chatted and it was just like one of
the best trips I think that that's the
trip the part of the trip where we all
got a lot closer as friends because we
just had a lot of time to walk and talk
and it was just it was just so fun
so now London yay our first day in
London we wanted to hit up some of the
super touristy spots I wanted to impress
me
memory but also because I when you
travel with a school group versus on
your own it's just so different we have
all been there before it's all best
travelling in the group but I wanted to
get some cool clips for you guys and
take some photos and do that whole thing
so we decided to a Big Bend first and
that was really fun we went on the
bridge and got some epic photos kind of
a protip see the bridge and then you
across the bridge from Big Bend you get
great photos and then also Pat and I
decided to do the phone booth kind of
stereotypical but it was really fun and
then of course we went to Buckingham
Palace which was always pretty it's
always pretty I mean how can you resist
oh is very touristy but always very
pretty so we had to check that out I was
able to meet one of you guys there to
her is her family that was awesome and
then after that we went to Tower Bridge
we kind of wanted to check that out
which was again pretty that's like it
was pretty there I thought England is
one of my favorite places I just think
everything is built so amazing and I
don't know I just want to take photos
everything talked about we kind of just
walked up and down by the water there
was some sort of like a Book Fair going
on or like a vintage book thing which is
really cool taht had a lot of fun with
that and then another really cool thing
that we staff was there is a poet you
can pay whatever you want and he'll give
you a poem and so Pat never had to do
that that's like totally a passing yeah
I was really adamant about going to a
Tower of London
I love castles and love that part of
history so it's kind of like one of the
things I really wanted to do again so we
bought tickets for that and we explored
it it's definitely something that I feel
like is not for everyone if you're into
castles and into kind of that type of
history then you will love it so then I
can't leaving that we were right by
power bridge again so we decided to
check that out take a few photos walk
across the bridge ended up finding this
really cute cafe which was actually much
farther from where we were and it was
really cool we got an acai bowl which
came in a coconut that was really good
we got carrot cake we got I don't even
know what else we got tea for sure and
then after that we just we went to the
end part of Portobello Road we kind of
were at the very end of the day like
them wrapping up so we kind of just
walked up and down pat really wanted to
find a hat who you're in and out of a
lot of hat shops but that area is really
pretty the houses there are so gorgeous
they have multicolored houses and it's
just a really pretty area and we had a
lot of fun just kind of walking up and
down and just going into little like
shops and things like that the next
morning we woke up and we had a flight
so we already had to leave you they went
by so quickly but we decided to go to
the Kensington Palace and garden which
was so cool we came across all these
birds and it was actually really pretty
out really frightened but it was so cool
they got us so close and people were
feeding them but after that our entire
trip was over it went by as quick as I
feel like this video did because it was
just so fun and I wish I could go back
and do it all over again
I hope you guys enjoyed it and then the
last and I really love doing this kind
of stuff for you so let me know by
giving me a thumbs up if you like my
travel Diaries and travel vlogs I always
try to do them differently every time so
I really hope you guys enjoyed this and
I will see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
