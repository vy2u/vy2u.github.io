you
Oh
you
Oh
what's up guys I hope you enjoyed our
Cuba travel diary I wanted to sit down
at the end of this video and kind of
break down the video for you just to
kind of share some tips tricks and by
everything that we did for Cuba in case
you guys are interested in going there
which I really think you should have
everything written on my phone so I
don't forget anything
but it's going to be quick because we
were only there for three days we really
only stayed in old sauna so the stuff
that I'm going to mention is just there
there's so many other things to do
though so really look into that for the
length of your stay so setting up prep
before you go to Cuba get cash you need
cash when you're there you have to take
out as much cash as you need for the
length of your stay because they do not
accept credit cards that is huge and
then as far as the certification and the
visa goes you don't have to order those
pre ahead of time unless you want to
save a bit of money otherwise you can
get those the day of your flight at the
airport which is what we did the next
thing which is the most important is
download this app and no I'm not
sponsored by this app but this app with
a life saver
I'll have the link to the apps below I'm
pretty sure it's just called Cuba and
it's just offline app so once you're
there you do not have internet you do
not have service you do not have
anything like that so making sure you
can figure out where to go you could you
could totally print out a map if you
want to but what Super T's need is to
have it on your phone it has kind of a
live feed of where you are also which is
super awesome and you can start all the
restaurants start all the monuments tile
start everything and it kind of saves it
all in there for you it also has key
words and phrases to kind of translate
into Spanish for you if that's not your
saying which we needed and for where we
stayed now we are thinking about going
those the usual route and just booking
the hotel but we decided that we wanted
to go people-to-people as far as our
certification and stay in a very local
apartment so we weren't with an Airbnb
they also have rooms for rent in Cuba
that you can just rent out rooms as you
go
it wasn't anything crazy fancy it was so
very nice but it was in a very run-down
building like Cuba is it's a very very
fascinating city I absolutely loved it
and I love that we chose the apartment
over a hotel because the hotels are
lovely and amazing and we went to a lot
of them for drink but as far as staying
and really like experiencing the Cuban
culture it was nice to be in the
department setting where there were
other local people around now as far as
what to see and what to do like I said
we only stayed in Old Havana for the
most part so we kind of just walked
around the area that was like our
favorite thing to do is kind of just
roamed and just like observed and kind
of like I don't know just walked around
which is amazing but we did go to a lot
of places that were very picturesque and
very touristy so I'll have all those
links below everything that you saw in
this video where we filmed everything
will all be listed it's all very easy
and very easy to find they're popular
tourist spots as far as bars and places
to get drinks and stuff like that there
are so many we kind of found ourselves
just walking into different places and
popping in popping out having a drink
there's so many different cafes and bars
and restaurants all over the place Plaza
vieja has a bunch of restaurants just
kind of circling it but there are some
in specific that Hemingway frequented
and are very very popular very touristy
and a little overpriced
but nothing crazy we definitely went to
those a lot of what you saw in the video
as far as cafes go for places to get
coffee or lunch or just like a small
bite something like that that has two
really awesome spots that you saw both
in this video my favorite drink to order
with the cafe bonbon and it's the best
coffee drink I don't even know what's in
it but it's amazing and I got that at
every cafe and it was so good for dinner
like I said there are so many places to
just pop in there's cafes everywhere and
restaurants you can just kind of mosey
and a lot of the times works out there
is out handing you menus and letting you
look and kind of see like what the menu
has to offer it however we did manage to
find a really good restaurant that we
went out of our way for and I will have
that in the description box below it had
a an amazing rooftop bar because we
didn't make reservations so we couldn't
get into the actual restaurant but if
you go up onto the rooftop there's a bar
and like a small menu that we got food
optimum it was by far our favorite meal
is delicious as far as the cards though
that you see that you saw pretty much in
the entire video
a lot of times those are taxis which is
awesome which means you can ride in them
as you saw they are more expensive than
the regular taxis so beware about that
we only took it probably twice because
we had two bunches our money and yeah we
didn't want to spend too much on taxis
but they are so fun to ride in the
classic cars are amazing but for the
most part everything is walkable where
our apartment was in Havana Vieja and
then which is the part of Old Havana if
I'm not mistaken you can kind of just
like walk we go all over the place and
it's super easy super walkable we didn't
have to walk treasure smiles or anything
it was very easy and it was plus that's
the best part about it is just kind of
walking and being in it and of course
the people the locals they are
incredibly nice I we have nothing but
good things to say about them we even
came home with a few email contacts of
locals that we met and were so awesome
and wanted to keep in touch
they were so generous and so nice and
they were really helpful especially for
our lack of Spanish knowledge as far as
speaking of home language they were so
accommodating so overall we had an
amazing time I hope the little tidbit
for helpful like I said on the list most
of this in the description box below
yeah I really hope you liked this video
thank you so much for watching and let
me know in the comments below where we
should go next I will see you guys in my
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
