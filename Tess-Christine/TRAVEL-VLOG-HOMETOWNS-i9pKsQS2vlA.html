vlog and this one as you guys can
probably already tell is a little bit
different but Patrick and I decided that
we wanted to take you to our hometowns
so we thought it'd be really fun to show
you guys something different and kind of
where we grew up because we've been kind
of taking you all over the world to
these amazing places but we wanted to
show you kind of where we're from which
is Minnesota and Wisconsin and it cuts
to kind of show you that you can have
your own adventure in your backyard and
you don't have to go somewhere crazy so
since we are gone for two weeks I
thought I would show you guys what I
packed because I had to consolidate
everything into a carry-on suitcase so I
packed some dinner shorts just some
basic tees and tank stuff that I can
wear around because as you will see we
are on the lake the river wherever so
we're always outside but then I did go
ahead and bring it to dresses and some
blouse tops in case I had to do anything
nice and then for my makeup when I pack
that I don't go crazy or anything I just
bring a few things I bring one eyeshadow
palette a bronzer concealer highlighter
blush and some eye products and of
course just like one lip product that I
really like and then of course I need to
have makeup brushes so I'm bringing my
Revlon ones and I love them I usually
only bring like the contour brush the
powder brush and then like a couple eyes
shadow brushes just because I feel like
you don't need all of them when you're
traveling but to have those kind of like
basic staple ones are a necessity for me
so after that I put it all in my
suitcase I sipped it up and we're off so
first stop is my hometown and that is
Wisconsin
you're a pro professional hi guys all
right we are in Minnesota now which is
my hometown
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
