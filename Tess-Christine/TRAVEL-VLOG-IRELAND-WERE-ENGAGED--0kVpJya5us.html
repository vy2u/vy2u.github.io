Fadi I met a little girl you start to
talk on a fan safty a can I ask you
friend what's a fella to do cuz the hair
was black and eyes were blue and you
write them I've been taking the world
from the salty wrong with the car we go
we are in Ireland
we are just leaving our place now got a
pastry for breakfast we're staying a
little bit outside of Dublin so the
first day here we are going to drive
into Dublin and explore there's a Pat hi
babe hi are you excited to be in Ireland
who's not excited to be in Ireland it's
beautiful here we're really excited we
all Alex Dan myself and Pat have never
been to Ireland ever we're all
experiencing it for the first time
together
alright so we just got to the guiness
factory tour right factory I think if
that's what it is it's freaking cool
already and we're gonna drink in US and
it's going to be a great day
your face
damn
[Laughter]
hey so we just finished eating and now
we're gonna go find people if I you only
get my teeth I think you're so tall and
I'm even rain boobies we're gonna go
look at some vintage shops right yeah
we're gonna do put it back we're doing
vintage things that
I knew we were coming we are headed up
north today to Northern Ireland I'm
gonna do some Game of Thrones
sightseeing right yeah hey I like oh we
all got like no sleep last night except
for Dan right yeah it was bad we all
kind of like felt the jet lag and the
gates opening so we got to run
[Laughter]
we finally made it two and a half right
babe two and a half hours later we made
it to the dark hedges and we're so
freakin excited it already looks so cool
so we kind of like googled some Game of
Thrones spots to go check out because
we're huge Game of Thrones fans and a
lot of its filmed in Northern Ireland so
we had to check it out
okay so protip we got here at like 10:00
and perfect timing because look at this
stampede of a tour are you kidding me so
if you want to come to the dark edges
get here early so you can get photos
without a bunch of people in it because
holy crap we had to run to get an
awesome o shot
okay so we came to this restaurant and
they told us to go and they have a whole
game of Thrones you guys see we would
have crossed but maybe it's a good thing
we don't want falling off
yay we did a little outfit change
because you know how to be a little
warmer we're at Giant's Causeway now and
it's really cool another long walk
that's a good thing I'm wearing booties
it is more beautiful than I could have
ever imagined
yeah I mean luck
we have this whole castle pretty much to
ourselves there's like nobody here
you think I'm a oh so nervous
yeah it's gonna be great so much fun
it's from the movie yes I love you
we are currently exploring this castle
we kind of found it randomly but it's
actually really cool because we can go
throughout it we were just saying it's
always so hard when you go to these
things because all the no-entry do not
touch cannot go past this point locked
doors you just want to open them cuz a
castle and it's freaking cool like this
stairway like don't you want to go up it
I want to go up it is really windy you
probably can't hear this it's really
cold and I forgot my gloves Alex
test is pretty bundle

place is so so cute let me show you guys
already but quickly we're gonna go eat
some lunch it's for starving

fell in love we just went to o'connell
bar which is where the Galway girl music
video was so we had to go because it was
you know for in Galway right
