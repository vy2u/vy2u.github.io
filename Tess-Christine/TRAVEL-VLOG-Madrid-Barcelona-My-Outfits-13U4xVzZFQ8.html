so excited I have never been here before
we are with Patrick Dan Katherine and
Alex
we flew an overnight from Toronto and we
just got here this morning we had a few
almost hiccups we basically flew from
Montreal to Toronto and our flight was
slightly delayed so we were really
nervous we're gonna miss our second
flight we got on it and then our bags
didn't show up for like what would you
guys say 45 minutes after they were like
last bag off the plane so we were like
oh crap we literally lost our bags but
we got it it ended up showing up and now
we're in our really beautiful Airbnb
but basically it's really early in the
morning they've to fight jet lag so
we're gonna go get food and coffee
look who it is wait Karina what is this
place okay federal so now we are walking
to the Royal Palace basically we're just
kind of walking around and like
sightseeing down there been except Alex
we came to this beautiful park I will
have the name here so I don't picture
the name but it's gorgeous
they're so funky they remind me of like
dr. Seuss trees
all right we stopped it uh I don't even
know what that's called oh my god not
you do it we got things real and we're
gonna do some tapas yeah
guys I love Spain so much
again
it's potato right
basically just decided to hang out in
the pots now we're getting sangria
we are at the same park we were at
yesterday only because it's a huge park
and it's a really nice day
nature 100 no good effort
lunch time we are at this place called
Ted content I came here last year and
the food is incredible it was pretty big
variety on the menu and a lot of things
are amazing my bread I'm so excited yeah
it's really cute look over it
okay we're trying but it's not so they
didn't make sure it's a very thin very
thin
Dan's mouth is completely stained
probably sweating so good though pray oh
my god
oh wow
[Laughter]
good morning guys we are on the train to
Barcelona it's very quiet so that's all
I'm going to say but I'll blahs when we
get there
all of our luggage so we just checked
into our Irene be so pretty look at the
tiles I'm gonna give you a little tour
this is a sliding door hidden a bathroom
so cute
I love how its decorated and then we got
our bedroom Patsy honey
hi and then we got these two hey guys
but it's so cute in here we're just
gonna kind of like freshen up because we
all kind of like try to sleep on the
train and we're gonna go out exploring
we're super hungry so first stop it's
definitely gonna be lunch but since we
only had like one full day in Barcelona
like this is like a half day tomorrow
we're gonna do a lot of the touristy
stuff like Sagrada família and all that
fun stuff that if you guys have been to
Barcelona you know all the stuff that we
have to do
brem cave which is where we're eating so
hopefully it's okay - I got a latte and
I built my own salad there's a tree in
the Attic them together we can make a
pork
oh my god
first tourists stop of the day is Casa
venti oh I hope I'm hoping I'm saying
that right definitely recommend we're on
the roof right now
but the house the decor if you want to
call it that the way it's built is
insane I've never seen anything like it
the gothic order
oh sure the gargoyles nothing right
there
they're like sticking out yeah it's cool
and we're basically doing the main
website
protip we decided to come to this light
park area across from it because it
makes for really good photos so if you
want to take a photo in front of the
church and get like the full Church in
it this is a good spot to come Wow it is
so pretty we just got in well to the
front earlier it is what do you think
it's gorgeous I've never seen a building
like this in my life yeah there's so
much detail you just want to keep
staring at it
yeah are coming up into the towers and
we're crossing over we're super high up
what I gather is if you guys decide to
do the towers it's you go up in an
elevator and then you basically just
spiral down if you look out the windows
it's really cool
don't do it if you're afraid of heights
I think it's a love spiral staircases so
this is like a dream realistic travel
scenario here a lot of it is under
construction which we didn't know but
there is still some of the tiles we go
back maybe a little less than half that
are open so thank goodness otherwise we
don't bought tickets to see nothing but
yeah no I'm excited to see it because
I'm living my oh my Cheetah Girl moments
if you get it you get it
I definitely recommend this spot it's a
really really pretty the tiles on all
the scenes are unreal
so apparently his fountain light show is
very popular but there are so many
people that we found this patch of grass
hi guys I am back home in New York it is
hot and humid so if I excuse my sweaty
appearance it is so hot here I feel like
it's hotter here than I wasn't Spain but
I really hope you guys enjoyed my video
we did it in a crunch time we were only
in Spain for about four full days with
Madrid and Barcelona so I hope this
helps you guys out if you guys are
looking to go to Spain or need some
ideas on how to make the most of your
trip we really did some really cool
things and even with taking the time to
film and go to all these touristy spots
we didn't feel rushed it was very very
fun so I really hope it gave you guys
some ideas if you are planning to go
there or just some fashion inspiration
for the summer because I definitely
wanted to include that but thank you
guys for watching be sure to give this a
big thumbs up especially for Pat he
killed it with the filming it's been a
while since we've done a travel like
artsy vlog like this we got some new
camera gear and he was really excited to
play around with it and I think he does
such an amazing job so yeah I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
