both super excited to be here we have
never been here before so we're freakin
pumped I'm working with FIFA to bring
you guys an epic travel diary so stay
tuned we're going to a bunch of our
places in Thailand how excited are you
over the moon okay
so it's super goal about this place is
basically it's the one of hookers on
land food market at least that's what we
sold a lot of them are in floating
markets but those only happen on
weekends if you're during the week we
got what you check out one of these
really cool it's very local which we
love so it's kind of cool to seeing
everybody buy food these kind of like
what we were told is their version of
fast food you can kind of come and get
whatever you want and then leave so I
know I tried is happy which it's
probably good this is happy but I think
it's making so Kendell so
really good is like caramel
when we got the pineapple they gave us
this little packet that has sugar and
old salts and chili chili you're
supposed to just define Apple into it
ask them to try it out
okay like the salt in the sugar kind of
like cancel each other out but it gives
it like a very interesting texture but
you do get like a little tingle from
black on the chilli I like it you're in
this really cool space if I ask me just
called and I wasn't mistaken I thought
it was a dance studio but it's actually
an art space so a lot of awesome things
are made here and we're actually meeting
someone is going to come and dance which
is really cool and I are going to try
dancing
okay so currently super exciting we are
in a dress shop and I am designing or
like tailoring my own traditional Thai
dress
like it so this is the style of dress I
thought the neckline is really cool and
then this is the color and so then
obviously on this dress we have three
different colors of thread so these are
the colors I picked out
we are in Phuket yesterday we packed up
our stuff from Bangkok and we went on a
quick plane ride it was only like an
hour from Bangkok and we got to Phuket
which is way more beachy we're way more
Island v so we're really excited to be
here I have to show you guys the view
from our hotel because it's unreal this
is my favorite roof obviously so what's
on the agenda today basically we are
having a ceviche we were just going to
kind of walk around the resort that
we're in and spend the day in the beach
Pat might try surfing so it's gonna be a
really fun day and I can't wait to thank
you along
ah
okay so currently yeah we are on a
snorkeling tour and we just got done
eating lunch and there's a really cool I
want to say cabana but it's basically
water table and it was delicious you
look like a babe with that captain's hat
on
we left lunch and we took about we got
to hong island and this place is insane
we're basically here just relaxing on
the beach and snorkeling so it's really
fun and the view is incredible
ah
in case you're wondering if it's humid
in Thailand not really not at all

through this a website called traveling
spoon basically what it is is you meet
up with the local and you go to a market
