channel today's video is going to be a
vacation checklist guide packing guide
I'm not really sure what I ended up
calling it but basically I wanted to
make this because if you've been
following my channel for a while now you
know that we love to travel and travel
dogs are great and all but I really
wanted to since we were only in st.
Lucia for about three days I wanted to
film more of like a guide video so I
know a lot of people tend to go on more
tropical vacations this time of year so
I thought it would be really helpful to
show you guys what I pack what I like
the pack basically basically just give
you guys a checklist to make your life
easier
and then of course some brand
recommendations on stuff that I bring so
I really hope you guys enjoy it and
let's get started so of course when
you're going on a tropical vacation
shoes this is always at the top of my
list because I feel like you wear these
the most when you are on vacation
because it's literally you're in it all
day for the most part but I have a few
of different ranges in here I love
swimsuits so I'm just gonna go ahead and
talk about this first one which is from
solid and striped my favorite thing to
do is buy high-waisted bikinis
because I just think that they look so
good they're so flattering and I just
feel the most comfortable in them the
only thing is this is my first time
actually purchasing this brand and
wearing the swimsuits so the sizes that
I normally get bottoms thick great I
bought them in a size small I believe
and the top runs it's he bit see um I
don't have I'm not very large chested
but this size is normally what I would
buy in a some suit and these little
bitty so if you have a larger chest I
would consider that when looking at this
brand I know they make a bunch of
different styles so maybe give it a
check check it out but that's the one
thing I would do differently with this
next up on the more affordable side is
from forever 21 and I always find that
forever 21 has such hit or misses when
it comes to swimsuits I'm like getting
all tangled up as I speak about it it's
striped it kind of Criss crosses up here
has a lot of ties like a lot of ties but
I think it's really cute and then the
next one is from Skyy and staghorn love
this brand I think I have one other
swimsuit it's a one-piece but I love
this one I definitely think the cut of
this top is my favorite I think oh I got
the bottoms a little bit differently I
either gone for a super high waisted or
more of a string so since I was only
gone for three days I only brought the
three swimsuits but another favorite of
mine are one pieces I think they're
great especially for tropical vacations
if you're going on excursions because
one pieces are really secure and you can
just wear them with denim shorts next
checklist category are basic essentials
and what I mean by this is just stuff
that's really easy it's kind of stuff
that I just throw into my suitcase
that's gonna be really easy to just
throw on and even over a swimsuit so
first up we have denim shorts pretty
self-explanatory I usually bring about
two pairs since we're only gone for a
short amount of time I only brought one
girlfriend denim is amazing also Levi's
are great Beach shirts I feel like these
are great to bring along on a trip
sometimes I'll even grab some of Pat's
like more chill dress shirts I think
they're great to just throw over a throw
over swimsuits tie it around your waist
next on my list are simple dresses or
like two-piece sets I find these to be
really easy especially if you these
could even be great for dinner depending
on how fancy it is even just walking
around the day let's say you're going
like on an excursion where you're like
exploring the coal village or stuff like
that where we're like going to a market
if you watched my travel vlogs you see
that I kind of bring this stuff along
everywhere that I go
just cuz it's really easy to throw on
and it's simple next up our dinner
addresses or fancier
says I find myself grabbing for these
during the nighttime or let's say you're
going out or you're going to a dinner
these are great next on the list are
sunglasses and I feel like I was a
little extra by bringing home bringing
all the sunglasses that I did you
definitely don't need that many that was
just me being like extra with my outfit
these ones are just like the best these
are the ones I grabbed the most they're
really easy to wear I'd very match
pretty much everything next category are
shoes usually I bring some sort of
tennis shoe or like a sporty or shoe
like vans converse something like that
because these are great for excursions
when you go out around islands and stuff
like that you want something that's a
little bit more sturdy now for more of
like the sandal or like dressier type of
shoe I only have two this one is flat
and these are from Windsor they're just
brown they're great they go with
everything they're wedges and they're
really cute and they go with all my
dresses and you can even dress them with
jeans this I got so many questions on my
Instagram about this is from Lulu's
these kind of woven bags are I'm not
even kidding you everywhere and they're
a huge trend for the spring and summer
they're so great to bring on a tropical
vacation even for the summer like if
you're not going anywhere and you're
just watching this video you know love
you but this is just great just in
general because it's perfect for this
time of year Jewelry is actually really
fun for me to bring besides accessory
accessorizing all the outfits that I
showed you and dresses I think it's
really great with swimwear I love buying
necklaces from like Maria Pascal ASOS 5
and 2 they just have a really dainty
gold jewelry that I think looks great
with all that kind of stuff and lastly
besides like
the essentials like toothbrush camera
hairbrush like all that kind of stuff
I'm going to just mention some beauty
products that are great to bring along
number one on the list is obviously
sunscreen I like to bring this because a
lot of the times if the resort doesn't
have it or like places that you're
staying it's just good to have a backup
because buying it there can be really
expensive and then the next thing which
is kind of opposite of what I just said
but it's the loving tan a bronze shimmer
if anything I'll use this link with my
outfit at night or something just to
give myself a little bit of a glow for
makeup number one is a highlighter I
love this especially like a cream
highlighter I think looks really good
because it makes your skin look super
dewy even though you're bronzing in the
Sun good to have bronzer just makes
everything look good underneath all of
that I have the first a beauty triple
protection skin tint this has SPF 30 in
it which is really great but it also has
a color so this is like one of my go-to
things right now especially but
especially when I'm traveling because
it's so easy and then for eyeshadow I
bring one palette that I think looks
great especially with the Sun and being
in the tropics is the naked feet palette
love this I'm pretty sure I put it in
one of my favorites
or maybe I get ready with me and then
lastly for hair hair can be kind of
tough because in a lot of places there's
humidity and if you have hair like me it
just is a frizz ball but you do what you
can so I usually bring either like a
curling iron just to help it out at
night but what I really rely on is some
sort of a wave spray or like a sea salt
spray this one is the geese ooh wild Mia
wave me rape me texturizing my spray and
that is it for my packing essentials
when it comes to clothing accessories
beauty items besides like toothbrush
brought hairbrush and my passport and
all that stuff which you guys get but I
really hope it helps you guys out
especially if you're going on a trip or
if you're not the summertime is so
coming up soon so all of this stuff can
be applied there as well so thank you
again for watching and I will see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
