today's video is going to be a fashion
haul you know how these things work
I'm gonna try it on like I always do for
you I was kind of do these at the
beginning of new seasons because I feel
like that's when you shop because you're
excited about the new stuff coming out
at least that's how I feel so I got a
bunch of stuff that I kinda already
cheated in war but then a lot of stuff
that I haven't yet but I'm really
excited of style so yeah let's get
started so the first thing I got were
jackets and I know it's kind of weird to
be buying that this time of year but if
you go into any store pretty much right
now a lot of stuff is on sale it's
specially jacket so that brings me to
the first thing I got and it's from Zara
and it's this a bomber jacket and I'm
really excited about it because I love
the embroidery I just think it looks so
cool it looks a lot nicer than it
actually not that it actually is but it
just looks like it'd be really expensive
I actually saw this in the winter or
fall time for like a hundred bucks or
something like that and I was like eh
because it's pretty lightweight so I was
like I don't know if I'm going to wear
it that much and anyways I went back and
they had it on sale for I think like
twenty five dollars so I was really
excited lightweight stuff like this is
always good to just kind of throw on
over t-shirts or tank tops and it's kind
of perfect for the spring so school work
next up is a leather jacket and this one
I'm really excited about it's by the
brand Blanc NYC and what I love about it
is the embroidery and the studs I just
think it looks so cool
like I said it's by the brand bling NYC
but I know you can buy it off of a lot
of retailers so I know Lulu's Haziq I'm
soo sure Urban Outfitters does it's just
a really cool jacket it has the floral
embroidery which i think is perfect for
spring but like I said it's good to just
kind of throw on especially for those
chillier days since it's not quite
summer yet I feel like I'm going to get
awesome use out of this in the fall I
mean in the spring and then bring it
into the fall this coming year so I'm
stoked on this
speaking of embroidery or I'm not even
sure if it is embroidery what I'm going
to show you but I don't know I I'm just
going to show you they're basically
denim jeans and they have studs on
and I'm obsessed with it I feel like
I've been seeing it kind of pop up a lot
more but I just think it's a really fun
added flair to denim and sort of just
kind of wearing plain denim jeans to
just wear like a basic cameo party this
kind of adds a different flare to it so
the first pair is from Sandro these are
more expensive
I actually was walking in bought these
on sale so I save so much money with
that it's a little bit more subtle than
the other ones I got because they're
kind of dispersed throughout both sides
of the leg and they just really look
really good I've already gotten a lot of
compliments on them so I'm stoked about
that and then the next one these are
from store ruts and they have pearls on
them and they're only on one side of the
leg and they stop basically right here
so they don't go all the way down but
they definitely have a heavy a map here
and I just think these look so cool
I've kind of worn these yet but I'm
really excited at to style these so be
sure to follow me on Instagram yes for a
shameless plug but also because I if you
follow me there already you know that I
style things a lot quicker on Instagram
than I do on YouTube so you'll see it
first there and then it'll get to
YouTube but I'm really excited about
these this store in general store s is
kind of the first time I've bought
something from them I'm pretty sure so
I'm kind of going to stop that site a
little bit more because they have some
really unique stuff next I have stuff
from Windsor and you know me in Windsor
I love it it's portable and it's frickin
awesome
I'm gonna start off with body suits
because those are just always a
must-have
the first one is it looks like this and
it's a leopard print I love it I already
know how I'm going to style it I'm
really excited it's really comfy body
suits are just like so the best thing is
that to the other intended because they
make outfit looks so good and they're so
easy the only thing that sucks is like
when you have to pee but other than that
they're really not really awesome so
love this one and then the other one is
basically just blocks it's lace and it
has like I said you'll see it on so
it'll make more sense but it's lace on
the front and kind of this one goes down
a little bit lower but I just think it
looks really pretty it's good for going
out later
under jackets all the good stuff next up
in the top and I've been really loving
stripes just that print a lot and
probably I already have two strikes
things I'm about to show you so this is
definitely more of like a statement help
like it's not an everyday top but it's
freaking cute and I'm really excited I
have a spring based break vacation
planned that I'm really excited to wear
this on so basically it's just striped
it's like a baby doll style top it has a
bow and it has these a really fun big
sleeves which I think it makes it really
stand out same from when there is
another stripe and this is a little bit
more of a different style this is
something that I would say it's a little
bit more everyday it's just a basic
button-down and I love these I think
these are so nice to just kind of tuck
into jeans and layer with like five
necklaces I just always feel like that's
such an easy way to make an outfit look
super bomb and then lastly from Windsor
I got sweater so kind of on a different
gear of spring break it looks like this
again I love this color I think I
mentioned that the bomber but this type
of brown rust color I kind of want to
say is awesome and like I said I already
know I'm gonna style this but having
read lightweight sweaters are really
nice to have in the springtime like I
said you can layer them over swimsuits
you can just tuck them into jean shorts
whatever you want and I like this one
because it kind of has this like cutout
here which i think is really pretty I've
been really into kind of vintage
shopping now when we travel to Europe
which if you follow me on instagram you
would know but I have a year of videos
coming up next we kind of stopped into
some vintage stores and as Sudan and I
was able to find this jacket which I was
really stoked about it's super
distressed super worn out but I got it
for 20 euros which I thought was a steal
I loved the pointed collar here I think
that made that look super unique it was
really warm I layered it with a sweater
it has all these de-stresses and wrists
and I just think that kind of style
looks so cool I know I can't like link
it or anything but I've kind of been
getting into vintage shops I kind of
want to make like a video series about
it and kind of show how I go into stores
and like what I pick and how I style it
so we all see because always filming in
stores is always dicey especially in New
York
so but yeah I got that and then another
thing that actually brought on Etsy it
was like an FC vintage shop and they are
these leather shorts and they are
freaking cool they're high-waisted and
I'm so excited to wear these in the
springtime because they're so kind of
heavy-duty but they're definitely not
summer shorts because in the summer and
these are going to get too warm but
layering like these shorts with this
sweater I think would look so good and
kind of tucking it in with a big belt I
love that style and I think I got these
for like 50 bucks maybe which i think is
a steal for shorts like this because now
places like Topshop and all that stuff
overpriced them so I was really excited
about that so I wanted to mention it and
if I can find use for any of those I
will link that in the feed room then
moving out while actually before I do
accessories I'm going to show you guys
two swimsuits that I got I know it's
kind of getting into that time where
you're shopping for three times bring
breaks if you're going on a vacation or
if you live by the water and you just
buy swimsuits all year-round then that's
great
so I have two swimsuits both from ASOS
the first one is actually like a super
bargain I was really excited I'm pretty
sure I got this one for like 30 bucks
both are one pieces I just think one
pieces are so freaking cute but this one
is specific I love it pink and purple or
like a lavender color and then it has a
huge cutout here with a bow and I just
think this is super flattering and then
the second one is another one piece this
one was more expensive because it's by
the brand a sky and staghorn I have a
top from them that I bought last year
that I really like but so I was like
okay I know I like the swimwear brand it
holds as well but this one's cool this
one is like a sexy or one piece I think
they both kind of are the top goes down
really low you give some like boob
action on the side it looks really nice
I just think it's super flattering and
one pieces are in which is awesome
because I just think they're so comfy
and they look super good oh another
thing is the front of this has this
really cool knot tie here which I find
kind of cinches everything makes it look
nice and lastly before I go and have two
accessories one you saw in my Cuba video
but I wanted to mention it because I
don't think I'd mention
like talking about it in the video
before and that's the Pat it is by the
brand lack of color Australians brand I
believe but I am so in love with this
hat and I have had but I hadn't loved
one as much as I loved this one
I just think it is so flattering for me
and I just felt like I never wanted to
take it off which I feel like it's a
good sign but the colour of this is
great it goes with brown black any color
of the rainbow it's perfect
I will link the exact one that I have
below and if you're interested this is a
habit I believe it's under $100 which i
think is great for a really well-made
hat because Pat is a hat freak and he
loves hats and he has a lot of homes
that range in different prices so when I
found this one for under 100 I was so
excited because a good quality hat goes
a long way if you are a type of person
that wears hat and my lab we are
accessories that I wanted to quickly
mention and I know I'm not always as an
accessory girl I hardly ever mention
accessories in my fashion videos I
always wear kind of like dainty
necklaces or dainty rings but I've been
getting a lot of questions about a
necklace in specific that I recently
bought it looks like is this I will show
you guys a close-up but it is a horn I
think like a yeah I think online is
called a horn necklace like a small
board so I'll link where this is from
the brand is Maria test gal I think I
hope I didn't butcher that but it's such
a good quality necklace I love it hasn't
tarnished at all and I've been wearing
it I've been wearing cue ball and I was
like sweating because the heat and it
didn't do anything so I'm really really
really happy with this I want to buy
more jewelry from that because I just
feel like it's held up really nicely and
it hasn't tarnished or anything like
that which I was doing it's a bummer
when you find a necklace you really like
and then it does value like no and then
the next thing are some rings um this
hem in specific I'm really stoked on
this shell ring is by far my favorite
thing it's past like insanely jealous of
this ring but it's so cool it's from the
brand Celeste twinkler I think again I'm
going to
everything linked but it's so cool it
has a shell insert inserted into the
ring and then the ring outside gold
which is like my favorite type of
jewelry it's all kind of wrapped around
it and then the other one is from Volvo
bar and it's basically just pearls but
it's like an expandable ring and it's
pearls at the top and it's just really
pretty I like it I'm kind of getting
into layering rings now I just got to
find a good handful of them that I'm
really stoked about and that don't wear
away that's like my biggest thing but
aren't like crazy expensive but that's
it for my haul today I really hope you
guys liked it and got some fashion
inspiration or are checking out some of
the links and we can be twins that'd be
cool other than that that's it so thank
