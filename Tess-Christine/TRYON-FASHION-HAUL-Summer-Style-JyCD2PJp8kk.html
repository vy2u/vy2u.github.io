today's video as you can tell is going
to be a fashion haul and you know me and
fashion and all that fun stuff I love it
so I bought some new stuff because the
weather is getting nicer and spring and
summer is just the best time to buy me
clothes I find because the stuff is so
cute so I'm going to try it on like I
always do for you guys if you can see
what it looks like but let's just get
started
first place I went to you already know
Zara I know you promising me a soaps but
I actually don't know I do have some
stuff from ASA Zara first though because
I think I bought the most from there so
the first thing was this top and it's
crazy bright which is actually kind of
crazy for me because I don't wear a ton
of color but it's floral ground-breaking
I know this time of year nobody wears
floral right but I think it's just a
really fun print I love it I think the
colors are really great and it's also a
different kind of style from the top I
normally have it the poofy sleeves are
crazy but I love it I think it's super
unique the next thing is a bodysuit and
I'm always down for the body suits and
stuff that kind of stands out great for
going out at night dressing up and
dressing down this one I feel like can
be both if the body suit and it has all
this kind of like embroidery with like
sequins kind of on it yes sequins it's
like floral and then this is like a poem
almost but I think wearing this is just
some jeans or you could totally dress
this up and wear it with some like black
pants or something like that
next thing is kind of like a day top and
it was like this I love this so much
it's not quite a crop top it's a little
bit longer than a crop top but it knots
here and I just find this to be so
flattering it just has these like big
bell sleeves I think that's what you
call them I don't know if pink or like a
mauve color it's not a bright pink I
love it I think it's so cute like I said
this is just some denim shorts it's just
like such an easy outfit the next are
some jeans and I posted this on
Instagram actually with just like a
basic white top and a lot of you guys
are like oh my god the jeans where did
you get them
like I always tag my stuff in my
instagrams by the way if they have an
Instagram which usually brands do but
they have pearls all on the bottom
you know I'm kind of obsessed in my last
haul I like called two other genes that
have this if I need to stop but I really
like them they're high-waisted they're
super flattering and just wearing them
with just like a basic white top that
like I did in the Instagram photo just
makes it look so good because it's so
simple but it has like extra Flair that
just like a basic denim and cheese
wouldn't have okay Zara's done the next
place that I went to was Urban
Outfitters I got two things from there
one is a romper looks like this it's
stripes but I really love it
stripes right now I'm kind of
gravitating towards I don't know I think
they is just a pattern I really like
right now but this is really cool with
the halter top low back and it's a
romper pretty self-explanatory but I
love the buttons going down I just think
it's a really easy summer outfit and you
can layer it with a jacket and make it
really look really good too sounds
really excited that Akama the next door
urban are pair of shoes and I have to
reach down and grab them so I'm going to
do that once again so I've worn these
already a bunch and they're white
sneakers say they're cut you kind of can
already how the wear and tear on them
but they're just do the basic Adidas
shoes they're not like the shell adidas
or just I don't remember the type I'll
have them linked below but I'd really
like these they just go with everything
pretty much I've been wearing them
almost every day since I got them next
place is Reformation and my goodness and
I love this store but my goodness as it
is expensive so I don't shop there too
often but I just love their clothes so
much so I saw I went in there into the
store like a week ago and found some
things that I had to have the first is
the top its crop top and it's unbuttoned
because Tryon but it is white it's lace
it's not like a full arm bustier crop
tops it's not super short like you
definitely would wear this with
high-waisted shorts but I just think
it's so pretty it's such a good staple
for the spring and summer because you
can just wear this with some
high-waisted jeans or shorts put a belt
on and
you look bomb so I really like this I
kind of thought it was like such a
staple that I'm going to get a lot of
you thought oh that's why I've paid a
bit more than I probably should have for
it next is a dress and I already posted
this on my Instagram because I loved it
so much
again it's floral it's like this baby
pink color but super it's almost cream
actually I would say it's cream the only
thing that's making it look baby pink is
the flowers on it really tiny little
flowers but it's just like the cutest
dress ever it's really simple I wore it
with like a denim jacket over it and
some booties and it's like one of my
favorite outfit next it's from a store
called Clio Bella and I wore their
shorts at Coachella and I kind of fell
in love with the store and I've been
stocking it so I got two new things that
I'm really excited about Pat and I are
going on a trip here soon and I'm going
to bring them on that trip so you guys
will see them on my Instagram from that
and in the video basically if they're to
knit items and they are so unique so
cool so this is like a knit dress but I
freaking love this or like crochet it's
like a mini dress but it's kind of has
like a beachy vibe which is perfect for
where we're going
super airy like I said this is going to
be really good for the summer you could
layer this over-explain suit it's just a
basic cream color and that's all I
really have to say you guys know I'm not
good at explaining stuff like this
another thing is another crochet knit I
don't even know what you want to call it
if another dress but I really liked the
stripes and the pattern of this this is
like a belt that can either go around
the waist or I think it could be kind of
cool as like a choker with it you can
kind of wear it however you feel and
then this belt it on its own it's really
pretty like I said I love the colors
it's like mauve tan Navy gray and then
the next plate is a so but I didn't even
get that much stuff from ASOS like I
normally do um but I found two things
that I really liked the first one is
this crop top and this print right now
is everywhere and I'm obsessed with it I
really want to find a pair of
that look like this because I have ideas
of how I want to style it no luck so far
but I'm on the hunt this print is kind
of taking over the springtime and I'm
okay with it it's like a crop top it has
these sleeves that kind of bail out like
this
the next is a romper and this one I
think isn't way perfect for the
summertime like going to the beach or on
vacation or something like that it's a a
romper it's floral and it has otters
even though it's like a stretchy
material here I think it would look
really good belted you can wear this
over a swimsuit it's just a really easy
thing to just throw on it was pretty
inexpensive too I think it still has the
tag on it yeah it was a 30-pound
so mom I really liked it so then the
last thing that I want to mention are my
necklaces I think I told you guys in my
last haul or maybe with my favorites
video about the Maria Pascal necklaces
and I said that I wanted to get the
bigger horn necklace and I did so in
case you're wondering what that is
that's what this is from I love the
jewelry so much from them so I got this
and then I got the little globe or world
necklace I pretty much wear it everyday
so I had to mention it put it in my haul
I will have it obviously linked below so
anyways that's it I really hope you guys
enjoyed my haul and found some new
fashion inspiration for when you're out
shopping and doing all that fun stuff so
yeah thank you guys so much for watching
and I will see you guys in my next video
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
