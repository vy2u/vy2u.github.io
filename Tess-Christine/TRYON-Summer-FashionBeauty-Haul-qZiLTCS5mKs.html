channel today's video is going to be a
summer haul and I did a spring haul a
while back and a lot of you guys seem to
really like it I kind of forgot about
hauls for a while and then when I was
kind of like asking for requests I got a
lot of requests for them and I was like
yeah let's bring it back I like it
because I can just sit and talk about it
and actually tell you guys like my first
opinions and why I got it and all that
fun stuff but before we get into that it
is that time of the week again I am Han
style Co live and this time I'm styling
this romper which is so cute perfect for
summer it's really bright and fun and I
show you guys how to style it from day
tonight super easy super fun so be sure
to tune in live tonight I will have all
the info in the description box below
but now let's go ahead and get into the
hall I got some really good stuffs and
stuff that's like staple things for the
summer for me and I'm really excited to
share them so let's get started so first
up we've got Urban Outfitters and I was
on the hunt for some new denim shorts
and I kind of buy them all over the
place I'll buy them from Topshop ASOS or
urban but I decided to stop in urban cuz
I was kind of on the hunt for some
Levi's ones because I really liked the
look of them so I got two pairs one is
like this white color or like off beige
or beige off-white I don't know
they're high rise these fit really well
they fit like comfortable well you know
like that's how they should feel but
like they just feel good and I also got
them in the just like basic denim light
wash I've already worn these I do like
them however I wish they were a little
bit more high rise I thought initially
when I tried them on they've looked high
rise and then when I actually put them
together with an outfit they were more
mid rise but I do really like the wash
of them I like the Levi's ones in
specific because they're like frayed at
the bottom and I just think they're fun
and casual and really easy to wear next
up from Urban I got a cut off sweatshirt
and you're probably thinking what the
heck it's summer but I saw this and it's
just a Calvin Klein one I've been
wanting one of these for a while when
it's summer it's really hot so I
probably won't be wearing this too much
during the day unless it's like a colder
summer day but at night these are really
fun to just kind of throw on they're
easy to just like throw on this and the
denim shorts and have like a really
simple outfit now I got ASOS now you
know ASOS is like my
I don't even know how to describe it's
just like my favorite store first thing
where oh this this is like my favorite
thing I've already worn this a ton
it's an off-the-shoulder ruffled top
pretty basic pretty simple but I love it
I wear it with so many things I wore it
the other day with like a tan bandana
scarf tied in a knot Oh cute these off
the top or off the chip these off the
shoulder tops are like my jam right now
I just genuinely really like them
they're comfy and they're easy to style
next up I got another like cutoff
sweater but this is so thin I've already
won this a couple times too it's like
this mauve color and it's cropped and
it's just easy to just kind of like
throw on again like I said with the
other one but this one is like a t-shirt
material it's not like a sweatshirt
material at all then I think I got my
favorite thing from ASOS which I was
really excited about it's just this
button-down shirt I actually wore this
last night so it's like super wrinkly
but it's just really soft and flowy and
I just kind of like tied it in a knot
last night and wore it with the denim
shorts and then I'm going to show you
what I heart with my next or my shoes
which I got from ASOS they're these and
I'm so pumped I got these because
they're like mule type things they're
like slip ons but they have this kind of
like tortoise shell looking heel to it
but it's really small but basically I
really like these because they're really
simple they go with pretty much
everything and I can just throw them on
the next group of stuff is just kind of
like miscellaneous things from various
different stores so the first thing I'm
going to show you is from forever 21 and
it's a dress it looks like this and I
really like it it's striped but it's
different types of stripes if that makes
sense
oh it's just really cute I like how it
fits and I just think it's like a really
good summer dress that I can just kind
of like throw on and it goes with a lot
of different things then the next thing
I got is from Tommy Hilfiger and it is a
bando and I was really excited when I
got this because it's from their like
rien collection in the sense that they
like redesigned some of like the old
vintage vintage styles and I wanted to
get my hands on this bando for so long
because I just really really liked it
like a really fun summer top wear it
with some high-waisted shorts and you're
like good to go
the next thing I
is a romper and it's from Amazon but the
brand is lovers and friends you can kind
of get it anywhere that has that brand
it's kind of like a brand that gets sold
a bunch of places but it's just kind of
like a basic flowy it's super beachy has
like a very beachy vibe but I really
like it because I don't know it's just
like totally my style has like that boho
feel to it but it's also enough looks
really nice I lost for clothing items I
purchased some shoes and these are my
favorite I posted them on Instagram in a
lot of you guys seem to like them too
but they look like this they're by
Jeffrey Campbell and I found um where
did I get these um I think right off the
site
right off of Jeffrey Campbell site but
they sell these kind of shoes I'm like
revolve Nasty Gal
um those type of places but I got them
in the taupe shade and I really really
like them they're like lace-up booties
but these things go with anything you
can wear them with shorts jeans dresses
and then they're kind of like a
different type of shoe like a statement
shoe but I don't know I just think they
look really good I'm the last fashion
items that I got were necklaces and
actually jewelry just jewelry in general
I got it from I saw it on Instagram I
was like stalking some Instagram and I
saw this like jewelry so I went and
checked it out it's called star gaze I
have no idea I'm gonna like put
everything in the description box below
so I got some rings and I got a few
different necklaces I really like them
because you can layer on the bunch
however I will say already I wore them
like a few days in a row and they start
to like wear off the gold and silver in
the back because they're like affordable
so it starts to tarnish so that kind of
sucks but you kind of get what you're
pay for in that sense so I think for the
time being I really like them and I'm
gonna wear them a bunch in the summer so
hopefully they last me the whole time
and lastly I'm going to share a few
beauty items that I purchased and I'm
really excited about so starting off a
foundation you guys notice in my get
ready with me video my last one that I
strayed away from my makeup for ever HD
and that was like my Holy Grail
foundation from not even kidding you
like three years four years but I heard
such good things about the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation
I had to try it and I have to say it's
like my new favorite and I never thought
I would stray away from the makeup for
everyone but oh this one's so good I
will say that it's pricey for me I'd
rather spend more on foundation and
everything else I'd rather buy drugstore
if I had to because Foundation for me is
just really important because I have a
breakout prone skin so what I put on my
skin is just really important for me
then I got this thing which is the
tatcha luminous dewy skin miss a lot of
people have been talking about it so I
wanted to try it for myself I was a
little hesitant because I have kind of
like oily or shiny skin throughout the
day so I was like is this just gonna
make it worse for me
I don't really know so I'm giving it a
shot I've used it a couple days now and
I have to say I like it so far
and then lastly lo and behold I got the
Kylie lip kits and I got four of them
and yes I did
sit on the computer and wait for them to
restock and do the whole cart Fiasco
thing and to not get who sent me to talk
about them I genuinely was like alright
let's do this
I've had years of boy band concert
experience of getting tickets so I feel
like I can do it and man name was
friggin stressful I have to say my
favorite is Kandy K as I feel like it is
for a lot of people I like candy K and I
like Dulce K occasionally Dulce K is
like pretty dark on my skin but I do
like it then I got cocoa K which I
haven't tried yet so it's in a halt and
Posie K so we will see on those two so
far my favorites are Kandy K and Dulce K
so if I were to recommend just get Kandy
K and your life will be set I'm wearing
it on my lips now and I really like it
so anyways that is my haul for today I
really hope you guys enjoyed it let me

fashion video do you want to see next
