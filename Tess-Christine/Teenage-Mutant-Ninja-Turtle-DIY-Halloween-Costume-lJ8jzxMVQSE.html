first of my Halloween videos and I'm so
excited about it so as you can tell by
the intro today's video is going to be a
ninja turtle costume no I am NOT an 80s
aerobics instructor kind of like I look
right now kind of in the thumbnail that
I'm seeing but I moved the masked up so
I didn't have to talk with it on my face
nonetheless a lot of people asking me
for group costume ideas and this is the
first one I thought up so I'm like I'm
gonna roll with it and I feel like a lot
of people would be like yeah Ninja
Turtles that's sweet so if you don't
like Ninja Turtles you want to be
something for girly I got you covered I
got a lot of ideas so stay tuned but
yeah let's get started
okay so starting off with the shirt I'm
just taking a rectangle cardboard piece
that I got off of an oatmeal box and I'm
just taking some lime green fabric and
I'm just cutting out a rectangle and I
fold it in half so basically it cuts
your time in half so it makes two and
then all I'm doing is I'm basically just
trimming up the corners to kind of give
a slightly rounded edge this is just
gonna make up your little turtle valley
splash ABS which is awesome so yeah it
doesn't really matter the type of green
you get either just kind of like a
lighter green of whatever green shirt
you bought now I'm just laying out my
shirt which I got at Target and I
placing a cardboard piece underneath it
so I don't glue the pieces together and
then I'm taking my green ovals and I'm
just arranging them like so making sure
I try it on the shirt beforehand so I
don't have the two tough ovals glued on
my boobs
so just slightly below that and it'll
make a little abdomen I'm also using hot
glue to glue these pieces on but a
fabric glue would have worked ten times
better so definitely use that
now I'm gonna show you guys how to make
your Ninja Turtle belt so all you're
gonna do is a grab around sort of
something so I got these are the craft
star they're just round little wooden
disks and all I'm gonna do is paint them
brown with just some acrylic paint it
doesn't really matter the type of front
either just kind of a dark brown and I'm
just kind of throwing that on there it
doesn't have to be perfect because
they're little like medallions on their
belts are actually like torn apart and
like really messy and not like perfect
at all um and then I'm gonna take some
letters these are just cardboard letters
again from a craft store and each of the
letters represent one of the Turtles
names so I'm gonna do is take a green
paint and I'm just gonna throw that
paint on there like I said it doesn't
have to be perfect
um so on each of the letters I'm gonna
do that and then I'm gonna go over it
with a brown just to kind of like mix it
up and make it look I don't know just
like rustic and like not so pretty you
know what I mean so once they're dry
you're just gonna take the wooden disks
that you have in the letters and you're
just gonna use hot glue it's really that
easy and you're basically just gonna
glue the letters on to the center of
each disk and that is gonna be like your
medallion or belt buckle I guess you
could say for your turtle costumes so
then with just some basic brown fabric
that you can buy at a fabric store I'm
just cutting a fairly wide section I did
fold the fabric in half so it's easier
just to cut it and then you just open it
like so and that's gonna be your belt so
I'm just cutting four of those obviously
if you do this with your friends you
guys can all do it together it'll be so
cute oh but now I'm just hot gluing up
the little like photo I keep calling
them medallions but they're like the
belt so right in the center with hot
glue it stays really well so I'm doing
that with all of them and voila now
you're a turtle so we can't forget the
turtle shells so this one is so easy and
I thought this was gonna be really hard
so all I did was I bought this like tin
foil pan at the grocery store and I just
spray painted it green I think mine is
like a turkey pan or like some sort of
crock pot pan I don't know you can find
these pretty much anywhere super
inexpensive so I'm just spraying that
with some green spray paint and then
over it I'm gonna go over with some
brown spray paint it's just going to
give a nice texture to it and make it
look all turtley then I'm taking some
brown fabric and I'm just going to cut I
don't know probably like an inch wide a
chunk of
again having it fold it in half just
makes it easier for you and then with
the scissors being very careful because
this was kind of dangerous I just poked
a hole in to the top of the turtle shell
because you're gonna make a backpack so
this is this will be pretty easy once
you actually have your shell so I'm just
stringing the fabric through that making
sure it fits on my shoulders and fits
snug on my back and yeah like you can
see it kind of just creates it back back
and all I'm doing the Kochs sukira is
just nodding the fabric because it stays
really well on the tin foil pan and then
cutting off the excess and yeah so easy
and you just put it on your back just
like a backpack and it's like a little
turtle shell and last but not least we
need to do the masks so with the
different colored fabric so this time I
showed you purple I'm just cutting a
fairly wide section of fabric like you
can see here having it fold it in half
of course and you just open it like that
and that's gonna make your mask so now
I'm just doing this like this which is
kind of crazy but I'm just marking where
my eyes are this is a lot easier with a
friend to help you
point out where your eyes are but this
works too if you're alone and doing it
so yep have my eye holes and now I'm
just cutting them out I'm making them a
little bit wider than my actual eyes
because if you make them the actual size
of your eyes it's gonna be fit really
weird and you're gonna be like blinking
on the fabric it's just gonna be
uncomfortable so make them a little bit
wider all you really need is like the
color of the mask like over your
forehead or eyebrows to get the just of
like the idea so now I'm just kind of
like cutting into the center to make it
more mask like so it's not just like a
straight rectangle across your face with
little eye holes this will make it more
like a stereotypical like superhero mask
so I'm doing that and then trimming off
the sides just to get make the mask a
little bit thinner especially with the
straps in the back for the rest of my
outfit I just wore some lime green
shorts and some knee-high socks both
from a sporting goods store and then
just some Brown booties and the costume
is done it's so easy so cute you and
your friends can each be a color and
it's just like the best group costume I
think it's so fun so yeah I really hope
you guys liked it
do
