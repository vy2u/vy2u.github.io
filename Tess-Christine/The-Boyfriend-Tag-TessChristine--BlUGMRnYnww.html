highly requested video and that is the
boyfriend tag and I'm here with Patrick
if you don't already know who he is I
asked you guys on Twitter to send me a
bunch of questions and so I'm going to
answer those and then some of the
original boyfriend tag questions and
it's going to be really fun so the first
question is where did you meet a Red
Bull event Red Bull plan destroyed and
he was taking photos he's really into
photos and I was at the party with a
bunch of my friends and I spotted this
cute face taking photos and then we just
ended up talking and that's kind of how
we met okay so the next question is how
long have you been together and we've
been together probably about a year and
a half yeah right yeah about a year and
a half okay so the next question is what
is something that you like to do
together long walks on the beach nuts
watch movies hang out yeah doing walks
hikes yeah spend a lot of time on the
lake in the summer of yeah definitely
but yeah we just kind of like to keep it
show we don't do anything super
extravagant or anything
yeah I'm pretty relaxed very very
low-key yeah okay so the next question
is what is one thing that annoys you
about the other person
oh man should have you read a list yeah
the one thing that annoys me about
Patrick is that you're kind of he's very
go go go go go all the time like he
never slows down like he's always like
needs to do something every two seconds
but really just like takes a second to
like it's just hard to keep up with him
sometimes so that's something that kind
of annoys me is cuz you're just like
always like ten steps ahead oh that's it
though what about you
well what annoys me is that you're
always so beautiful and you can
you still ready got a chef's wedding
could this show for you guys that's not
what say something let's see alright
you'd like to sleep in yeah I do I sleep
in it I will go to a morning class
and give her a text and then half an
hour later I get a good morning it's you
were still sleeping what are you doing
out leaping into me is like waking up at
like 9:30 10 o'clock which I guess yeah
is sleeping in but to him he wakes up at
like 8
7:38 like ready to go crack alone I
guess yeah that would probably annoy you
because he's already like a good portion
Thursday but that comes in full circle
with mine how you never slow down you're
like oh yes it's alright I just get way
more done in my day than you well I
guess I'm still in school and you ran it
cm9 I graduated so now all I have is
YouTube so I have an excuse you guys get
to see her a lot more than I do what was
your first impression of each other
dan shadi um I was I was super
intimidated like you were intimidated oh
I mean a little bit I mean it's hard not
to be intimidated by like beautiful
women at least to some degree my first
impression of Patrick was that he was
super cute and I also noticed that he
dressed really nice like you just looked
good like the way he presents himself is
very confident and like he just has this
like swag about him when I saw him saw
swag yes way and I was like he's so cute
he's so cute I want to notify well you
saw me before I saw you
yeah cuz I'm a huge creeper you guys
binoculars up like oh yeah I was crying
I was like where's those cute bombers
and then I saw him not like yes favorite
physical feature of each other oh boy my
favorite physical feature is your eyes
they're like this really cool blue-green
color I will love his eyes they're my
favorite they're actually one of like
the first things that I when I actually
started getting to know him I always
noticed his eyes I thought they were
always so pretty I like her smile she
was really nice teeth and
I really like her smile Mason makes it
very very easy on the eyes does he watch
Vampire Diaries with you yeah yeah he
does he really likes it
Jean team Damon all the way see and I'm
team Stefan so this is where it doesn't
work where I like season three with him
but I might in my bus far Damon kind of
a winner he only likes Damon because he
likes his attitude and he likes the way
he does things but you dare ever know
he's like no I'm gonna do this right but
Stefan is the sensitive one which
usually he's almost too sensitive it's
it's crippling done in seasons and
season um next question is when did you
realize that you guys liked each other
no I fell in love right away I it's kind
of hard not do you see this Oh baby I
think I knew right away just because
when you start talking with somebody and
you just it was easy to talk while he
was lots of lots of lots of similarities
yeah off the bat we just like I don't
know just the way we started talking and
everything that we would talk about we
just got along really well and
everything just went so smoothly that
was just like so easy one friends like
yeah similarly there's yes it's really
easy to kind of like get in the groove
of each other it was yeah because if we
didn't know right away then we probably
want to continue talking to each other
it escalated pretty quickly yeah yeah
Mike hey you're cute - hey what's going
- yeah we do need some coffee yeah
exactly
next question is any place that you
would like to go together Australia or
Hawaii Australia Hawaii
definitely because yeah oh yeah we
talked about this before yeah yeah I did
a surf there right yeah because I don't
know how to surf and he loves to serve
and he knows how and all that stuff so I
really want to learn and plus who
doesn't love the beach and you guys know
that I about that about me that I love
the beach so I'm down next question is
what did he think of your YouTube I
thought it was rad I didn't know you can
do that the way she did I hey I was
rather impressed to say the least
there's no one telling
what to do or how to do it and she just
took the reins and I don't know him yeah
I was super nervous at her to tell him
initially like when he had asked kind of
like what do you do and I was explaining
this to him and I was like really
nervous but he was like oh it's so cool
he like loved it right away so next
question is what is your favorite thing
about each other um my favorite thing
about Patrick is that he's really
outgoing and fun and you just like like
to do things and he always encourages me
to do more and like do crazy things like
he's very adventurous and not that I
wasn't before but he just like pushes me
more which i think is really cool
because there's a lot of things that I'd
be like hesitant about but with him it's
just I don't know he's just like a
go-getter and he just wants to do stuff
which makes me want to I like her
fashion sense and her independence her
she's very structured whereas I'm not
structured at all and she she definitely
builds some kind of like wireframe
around my life so that I get somewhere
otherwise I just kind of be like a ski
slash surf bum so she she keeps me in
line but I still like the ski slash
their phone I do
certainly but I mean I make each other
better we do we do we definitely
complement each other like when I when I
need to be like whoa hey
you need to reel it in yeah you help me
with that big-time otherwise I just fly
off the hand is who said I love you
first I'm gonna take credit for that
yeah he did I jumped right into that one
yeah you did it was okay though yeah I
regretted it instantaneous I didn't and
then I said it so it was fine cuz we
both kind of had the same vibe going wow
she says it all the time yeah I can't
stop these next questions are more from
the boyfriend tag so they're more like
I'm quizzing him so let's see how he
does I'm sitting in front of the TV
Vampire Diaries don't look like a hot
chick thought you know that and yeah
that's so what else would it be
yeah okay yeah yeah that or Pretty
Little Liars I'm surprising you I'm
actually really surprised what is one
food that I don't like well it's not
pickles you can put a jar other
down and like oh yeah we can i I can't
recall you ever saying like I don't like
that that's true I don't think they're
something now you have a pretty wide
variety as far as your taste is
concerned that's actually true I
actually eat a lot of stuff like I'm not
that picky so I don't really know what
which is which that doesn't suck because
usually you're like no just try you'll
probably like it yeah I put up a fight
and you end up having me try it anyway
and then I usually like it so I guess
that question isn't really weird cuz I
pretty much will eat anything garbage
disposal but a really really pretty one
oh nice okay what is my eye color that's
a real question yeah if I'm crazy you I
don't know light gray I mean you think
here you guys help me out with this one
