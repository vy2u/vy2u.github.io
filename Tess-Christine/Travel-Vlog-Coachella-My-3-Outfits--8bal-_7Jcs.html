danced like this before we don't talk
about it to talk about it hi guys
today's video is going to be a travel
vlog slash outfit video I thought I
would take you guys along with me to
Coachella by showing you guys a few
clips from my weekend along with my free
outfits so I really hope you guys enjoy
and let's get started
day 1 was a lot of exploring the
festival ground since Patrick and I have
never been to a festival like this
before so it was a lot of walking around
and kind of seeing everything they had
to offer and then of course at the end
of the night we rocked out to some ac/dc
so this is what I decided to wear on day
one I love it because it has fringe
which is like my new favorite trend for
the spring and summer so starting off
with my black fringe booties those are
from Windsor my black high-waisted
shorts of those are from ASOS I decided
to a pair of dealt with it so the
studded belt is also from ASOS for
accessories I decided to keep it pretty
chill for the most part I wear this
tassel beaded necklace from Windsor also
with a turquoise necklace from Windsor
which I thought looked really good with
this kind of burnt orange fringe vest
from forever 21 and my white top
underneath that is also from Windsor
super flowy and then I'm wearing some
club master ray bands with a backpack
from Target day two started out with
brunch at the refinery29 pool party and
I also filmed a video with refinery29
and Garnier which was a lot of fun they
did my hair and these really cool
fishtail braids
then basically Patrick and I just hung
out at the pool party for a while longer
took a shuttle to the grounds and then
basically just enjoy the festival this
is one of my favorite days we listen to
so many bands my favorites were milky
chance hozier al J and of course the
weekend it was so much fun
this is what I decided to wear on day
two it was super light and airy which I
really liked because it was super hot
this day my favorite part about this was
definitely my lace kimono it really
stands out and I got a lot of
compliments on it and that is from
Windsor I'm wearing the same black
fringe booties as before for my shorts
those are from PacSun along with the
same ASOS black studded belt for my
green top that is from forever 21 it's
just a basic green crop top and my
all-time favorite necklace which you
guys went crazy on instagram for that is
from windsor day three started out at
the adidas pool party this was awesome
we danced to a lot of Michael Jackson my
favorite then we made our way to the
grounds and saw Vance joy Florence in
the machine and of course Drake I was
lucky enough to even be able to hang out
with the two of my subscribers during
the Drake concert
now on to my day three outfit this one
is definitely the most colorful and also
very breathable which is really
necessary when you're dancing in the
desert because it was so hot so starting
off with my shoes those are just some
kids for my shorts those are from
Windsor and they're just basic white
distressed shorts my belt is from Nasty
Gal my floral shirt is from Windsor
