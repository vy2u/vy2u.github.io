today's video is going to be an ugly
location photoshoot challenge and I saw
this kind of floating around the
internet and I thought it was a really
really cool idea and I definitely wanted
to give it a shot
so that's what I did I'm really excited
to share the photos that I got with you
guys as you know I live in New York so I
noticed a lot of the challenges were
going into like different department
stores or like fast food but I thought I
would get a little creative with it
since I have New York as a backdrop and
there's a lot a huge range
uh of New York some good some bad
a lot of ugly areas but the crazy thing
is is New York is such a creative place
and I feel like every spot I could think
of that's like ugly has been turned into
a photo shoot sometime somewhere so I
really did my best I really hope you
guys like it
I love the photos and I love how they
turned out so let's get started the
first location we thought of was a
Bodega and bodegas if you're unfamiliar
with what they are they're basically
like a corner market they sell food
basic food it's not a full-on grocery
sometimes they have a deli in them
household items they're usually pretty
small and they're not decorated super
cute it's kind of a one-stop shop so I
thought it'd be a really great
opportunity to use this for a challenge
so now I was thinking about where I
wanted to shoot in the bodega I was
thinking like the chip Isles and doing
something fun like snacks and candy but
it was really busy and I wanted to be
like the least of a hassle since they
were not putting up a fight without
shooting in there as possible so I was
not trying to like have stuff scattered
all over the floor or anything like that
which in my head that's why what I
envisioned so I was like okay let's go
to like the refrigerated section it's
like in the back not many people are
back there and at the time of day like
literally was all beer so no one was
really going back there just because of
the time of the day so I was like okay I
need a prop
so once they had something to like holes
with I was kind of just using the doors
and like ways to position my body it
honestly felt really weird and
uncomfortable because I usually just do
outfit photos they don't do anything
crazy shoots or anything straddle that
door girl basically we just thought we
would use a sock it's a glass or a joke
John I think we got the shot though so
funny thing about the milk carton that I
was using I posted this photo as like a
teaser on my Instagram and so many of
you guys were like concerned that I
didn't pay for the milk I was drinking
it and putting it back first of all you
can't buy those like glass cartons we
had one of those as decor in our
apartment we were using it for flowers
so we brought that and I bought all my
milk at the bodega filled it up and like
just used it as a prop so that's it
there's no like huge story behind it I
literally just bought milk domed it in
and thought it was cute these are the
final photos I absolutely loved how they
turned out I think Pat did an amazing
job he did like a bunch of different
angles I think they're super cute like I
said I already posted on my Instagram
because I liked it
so definitely excited about this one
moving on to the next location we
decided to go to a subway station and
this is hard because there's been so
many photo shoots at subways and they
look amazing or in Subway's and they
look great so I was like okay so when we
first initially went on this subway
station which my G we tried to pick one
that was like pretty rundown like the
signs were coming off of it there was
like garbage everywhere I'm so we have
picked like a really cute one and they
do exist like cute subway stations like
Grand Central is a really cute popular
photoshoot spot so we tried to pick one
that was just a little bit more rundown
and initially I was like okay I'm gonna
pose in front of the train like when the
train is moving like you've probably
seen so many of those photos and it
turned out great these are the ones from
in front of the subway
like them a lot I like the movement in
the background I think they're really
cool and they definitely look more like
a photo shoot but then that was like
that's too easy I can't just do that so
I was like I'm gonna use the likes bench
that you can sit on if you're waiting
for a train and usually there's garbage
and like the sign and blah blah blah
so I was like I'm gonna try to sit and
like make something cool and chic and
like try to be more outfit post about it
like something I would actually want to
post and these are how those turns out I
absolutely love them I think they're
really really cute not like my favorite
because there's not going not a lot
going on and the background is just kind
of a subway but I definitely think we
made the best of it location number
three this one was spur-of-the-moment we
were actually kind of like hunting down
a new location we thought maybe a
laundromat but then we're like no that's
another like really popular photo shoot
spot so when we were walking to said
laundromat we saw this really beat down
oven next to a trash can we're gonna
turn up and the funny thing behind this
is if you live in New York or have
traveled here a lot and just spend time
walking around you know that this is
actually kind of a common thing I think
about a year ago maybe a little more Pat
and I saw this like a really random
beaten up couch that's like standing
vertical on the street and Pat was like
I want a photo in the couch and it
turned out awesome
which really reminded me of this
challenge so Pat was a very adamant that
we use this oven so I was like how am I
gonna make this oven look cute
sounds like prop ice cream cone check so
basically Pat kind of took director lead
on this he had me sit on the oven use my
foot to push open the oven door this one
was proud
the hardest to do for many reasons one I
was trying to make a really beat down
oven next to a trash can look cute which
huh and it was super super windy we were
on a Main Street and it was like a
Saturday everyone was like walking past
with me like oh this girl is literally
modeling on an oven it was a lot it was
challenging I was really nervous like I
was like I want to get this done the
funny thing is here are the images love
them I honestly think that they're my
favorite from this video Pat killed it I
think that they look so cool they're so
different they're definitely not
something I would normally pose on and I
just am really proud of how these turned
out I think they're really really cute
our last location this one is another
one that was spur-of-the-moment I love
this one for different reasons first of
all it took zero time to actually do
this photo shoot because it was so easy
like the guy was so cool so basically
it's like a storefront souvenir shop
shop gift shop it's just I always like
like I said it's like with the bodega
like I'm not gonna call it ugly his
stuff he had really really cool stuff in
there
I was actually posing with some of the
sunglasses that were in his shop they
were really cool really cheap and like
really unsure and I was like the store's
awesome but it's just one of those
places that I probably wouldn't pose
with like my new cute outfit in front of
so the challenge initially but we got
the shop right away because I was like
trying on sunglasses and Pat happened to
snap when he like held the mirror out
for me to look it's my favorite shot I
think it looks so cool and I love that
his hand is in it like holding the
mirror I think it looks really good and
like all the colors in the background
with all the different fabrics in the
back looked really really cool and I
thought it was very different so yeh but
for my video today I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and enjoyed this like
challenge video let me know if you guys
want me to do more of these or maybe
like recreating a celebrity's Instagram
that would be really fun so yeah thank
you guys for watching and I will see you
all in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
