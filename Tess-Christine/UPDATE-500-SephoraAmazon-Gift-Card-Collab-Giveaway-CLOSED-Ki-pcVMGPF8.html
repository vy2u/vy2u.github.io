be a giveaway and I'm super excited to
tell you guys all about this giveaway
but first I should probably tell you
guys where I've been for the past couple
months because I've been getting a lot
of questions on my Facebook and my
Twitter Instagram YouTube comments
asking me where I've been because I know
I haven't been uploading as frequently
as I'm used to if you guys are unaware
I've mentioned it a couple times but I'm
in my fourth year of college currently
and I took on a lot of credits this
semester and I was just overwhelmed with
school and I just wanted to make sure I
was still doing well in school um before
I kind of put all of my time and energy
into YouTube I wanted to make sure that
i was still spending a lot of time on
school because it is very important to
me I love uploading for you guys and
making videos so I definitely am still
going to make videos a lot of you guys
were like where have you been did you
stop YouTube and of course not I just
needed a couple months to make sure i
was doing well in school and um
finishing up the semester you know with
good grades now I am on Christmas break
so I'll have about a month of you for
you guys to do videos and next semester
it won't be as busy with classes just
because I'm not taking as many so i'll
be having more time to upload for you
guys so i just wanted to give you guys a
heads up on where I've been I know a lot
of you guys were asking so I hope that
clears it up for you guys now moving on
to the actual point of this video which
is the giveaway now this giveaway is
really fun one because it's a collab
giveaway and I've never done one of
these before I usually steer away from
them just because they can get a little
bit too large and a little bit too hard
to keep track of so but this one is
short and small and sweet and I love it
just for other girls um me included so
that makes us five a collab giveaway if
you are unaware of what that is is
basically we compile all of our money
together and we give away a prize and
this time there's going to be five
winners so um since there's five of us
girls there's going to be five winners
and each of you will have the
opportunity to win a 100 dollar gift
gift card to either amazon or sephora
which i think is an awesome gift because
you can pick out whatever you want i
love both of those places you can get
pretty much anything you ever need from
those so that's a super awesome prize in
my opinion moving on to the contest
rules these are all very simple you guys
have probably heard them before but I'm
just going to run through it and they
will all be relisted in the description
box below so you don't miss anything
you're in case you didn't understand
what i said or something like that
they'll all be relisted below so
obviously there's going to be the
channels that you have to subscribe to
it's just since we're all putting our
money together in compiling five winners
that only make sense that you're
subscribed to all five of us so I'll
have all the channels linked below
another thing is that there's going to
be a link that you click on you go to it
and you enter your youtube username and
that is going to be how you are entered
into the contest now as for the winners
go like I said there will be five
winners and they will all be chosen at
random before you enter though you must
be 18 years or older or have your
parents permission just so your parents
are kind of aware if you're not 18 or
older that you are entering a giveaway
the contest will run until January 10th
2013 and will end at midnight so you
have until then to enter the contest and
this contest is international which is
super awesome saw my international
subscribers can enter if you guys are
interested so that is it for the contest
entry rules I really hope you guys enter
this contest and go check out all the
other girls that are involved in this
club giving away because they are
awesome I love watching them and I know
you guys will too I really hope you guys
like this video I know it was kind of
short and sweet just a giveaway video

making more videos for you guys and I'll
have all the videos you're used to for
