going to be an updated face makeup
routine and a lot of you guys are
requesting this because I switched my
foundation so I'm not a whole lot has
changed but I did want to do it because
you guys requested it a lot so again
this is just my face makeup just my
foundation everything that I put on my
face and then obviously my eye makeup
changes day to day so I didn't include
that in part in the video but I just
showed you what I do for just my face so
if you are interested in that please
keep watching ok so the first thing I'm
going to use is the Laura Mercier
foundation primer in oil free and I'm
just going to put that all over my face
the reason why I chose to use oil free
is because my face is already tends to
get a little oily so I don't want to use
the moisture now with a flat top brush
from ELF I'm going to be taking makeup
Forever's HD foundation and the color I
am in is 123 and I'm just going to pump
one pump on that brush and I'm just
going to buff it onto my face
next I'm taking the Sonia Kashuk
concealer palette I got this at Target
and I'm just going to use the top two
colors and I like to mix them just
because it blends into my skin tone a
little bit easier and I'm just going to
focus that underneath my eyes and then
on any blemishes I may have all right
next to set my foundation and concealer
I'm taking the Laura Mercier translucent
powder and with a Sonia Kashuk powder
brush I'm just going to place a little
bit of that around my face now I'm
taking my favorite bronzer NARS Laguna
bronzer and I'm just going to contour my
face with that and the brush I'm using
is a crown brush and I got this on hot
whole look hot look I don't know how to
say it
lastly I'm taking one of my favorite
blushes from Mac and it is well dressed
and it's just a light baby pink color
and I really like it it complements my
skin tone really well and I'm just
taking another brush from crown brushes
and I'm just going to focus that on the
apples of my cheeks
and that is my completed base makeup
routine oh yeah that was my face makeup
routine I really really hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know what you
think in the comments below I'll see you
guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
