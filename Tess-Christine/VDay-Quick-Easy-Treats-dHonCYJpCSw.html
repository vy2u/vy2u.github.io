exciting video because it involves food
yes
who doesn't want food I love food so
much and today's video is all about
sweet treats and yummy pizza so it's
even better right since Valentine's Day
is right around the corner / end of the
week I decided I was going to show you
guys some yummy treats and delicious
pizza and if you don't have a date this
valentine's day not to wear a
valentine's day is always about spending
it with somebody that you love or people
that you love I filmed this video with
my roommates and it was so much fun and
we just picked out at the end and it was
just amazing Valentine's Day is on a
Friday I believe so have a sleepover
make delicious food pig out and have so
much fun that's like my every Friday
night so Valentine's Day is just a
cherry on top because you can make
heart-shaped things so if you're
interested in learning how to make yummy
delicious food then just keep on
watching so to begin I'm going to show
you guys how to make these really cute
personal heart pizzas they're so yummy
and a lot easier to make than you
probably think
so 4 ingredients all you need is
store-bought package Pisa crust and any
type of ingredients for your pizza that
you want so we decided to use
store-bought packaged pizza crust
because it was really easy all you had
to do was add water stir and let sit for
five minutes but you can totally make
homemade dough if you want to the only
reason why we chose to use dough was
because it's a lot easier to form into
hearts later if that's what you choose
to do so after letting it sit for five
minutes you take out the pizza crust and
we basically just laid down tinfoil and
then a little bit of flour so it didn't
stick to the pan and kind of knead it
out and stretch out the dough to make it
big enough to form a heart and so the
crust is the perfect size that we want
so now to shape it into a heart all we
did was we just took a knife and we just
traced an outline of a heart and began
cutting around the outlines and then
using the extra dough to add to the
dough later for another pizza so this
becomes really fun because you and your
friends can do it together you can make
as many pizzas as you want and it's just
really cool because you can all make
your own personal little heart pizzas so
now after you've done pressing your
dough into hearts which is a lot easier
than you probably think might add it's
time to decorate and buy decorate I mean
add sauce and cheese and toppings and
even decided to cut our pepperonis into
little hearts because we're super super
corny like that and we thought it was
really cute and please look at Alex with
this knife I died laughing during
editing but now we're adding green
peppers and mushrooms and this is just
super fun because you can all make your
own pizza we all just kind of like the
same pizza so we probably could have
just made one giant heart but for the
sake of this video I wanted to show you
that you can make all different ones
some people could have happily and some
people have sausage some people could
have pepperoni that's the best part
about a personal pizza is it's totally
your own so after you finish decorating
now it's time to put it into the oven
and it went in for about 12 minutes I
believe and they came out super
golden-brown and all melty and gooey and
so so yummy so now we're cutting it up
and just eating it up we ate all four
pizzas yes
YUM moving on to our pink and red banana
split which is my favorite all you're
gonna need is something to put the
dessert in so in my case I had three
serving bowls strawberries ice cream hot
fudge bananas and sprinkles so this is
super easy all you're gonna need to do
is cut the bananas in half and then
Christina came up with this idea was to
drizzle the hot fudge into the bottom of
the bowl for the hot fudge you just read
the directions on the container but all
you need to do is put it in the
microwave until it gets kind of this
runny consistency so it's a little bit
warm now all I'm doing is cutting the
strawberries in half we wanted to keep
with the Valentine's Day theme by using
red or pink things so in our case we
used strawberry ice cream and
strawberries but you can totally use
whatever fruit and whatever ice cream
you want now after putting two scoops of
ice cream you're just gonna place the
bananas boat style so they're flipped up
and kind of cradling the ice cream to
make more of a banana split type thing
and then all you're gonna do is top it
with as many strawberries as you want
and then of course we're gonna add more
chocolate because who doesn't love that
and then we each wanted different
sprinkles so we're doing that now and
then voila it's done it's so yummy so
delicious we ate the entire thing it was
just so good I can't even express to you
guys
moving on to Valentine's Day snack mix
this is super yummy and it makes really
cute goodie bags so all you're gonna
need is popcorn rice Chex peanuts
pretzels M&amp;amp;M sprinkles and chocolate so
all I'm doing is dumping a good amount
of Chex cereal into a bowl pretzels
popcorn and lastly peanuts and all
you're gonna do is kind of stir that
together make sure not to overfill it
because it's gonna be really hard to mix
the chocolate in otherwise so moving on
to the chocolate I'm just taking the
white chocolate candy melts and I'm
putting a good amount of them into the
bowl and I'm going to microwave them at
30-second intervals stirring as I go to
make sure that the chocolate does not
burn so this is where help becomes kind
of required so having at least two
people is kind of needed because I'm
stirring the Chex Mix while Alex is
pouring in the chocolate it just makes
it easier easier to evenly distribute
the chocolate throughout the bowl and
make sure everything is covered so then
now I'm just dumping in M&amp;amp;Ms and storing
that in while the chocolate is still
warm and gooey because you want it to
kind of stick to it just not all the way
you want more of the chocolate to stick
to the checks and the pretzels but you
want the M&amp;amp;Ms and the sprinkles just be
kind of the last thing that kind of
sticks to it and so then lastly while
the chocolate is still warm you're gonna
dump it all into a baking pan and you're
just gonna kind of let it sit and make
sure everything kind of hardens together
so once the chocolate is cooled and no
longer gooey you can just dump it into a
bowl and dive right in otherwise I
thought it'd be really cute as goodie
bags you could give them to your friends
or at work or at school
they're just really yummy snacks and
treats and I thought it was really cute
so now moving on to a classic and one of
my favorites chocolate-covered
strawberries YUM and we decided to add
sprinkles and swirls to make it a little
bit different so all you're gonna need
is melting wafers strawberries sprinkles
and food coloring if you want to get
fancy so all I'm doing is laying down
parchment paper so the chocolate doesn't
stick and I'm just dumping the wafers
into a bowl and I'm gonna do the same
thing as before and microwave them at
30-second intervals until it's all
melted
so after washing the strawberries all
you're gonna do is dry them off so
they're not wet and then you're just
gonna basically dip them into the
chocolate
this one is so easy and hardly takes any
time you do kind of have to move quickly
because the chocolate does kind of dry
quickly so just keep that in mind so
this part is completely optional but
Alex and I decided to get fancy and add
sprinkles this first one was a fail we
thought it would be easy to roll the
strawberries in the sprinkles and it
ended up just being a complete mess but
that's the fun of it making mistakes
you're doing this with your friends or
your date anyways so it's just fun they
don't have to be perfect or anything but
what we did find that works with the
sprinkles is you hold it over a plate
and then sprinkle the sprinkles on it
makes it way easier so while the
strawberries were drying Alex and I
could not pass up the leftover chocolate
so we found bananas and we use
toothpicks to dip that in it was so good
so lastly we're just gonna melt some
white chocolate and add some food
coloring to make it pink again this is
getting really fancy but it was just
kind of fun to do to add some more
decoration at the strawberries so all we
did was we basically drizzled it over
the strawberries obviously it's not
perfect but that's the fun of it because
we're not trying to sell these or
anything we're gonna eat them later so
we just kind of had fun and mixed a
bunch of different colors and there's a
loom all over the strawberries and
that's it they were so yummy and
delicious I mean how could you pass up a
classic like chocolate-covered
strawberries but that's it for this
video I really hope you guys enjoyed it
if you try out any of these sweet treats

picture and I will see you guys in my
next video love you guys so much bye
