Day inspired hair and makeup tutorial I
know I'm kind of late in the game being
that Valentine's Day is tomorrow but I
thought you guys would still enjoy it
plus this look could be worn any time
you please so I thought I would still
upload it for the eye makeup all I did
was like a pink smoky sultry eye I
absolutely loved it and I used the Naked
3 palette to do that and then for the
hair I just did these big soft big
balumptuous' waves that kind of reminded
me of something Victoria's Secret asks
something that's a little bit more
romantic and sexy so I thought it would
be perfect for you guys if you are
interested in that sort of thing also be
sure to stay tuned to the end of the
video for a special giveaway because I
heart you guys and since it's
Valentine's Day I thought I would do a
special giveaway for one lucky winner so
if you're interested in that stay tuned
to the end but if you are interested in
this video at all-but and just keep on
watching ok so like always we're gonna
start with the makeup and to begin I'm
going to prime my eyes using Urban
Decay's primer potion to begin with the
eye shadow I'm just gonna be picking up
dust and placing that all over my lids
and then I'm gonna be picking up a
nooner which is a matte shade and I'm
going to be creating an outer V this is
just gonna define the crease a little
bit more which will act as a base for
the rest of the colors next I'm just
gonna be taking a crease brush and
blending that color out to make sure
that there aren't any visible harsh
lines and then with that same crease
brush I'm going to be picking up Factory
which is just a brown color I'm gonna
place that right over the color that I
had put before just to kind of deepen
the look then I'm going to be picking up
Buzz which is just another pink color
and I'm gonna place that on my upper
brow bone for some more pink colors next
I'm gonna be taking black heart which is
the darkest color of the palette and I'm
just gonna be focusing that on the outer
corner and then blending it with a
crease brush to kind of blend everything
in and kind of smoke it out next I'm
picking up strange and I'm gonna place
that on my brow bone to highlight it and
then into my inner corner I'm just gonna
be picking up dust and placing that
there to kind of balance out the pink
and then with the same brush I'm gonna
be picking up factory that brown color
and putting it on the outer lash line
next I'm gonna begin by using a gel
liner to give myself kind of a winged
eyeliner look I'm not gonna go too
dramatic with the winged look I'm just
gonna
give it a slight wing for a dramatic
effect next i'm going to tightline and
then line my bottom waterline and then
lastly i'm going to curl my lashes and
apply some mascara this next part is
completely optional but I decided to add
some false lashes for a little bit more
of a dramatic effect moving on to my
face I had already applied foundation
and concealer and bronzer so now I'm
just gonna add some blush I just picked
this one from benefit because it's a
very subtle pink color with some shimmer
and then lastly for my lips I'm just
applying a light pink lip gloss to
complete the makeup look now it's time
to move on to the hair so to begin I
just kind of brushed out the hair that I
had it was second day hair I believe and
I'm just gonna be taking a connor
one-inch curling iron and I'm gonna
begin curling my hair and now you're
probably thinking what is different
about this well what's different about
it is that basically all I'm doing is
I'm taking the hair and I'm wrapping it
up in the curling iron but I'm gonna let
go right away normally when you curl
your hair you hold it there to kind of
let the heat get through your hair but
this way it's just gonna kind of pull
the curl out right away and it's just
gonna be like this loose wave so it's
not gonna fully hold the curl it's just
gonna kind of give you like straight
ends it's gonna give you a very natural
looking texture to your hair which is
what I wanted for this look and which is
what I wanted to teach you guys too
so all I did was wrap it up and let it
go right away don't hold it at all and
you're gonna get these soft loose waves
which are so so pretty so after that I
just kind of shook them out and run my
fingers through it and then I'm just
going to finish with some hairspray and
it's that easy it literally only takes
like ten minutes depending on your hair
but that completes the look and I think
it's so pretty and just perfect for
Valentine's Day no matter what you're
doing so now on to the exciting part of
the video which is the giveaway now if
you guys watch the video which hopefully
you did you know that I used the Naked 3
