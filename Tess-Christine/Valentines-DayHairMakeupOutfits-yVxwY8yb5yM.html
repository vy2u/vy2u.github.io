do a Valentine's Day video so I thought
I would do a hair makeup and outfit
ideas video for you guys for this year's
Valentine's Day since this part takes
longest let's start with the hair I'm
taking in Conair two inch curling wand
and I'm going to start by curling my
hair from the top of my head and working
my way to the bottom the reason why I'm
doing this is because I am going to be
pinning the curls up while they are
still hot this is just gonna help the
curls keep their hold a little bit
easier and cool off while they are still
in the curl so it'll just give a more
bouncy texture to your curls so
basically all I'm doing is catching the
curl once I release it from the curling
iron and taking bobby pins and pinning
the curl down now I'm going to keep
doing this for the rest of my hair until
I get to the bottom layer it's fairly
simple it takes a little practice it's
kind of tricky as you can see I kind of
fumbled with it a little bit but after
your while you get the hang of it but
basically I'm just going to repeat this
process from the top of my head and work
my way all the way to the bottom layer
of my head
now if you don't have the time or the
patience to handle pending up all your
curls around your whole head you can
also use a smaller curling iron and will
have the curls have a little bit more of
a stronger texture and a stronger curl
that way they'll stay in a little bit
longer I'm just kind of going more for
the loose curl effect because I think
that looks really pretty and very
natural and effortless which is I think
what you would want on a Valentine's Day
date you don't want to look like you
tried too hard so I really like this
hairstyle for a date even I think it's a
really great hairstyle but if you don't
have the time and patience to pin it up
or anything like that you can just take
even the same curling iron and just kind
of let the curls cool off a little bit
even in your hand just give them that
bouncy effect but again this isn't
always necessary I just think it gives
it a cool effect when you take it down
it just looks a little bit more natural
than just taking it out of the barrel
right away but it is totally up to you
and how you choose to curl your hair in
this sense
now once you have finally finished
pinning your last curl you're just going
to lightly miss the top of your head
with hairspray don't go crazy with it
because you don't want it to turn all
crusty but this is the perfect time
while it sits and cools to start your
makeup
so just because pink and red are
Valentine's Day signature colors doesn't
mean you have to go all crazy with the
eyeshadow so I decided to stick with a
natural bronze smokey eye look but
decided to throw a little bit of pink on
my lower lash line so to begin I am
priming my eyes using Urban Decay's
primer potion and I'm just going to
spread that all over my lids and up to
my brow bone
now I am going to put the exact colors
that I use in the bottom bar below but
for now I'm just going to explain them
by shade so it's easier for you guys to
find exact dupes from the colors that
I'm using so right now I'm basically
just putting on a matte beige color and
I'm placing that on my lids and on my
brow bones to create a base for the rest
of my colors next I'm taking a champagne
light pink color it's very shimmery and
I'm putting this directly onto my lids
next using windshield wiper motions I am
taking a bronzy gold shimmery color and
placing that directly onto my crease if
it I want to say it is more bronze
bronzey Brown than it is gold it's a
very pretty color and I think it gives
great dimension and really complements
pink if you do want to add more pink to
the eye look later
next with a fluffy brush I'm just going
to be taking a light shimmery color and
placing that on my brow bone as a
highlight and blending out any harsh
lines from the dark color that I just
placed next with an eyeliner I'm just
going to lightly line my eyes and then
I'm going to be taking a flat shader
brush and I'm going to be smudging my
eyeliner out I'm not gonna smudge it too
much just directly into my lash line
just to give it more of a natural effect
and make it look a little bit more
natural instead of such a harsh line on
my eyelids
with that same eyeliner pencil I'm just
going to be tight lining and lining my
water lines next with two different
shimmery paint colors I'm just going to
be taking an eyeshadow pencil brush and
I'm just going to lightly be dusting
that on my bottom lash line underneath
my waterline this is just going to kind
of add a subtle hint of pink that
everybody wants on Valentine's Day just
to your eye look but not make it so
dramatic where you're taking on pink
eyeshadow I am also going to be taking a
light very light pink shimmery color and
placing that on the inner tear ducts of
my eyes this is just going to brighten
up my eyes a little bit more and make
them a little bit more white and a
little bit more awake next with mascara
I'm just going to be applying that to my
top and bottom lashes I'm using two
different mascaras and I will have them
in the description box below
for my lips I'm just taking max creme
Cup and I'm just going to be placing
that directly on my lips this is just a
very light natural-looking pink color
and next I'm finishing over top of it
Cora's lip gloss and light pink this is
just a very pretty lip combination I
love it and I wear it a lot of my videos
that completes the makeup look now it's
time to let your hair down now once you
begin unpinning all of your curls that
are pinned up you're gonna find these
loose very natural-looking curls they
bounce at the end and that's what I
really love about them now it's up to
you how natural you want these to look
now if you want these to straighten out
quite a bit you can run your fingers
through them a lot more than I do
or even brush them through and it'll
just give kind of like a natural
wave-like look to your hair or you can
leave it down like this and kind of just
have these loose messy looking curls yet
still very put-together and very
appropriate for a date I just think it's
a very pretty and very flattering
hairstyle
now of course my hair needs some help in
the volume department so I'm going to
tease my hair obviously this is optional
whether you like teasing your hair or
not I really like to tease my hair just
because it gives it a lot more volume
and makes the curls look a little bit
more voluptuous and bouncy then they
normally would but again it's all
depends on your hair type I am going to
finish with hairspray obviously and that
is the completed hair look I really
really hope you guys like this it's a
really really natural-looking hairstyle
and I absolutely love it lastly I've put
together four different outfit ideas or
things that I would wear on a
Valentine's Day date depending on where
I am going
this first outfit is more on the casual
side I would definitely recommend this
maybe for a casual dinner and a movie I
think it is very cute and put together
outfit it's just something that's not
super fancy the top that I'm wearing is
from forever 21 it is very cute collared
pink and white polka dot shirt the
earrings that I'm wearing are from
Target they're basic just hoop earrings
with kind of sparkly black beads at the
end the purse that I have is from TJ
Maxx these black skinny jeans that I'm
wearing are from Dorothy Perkins a store
in England but obviously black jeans are
super easy to find and these really cute
tan wedges are from PacSun the second
outfit is definitely on the even more
casual side but kids my age definitely
don't go to super fancy restaurants so
this is actually a perfect outfit
especially for this cold winter winter
months that I'm living in the scrap that
I'm wearing is from a local boutique
this water I'm wearing is from American
Eagle on the belt and the tights that
I'm wearing are from Target this bag
that I have is from TJ Maxx and the
brand is Alex and Olivia the tights like
I said before are from Target and the
shoes that I'm wearing are from TJ Maxx
this third outfit is a little bit more
on the fancy side I decided to wear a
nice black dress so this is definitely
something you would wear if you were
going to a nice fancy dinner or anything
like that but this dress is from H&amp;amp;M I
really like it's a two panel dress one
side is kind of like a felt and the
other side is more of a cotton material
I really really love this dress a lot
and the belt came with it this clutch
that I'm wearing is from Dorothy Perkins
now this is optional depending on the
weather but I decided to put carrot with
a lace blazer from forever 21 just
because it's a little bit chilly here
and it's just a little bit more
practical but this is obviously optional
and again this is a more fancy look so
if you're not going somewhere super
fancy I would probably stick to one of
the other outfits the shoes I forgot to
mention they are from Charlotte Russe
and they're just basic black pumps this
last outfit is definitely my favorite I
absolutely love this outfit is probably
out of the four this is probably the one
that I would most likely wear on a date
the collared shirt that I'm wearing is
from forever 21
I really love the lace detailing on the
arms I just think it gives it a really
really great feminine touch the jeans
that I'm wearing are Levi's jeans and I
bought them at Macy's and again these
same lace-up wedges are from PacSun but
that is it for this video I really
really hope you guys enjoyed it please
let me know what you think in the
comments below and I wish you all a very
happy Valentine's Day no matter what
you're doing see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
