is another part of my Vampire Diaries
fashion series and the last time I did
my Vampire Diaries fashion series was
all the way back in August so if you
haven't seen my Elena or Catherine
fashion video I will link those in the
description box below or somewhere on my
video you should definitely go check
those out because I did those before I
studied abroad so now I am on to
Caroline and this probably was one of my
highly requested fashion videos was a
Caroline Forbes fashion video I loved
Caroline's fashion because it was very
different from Elena and Katherine so
this fashion video was really fun for me
to do because I got to pick out
completely different outfits Caroline
dresses a lot more girly than Elena and
Katherine do Elena and Katherine kind of
have a darker wardrobe Caroline likes to
wear dresses and you know add Pink's and
stuff to her wardrobe remember again I'm
just gonna do a short disclaimer these
are not the exact outfits these are just
outfits that I put together from my own
closet that I think Caroline would wear
I do not know how the stylist dresses
like I do I don't know anything about
the stylist I don't know where she gets
her clothes I don't know where anything
about it so I just take what I cuz I
watch the show like all the time it's my
favorite show if you don't know that
already and so I watch the show a lot so
I take you know pictures I find off of
Google and things I see in the show that
she wears and I create outfits from my
closet for that and they also make them
very affordable so I'm picking pieces
that you all can afford at home and
achieve Caroline's look so I really
really hope you guys enjoy the sash
video and stay tuned for Bonnie's
because I am going to do a Bonnie
fashion video I'm not sure when exactly
but it'll be sometime soon so stay tuned
for that and I will see you in my next
video bye guys this first outfit is
something that Caroline would wear you
know as a vampire running around as a
vampire more of a casual type of look
the top that I'm wearing is a pink top
and it is from TJ Maxx and the jacket
that I'm wearing is from American Eagle
but I would choose to wear a darker
shade of jacket just because it looks
more like that in the picture but this
is just what I had and my maroon pants
are from new book and my shoes are from
River Island
this next look is something you would
see Caroline wearing on pretty much an
everyday occasion maybe going to school
or something like that in her earlier
episodes you would see her wearing
something like this the dress and the
cardigan that I'm wearing are both from
Target and the belt that I'm wearing is
from Express the shoes that I'm wearing
our flats from Kohl's these are just the
black flats that I have I it's up to you
whether or not you wanted to wear heels
I just chose flats because it's a bit
more practical this next outfit is
something that I think Caroline again
would wear later in the seasons as a
vampire I think she likes to take basic
pieces like jackets and pants and wear
them with very feminine things like
roughly tops or floral tops or something
like that that makes Caroline's style
very girly the jacket that I'm wearing
is from TJ Maxx and it's a jacket blazer
type of deal and my shirt is from
Express again any ruffle tank top or
floral tank top will make this look look
very similar to care lines and these
pants that I'm wearing are from Dorothy
Perkins these lace up booties are from
Zara but again you can choose wear flats
if that is more comfortable for you
this next outfit is another very casual
Caroline look I really like how she
takes jackets and pairs them with very
girly feminine tops because you can make
so many different outfits out of that
the jacket that I'm wearing is from H&amp;amp;M
it's just an army green style jacket and
the top that I'm wearing is from Macy's
it's in the American Rag brand at Macy's
these jeans that I'm wearing are from J
Brand and I did choose to roll them up
as capris but again any Jean blue jean
would help you achieve this look and
again I chose to wear the same black
flats from Kohl's
and I had to tie in another dress in
this fashion video because Caroline does
love wearing dresses and she wears them
in multiple different ways I chose to
pair this with flats but again you can
wear them with heels I could totally see
Caroline wearing heels for this look but
flats you know are a bit more practical
for everyday the jacket that I'm wearing
is out just a white leather jacket from
a local boutique in my hometown the
flats that I'm wearing are the same
black flats from before they're from
Kohl's and I chose to wear this blue
chiffon dress from t.j.maxx visit for
this fashion video I really hope you
guys enjoyed it thanks so much for
