is going to be another fashion video for
you guys and I got such awesome feedback
on my Pretty Little Liars fashion series
and one of my biggest requests was to do
a Vampire Diaries fashion series so of
course being my favorite show of course
I was going to do it today's look is
going to be Elena
so I created a whole fashion video for
just Elena I think I have like 5 or 6
outfits maybe her style is very very
easy to recreate because she dresses I
want to say plain because it's almost
kind of how she dresses she doesn't
dress with a lot of patterns or anything
she just is very plain but still very
very cute and very practical for
everyday so that's why I thought I would
do it now kind of throwing it into like
back-to-school it's not part of my back
to school series or anything this is for
my Vampire Diaries fashion series but I
figured I might as well put it up now
because it is so practical for
back-to-school so you guys could get
some ideas from her style to add to your
back-to-school wardrobe I am going to do
all the other characters so you don't
need to comment or anything on in the
comments below saying that you want to
see like Vani Caroline and Catherine
because I promise I will do them I'm not
exactly sure when I only have a week
left in the States so I have to kind of
figure out my fashion stuff now I'm not
sure if I'm going to be able to get all
the characters up now or I'm going to
might have to wait until December until
I get more of the characters up because
I can't bring all my clothes with to
England so it's going to be harder for
me to recreate certain looks when I
can't bring all of my clothes obviously
so I'm going to eventually get all the
characters up don't worry I know the
series comes out or the next season
starts in September so that'll be
perfect I'll have Elena's up hopefully
Katherine's and then in December which
which I'm thinking it would almost be
better if I just waited for Katherine's
and um Bonnie and Elena
Urbani and cat Caroline's until I get
back because then I'll have that whole
last season to go off of for their
wardrobe Elena I feel like her style
won't change very much if there's a few
pieces that are very different that I
think are really really cute that I want
to throw in somewhere maybe I'll do like
an outfit of the day inspired by her
something from this last season so I
most likely will wait until December to
do the rest of the characters that way I
have a whole other season to go off of
their outfits so yes make sure you stay
tuned for that
really hope you guys like this fashion
video um the outputs were really really
easy for me to recreate she has about
four basic pieces in her wardrobe that
she wears almost all the time I would
have to say lace tank tops scoop neck
long sleeve shirts and then also leather
jackets she always has some sort of
leather jacket and then jeans and
converse so you have any of those you
have Elena's look and you can get it
super easy so I really really hope you
guys enjoy this fashion video and until
my next video
see you guys
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
