is going to be another part of my
Vampire Diaries fashion series as you
guys can probably tell from the title
above that I am doing Katherine's today
and I know some of you guys didn't want
me to wait until December like I said in
my last video so I thought I would just
do Katherine's because hers is kind of
like Elena's I feel like except just a
little bit darker and a little bit
edgier so I figured I might as well tie
it in with that too in case I don't know
any of you guys are interested in hers
for like a night look or something that
would be really fun if you are just
coming across this video and you haven't
seen my Elena fashion video I did that
so I will link that in the description
box below and also I am going to be
doing Bonnie and Caroline's probably not
until December but I just wanted to
throw that out there in case your first
stopping by this video and you want to
come and see that but I will do that so
you don't have to worry about commenting
or anything like that
re I've been gone for so long I'm super
super busy with packing and getting at
getting everything ready for England I
leave on Wednesday so that's so soon so
if you guys haven't heard of my vlog
channel yet I am starting a vlog channel
that I'm going to be vlogging throughout
my study abroad experience in England so
I will link my vlog channel in the
description box below so you should
definitely go subscribe to that because
I'll have vlogs up and videos up
regularly starting next week so
definitely stay tuned for that and I
really really hope you guys enjoy this
fashion video of Katherine I do want to
do a short disclaimer that all of these
outfits again with my Elena one and all
these fashion series that I do they are
not exact outfits obviously I have no
idea where the stylist gets the clothes
for the characters this is just me
inspired by their looks so none of these
outfits are going to be exact some might
not even be the same styles they are
just my creation of what I think
Katherine would wear and what I have
seen her wear so I kind of put together
outfits in that sense and I also make
them super affordable for you guys to go
and get yourself so I don't buy super
expensive items of clothing to recreate
this because the whole point of these
fashion videos are kind of for me to
show you guys how I get the look and how
you guys can get the look at home for a
lot less I really really hope you guys
enjoy this video let me know what you
think in the comments below and
can't wait to see you in my next video
bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
