my second look from my Vampire Diaries
inspired tutorials and this look is
Katherine again but from 1864 and
basically her hair is just very tight
curls and pin backed with kind of a
twist and then it's poofed at the back
and I really like this look actually I
thought it was going to be too kind of
formal for everyday but I actually
really liked it and yeah it's actually
really easy if you have watched my how
to wavy hair tutorial it's pretty much
the exact same thing just using a
different curling iron the curling iron
I'm actually using is con Aires infinity
curling iron and I'm sure you guys have
seen this before um it creates very
tight curls I wouldn't necessarily
recommend this curling iron if you want
sort of loose curls or loose waves
because it's not going to give you that
it'll give you tight curls kind of what
I show you in this tutorial so basically
yeah I'm just using this and then um
hairspray teasing comb and yeah that's
pretty much it and I already the heat
protectant I'm using is the Chi 44 iron
guard and before I started this tutorial
I sprayed my whole head with it so just
remember to do that if you do this look
because it's a lot of heat on your hair
but yeah I guess there's not much else
to say but let's get into Tori oh
alright hi guys the first thing we're
going to do is start with our hair
parted down the center we're going to
section off our hair I like to section
mine a little bit above my ears
and then we're going to separate a
little chunk of our hair and wrap that
away from our face on to the curling
iron and hold for a few seconds and then
release and you get this nice little
bouncy curl depending on your hair type
you might have to hold it a little
longer a little less depending on how
thick or thin your hair is I like to
hold mine for I don't know ten seconds
all right and then for the other side of
your head make sure you flip an or
switch hands and wrap the hair away from
your face this will make sure the curls
are even throughout your entire head and
then all you're going to do is repeat
through that the same thing throughout
the entire section all right and then
once you're done with that you're going
to take care spray and spray that layer
then take down your hair and section it
again I like to section mine this time
by my eyebrows
just take another section of your head
and just repeat
right and then spray that layer and then
take this layer down now we're going to
tease we're going to tease before we
curl because this way you won't have to
mess up the curl to try to get your
fingers underneath to tease and I like
to use my hair from the back to the
front it just gives me more control of
how high my pouf is right and then I
like to smooth it down with a comb and
then spray and now we're just gonna do
the same thing for that part of the hair
and then spray
great and now to section off her hair
we're going to do the back proof section
first and we're just going to take bobby
pins you're going to kind of pinch take
your two fingers and pinch it around
your hair in the back and puff it up and
then just take my even taking four bobby
pins and pinning it back and what I like
to do is cross the bobby pins over each
other this way the bobby pins hook and
it'll just make sure that they stay in
place again depending on your hair
thickness I'll depend on how many bobby
pins you use alright and then for the
sides of the hair we're just going to
take and I match it up with the back and
we're just going to twist it and then
pin it again and just pin it over the
bobby pins that you already placed and
then do the same thing on the other side
again twist it away from your face
all right and then you're just going to
kind of pull the twists out a little bit
this will just give your hair a little
bit more volume
not so tight to your face then you're
just going to spray with hairspray once
you finish with that the look is done
alright that was the look and I really
hope you guys enjoyed it and can go out
and try it yourselves stay tuned for my
next video because it's going to be
another Vampire Diaries inspired
tutorial and this time it's going to be
Elena so I'm very excited to do that one
and yeah I guess that's it so thanks for
watching and see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
