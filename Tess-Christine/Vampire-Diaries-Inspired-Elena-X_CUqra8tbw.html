and final Vampire Diaries inspired
tutorial and today's look is a makeup
tutorial inspired by Elena in the show
and her look is very natural and very
simple it's I'll show you a close-up
it's just using Browns and very subtle
natural-looking Browns and it smoked out
towards the edge and then just black
eyeliner so it's very simple and I
thought you guys would be interested in
it just because it is also very good for
an everyday look too but yeah I guess
that's it so let's get into this
tutorial right so the first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna prime my eyes
using Mac's painterly paint-pot we're
just gonna spread that all over the lid
next I'm taking a flat shader brush and
from The Naked palette I'm picking up
the color naked and I'm just gonna put
that all over my lid and this color is
just a matte light brown then I'm gonna
take NYX eyeshadow pencil in French
fries and I'm going to put that on the
outer half of my lid and this is just a
dark cream shadow then I'm gonna take my
finger and I'm gonna blend it in with
the other shadow but keeping it still
dark towards the outer half then I'm
gonna take a dome shader brush and I'm
going to pick up buck from The Naked
palette it's just a matte kind of medium
brown and I'm gonna just put that in the
crease focusing it on the outer half
then I'm gonna kind of spread it onto my
lid to create a v-shape and then spread
it up towards the end of my eyebrow
right next I'm taking a fluffy blender
brush and I'm just gonna blend that out
then I'm gonna take that dome brush
again and pick up naked and put that on
the inside or the inner half of my lower
lash line and then take buck and do the
same thing on the outer half kind of
blending it in with the lid at the top
or the color at the top then I'm gonna
take that fluffy brush and blend it out
again and then I'm going to apply false
eyelashes I cut them just so that they
would be placed at that
half of my eyelashes and now I'm going
to be taking a sponge brush and picking
up virgin from The Naked palette it's a
light shimmery beige color and I'm gonna
focus that on my brow bone then I'm
gonna put it also in the inner corner to
brighten my eyes now once your eyelashes
are dry I'm taking a Mac to a weight
brush and I'm gonna pick up a gel liner
mine is blitz and glutes by Mac and I'm
gonna put that over my lashes kind of
blending it onto my eye to make it look
natural and wing it out a slight bit not
too much I like to put my eyeliner over
my eyelashes this way it blends in with
my eyelid nicely now I'm gonna take a
pencil eyeliner and I'm gonna line my
waterline this is just a L'Oreal black
eye are a pencil eyeliner and I'm gonna
curl my eyelashes this will just blend
my natural eyelashes in with the fake
eyelashes and then I'm gonna take
Maybelline falsies mascara and I'm going
to apply it to my top lashes and then
also my bottom lashes
all right in for my face I'm gonna be
taking dainty by Mac it's just a very
light pink color I'm gonna be taking a
blush brush and lightly dusting that on
the apples of my cheeks not too much
because the way she has in the picture
is very subtle next I'm going to take
Carmack's and put it all over my lips
just to moisturize them and then I'm
going to be taking the NYX jumbo lip
pencil and pink nude and I'm going to be
covering my lips with that that's kind
of a lip base and then I'm gonna be
taking a lipstick by Revlon the color is
temptress and I'm gonna be putting that
on my lips this is just a light pink
color it's very pretty and then yeah
that is it for the makeup I really hope
you guys liked it
