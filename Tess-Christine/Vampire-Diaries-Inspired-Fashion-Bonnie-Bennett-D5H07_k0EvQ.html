fashion video I know you guys have been
waiting so long I finally got around to
it and today's fashion video is the last
of my Vampire Diaries series and that is
Bonnie Bennett and I know a lot of you
guys have been waiting for this one
Bonnie style is actually very easy to
achieve she does actually where a lot of
flowy chiffon shirts so if you have any
of that in your wardrobe you can achieve
Bonnie style really easily out there
with me because when I filmed every
other fashion video that I think I've
ever done it's been at my parents house
because either I was filming it in the
summer where I usually work in the
summer or which I live there in the
summer is what I'm trying to say and
winter break because of the other times
I was either at school or in England and
there's not a lot of places to film so I
did make do with filming I really really
hope that it turns out okay I'm crossing
my fingers that you guys can see the
outfits okay and everything because I
did manage to film in my room in this
little space back here also if you
haven't seen my Elena Katherine or
Caroline fashion videos that I did from
The Vampire Diaries I will have them
linked in the description box below I
really really hope you guys enjoy this
fashion video please let me know she
think in the comments below and I will
see you guys next time
bye guys for this first outfit this is
kind of a typical Bonnie outfit she
would wear this and maybe even pair a
jacket over it the shirt that I'm
wearing is from Macy's and the brand is
guest the necklace is from forever 21
but any kind of bold dangly necklace
would work for this look the jeans that
I'm wearing are from forever 21 and the
shoes that I'm wearing are from Zara
this next look is something that bonnie
has been wearing in a lot of the most
recent episodes of vampire diaries
lately it's kind of been her most go to
go to look the scarf that I'm wearing is
from maurices and the jacket I'm wearing
is from TJ Maxx the tank top that I'm
wearing underneath my jacket is actually
from Target but any sort of colored tank
top would work for this is just a basic
racerback tank top and the shoes are
from Kohl's and the jeans are from
forever 21
since Bonnie's go to fashion item is a
flowy chiffon shirt I had to throw
another one in this fashion video the
one that I'm wearing is from forever 21
as well as the belt I also decided to
pair it with some dangly earrings
instead of a necklace and the earrings
that I'm wearing are from forever 21 as
for the bottom half of the outfit the
grey jeans that I'm wearing are from
Target as well as the black boots this
last outfit is one of my favorites
because I think it really resembles
Bonnie's cute simple and girly style the
shirt that I'm wearing is from forever
21 it is just a basic floral chiffon
tank top I paired it with a cardigan
from Target and a necklace as well from
forever 21 this is just another bold
necklace that Bonnie always likes to
pair over her shirts and cardigans the
black jeans that I'm wearing are from
Dorothy Perkins actually in a store in
England and the boots that I'm wearing
are from River Island
but that is it for this Bonnie Bennett
inspired fashion video I really hope you
guys enjoyed it and I'll see you guys
next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
