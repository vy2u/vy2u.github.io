requests for vampire look and who better
than the cast of The Vampire Diaries to
be inspired by you guys all know that I
absolutely love the show so I picked
this more of a sexy vampire look instead
of the traditional one and I know I know
there's a few other vampire tutorials
like this on YouTube but I thought I
would still share my version with you
for those who are interested so I hope
you guys enjoy
okay so as usual we're starting out with
the makeup and I bet you guys can guess
what I'm doing I'm priming my eyes but
next I'm going to lightly dust a matte
light brown color to my lids as kind of
a base for the entire look now I decided
to mix a dark red with a golden brown
color and after wetting the brush I'm
going to slowly build that onto my
eyelid and extend it a little bit into
the crease the trick with this is to Pat
it and then slowly swipe it onto the lid
this will help with preventing fallout
and it will help you build the color
evenly next with a crease brush I'm just
lightly swiping that over the crease to
blend out any harsh lines to get
dimension to my eyes I'm taking a black
shadow with a flat top eyes shadow brush
and creating an outer V shape with it
I'm following the natural shape of my
eye and building that color into the
center of my eye keeping the strongest
part of the black on the outer corner
again I'm taking that same crease brush
from before and blending out any harsh
lines now I'm taking a white shimmery
color and putting that onto my brow bone
and into the inner corner of my eyes for
some highlight to line my eyes I'm using
a liquid eyeliner to create a thin but
an even line across my eyes with a bit
of a wing I don't want too much of a
dramatic wing just a slight one at the
end and then to mattify the shininess of
the eyeliner I'm going over that with a
black eye shadow and then of course I'm
going to line both of my inner water
lines moving onto the main focus of the
look which is the creepy dead like veins
I have on the bottom of my eyes
I'm taking a dark brown eyeliner and
lining my lower lash line then with a
smudging brush I'm smearing that down to
give more of a smudged out smoky look
then picking up that same golden brown
color wheeze before I'm using a
different brush to drag that down
creating kind of a gradient from my
lashline and then to make that demonised
red eye look I'm picking up a red shadow
and then dusting that from the brown
color down to the start of my cheekbone
for the veins I'm using this light
grayish eye pencil and basically all I
did was begin drying on veins and what
helped me do this in specific was
lightly pulling down on my cheek to make
a smooth surface from your eye because
your eye bunches up
when it gets closer so pulling down will
help you make the straight lines and for
the veins I just made jagged lines not
being precise at all making sure some of
the veins extended from each other and
just kept building around that I
to make the veins look a little bit more
realistic I wet an angled brush and went
over the lines that I had just created
basically what this does is it smudges
it and makes it look a little bit more
faint so it looks like it's coming out
of your skin instead of lines just on
your skin it kind of makes them kind of
push in a little bit more which is what
you want because you don't want it to
look like you have lines on your face
you want to just look like they're kind
of coming out scar like these veins that
are popping out when you show your face
but just play around with this until you
think you're satisfied with how it looks
and then lastly I went over the veins
with the leftover red and brown that was
on my brush from before but really the
trick to this look is just to keep
playing with it it doesn't have to be
for perfect but basically all I did was
I kept repeating the steps until I was
happy with it so I did the same thing
with the eyeliner in the angled brush
until I was satisfied with how the veins
looked to complete the eyes I put
mascara on my top and bottom lashes and
then added some individual lashes to the
outer corners of my eyes
you guys can totally add like full false
lashes but I just had leftover um
individual eyelashes so I just did that
for more of a dramatic look for my face
I applied concealer and foundation
before but as for contouring I chose to
stick with a dark brown for a sunken in
look if you want more of the traditional
vampire use white makeup and then gray
to contour for the face now moving on to
the lips I started by lining my lips
with a dark maroon lip liner and I just
basically line that I didn't even really
fill them in because the main point is
the lipstick so then I just filled it in
with a dark red lipstick just on the
center of my lips because on the outside
of my lips I am going to fill it in with
a black eyeliner this will make your
lips appear a bit darker and look more
blood like because it kind of has a
gradient to it and it just makes the red
look a little bit darker and spookier
and then to give that shiny wet look I
went over all of it with a lip gloss and
a lip brush this also helped blend
everything together and that's it for
the makeup I was really happy actually
how everything turned out I was really
really liking the veins I thought it
looked super spooky but yeah now let's
move on to the hair
okay so for the hair you really can do
anything you want because this is all
open to interpretation so I just decided
to curl my hair because I love curling
my hair so I did that with a one inch
curling iron from Hot Tools and then of
course teased both sides of my head and
the crown for some extra volume and then
I just brushed it through with my
fingers to give more of a relaxed look
because really the main point of this
look is your makeup so I want to didn't
want to take away from it at all and
then I decided for a little extra Flair
I decided to pin one side back and then
kind of gather it all to one side and
then finish with hairspray but like I
said you guys can do your hair however
you want or however you see fitting for
a vampire of course we can't forget the
things I picked these up at spirit
Halloween store they were about 20
dollars and basically all you do is
follow the instructions it's really
important that you do so because you
have to kind of mold them to your teeth
and then they fit really easily after
you do that they come in and out super
super easy and convenient perfect for
this costume so now moving on to the
outfit of course I wanted to wear
leather so I wore a leather jacket with
a lace tank top and some jeans and heels
this costume is super easy because you
can basically wear whatever you want the
whole point is the makeup and the fangs
but that's it for this tutorial I really
hope you guys enjoyed it tweet or
Facebook me pictures if you do this or
any of my tutorials and I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
