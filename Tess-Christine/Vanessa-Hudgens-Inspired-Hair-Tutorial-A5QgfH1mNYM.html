going to be another celebrity inspired
hair tutorial and I asked you guys all
on Twitter if you wanted me to continue
doing my celebrity inspired looks and
you all said yes so I will definitely
keep doing them the hair I decided to do
was her natural everyday hair if you
ever see her in a picture in a magazine
or if you google her any like anything
like that she's always having kind of
these natural-looking curls they're very
messy they're not perfect they're not
exact
I'm guessing it's her natural hair I'm
pretty sure almost positive it's her
natural hair I know a lot of people
really like that look and so when you
guys were commenting saying you wanted
to been asked the Hudgens inspired look
I was kind of assuming you wanted that
kind of hair if you are interested in
watching that just keep on watching let
me know what you think in the comments
below don't forget to request another
celebrity because I do listen to your
requests that's how I that's how I'd
make my videos is I listen to your
requests because I don't have time to
like think up up up all this stuff by
myself so you guys gotta help me so
comment below on what celebrity you want
to see next and I will see you guys next
time bye guys
to begin I am using just showered hair
you can use second day hair if you want
to as well it would work the same I'm
gonna start by sectioning my hair off
right by my ears I like to curl my hair
this way just so I know I'm getting
every piece of strand of hair curled and
I'm going to take the Conair infinity
one and wrap small sections around the
curling wand and I'm going to repeat
this process around my head but if you
notice I am wrapping it every other way
or direction so every time I pick up a
piece of hair I'm going to wrap it the
opposite way of this the way I curled
the strand before if that makes any
sense so I'll show you again on the
other side I'm going to take a section
of hair and wrap it one way and then the
next section the other way this will
just prevent the curls from sticking
together to create that messy look you
don't want the curls to kind of form
into one giant wave because that's how
not how Vanessa's hair is it looks more
natural so in this way the curls will
kind of fall in random places and look a
little bit more like it's your natural
hair so next I am just sectioning my
hair off again how often you section
your hair and
you section your hair off at all is
totally optional for you again I just
like to do it this way and I'm going to
repeat this every other curling process
throughout my entire head and it is
seriously just as simple as that also if
you want to you can change it up by
holding certain strands of hair on the
curling iron a little bit longer than
others this will just make the curls
even a little bit more uneven and make
them look a little bit more natural
instead of all you know the same
tightness and same strength if you get
what I'm saying so if you hold a certain
curl on the barrel a little bit longer
it'll be a tighter curl and then the
next strand of hair if you hold it a
little bit less it'll be a different
kind of sized curl so that'll also make
it a little look a little bit more
natural as well I did choose to tease
the crown of my head again this is
optional it just gives the look a little
bit more of a full effect and I am
finishing with hairspray just to keep
the look in place and then to change it
up a little bit I am going to take some
dry shampoo and spray that throughout
the sections of my hair this will just
give the curls a little bit more texture
and again give it more of the natural
look because it's separating the curls a
little bit more and that is the
completed look but before you go I do
have another quick bonus look for you
guys I decided to throw in another
signature Vanessa Hudgens everyday hair
style so I'm gonna do is section my hair
back just my bangs on each side and I'm
going to kind of pinch that in the back
middle of my head take a clip and place
it in or pin it back and there you go
you have another Vanessa Hudgens
everyday hairstyle I really really hope
you guys liked this video please let me
know what you think in the comments
below and I will see you guys next time
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
