it's test and today's video is going to
be a hair tutorial inspired by the
Victoria's Secret models and their hair
is always very big and with loose curls
and I love this look and I think it's
very fun and sexy you know for a night
look or something like that so I thought
I would show you my take on it I know
there are tons and tons of videos here
on YouTube showing you how to get
Victoria's Secret hair but I thought I
would show you my take on it and I
really hope you enjoy it so the products
you're gonna be using today are hair
spray
I'm a heat protectant and the heat
protectant I'm using is just the Chi 44
iron guard like usual but any heat
protectant will work and the hair spray
again I'm just using is the matrix's
ba-boom hair spray but again any hair
spray would work for this look and this
look actually requires two curling irons
and I like using two curling irons
because it gives your hair a bit of a
different kind of curl and with a little
bit more dimension and look two curling
irons I'm using they're both by Conair
and one is a con air one-inch I believe
and like on our two-inch and they're
quite a big size difference if you
notice and what I like to do with these
is curl my hair every other with using
different curling irons because this one
will give you more of a loose curl and
then this one will give you a tighter
curl and when they're mixed together it
gives your curls of a bit more dimension
and they don't all stick together so it
looks very big and fun and curly so
that's what I like to use and I really
hope you guys find this tutorial helpful
also just a warning throughout this
video I am my two roommates are sitting
in my room with me so I am talking to
them during this entire video so if you
see my mouth moving really fast or me
laughing or something that's what that's
all about but yeah let's get into the
video all right so the first thing
you're going to do is you're going to
section on
your hair I like to section mine a
little bit above my ears and just tie
that off then with a one-inch curling
iron you're just gonna start by curling
away from your face and then every other
piece of hair you're just gonna switch
curling iron so now I'm taking the 2
inch curling iron and I'm gonna curl
that piece I'm take fairly small pieces
of hair when you are curling not too
small but not too big either because
that'll affect how big and tight the
curl is so you're just gonna repeat this
every other process throughout that
layer of your hair next now take down
the next layer of hair and tie that off
and you're just gonna do the same thing
again I'm starting with the smaller
curling iron and switching it to the
larger one you can do whichever one you
want doesn't really matter and then
repeat this through that layer of your
hair too
all right and then spray that later all
right and then section it off again and
when sectioning of your hair you can
section it as many times as you want
depending on how thick your hair is I
section mine about three four times I
just do this so I can make sure I curl
every part of my hair but this is
optional you don't have to do this if
you don't want to there was like a
motorcycle I don't know if you guys
could hear that but it was really well
all right so now you're going to tease
your hair before you curl because you do
not want to mess up the curls by teasing
it afterwards so I'm just going to tease
it from the back to the front again you
can tease it however many layers you
want I am doing I think three and this
will just determine how big you want
your pouf Victoria's Secret models you
know I tend to have pretty big hair so I
would suggest the bigger the pouf of the
better and I'm teasing the sides of my
hair just to give it more volume to the
center part because sometimes the center
part can get a little flat for me
alright and now I'm just gonna curl it
again for my bangs I like to do the
technique of wrapping it around the
barrel just because it gives it more of
a flattering curl around your face to
frame it because when I wrap it around
the barrel you know it gives it an S
curl which frames my face a lot better
but if I clamp it sometimes it can get a
little too tight
kind of silly by your face but yeah just
repeat that every other step process on
this layer as well same thing for the
other side and all you're gonna do is
finish with hairspray and then take your
fingers and kind of mess up the curls a
little bit because you don't want them
to be too uniform because Victoria's
Secret hair is very messy and big then
finish that with hairspray again and now
I'm just gonna take a comb and kind of
tease little bits of my hair on don't go
too crazy with the teasing but I like to
do this because it makes my hair a
little bit bigger more volume and the
curls kind of you know more the lumps
shoes I guess that's what the back looks
like it's a very fun style and I really
hope you guys enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
