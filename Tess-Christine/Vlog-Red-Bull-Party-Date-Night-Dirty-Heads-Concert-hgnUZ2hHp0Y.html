weekly vlogs and I promised you guys on
Twitter well I asked you guys on Twitter
and like some YouTube comments as
getting or like start vlogging and I've
always wanted to but I've always been
super hesitant about it so I promised
you guys that I would attempt it so
that's exactly what I'm doing I'm going
to do like weekly vlogs so basically I'm
just gonna vlog like a week and put them
all together in one vlog just to see how
it goes and yeah and if you guys like it
if you guys like it I'll continue doing
it but I was super hesitant about this I
don't know why I'm just not used to
vlogging at all so it's going to take
some getting used to especially with
like my friends and stuff because like I
don't have a bunch of YouTube friends
like they don't really like understand I
mean they kind of do but so throwing a
camera in their face is going to be kind
of weird so hopefully it goes well I
guess this is why it's a learning
experience we'll see if it does well
okay so it's Monday and I figured that's
when I should probably start this weekly
vlog thing and I already forgot to vlog
but it's really not that late in the day
it's like morning mid-morning almost
afternoon ish but as you guys can tell
my room is not my room it is a server
room like just look at this so clearly
this is not my room and it's Patrick's
room and I didn't really tell you guys
about this because I was like I don't
know I didn't really like have any way
to tell you really but I moved in with
Patrick and his two roommates for the
summer because my lease with my three
girl roommates were was up and I didn't
want to sign a new lease because I
didn't know if I was going to stay in
Minnesota so I just moved with in with
him for the summer and then once fall
comes around I'll kind of figure out
like my own living situation so we'll
see and my parents are in the middle of
moving so I couldn't even really like go
home so I'm just in like this awkward
like living situation I said in my um so
I'm learning routine that I feel like
just from your girl because I'm
seriously living with three dudes like
it's crazy living with guys
versus I'm living with girl woohoo it's
done yes so exciting now I can upload it
so Patrick's out here listening to
schoolboy q rap music that's what he's
been doing this whole time but also what
did you do to your phone

iPhone so luckily our friend Mitch had
one so he's just transferring all of his
like phone data pretty happy guys onto
that iPhone now so he'll have a new one
really soon okay so I came back in here
to do an outfit of the day because isn't
