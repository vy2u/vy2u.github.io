and read at the airport unfortunately
because yes so technically it's not our
last day in San Diego yesterday was our
last day and see a beautiful day it's
our travel day home today which is the
long one because California to New York
takes forever my parents left this
morning their flight was that like 6
a.m. so we were sleeping so we said bye
to them last night so sad it's kind of a
tradition every March we go somewhere
with my family so this one was a fun one
because because it's because I'm just
stuttering we got to see my brother and
like where he lives and his girlfriend
and like what he likes to do in
restaurants that he got to take us to
that was really cool so yeah I'll take
you guys along with I never vlog at the
airport so I thought why not I have zero
idea how much footage I got over this
past week so let's go to the airport
we're gonna go a little bit early since
we have to check out of our B&amp;amp;B at 11:00
so we're gonna go get brown bagels okay
so we just got through security and look
who it is
step one
coffee
I ran out of chips the good news is I
brought my own
we're really early you've got like a
full little editing station we've got
some food
got about
an hour an hour left I was like grant
least until it boards
Boise
boarding house
are your cooperation
we're depleting
we are D flaming oh my god my leg
I guess there's the first time for
everything
first time I've ever gotten to playing
we decided to stay on a flight instead
of rebook it for tomorrow a.m. we're
gonna risk it so we don't bore it for
another two hours again so exciting I
think Pat is the only person in the
world that thinks this is exciting
he's actually skipping because he loves
airports that much very very confusing
so we're gonna go to the bar and get
some mimosas look who it is the after my
I keep progressively looking worse but
