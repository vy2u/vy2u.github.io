week and I'm very excited we've got a
lot of stuff going on again I'm coming
at you from California it's insane how
much we've been here lately but yeah
very exciting week because we are here
with revolve for revolve festival which
is my first time ever I'm very very
excited I feel very grateful because
they always go all out and I'm really
excited that I'm one of the bloggers
youtubers that they thought of to bring
so very exciting obviously we are like I
just said we are in California we're in
LA right now we have a few events here
before we head to Palm Springs bear with
me vlogging around new people is always
hard for me but I will hopefully make it
work we're here also with Alex and Dan
our favorite people so that'll be fun oh
hey you guys are super backlit let me
just do a little rotation look who it is
it's really windy today yeah we have
about a three hour bus ride I think it's
three hours but it'll be fun
we made it
so excited so I just finished getting
ready for tonight which is the Welcome
Dinner and we're supposed to wear the
brand LPA so that is where my skirt is
from I thought it was really fun
has flames on it and this top is just a
basic block tank and then booties are
tony bianco and then i have a jean
jacket because it's kind of chilly all
right
I think it's stable we are officially in
Palm Springs so look a little crazy
right now maybe wet hair but I just have
to finish through my hair I'm makeups
just about done
it's a side lip liner and the first
thing a-huntin today's agenda is a
brunch with house of Marlo which is what
I'm wearing this top boom so we have a
brunch the guys just went down to get
coffee cuz they're all he's the first
ones ready Alex I think is doing her
hair and makeup she's right next door
I'm really really excited this year to
be here with revolve we last year when
we were here we were only invited to the
parties we didn't actually get to stay
with them which was actually which was
fine we had so much fun
this is just such a different experience
because it's just way more us the Raval
festival you do things like brunch
dinners like for some perception parties
which is what we had last night which I
didn't vlog because those things are
always like meeting new people and I
never like to stick a lot cameras on
these days even though some of them are
youtubers but most of them are bloggers
so it's a little bit different but
something's going to be social and not
always be on social media so yeah but
today's really exciting because it's day
one of the festival I'm going to bring
you guys along so I'm gonna finish
getting ready so you can go down to eat
eat the whole coconut well obviously I'm
not group but not it's like chili powder
isn't really good know what's the view
of the watermelon first
it's a good contrast
no no here but it's good well I mean
you're like a little spring coat we're
all just kind of standing and they have
like little choppa type French stuff
walking around
I could never know I know look at it are
you kidding so pretty oh hi
Pat nice shave
john-boy is doing tattoos I'm tempted to
do my first tattoo only because they're
really tiny asian I would do like a
little heart there's like a little
selection that you can pick from I feel
like if I do a little heart it's going
to take two seconds I feel like it'll be
a good time would be a good test you're
gonna see also I feel like I can you
playing up in your book you're playing
it up in your mind a lot that it's gonna
hurt ya I feel like no tattoo sadly
because there was a list a very long
list that we were not on so we decided
we were gonna leave the party and go to
the festival festival we changed into
more festival outfits
obviously not swimsuits hats got his
Lanka sunglasses on we are going to see
a familiar face
hopefully you guys recognize them
it's a wild Brandon yes catching at my
best right now why cuz I've been out all
day long and just
day to PR at roville festival officially
they're like day party is Saturday and
Sunday it's already epic we're walking
through a tunnel there's a swing set
that's eating all of this coconut I
think is this your favorite food I asked
you a question as you stuff your mouth
that in a Hawaiian pizza they always go
all out for these parties they're so fun
there's so many things going on there's
a crazy car filled with a bunch of
flowers that I took a photo in a Malay
maze we're at the end you get so a love
that so we are basically just hanging
out here and maybe going to the festival
later there's a few bands I want to see
but it's at least nice and relaxing to
just hang out it's definitely a real
golf festival experience
so we're excited to kind of do it
differently this year we are going on a
jet plane it's not a jet plane are you
