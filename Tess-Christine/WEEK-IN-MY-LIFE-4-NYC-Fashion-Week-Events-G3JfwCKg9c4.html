in my life
excuse my messy hair I just got out of
the shower and did my makeup so I'm kind
of getting ready for the day but I
wanted to enjoy this video because today
or it's a really exciting week because
it's one fashion week but beginning of
the week my friend Alex came to visit
but alex is one of my oldest friends if
you guys have been following me for a
while when I started my youtube channel
like in the when I was in college she
was one of my apartment roommates and
I've known her since like middle school
she's one of my oldest friends loved her
so much so she came to visit and that
was super super fun we kind of just
walked around the city showed her a few
things she wanted to go to a rooftop bar
so we took her to a really cool one that
we actually haven't been to but it was
awesome and then after that we went to
go get food so tense tell me where are
we going for dinner pork
you look so you right now
oh my gosh a smelly table so no one goes
on it and we got to try dumplings for
the first time which I actually have not
tried soup dumplings before and they
were freaking delicious and now Patrick
and I have like a new obsession with
them
bro so then after dinner we took her to
one of our favorite spots it's called
the duplex it's a piano bar and you guys
have seen it on my ancestors Pat's
carries it's just one of our favorite
places it's so much fun
on Mondays and Thursdays they have this
like open mic night but what we really
like about it is people come around and
they sing and they get up there and like
request songs and we all kind of sing
along it's not like typical karaoke
where like I would get up there but if
you know how to sing you go up there and
it's really awesome we always have the
best time
smelly's leaving alright bye I'll miss
you so much I know
have fun in Minnesota
bye so today is a pretty boring day
because it's just normal stuff like
errands meaning grocery shopping and we
have to do laundry
I always forget to do this before we
start eating so sorry that I put it up
on you right as you take the biggest buy
yeah
I put the healthy stuff plumcots
chocolate chip these are really good
Julia if you're watching we stole a
bunch from you and now we're buying them
because they're really good
cauliflower crust will strong with
normal crust it cauliflower crust is
good have you ever had it I'm gonna get
it just to show you that it's good no
it's not gonna taste like cardboard
you'll be shy on the outside of the
package oh my god
these are awesome
not the groceries good
put the groceries away that happened
Patrick so yeah I remember I told you
guys before when we moved to our new
apartment we got a bigger space and it's
like got a lot more character as you can
see for less money but we gave up some
amenities one being having a laundry in
our unit even in the building so
sometimes we will send it out depending
on how much time we have it's similar in
price it's a little bit more expensive
it's the same place we go and do the
laundry but they'll just do it for you
when you pick it up so it's a little bit
more expensive
time is money type of thing so it just
depends on how you want to spend it but
for instance we have some few things
that we need wash ASAP so let's go we
usually have two of these it's only one
how did we not know that I googled it
Google Maps Det we found one that's open
only a few blocks away so
for fitzy just FYI
Oh China
you look so good for doing laundry like
what is this outfit
like who are you what era are you from
look at my dirty ass sneaks
so we just got to the YouTube space to
film with Pat and I've never used the
YouTube space before and I'm really
excited because why we're using it this
diner strap just broke so that's great
using a security badge clip yeah we
don't have a safety pin so or a sewing
kit this actually has never happened to
me before of all shooting I'm wearing a
cardigan all right Betty is ready with
makeshift safety pins and all
this is what I have to deal with back up
through me if I can wear outfits to do
all right
last look it is 7:40 we have until 8:30
to wrap so I think we've we're gonna get
there so around the last one and then
it's food time because we haven't really
eaten that all today I think this is my
favorite outfit by the way because this
jacket is my favorite and we're done all
right what's up guys so today is a super
exciting day and actually kind of a
nerve-wracking day I have a really busy
night so today I'm kind of just hanging
out getting some work done some emails
some video ideas figure it out because
Halloween is right around the corner so
I have a lot of stuff to do but tonight
I'm really excited because I'm speaking
at Li M it's a college here in New York
fashion college and I was actually asked
to come speak which is insane to me
because well for one I've never done
that before but - I'm like what could I
possibly talk about at a college but
then I'm like okay I get it they want to
ask me a lot of college questions and
how I got started on YouTube so I
thought it would be fun normally I don't
do that kind of stuff but I was like why
not step out of my comfort zone let's do
it you kill it on the social platform
like you know I don't like the words dog
might be sir about what we studied
abroad where did you go just study I
said I want finish that memory
and they have to take some British
history classes things like that so
before I do my little QA I'm going there
a little bit early so I can meet some of
you guys they kind of set it all up for
me where you guys kind of put in for a
meet and greet type of thing and then we
get to just hang out chats it take some
photos and then I have to speak which is
like nice because it's a QA there's in
the moderator so I don't have to worry
about like coming up with my own things
to talk about because I will be
terrified if that were the case
like I said YouTube is just constantly
changing it's very hard now I will say I
feel like the the people that started it
early on
I feel like now there's just so many
it's it's so much harder and I commend
everyone that does that tries that it
commits it's a whole other world
but honestly it's so cliche and I hate
it but you just have to really stay true
to what you want to do and be yourself
because you can get caught up in this
trends and things like that and what's
popular and what's what's used and
stupid and all that stuff and we've
really got to be careful because the
data just control your mind to next but
also yes
sure
you guys and then after that like
directly after that I have to get into a
car and go straight to 29 rooms which I
did last year if you follow me on
Instagram it's kind of like a photo
dream basically refinery29 puts on these
29 rooms they work with different brands
and they create these really fun
essentially photo rooms and you people
go there and you just take a bunch of
photos I think you have to get tickets
we're doing a night ahead of time
because I'm working with one of the
brands so we get to go there and kind of
see a preview of it before it's open to
the public which is going to be really
fun because Pat and I just like go photo
crazy in there and just take a bunch of
photos and do all the art installations
and basically take advantage of all of
it because it's like one big adult fun
house
okay

hello hello we meet again are you sick
of me yet I feel like this is gonna be a
really long blog so what I'm currently
doing is video stuff I'm editing
together this vlog a little bit and then
I am going through video ideas so you
guys know that I really do try to listen
to you and I also I take my time I don't
like to upload crap so it I'm not on the
main schedule so I take my time and I
really want to make my content great for
you guys so I really try to work hard on
that besides the point um I'm doing an
office lookbook I got a lot of comments
being like oh I wish I could wear this
day to day or wish I could wear those
outfits and then I'm kind of realizing
you guys are growing with me I had such
a young audience before but now you guys
are all in like high school and college
and have like real jobs and have to
dress a certain way for your job so I
was like that got me thinking all of my
friends have professional jobs like not
youtuber jobs and they all have to wear
certain things to work so I was like I
should do a lookbook and giving you guys
ideas so I'm starting to do that but why
I'm telling you about this now is
because I want you guys to leave in the
comments if you guys have a job like
that where you have a dress code or
something that you have to wear and what
you have to wear or what you like to
wear and I can kind of make outfits and
style it around there so I can know but
then besides that I'm going through my
Halloween videos and I have just about
all of my items ordered and ready to go
I'm not gonna spoil anything for my
Halloween videos but I'm really really
excited I hope you guys are too because
I love construction outside my door uh
but I love all my ideas so I'm really
excited to get going on that and
starting to film that so uh yeah that's
what I'm currently doing so you know and
update you
