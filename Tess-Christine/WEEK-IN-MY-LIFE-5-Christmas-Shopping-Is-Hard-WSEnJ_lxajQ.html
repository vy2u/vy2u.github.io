december sort of just one week because
over Christmas I'm going to Florida so I
thought it'd be really fun to take you
guys along to that but for the next two
weeks or one week two weeks we're gonna
be in New York so Christmas time in New
York is like the best time ever so why
not take you long on our adventures it's
a little bit later in the day as you
guys can tell from the light but we are
gonna go to Soho and hopefully do a
little Christmas shopping not my
favorite thing in the world but New
York's always decorated really cool so
tonight to play something
our videos
Sandro
it's much colder here and I don't know
why it feels colder but it does which
doesn't make any sense
like it there's your head I got it you
in it oh there we go okay sure I'm
letting Pat lead if you watched our last
video our trivia I'm not I'm not very
good that I usually just feel like I'm
always on my phone sometimes you

public who little timid so bear with me
[Laughter]

not him
I bought a lipstick underwear nothing
for anyone else yeah great off to a good
start oh you know just vintage shopping
oh it must be golden for some kind of
furry puffs that is cute it's a little
too maroon for my tastes
thanks so much for all the help
no I know I just
I suck at Christmas shopping this is
blocking me right now you can say hi oh
hi Michael I don't like it here are you
asking were you asking for Christmas
ideas I am well not ideas I kind of get
like an idea it's like palette yeah so
an idea which is like are you have to go

want is love so cool
do you feel better yeah okay so we just
got done eating at this really cute
restaurant put the name of it here

okay and now what we have to refill it
anyway
wow that was so artsy I'm really proud
of you for that beautiful shot no
underwear
back in Brooklyn so much quieter okay
angel you're so sweet
so we just made a quick stop at our
corner bodega where they have bodega
cats which is like such a thing in New
York we got some stuff that we needed
like milk and random stuff like that now
we're headed back we don't even have to
decorate our apartment building because
they did it for us
okay good morning guys welcome to
another day of a vlog currently what I
am doing is well first of all I'm all
ready for the day but what I have been
doing is I've been planning outfits for
a holiday party holiday I'm not really
sure what I'm going to title it I don't
really dress up like super fancy when I
go up to holiday parties so I wanted to
do something that was like true to me so
they're like cute well put together
outfits so I'll have to figure out what
I'm gonna call that but I'm gonna film
that later this week so you guys will
see that I think in this vlog room maybe
the next one because I'm doing like
three week in my lives so I can't really
keep it straight of when I'm all putting
everything in it but you guys will see
you when you do so you have to take out
all of those boxes Pat over here I'm so
close to finding this cafe but I don't
know the name of it so I'm using Google
Earth he's editing and location scouting
for a couple shoots yes coming up so
close unless this is it they're doing
construction over on the other apartment
there's like an apartment across from us
that they're renovating and so they
painted our door randomly I don't know
why that they did that cuz they love us
maybe I don't know but we had to be here
for it but now they're gone so we're
gonna go get coffee normally we'd make
coffee but there's this place by us that
has a really really good coffee and they
have homemade almond milk and it's so
good so we just have to spoil ourselves
sometimes so we're gonna go get back
oh thank you I can't be the only one
that gets ice coffee even when it's
still cold it just tastes different and
it could be the same drink it just
tastes different and I just can get
taste better
we are back chillin in our apartment now
I'm gonna go kind of still do some of
the like put together outfit things I
got to figure out shooting location for
my holiday party outfits and then plan
the rest of the week especially when I'm
gone and traveling for the holidays
because I want to have some content up
upload for you guys we're gonna go
either play with the puppy next or go to
Target so both good things cookie you're
gonna be such Adele
look at you
but Olli I really like
ooh I like that one that's the winner
nice and a little bit wider though wider
what do you mean what is no that's fine
this one had so much potential but as
with that text
almond milk creamer the best
I'm nursing so long so sweet so we just
got to care and Josh's play so you have
to beat Rome in their sweet little baby
hi sweetheart
ready go outside and play

part like the life of a dog

first snowfall I don't know what it is
but we woke up this morning Saturday we
were just gonna have a chill day I'm
going to start editing this vlog

and take advantage of the snow because
it's so pretty so I think Pat and I are
gonna go get brunch we're gonna make
breakfast but we're like no let's go out
play in the snow
take some fun photos and go eat I feel
like I always start my vlogs when I'm
like fully ready so I'm just showing you
what I'm doing now I put my hair in
braids because for one of my hair is
greasy but - it's snowing and I feel
like braids besides the Hat are pretty
snow proof they can't really mess up
your hair too much don't you know did
the braids but with this whole like PJ

that I filmed it get ready with me like
a week ago and that'll go up in a few
weeks I think but um just because I have
a different video schedule when I get

the best
besides the world that is great okay now
I'm gonna get on my pajamas and put on
something warmer I'm just wearing this
sweater from a while ago
this jacket which is from ASOS jeans
urban and some combat boots my favorite
thing about the snow is when it clings
to the trees it looks so pretty I'm
obsessed with it and you look pretty
cute too
we're back home obviously super cozy day
like our apartment with the snow I
frickin love it so before we go to our
friend Devin's for the dinner party
