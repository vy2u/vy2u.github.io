welcome to another week in my life as
you can tell it is Monday which means
it's a full-on work week for us we're
prepping for the holidays something some
videos see you guys will see us do all
of that we're gonna go out and shoot
some instagrams it's a little chilly but
it's kind of sunny which is good because
I love shooting in the Sun alright first
outfit ready to shoot it's actually a
really pleasant today we are going to
shoot a couple of these outfits for my
Instagram since I kind of play fashion
bloggers sometimes but I like to give
you guys ideas hopefully on a daily
basis on my Instagram even if they're
not being put in outfit videos so you
don't you're very inspiring what do you
mean I can't wait to buy those red shoes
okay Pat's making fun of you most of
that is just pretending to her but I
also do like putting together outfits
we are obviously back in our apartment
now and it's really dark in this kitchen
because our light bulbs up there burned
out so we have to call our seat back
tomorrow to get that fix Oh burn
literally cooking on the stove light so
you know good things but we're making
food packed on pine nut and sage duty
he's toasting those and you're kind of
an early dinner
we just got hungry really quick so we're
doing that now cue cooking
some of you know this some of you don't
know this but I hate mushrooms and
they're literally one of my favorite
things I usually try to leave them out
food is done really quick really easy so
that looks like gnocchi taste test
I literally dropped my very first bite
off to a good start
do you like it yeah and all the
mushrooms in there mmm
there's not that many plus he's putting
them on my guys all right so it's
morning early afternoon right now and it
is a complete full-on work day for us so
I'm trying to remember to blog as much
as I can I have so much to do I have to
I'm filming an entire holiday lookbook
video for you guys that I'm gonna edit
and upload hopefully in a day or two it
is kind of a gloomy day which does help
because I feel like when it's gloomy
cleaning and packing is something that
you would just normally do anyways at
least for me because you can't really go
outside it just doesn't feel right hi
Pat hi what's she doing Pat is also in
full swing he's helping me film but he's
also editing some photos he took four
what's your name Tessa Tessa Oh funny so
yeah he's doing that he's kind of
multitasking so busy day I just actually
ordered lunch so it kind of takes a
while usually we will well sometimes we
will order lunch if I don't have
anything quick to make just because we
want to keep the day moving in the
winter there's like no daylight
this one is super fancy well kind of I
think it's definitely more glam the
other one was more simple both are
awesome just for different occasions
which is kind of why I wanted to do this
video because they're all very very
different they're not all fancy they're
not all sparkly that has a new obsession
with Lacroix right Jack look fried the
sparkling waters they're pretty good but
he's taken the obsession to a whole new
level he drinks like so many of those
waters all right changed into something
more comfortable
lunch is here happy case you're curious
I don't know why you would be but maybe
you are what I got from sweet green I
got a root glove I do I always do like
the build your own just because I'm very
particular but I got arugula quinoa
Brussels sprouts sweet potatoes the
mushroom the Portobello mix the pesto
vinaigrette and corn oh and I think goat
cheese is in there which I love and Pat
I'm I just here's my food you don't get
any no he's going to lunch with Ryan
pretty casual everyday stuff all right
it's not like a weekend vlog but this is
what you guys wanted to see you so here
it is salad was bomb lunch break sadly
over we're back to shooting I'm
obviously in a much fancier outfit this
is one of my suggestions for a New
Year's Eve look which I love there's a
patch so we're not gonna waste any time
we're just going to get to shoot him you
only have two more looks left and
we finished filming and the perfect
amount of time because the Sun is
starting to go down so I was just kind
of chillin taking a little breather
before I go in and start editing which I
don't even know if I'm gonna do tonight
because I have so much cleaning and
holiday prep to do I know tomorrow Pat
and I and Minnie Ryan are gonna go to
Union Square to do some more Christmas
shopping because they have like a
holiday festival thing so that should be
a really fun
we also because I think I told you guys
in our last vlog since we are spending
Christmas apart this year we're going to
I'm going to Florida he's going back to
Minnesota we wanted to do something fun
and festive together so we thought we
would make and decorate Christmas
cookies sometime this week
alright I'm officially calling it quits
on organizing I got almost all the rooms
done as you saw so it's much better than
it was so I feel good about it
pretty hungry so I'm gonna make myself
some food it's cold outside it is a cold
one today so new day new blog what has
been doing this morning is just editing
super boring just on my computer just
editing that holiday video so I can have
it up soon for you guys and I was going
a little crazy inside of my apartment so
we decided to go and get some lunch so
we're gonna go do that now and then
later we're going to Union Square
finally I feel like all we've been doing
is working so it'll be nice to go see
some holidays sticking ways before
crossing the street
yeah do anything to say
I'm just in a very great mood I had my
Ida casting this afternoon I leave her
flight in the morning for my last job
for the Year Christmas vacation and I
get to go hug my mother and father week

said we were going to Union Square I
totally lied I'm not actually in New
Yorker at all and I didn't know where I
was going we're going to Bryant Park

ouch I'm keeping my right hand in his
bag oppressed cuz the fries come back a
little face on in them you found this a
really cute pottery place and Pat found
a picture
and hear me over this like angelic music
there are samboni mice and this was my
favorite thing as a kid when I would go
to my brother's hockey games because
it's just so satisfying
by Kari you're not gonna have time to
hug you miss your train
- huh
you can take it with us
new day new blog type hats that we
wanted to do some Christmas cookie
baking and redeem ourselves from last
year if you guys saw Pat and Tess in the
kitchen we failed at sugar cookie making
so we're gonna try it again because we
have cuts mom's recipe this year yay
remembered from my shopping list got
some decorations only thing we couldn't
find with Christmas cookie cutters which
sucks they're sold out everywhere so
we're just going to do circles and then
it'll just be more of a challenge when
we're decorating them to make them look
super Christmasy Christmas cookie making
in three two one
you just put the sugar cookie dough in
the fridge it's suppose to chill
literally we're gonna let it do that and
then we'll roll it out and start baking
it which is really quick and then you
get to decorate the best part timer is
off time to roll out the dough
Pat decided to put a square why because
the rest of them are circles and one of
them needs to stick we have the cookies
they're pretty much cool that leaves the
first one we're getting impatient so we
moved the cookie decorating station over
here more room you ready I'm ready
finished these are the final cookies Hey
and then these are all of our fails good
mystery okay it's much later since you
last saw me I was making cookies I did
my hair kind of got ready cuz Pat and I
went to dinner I'm back now and I just
started uploading some footage from this
vlog and it's getting a little long so I
thought I would end it here I really
hope you guys liked it this is a very
typical work week for us we always are
kind of filming and taking photos
everywhere so I'm glad you guys got a
peek into that part of our life and not
just the fun events and going out on
weekends but anyways I really hope you
guys have a great day sending all my
love and I will see you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
