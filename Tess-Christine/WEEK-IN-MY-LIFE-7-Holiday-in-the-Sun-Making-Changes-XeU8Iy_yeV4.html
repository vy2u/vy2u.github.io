antique vintage e shops before we go eat
and before I have to go to catch my
flight so found a pair of shoes that I
really like
this that makes me think of now and then
when she pours the lemonade so crazy
I hope you guys enjoyed that I had a lot
of fun in Florida even though I started
to get pretty sick towards the end but
all as well I wanted to quickly come on
here and talk about 2018 for my channel
because I'm very excited
only because at 2017 for me on YouTube
was pretty rough
you guys probably wouldn't have known it
because I've never really talked about
it but me mentally 2017 in regards to
YouTube was pretty challenging
I felt very kind of like defeated and
frustrated with my ideas and things I
was coming up with and I just kind of
was going through this like roller
coaster of all of 2017 only because the
YouTube has just changed and I know but
that is like such a broken record thing
I feel like everybody's talking about
that especially if they started you know
at least five years ago which is what I
when I started which is fine I'm not
gonna sit here and complain about how
much YouTube has changed but it
definitely intimidated me a lot because
what people are watching now is so
different from what it used to be and
that's really intimidating for somebody
like me who does beauty and fashion and
that kind of was a lot of YouTube for a
while and now people are kind of more
into like the drama channels and like
vlog channels and all of that and I want
to start vlogging more and I really have
been keeping up with this week in my
life which I'm really excited about but
I just wanted to come on here and say
that I just feel like ten times better
for 2018 I kind of had this like weird
realization on my youtube channel that I
just need to stop overthinking
everything in 2017 like I was just so
frustrated with my videos and thinking
like people weren't gonna like it and I
was constantly overthinking and I just
like wouldn't upload or like wouldn't
shoot videos because I was like this is
lame people aren't gonna like this
people are gonna you know and I don't
know why I was thinking that because
when I started I would just upload
whatever I liked and like whatever I
really enjoyed and now I feel like
everything is so like constructed and I
I don't want it to be that way I wanna I
want to just like be free to upload
whatever I want and if you guys don't
like it you know I want you guys to like
it but I also want to get back in my
mental state when I first started but I
just was uploading things I was really
excited about I want to do more of my
get the look videos I want to do more in
New York City guys and stuff like that
and I was kind of steering away from all
of that because YouTube is so different
now that I just like Panna
basically so I'm not gonna ramble on and
have this be like a whole rant I just
wanted to get you guys or give you guys
a little like understanding of where I
was at in 2017 so some of my youtube
goals for 2018 but I really hope I keep
up with is one do you get on more of a
consistent upload schedule I really want
to upload more for you guys and be
consistent a little bit more with my
videos I get very in my head about like
it's not perfect yet it doesn't look
right yet I can't upload it yet and then
I like wait but I just need to like get
it together and get that sorted and then
the second thing is I'm not gonna
overthink I'm gonna upload stuff that I
know you guys enjoy but I'm not gonna
stress about it if I change it up a bit
or I do something different or showing
you outfit that's like a little bit
different like I'm not gonna stress and
I really that's like my goal so I
thought I would share that with you guys
cuz you are my youtube channel and you
are my viewers and I feel like you have
a right to know especially where I'm at
and I know a lot of you guys were
stressed with the schedule let this last
year how I would like miss a week or
something like that and I hated that
just as much as you did so wanted to
give you guys that I really hope you
enjoy I'm really excited for 2018
especially on my channel it feels so
much better or so um yeah thank you guys
so much for watching I'm really excited
for what's to come and I can't wait for
you guys to see it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
