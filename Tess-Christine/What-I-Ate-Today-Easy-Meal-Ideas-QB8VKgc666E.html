what I ate today video and this has been
highly requested a lot of you guys want
me to do this again I think I did it
once before and I really like watching
these videos on YouTube because for one
you get new food ideas and I know
cooking for yourself can get like boring
after a while so you want like new ideas
so this is super cool so basically
you're unfamiliar with the video I just
go through a day of what I ate I show
you how I make it they're all super easy
they're healthier so that's awesome cuz
I know it's the time of year when you
want to eat a little bit healthier so I
hope this helps you guys out and yeah
let's get started okay so of course
starting off with breakfast which is my
favorite meal of the day I've been
loving acai bowls so I found these sa
berry blend packets from Whole Foods and
I put one of those in to a nutribullet
along with some frozen strawberries
frozen blueberries bananas peanut butter
and some cocoa powder and then I just
add a little soy milk or almond milk
just to help it out you don't want to
add too much like you'd be making a
smoothie you want it to be a little bit
thicker when you blend it so you can put
it into a bowl like so and then that's
basically it now this is the part where
you can have a little bit of fun with it
so I of course put some strawberries in
there and then also bananas you don't
have to get this fancy unless maybe you
plan on taking a photo of it but um for
the sake of this video I did it's just
good if you just throw it all in there
if you're in a hurry but I also put
granola and some cacao nibs in there for
a little extra crunch and then of course
I can have breakfast without coffee and
that's it moving on to lunch time one of
my favorite things lately to eat has
been a Brussels sprout salad so I start
off with a huge helping of mixed greens
this has spinach arugula sometimes it
just depends on what I get I can bad the
likes mixed green packets and those are
really good and then my favorite part is
I add some roasted Brussels sprouts
along with some pine nuts and some
Parmesan cheese and then I finish it off
with a balsamic dressing and it's like
my favorite thing I've been eating it
like crazy and then I have it with a
glass of ice water and it's like my
perfect lunch now I'm the queen of
snacking so one of my favorite snacks is
just the classic apples Pinot
butter and granola this is pretty
self-explanatory but this one is just
such a classic it's so good Patrick and
I usually share it and it's healthy for
you but it's seriously taste like a
dessert for snacks number two a little
later in the day either also now I've
gotten some nuts or some fruit or
something like that but if I went to the
gym or have a little bit more of a nap
today I'll make avocado toast just one
and it's just like the perfect little
snack so I'll mash up an avocado add
some lime juice a little salt a little
pepper and then I just toast some bread
and I basically just smear it all over
the place this is kind of
self-explanatory as well but this is a
great one I know this is kind of a
breakfast thing but I just think that
they're super good just have one ever
and then on top of it I put a little red
pepper flakes or chili flakes just for a
little added kick and then I love just
some like shredded or shredded shredded
Parmesan cheese and it tastes delicious
moving on to dinner this one is a
classic and it's chicken with Brussels
sprouts and potatoes so I start off with
some potatoes I wash them and then I cut
them in half and boil them until they're
soft tender and then I set them aside
while those are cooking I cut up some
sage some shallots and I wash and trim
two chicken breasts since Patrick and I
are both eating this and then i season
the chicken with just some table
seasoning super easy to just buy and
then I heat up a skillet with some olive
oil and I started cooking the chicken as
you would normally cook a chicken breast
um and then while those are cooking I
move over to another pan add a little
bit of oil and just a little bit of
butter because this is going to be like
the Brussels sprout potato mixture so I
add the shallots and I cook those until
they are golden brown so they're kind of
like caramelized and I obviously I do
all of this while the chicken is cooking
and then I take some Brussels sprouts
and I shape those down just because
they're a little bit easier to cook and
eat this way and I put those in with the
shallots once they're a little bit more
tender and I start cooking that until
it's pretty much done this is super
super easy so once those have like a
good start to them I'll add the cooked
potatoes that I set aside and basically
this is just going to kind of like cook
them up a little bit more and give them
that kind of like toasted coating which
is always so good
um so I cook that until golden-brown and
then basically you're ready to plate
super easy so I start off by plating
some of the Brussels sprouts and
potatoes and then of course I finish it
with the chicken breast and it's just so
good so easy Patrick and I love this one
but that's my video for today I really
hope you guys enjoyed it if you did and
want more of these type of videos then
just give it a thumbs up for me

you guys next week I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
