obviously as you guys can tell by the
title this is a skincare video and I'm
super excited to do this because I've
been meaning to do this for so long
about a few issuance ago I went through
some crazy skin changes and I'm about to
get into that really really soon and I
really wanted to make this video for you
guys cuz a lot of stuff has changed and
I wanted to share with you guys because
these are some things that really really
helped clear up my skin and make a huge
difference so if you're interested in
this video then of course just keep on
watching alright so I have to get in a
little bit of a background for you guys
because everybody's skin is so different
but I really want you guys to understand
my skin type and how it works and how it
has been in the past in my adolescent
teen years I guess middle school high
school I never had crazy breakouts I had
typical teenage breakouts which were
like you know pimples here and there
nothing too crazy well as you know if
you are a woman which I think most of
you here are that time of the month is
just the favorite isn't it my time of
the month
it came whenever it wanted to it wasn't
just like you know I'm gonna come you
know around this time during the month
it's like I'm gonna come whenever I want
to and you're gonna have to deal with me
and it was awful so after talking my
doctor about it she told me to go on
birth control pills because birth
control pills contain hormones that help
regulate your system so that's what I
did and I loved it it worked great for
me well in the fall I was experiencing
some health issues and I went to the
doctor about it and they after a while
they have come to the conclusion that my
birth control pills
we're causing these problems they told
me you need to get off these pills like
you cannot be taking these hormones
anymore your body's not reacting to it
well which happens for some people well
as you can imagine being on those pills
for five plus years my body was very
very used to it though when I went off
of it like boom so quick my hormone
levels just went crazy like I had the
most insane hormone imbalance ever and
with that comes breakouts my face was
just broken out I even got breakouts
like some places on my chest some places
on my back
I have never experienced this before in
my life some people have it way worse
than I did but for me and my body I had
never experienced that before so I was
breaking out like way more than usual
though I made some lifestyle changes and
I made some skincare changes that I
really want to share with you guys today
so it's taken me probably since around
Christmastime to really start making
changes um it took so long it was really
really frustrating because I try to
seriously every product Under the Sun it
felt like I was spending so much money
trying different products to try to
clear my skin when in the end I just
really had to be patient so like I said
I wanted to start with the root of the
problem which means I had to change some
lifestyle things so the first general
thing that I found the most common was
dairy I was like Oh home this is weird
so I did more research into it and
there's a lot of research involving
Dairy Milk and specific dairy products
in general as you guys know the leading
cause of my breakouts was because my
hormone imbalance well dairy milk has a
lot of hormones in it that are meant for
baby calves so it's meant for them to
grow big and strong but it can also make
your acne grow a lot crazier than you
probably want it to another thing that I
found is that dairy can lead to your
body producing excess sebum I think it's
called it's another word for oil
basically and I already had oil II skin
as it is and when I found this out I was
like hmm that could be it I just really
wanted to try it I don't want to do
anything crazy so I just cut out dairy
milk and I switched for almond milk I
really really believe that that's what
helped me um not all of the reasons but
I really think that that in itself was
kind of like a huge core to the problem
so I just did kind of baby steps I just
cut out milk and then just don't eat as
much cheese as I used to because I ate a
lot of cheese before this like I did
so if you haven't already tried that
maybe you should give it a try and it
might help you the next lifestyle change
that I made was I wanted to take some
sort of vitamin supplement because I
really like I said wanted to get to
court of the issue I cut out dairy milk
and I picked up some skin beauty and
wellness um
vitamins they're just vitamins they're
nothing crazy nothing prescribed or
anything like that I bought mine at
Target they're by the brand Nature Made
basically all they are is just
just little packs and they have two
pills in this one and two pills in this
one and they're just vitamins they're
now moving on to actual products that
I'm using there's two cleansers that I
want to recommend to you guys today I've
tried both of them out and I really do
love them both and I think they both
have held the first one is a clean and
clear advantage three and one
exfoliating cleanser this one's really
really good it has 5% benzoyl peroxide
acne medication which is really what
you're looking for my roommates actually
use this and they really really enjoy
this as well but then I also picked up
this one from Ulta it's Mario Badescu I
don't really know I read a lot of
reviews online on alte and a lot of
people were recommending this one they
said they really really liked it it's
just an acne facial cleanser this one's
a little bit more pricey than this one
so that's why I wanted to give you two
options in case you were interested
because they both have worked for me
moving on to a morning cleanser this is
just something that I use in the morning
those two that I just showed you are
strictly at night I love this one by
clean and clear
it's a morning bird skin brightening
facial scrub this has helped so much the
skin brightening formula and it really
really does help eliminate and fade the
appearance of your scars
my roommate Alex uses this and
absolutely loves it as well she used to
have really bad breakout breakouts in
high school and so she's been using this
for such a long time and she said it
really helped fade her scarring over
time moving on to toners I've narrowed
myself down to two toners that I really
really enjoy and that I think have
really helped brighten and make my skin
look a little bit more even and glowy
the first one you're going to recognize
from my nighttime routine this one
hasn't changed this one's the Michael
Todd blue-green algae antibacterial
toner love this stuff so much I use this
religiously every night but in the
morning I like to use a little bit of a
lighter toner nothing too intense so I
will use this one it's botanics rose
water toning spritz I bought this at
Target rose water is just really good
for your skin in general so the fact
that it has this in is a huge benefit
plus it's organic so it doesn't have any
crazy chemicals or anything like that
it's just all natural moving on to spot
treatments I have narrowed myself to two
again this one you're getting bored of
me talked about and that's the cleaning
clear advantage acne spot treatment I
stand by this wholeheartedly
I think it works amazing um I don't
think it works very well if you have
cystic or really deep pimples for just
you know raised pimples that are just
kind of there this will eliminate them
pretty much overnight now this next one
is probably my lifesaver I was so glad
when I found this it's by the same brand
as the cleanser and it's Mario Badescu
I'm just butchering that name probably
it's really really weird I'll show you a
close-up of it but it's basically got
some like pink fluid in the bottom and
then this like clear fluid on top um
basically all you have to do is stick a
q-tip in it until you reach the pink
stuff in the bottom and pull out you're
not supposed to shake it so you pull the
q-tip out and then you just dab it on
wherever your pimples are it's going to
leave something on your face you want to
do it at night it's a little bit more on
the pricier side so if you don't really
have a need for it and you don't have a
really really bad acne spots um you
probably don't need this you can
probably just stick to the cleaning
clear stuff which is a little bit more
inexpensive but this stuff is awesome
moving on to the repair step or like the
moisture and making your skin you know
not so dry the first thing I use is the
Dermalogica oil control lotion I use
this before I apply my makeup in the
morning this stuff is amazing mostly
because it's oil control so it really
helps eliminate the excess oil on your
face and throughout the day I don't get
a shiny it's really really good it's
moisturizing and it doesn't break me out
which is awesome this is my Dermalogica
and you can get it at Ulta the next
thing is for any of you guys suffering
from body breakouts
those aren't awful it sucks I found two
products that I think really really
helped the first is the Neutrogena body
clear body scrub I put this on a loofah
with a stick so you can get anywhere you
so please wherever your breakouts are
it's made with silicic acid which is
perfect for an acne treatment it's a
little bit stronger than the stuff for
your face because your body has a little
bit tougher skin so you're going to need
something that's directly um made for
body breakouts the next is for a little
bit more serious of breakouts this is
Murad clarifying body spray this stuff
is so awesome because it's just a spray
and it's a twisty nozzle so you can
pretty much move it anywhere it'll spray
wherever you want this stuff is made
with lookit solicit acid as well it's
super super awesome this stuff works
great it's really easy to use lastly I
just want to share with you some things
with my makeup that I really noticed
have helped my
again I used to use a foundation brush
but that carries a lot of bacteria in it
and I noticed that was that was probably
another reason for my breakouts so I got
a Beautyblender sponge I love this so
much what's great about it and
specifically is that you have to wet it
every time you use it which means it's
super handy to clean brushes take a
little bit longer because you have to
let them dry they're not as convenient
to wash I just used this so it's a
little dirty but you just clean out all
the makeup and it really helps because
it doesn't hold as much bacteria as a
foundation brush would so yeah that's my
skincare routine I guess essentials
things that helped clear my skin I
really really hope this video was
beneficial for you guys I really wanted
to make it for you because I underwent
some serious changes with my skin and so
I thought it would really help you guys
if I shared some of my trials and things
that really work for me give me a thumbs
up if you want to see a new nighttime
routine and yeah I will see you guys in
my next video love you guys so much I'm
still like chewing out there doing why
this is not going well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
