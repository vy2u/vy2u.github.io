is going to be an updated what's in my
bag video and I think my last what's in
my bag video was erm like my first one
was probably one of my first videos I
ever did so I figured I was kind of
doing for a new one plus a lot of the
stuff has changed not all of it but most
of it has changed so I thought it would
make a new one for you guys start out
this is my bag it looks like this oh if
I can get it all in the frame for you
guys it looks like this I purchased it
at t.j.maxx it is a Steve Madden bag but
again I didn't purchase it from the
Steve Madden store I purchase it
purchased it at t.j.maxx it looks like
this it's black obviously on both of the
sides it has these gold studs now it has
gold hardware gold detailing around the
whole entire purse here it has studs on
this side and on this side and then it
has a buckle that kind of gathers that
together right here initially the front
it has two buckles right here it has
like a flap that opens right here and
then obviously the handle right here and
then it has a really long one that looks
like this and this is how I usually wear
it on my shoulder like this I never
really used the handle all that much
just because I just like using the other
strap better but it snaps in the front
right here and then it also has a zipper
which is why I really like it just
because I like my person to have the
first I just think it keeps everything
in there really easily and it has these
two main pockets and then the big pocket
in the middle these two pockets I just
keep like things that I need to access a
lot which would be my phone so that's
all I usually keep in one of these or
like my keys sometimes I'll keep in here
or anything that I'm hanging on to I
will just like put in here right away
because then this can stay zipped and
then I can just like reach right into
here and grab it really cool and this
other one another thing when I've gone
I'm using right now is orbit the green
one delicious what else do I have in
here movie ticket for Hunger Games which
I just recently saw and I really liked
it if you watch or follow me on Twitter
you'll know that I really enjoyed that
on your games I never read the books but
I absolutely loved them okay so that's
it for these two little pockets right
here nothing really special at all now
I'm gonna dive into the middle here and
just a warning sign in say this in the
beginning but I literally have not
touched this in so long I bought this
purse in the summer yeah right in the
summer like right August right before I
left for England so this is the purse
that I brought while I was there and I
literally have not like cleaned out much
at all so I mean there's probably not a
ton in there but just so you know stuff
might be kind of outdated
who knows I'll start with like the
little side pockets and then go into
like the main part so first I have
travel oh and you guys have probably
seen these on YouTube for awhile now
because that's how I discovered them so
I feel like they've been around YouTube
for awhile but if you're unaware of what
a travel is is basically a travel
perfume holder if that makes sense but
it's not just limited to one perfume you
can interchange it with a bunch of your
other perfumes so basically it's just
kind of a little device that holds
different perfumes like like right now
in there I have the Taylor Swift perfume
and it's a really really neat thing I
really like this a lot and I saw them
all over YouTube and I never gotten one
and then I finally got around to getting
one because I thought they would be
really handy in traveling and that's why
I keep it in my purse because I don't
know but like my big bulky perfumes I
don't want to just like have that in my
purse or like when I travel somewhere I
don't really want to like take a huge
bottle of perfume and like risk it
spilling or breaking or something like
that so this is super handy and this is
what mine looks like it is pink I got
this is the XL travel oh and you can get
a whole bunch of different colors they
have a wide variety of colors so there's
a bunch you can choose from and if you
guys have felt watching my videos for a
while or watched any of my vlogs you
know that I went to Florida and I
brought this to Florida with me and Alex
and I shared it the girl that I went
with my roommate to Florida with and we
both shared it and we'd filled it up all
the way and it lasted us the
we can we still had extra left so it has
a ton of sprays in it last for both of
us and I also found out that travel is
doing a really really cool contest on
their Facebook page so if you want to or
if you're interested in purchasing in
this but you didn't really want to buy
it or something like that you can enter
to win a free one of these on their
Facebook page if you just go like it and
tell them who sent you and then you can
be entered to win and they'll randomly
pick ten people ten fans to win for
those of you guys who aren't aware of
like what this is even at all I will
have a demonstration at the end of this
video because I think it's a really cool
thing and I just want to show you guys
how to use it I think I have is hand
sanitizer and this is probably my
favorite hand sanitizer ever I love it
it is the Japanese cherry blossom I just
really like this kind just because it
smells really good and it doesn't smell
super strong or like very alcohol II if
you know what I'm say at Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works case you're interested in I love
it the next thing in this little pocket
I'd have is makeup and I have first
thing is the Studio Fix Mac face powder
and the color I am in is NC 40 this
stuff is old this stuff has lasted me
for like a year or something now it's a
little bit too dark for my skin right
now but in the summer it's perfect it's
basically just like a face powder I keep
it in there just in case I need any sort
of touch-ups throughout the day or
something like that it's just always
good to have something like that in your
purse and then the next thing I have is
my all-time favorite lip gloss I keep
this thing with me at all times just
because I love it it's so amazing you
guys have heard me rant and rave about
this for such a long time now but it is
the Korres lip gloss and light pink
numbers 11 but it's light pink it all
says say when you go to buy it but I got
this at Sephora I can't remember the
price off the top of my head but this
has been repurchase multiple times I
absolutely love this stuff
now for the middle like the huge middle
part I guess I'll just start with my
wallet because that's just the biggest
thing in there right now this is what my
wallet looks like I got this at t.j.maxx
- it is basically like maroon colored
woven kind of leather material thank you
this was like ten dollars five ten
dollars at t.j.maxx oh it was really
cheap I like it cuz it's big and very
really sturdy which I like because
um it just holds a lot of stuff and I
had this for a while now again I got
this like around the same time I got the
purse so side it's just separated into a
bunch of stuff so oh my gosh this is
gonna be forever I guess I'll go through
a little bit of it not all of it but um
I'll go through a little bit this
seriously oh my gosh this is how long I
have cleaned i have not cleaned out my
wallet since so long and this will just
prove look at this you guys
I have pounds and euros in my wallet
stuff like this is useless to me I don't
I don't understand why I have this in
here literally I have not touched this
this is probably a bad idea to go
through all this because it would
literally take like half an hour to show
you everything but okay so I have pounds
and euros you know in case they ever
start taking those in America please I
have two dollars in American money so I
have more pounds and euros in my wallet
than I do money that is actually useable
here which doesn't really make sense but
whatever next
I have oh my gosh a ton of receipts oh
what's this for
receipt for pizza my roommates and I got
pizza the other day so I have a receipt
for that I have my credit cards which
it's not that exciting I have a receipt
for a movie which I'm guessing is
probably the Hunger Games because I
haven't that's like the only movie I've
been to in a while um what else do I
have in one side in like this side I'll
pull out some pull out some of the cards
I have a Sally's Beauty Supply Beauty
Club member card it's in like a little
keychain thing but I just keep it in my
wallet um
next I have an Ulta card yeah the club
at Ulta card I don't know
I have okay I have a lot of my G's
okay I have a Costa Coffee Club and we
don't even have a Costa in America but
they have costa's in the UK and that's
what this is from where I was staying in
England they had a Costa like right
around the corner so we went there all
the time so I have like a Costa Club I
don't even think these like things
expire so maybe I'll keep it in case I
ever go back I don't know but anyways I
have that in there and then I have my 16
to 25 real card basically what this is
if you don't know this is just like a
rail car do you use like a discount
student rail card if you want to take
the trains anywhere in England I mean
it's useless for me here but um yeah I
use this all the time when I was in
England because trains are just a
necessity to take over there it's so
easy I love it i wish we had a train
system like them over there just because
it was just so easy to just like get up
and go somewhere if you wanted to on a
train so i liked that a lot I have like
my international student identity card
and I can't really show you the face of
this because it has a lot of my
information on it but basically I just
carried this thing around when I was
abroad in England or just traveling
around Europe or anywhere that kind of
says like Who I am and why I'm there
like it just says that I'm a student and
how long I'm gonna be in that country
for that kind of stuff so yeah have that
in there what else do I have all right
other side I have my driver's license I
still have my permit from when I was
like 15 which is just funny to like
compare the two pictures cuz I'm a hot
mess in the first one like 15 also I
have I have a Delta SkyMiles card
not that I fly all that much but
ya have that in there alright not all of
these cards I have a triple-a card which
is like in case you ever get an
emergency when you're driving on the
road or something like that it's good to
have a triple-a or some sort of
insurance it's basically just like a
help line if you ever need help on the
side of the road so I have that I have
two gas cards for holiday gas station
what else do I have I have another
Sally's Beauty card it's the same one
it's just a bigger version like more of
like a credit card looking version I
have two hair salon cards like you know
when you go to like a hair salon and the
hair staffs gives you her card I have
two of those but these are really old
because I don't even remember who these
people are so they're kind of useless to
me now I have a Panera card which I
don't really know what this does if you
guys know what this does like I've never
used it I'm guessing it's just like a
points card it just says my Panera
membercard but they've never asked me
for it
like when I go purchase food so I guess
I'm just kind of confused by it I don't
really use this at all but I have it
there I have Gloria Jean's which is
another coffee place I have like a punch
card to there I have a caribou coffee
punch card I have so many coffee cards I
have a buckle primo card I have like
thirty dollars left until I get a
discount on something I don't know I've
had this for awhile I have a Sephora
Beauty Insider card and then I have like
my health insurance cards in here too so
yeah that's pretty much it as for all I
have like my student ID from when I was
in England but I can't show you that
either has it has stuff on it but it
just says I'm a student and like yeah I
understand feel like I should clean out
my wallet I have all this useless stuff
like pounds and England things in there
that I have no use for anymore
he's our next so my keys nothing too
exciting on here I have my car keys
I have my house keys and my room key
like my house here
in my like college town or ever I have a
key to the front door or like a main
door and then I have a key to my room
because all of our rooms are
individually locked because that's how
they like lease them it's weird but yeah
that's what that's for
I have that Panera thing on here again
and I have a Gold's Gym membership card
yeah nothing too exciting on that oh
what's next I have an EOS lip-balm this
is the melon one this one actually is
pretty new I think I just like put this
in here a couple days ago it smells
really good I like the smell that I used
to like only like the pink and the mint
one but I really like the melon one a
lot thing I have is a nutrigrain wrapper
this what it looks like
this is the strawberry one I always
usually have food in my prayers most of
the time I do I have hair tie and bobby
pins floating around all on the bottom
of my purse like crazy I also have cough
drops because a while back like during
the winter well I got kind of sick for a
while like a month it lasted I had this
terrible cough so these were floating
around everywhere if not in my purse in
my backpack
something like that they were everywhere
so these are like the lemon honey ones
Hull's by Howells yeah tastes really
good okay the next thing I have are
sunglasses and there's stuff all over
these which is kind of nasty but these
are just Ray Ban sunglasses I wore these
a lot in my vlog videos and a lot of you
guys were asking me about them and I'm
like tweeting me like asking me the
style name and stuff this is what they
look like I can't remember the style
number of these because I got these a
while ago but um they're just like the
basic Ray Ban aviators they're not
polarized just because I didn't want to
spend like the extra money to get them
Polaroids but um yeah so they're just
like they're regular aviators I'm pretty
sure I got them in like the larger size
so yeah I wish I could tell you the
exact style number but I seriously have
no idea so I got this so they look like
a lot of you guys are asking so alright
next thing I have and I'm pretty sure
the last thing
make sure yeah if this is the last thing
I have is a camera and this is the
camera that I have in my purse I'm not a
huge fan of this camera actually the one
I film on obviously I like better but
this is kind of just like my travel with
me camera I just really don't know how I
feel about this it's the nikon coolpix
umm nikon coolpix s4 100 looks like this
it's like a really pretty maroon color I
really liked it and it has a touchscreen
on the back and then just like basic
buttons right here but I really hate the
touchscreen you have to like really push
down hard and I really don't like that I
just think it's really weird and it has
like a weird grainy scent like when you
take a picture and you look at it on the
viewfinder it has a grainy look to it so
I always think it's blurry so I always
take like have to retake the picture
until I put it on the kick put it on my
computer and then it looks totally fine
so like the view or the screen like the
viewfinder screen or whatever is really
bad quality I just don't like that at
all
but this is the camera that I have I got
it a while ago but I mean it works and
it takes good pictures like once you
actually put it on the computer I like
it but just initially looking at it on
the screen I don't like it at all but
yeah that is it for everything in my
purse there's literally nothing left in
here like a few pennies and stuff at the
bottom but that is everything that's in
this thing like I said in the beginning
of the video I was going to show you
guys a quick travel demonstration just
to show you guys how it works so if
you're interested in that please keep on
watching now again this is what the
travel looks like it kind of looks like
a little bullet and on the top this
comes off and then just has like a
normal spray pump right there
on the bottom of the travel oh it has
this clear opening right there and that
is what you put on top of your perfume
bottle so for instance I have the Taylor
Swift wonderstruck perfume so I will
take my Taylor Swift wonderstruck
perfume like this and as you can tell I
mean travel wise this obviously would be
more ideal than this how do I do this
basically it's you take off obviously
the main campus and then you'll see like
a normal perfume spray bottle thing in
most in all perfumes it you'll be able
to take off the cap like like this
and you'll see this like clear a little
white thing now don't worry you didn't
just break it I know I was kind of
initially like oh my gosh I don't want
to break my nice perfumes but they're
supposed to come off it works that way
so don't freak out don't lose this
though for the second that you used to
fill this so I'm gonna set that there
and then you take your travel and you're
going to put it directly on top of this
white pump so all you're gonna do is
stick it on top and you're just gonna
push down like you're spraying the
perfume so I'm gonna do is do this and
you're just gonna keep pushing down
until it's however full you want and
there's a little clear viewfinder here
for you that shows you helpful the
perfume is now mine is pretty full
already but I can show you a couple more
pumps hold where really all you do is
just set it on top and push down and
it'll go inside and so once you're
finished all you're gonna do is take it
off like this so and that's it you don't
have to worry about that it won't come
off the bottom of this so you don't have
to worry about that it's all sturdy and
everything like that now you have this
and you're like okay now what do I do so
once this is done you can just throw
this in your purse and go super easy to
get your perfume back to normal all
you're gonna do is take that cap that
you have and push it back on and it
might spray like that it always does
that for me every time I flip this cap
back on it always sprays but yeah that
is the video for today I really really
hope you guys enjoyed this updated
what's in my bag video I hope you're all
are having a wonderful day and I will
see you guys next time bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
