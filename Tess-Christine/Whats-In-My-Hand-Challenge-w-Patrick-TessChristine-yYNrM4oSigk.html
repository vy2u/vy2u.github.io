hilarious so I'm really excited to do it
basically what it is is we each have
five items I don't know there's probably
different numbers going around but we
went to five and one person is
blindfolded and then you put whatever
object that is in that person's hand and
they have to guess it and it's really
fun okay so you do you want to be
blindfolded right now you're gonna go
first
I'm gonna be one okay I went first I
look on the PI video you're gonna go
