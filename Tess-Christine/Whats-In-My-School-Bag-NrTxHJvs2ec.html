is going to be the start of my back to
school series and I am like shocked I'm
like back to school already seriously
and I saw commercials and I got a lot of
comments from you guys asking me to do
back-to-school stuff and I was like no
I'm still in summer mode but I figured I
might as well do a back to school series
because now is the time where people
start shopping for back-to-school and
all that sorts of stuff so today's video
is going to be what's in my school bag
and as you guys know I do go to college
and so it is a little bit different than
high school we're in high school you'd
go to class from 7:30 to 3:00 every day
and you'd have you just be in school
going to classes constantly in college
my classes were a little bit more spaced
out so I'd have a class maybe from 9 to
10 in the morning and then I'd have a
class at noon to 1:00 or something and
then I'd have a class at like 4 so I
have all these breaks so I never really
had to bring that much stuff to class
but I figured I might as well do one for
a lot of you guys going into middle
school or high school or that sorts of
stuff because I do remember what I kept
in my school bag for that sort for those
years so I thought I would show you what
I kept in my school bag and some of this
stuff is still the same that I used for
college like my backpack and everything
like that but um and things that I
actually keep in my bag but I wouldn't
normally keep this much stuff in my
school bag for college but in high
school I did so I will show you what I
kept in my bag this is my bag it's well
bag backpack my backpack uh-huh it's a
North Face backpack and I got it at
Scheels it's a sporting goods store so
um but I know they sell backpacks pretty
much anywhere I'll just show you what's
in my first pocket like the biggest one
and that is this big notebook and this
was what I used this past semester for
school and this is my favorite notebook
because it has all these folders and so
I can keep kind of organize my thing by
class and I know that this works out
perfectly for me i know--let's
teachers require you to get a notebook
and a folder for each class and that is
totally you can do that sometimes you
have to do that I remember having to do
that too
but some teachers allow you to do this
where it's a giant notebook and then it
has paper and then it has a folder and
you keep for like each class this was
perfect because it kept me really
organized and this is just the five star
I think this is the five subject
notebook and you can get I got mine at
Target you can get these pretty much
anywhere then another thing I have is my
planner my trusty planner that I
seriously rely on daily for this during
school
it's a planner basically it just I mean
it's self-explanatory what a planner
does I mean it has the planner I got was
from Target and it comes in this cool
little leather Kate or not.let it's not
real leather but it's like a leather
kind of material case what I really
really like about it is it has the
layout of a whole month and then you
flip the page and it goes by like day so
then you can write down what your
assignments are for your day then and
then at the bottom it has it has a spot
for like notes you can see that it has
so like how its set up is so it'll say
Monday and then it'll have like what's
going on that day and then you can write
your to-do list there I would definitely
recommend all of you guys going out and
getting a planner because they're really
handy to have it keeps you very
organized and you don't forget
assignments that dreaded thing coming to
class thought your homework done was
like my biggest fear in high school
because teachers get on you for that so
um I definitely would recommend some
sort of planner but that is all I keep
in my main one and then I also keep my
book so if I have math class I'll put my
math book in there but obviously I don't
need to like show you those because
you'd have your own books for the class
and that's what I keep in there then my
next pocket which is like the middle one
I keep my pencils and my pens that sorts
of stuff it's pretty self-explanatory
pens pencils and then I keep a sharpie
and I keep highlighters I don't have a
highlighters in here for some reason but
I always
highlighters again you can get those at
any office supply store target carries
them but also I keep our tissues and
these are a must have especially in the
winter months because at least where I
live because when it snows it's freezing
outside and then you walk inside and
it's heated right and your body goes and
so then your nose just starts running
because it was from the cold to the hot
it just all starts running so tissues
our serious must-have for the sniffles
in the winter month next thing I keep in
my bag
is my calculator for math class
it's a graphing calculator it was the
one that was required for us for those
interested it's the ti-83 plus I don't
know usually and especially in high
school if you're taking a math class
that needs a graphing calculator your
teacher or the class name will tell you
what kind of calculator you need to get
for that class again they sell these
everywhere everywhere during
back-to-school season
I keep gum aways gum but this is
seriously um gum I remember this in high
school every time I would have gum in my
bag and I would like pull it out to take
a piece like ten people would be like
hey can I have a piece of gum and you're
like sure and then you give out all your
gum and so literally you go through like
a pack a week which is ridiculous so if
you're gonna keep gum in your bag make
it secretive when you grab a piece
unless you want to share it's kind of
funny to me I don't know anyways so I
keep coming there because I always like
gum especially after lunch and all that
stuff whenever you just want gum or if
you're bored I used to chew gum when I
got bored in class and it helped a
little kinda sometimes I don't know um
the next thing I keep in my bag is my
iPod and I keep this in my bag because I
use it when I walk to class my class was
certain classes were like four or five
blocks away from my apartment so I don't
know it's kind of nice to listen to
music if you're walking alone it's kind
of nice to listen to music everyone's
and then what else do I keep in here I
keep an umbrella because this is a
really ugly umbrella it's like grey and
disgusting but I do keep an umbrella
because especially when I'm walking to
class if it rains
I don't have a hood or a jacket or
something an umbrella is a serious
must-have for me so I don't get wet the
next thing that I keep in my bag is a
makeup bag and this is an awful of
makeup I do keep it's full of other
stuff that I'll show you in a second but
I keep this in there because it's so
nice to have especially as a girl to
just kind of have a little bag that has
kind of everything you need for like I
don't know touch-ups I don't know
emergencies that sort of thing um this
bag is so cute I got it at Target and I
absolutely love this it's like a
brownish color I love this makeup bag
and this is what it looks like inside
it's got two zippers and I'll kind of
just like go quickly with what I keep in
here so if you guys are looking for
ideas or something or what I most likely
used in high school and what I needed at
all times that's what this was so the
first thing I keep are these Colgate
whisks and these are good to have I keep
these in my purse as well but I don't
usually carry my purse to school I just
have everything in my backpack but um so
I do have an extra one of these in my
backpack because these are especially
nice after you just eat lunch or
something like that and if you eat
something like crazy that makes your
breath smell or something or you have
food stuck in your teeth these are so
nice to have to quickly use before you
go to your next class um the next thing
I have is hand sanitizer and this is
always just good to have especially if I
don't know whenever you feel like you
need hand sanitizer it's just good to
have I always use this like after lunch
or something it's a hand sanitizer is
always good to have everywhere your
purse your backpack your that I don't
even know but broom it's just good to
have and the hand sanitizer that I have
is just from Bath and Body Works it's my
favorite hand sanitizer scent it's the
Japanese cherry blossom I love it and I
believe it was like a dollar next thing
I have our oil blotting sheets and me
seriously saved my life I always use
these when I went to the bathroom or
something because as you know I have
fairly oily skin so um every time I went
to the bathroom I'd just use one of
these and it helped out a ton so I keep
that in there as well I also keep an
eyelash curler and a tweezers and some
eyeliner because eyeliner is always good
to touch up because eyeliner tends to
come off during the day especially when
it's on your waterline and then a
tweezers is always good to have
especially if you like in your
rushon morning and like forgot to like
pluck your eyebrows or something and
then you see like a giant thick hair in
your brow and you're like you that's
disgusting you can like quickly pluck it
and it's totally cool so I loved having
these and then an eyelash curler because
these just always just brighten up your
eyes in case you um cuz I don't you like
I don't wear a ton of makeup to school
all the time so like especially mascara
so if you want to just like curl your
eyelashes and make them you know
brighter kind of give the effect that
you are wearing mascara eyelash curlers
are really nice to have because it's
because they'll clear curl your
eyelashes even without mascara and then
on the other side I have some makeup I
have just a matte compact makeup it's
just powder to foundation this is just
good to have to touch up any foundation
mess ups or anything like that during
the day if your foundation were to come
off and you want to fix it a compact is
really really good to have I also keep a
bunch of lip thing lip products in here
I keep a chapstick this is just a soft
lips
chapstick that I have that I really like
and then I keep lipgloss em in there as
well and I'm lipgloss is just always
really good to have and I also have an
extra elf conditioning lip balm because
this acts to me as like chapstick and
lip gloss at the same time so it's like
perfect and that's why I really really
like this stuff so I keep that in there
as well and that is it for my school
makeup bag and the next thing I keep in
my bag are some sort of snacks and I
used to get so hungry in high school
like seriously I used to be like
starving because you'd eat breakfast
like super early in the morning and then
you'd have to wait so long to eat lunch
and so there's always one period in
specific that I would get so hungry and
so I have to keep some sort of like
granola bar in my purse so what I loved
to keep in my school bag were these
granola bars this one I ate all the time
during high school was the Nature Valley
peanut butter which is my favorite
favorite flavor and I love this granola
bar it's a bit messy though but it was
delicious and I also like to keep a
cliff
Clif Bar and chocolate chips not my
favorite I like the peanut butter ones
better but Clif bars are really good to
have
because they give you energy they're
energy bars and they fill you up really
easily and they give you kind of what
you need in your stomach when you're
hungry so these are these both we're
really really good to have in my bag and
I still keep this stuff even in my purse
if I'm going to class to having some
sort of a granola bar in your purse is
just a purse or school bag it's just
good to have in case you ever get hungry
and the last final thing that I keep in
my school bag is a water bottle and
obviously this isn't full but I did keep
a water bottle on that nifty little side
pouch that backpacks have in case you
ever get thirsty it's nice to have
especially if you're eating those
granola bars you're gonna get thirsty so
instead of leaving class or instead of
going to a drinking fountain like if
your high school is anything like my
high school our drinking fountains like
we're not very good there's only like
two drinking fountains that everybody
knew we're just like the best drinking
pounds that were like the coldest
whatever and I remember always being
like super thirsty and that drinking
pump was like the furthest away from my
class I never could get there
water bottles are always just handy to
have because water is so good for you
and if you like read how much water
you're supposed to drink a day it's
crazy like I can't even get that much
water in a day if I unless I'm like
trying to get that much water in the day
because I always forget to drink water
you know but yeah that is all I keep in
my chesty school bag I really hope you
guys found this video helpful and found
some ideas to add to your school bag
that I found were really helpful when I
was going to school this is only my
first part of my video I'm gonna do hair
makeup and fashion as well because it
was highly requested from all of you so
of course I'm gonna do it and yeah that
should be coming up soon I don't know if
they're all gonna be in a row or what
I'm gonna do with that but they should
all be up in the next couple of weeks
because it is back-to-school season now
which is just crazy I don't like it I
want it to be summer but yeah so again I
really hope you guys like this video and
until my next video
bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
