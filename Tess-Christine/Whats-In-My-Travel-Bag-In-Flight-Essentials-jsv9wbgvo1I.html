hi guys today's video is going to be my
travel bag essentials I've been
traveling a lot lately and I know it's
kind of spring break season so maybe a
lot of you guys are traveling to or if
you're a first time traveler I hope this
video helps you guys out basically all
it is is just a what's in my bag video
just kind of a themed version so it's a
what's in my travel bag as in the bag
that I carry with me and that I put in
the seat in front of me in the airplane
the stuff that I use throughout the
flight it's not my carry-on suitcase if
you guys want a video on how I pack my
carry-on suitcase I can totally do that
for you this is just the bag of
necessities that I like to bring with me
whether it's a super long international
flight I tend to bring a little bit more
on those or if it's just like a regular
flight I fly a lot to either New York or
LA and those are both each about two and
a half three hours for me so it's stuff
that I like to carry with me so I
figured it would be helpful for you guys
if you're interested in it then just
keep on watching starting off with the
bag that I use at they vary but most of
the time I'm using this one it's a
longshot bag I really like it it's super
durable it's not too big so I can still
use a carry-on suitcase but it holds
everything I need okay so the first
thing that I like to keep in there is I
guess what I call my in-flight potential
essentials so it's stuff that I might
not use but I might need so it's kind of
important for me to carry this bag that
I'm using is from Target it came in a
set of three and what I like about this
one it's clear so you can see exactly
what you're grabbing out the first thing
I like to keep in there are either
makeup wipes or these by Olay fresh
effects it is the clear skin
c-spot swipe oil reducing wet cloths my
skin and airplanes don't mix whatsoever
the pressurized air that's running
through the cabin really dries out your
skin in turn making your skin produce
oil to kind of balance it out therefore
causing me to break out so these just
kind of help wipe away dirt oil and dead
skin cells that can clog your pores so I
definitely think they help this next
item I will only bring and potentially
use on super long international flights
basically they're just deep Hough iPads
it's kind of a luxury thing I think that
they definitely do help but they mainly
just feel really really good so it's
awesome when you just wake up on a plane
after a long flight and you're kind of
laying there and you don't mind looking
really silly tab
on us in the plane they just feel really
good and relaxing next up I like to
carry a small thing of deodorant
sometimes airplanes can leave you
feeling super girls so it's nice to have
that just in case you want to freshen up
another thing are tissues one time I
didn't have tissues on a plane and it
was miserable so I always bring them now
another thing are bobby pins and hair
ties you may never need these but they
are kind of a just-in-case item because
you'd be super annoyed if you needed
them and didn't have them the next thing
I put in there is some lip balm that's
pretty self-explanatory and then a
toothbrush you never know if you're
gonna need that and then also I put in
q-tips q-tips and cotton pads I don't
know if you ever use them um but you
never know so I keep those in there as
well and then of course you can't forget
the girly products because you don't
want to not be prepared on the airplane
so now that is filled with everything
that I want in there so that's going
into my travel bag and the next bag I am
packing is my quote-unquote liquids bag
meaning the bag that comes out at
security filled with all of my liquids
now these have to be TSA regulated a lot
of stores are coming out with their own
TSA regulated plastic bags like this
woman I got free with purchase at
Sephora one of the rules is that your
liquids have to be under four ounces so
lucky for us places like Target and
Walmart make little plastic bottles that
you can transfer all of your beauty
products into so like here I have a
shampoo conditioner face wash and eye
cream if you go into Ulta or Sephora
sometimes they have products that are
already sized down to the exact travel
size that you need like this rose water
spray my foundation hand cream
toothpaste and of course my travel elf
or my perfume so as long as all of your
liquids fit into a TSA regulated plastic
bag you are good to go you can also use
a regular ziplock bag that is this size
but just a tip for you most of the time
they come free with purchase if you buy
the clear plastic bottles or beauty
products that are size down the next
thing I put in my travel bag is my
regular everyday purse and what I keep
in there is mascara because that's a
necessary beauty item for me some
concealer for when I get off the flight
or when the flight is over and I need to
touch up two lip products my two
favorite and go twos which is the Urban
Decay Naked 2 lip liner and Mac's hue
lipstick another thing is a pocket-sized
mirror just in case or if I need to
apply my makeup
I'm getting off the plane and going
somewhere that I have to be ready for
another thing of course is gum and/or
mints most of the time I keep both
because I like to eat mints I'm weird
but I like them a lot and then also of
course the little wallet thing that I
got from Target it just holds all my
cards IDs and I will also most likely
put my boarding pass in here next up our
electronics starting with my vlogging
camera I'm taking that and putting it
into a case that I purchase at Target
just keeps it a little bit more
protected than it would on its own for
my chargers I'm using one of the bags
from that 3 set that I purchased at
Target up those little bags and I'm
putting my chargers in there so they
don't get lost in the bottom of my
travel bag um it just as easy to just
grab and go whenever you need a charger
for my headphones I just have the
friends headphones and they came with
their own case so I'm putting them in
there like so and then of course loading
it all into the travel bag I also bring
an iPad it's just a little bit more
convenient than a big laptop and it does
everything I need it to some other
miscellaneous things I will have in
there is some sort of magazine or two
and also snacks I can't go a plane ride
without having snacks so I really like
having trail mix so now that it's pretty
much filled to capacity I will just
obviously exhibit and I am good to go
but that's it for my video today I
really hope you guys found it helpful be
sure to let me know in the comments what
you guys like to bring on flights or if
you travel in a car if you travel at all
just let me know I like when you guys
comment and talk because I like to
comment back and I could use more help
to with my essentials I'm sure of it
so anyways if you guys want more travel
themed videos let me know by thumb zing
up this video and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
