do a what's in my bag video and I love
these videos on YouTube I searched them
all the time I just I don't know why I
find it so interesting so I thought I
would do one and share with you guys so
my bag to start off is this bag it is a
coach purse
I got it I want to say last year yeah I
got it last year for my birthday and
it's very cute it's got um the C's all
over it and then it's got this detailing
which i think is really really cool I
think it's very pretty and then the
straps on the side are really cute and
yeah and then in the inside it's got
this cool like blue color I think it's
really really pretty so onto what's
inside I'm just going to like pull out
whatever I see first
so no particular order and how I keep it
in here it's usually just a bundled mess
at the bottom of my purse it's never
organized so I'll just pull out whatever
so the first thing is my wallet and this
I believe I got at Target doesn't really
match my purse I I like it um I did have
a different one before this and that one
got stolen so that was really sad but um
so I've just bought this one quick to
keep all my stuff in but yeah it's
actually I really like it it's it's like
flexible and it snaps but yeah and then
this is where I keep all my cards and
then my money and it has like a little
zipper thing where I keep like what are
these Oh like um you know those like
store cards you get if you like I don't
know like reward cards yeah that's where
I keep all of those but yeah that's my
wallet a Rubik's Cube I'm like
determined to solve one of these so I
always keep it in my purse in case I
ever get bored or
I like meet someone that knows how to
solve it I can teach me I have one side
salt and then after this side I always
get stuck so if any of you guys know how
to solve a Rubik's Cube I've looked up a
couple things online but they're so
confusing to me but many of you guys
know how to I'd love to see a video
response so I can learn it too all right
what else sunglasses
yeah I don't wear these too often here
now because it's not it's starting to
get sunny but um yeah in the summer
these are really nice they're um Ray Ban
sunglasses and I got these like a couple
years ago I really like these sunglasses
a lot they are brown I don't know what
color exactly but they're like the brown
and black kind of like mixed and they're
the Wayfarer ones I really like these
next my iPod this is a very old iPod I
got this probably in middle school maybe
what it still works and it still staying
strong for me so yeah I don't listen to
this too often especially in my
apartment except my iTunes just playing
but on the way home I use I think I have
this my I trip which I wouldn't really
recommend buying one of these I trips
because they're very touchy when it
comes to the radio you always have to
switch the stations and like anyplace
you put it in the car it'll be like
fuzzy so I wouldn't necessarily
recommend these I find that the little
tape if you still have tape players in
your car I recommend those because some
of my friends have those and they work
way better than the I trip alright and
then I have these little Colgate with
things and they're like little mini
toothbrushes but like on the go
these are so handy I definitely
recommend having these in your purse
especially when you go out to eat and
you get like food stuck in your teeth
these are so nice to just like freshen
your breath and I really really like
these in your teeth like get things out
of your teeth they're so nice to have
definite lifesaver on those
um what I have chapstick
well Carmack's and this lipgloss which
if you guys watch up my videos you would
know that at UC or you've seen this
lipgloss before I have it in my March
favorites and really really like this
lip glass for those of you haven't seen
it it's the Korres natural products in
light pink and it's a cherry lip gloss I
really really like that a lot
Carmack's is just always good to have
next I have hand sanitizer and this is I
got this at bat the body works for like
a dollar fifty and this is really good
to have because I don't know I really
I'm not a germ freak but I really like
having hand sanitizer in my purse just
in case and this is the scent Japanese
cherry blossom really really like this
scent a lot it doesn't smell like
regular hand sanitizer with like
chemicals and it's just smelly this
smells exactly like the regular scent
and I have the lotion so I absolutely
love that flatting papers these are
really good to have in your purse um
just in case I guess I don't know there
I got there that I got I might target
there with a Sonia Kashuk blotting
papers and it comes with this little I
don't even know what this is called not
plastic it's some sort of like case for
it and then the blotting papers are
inside of it and this is just really
good to have case you ever get oily
which my skin does next I have a matte
compact and this is the Studio Fix matte
compact it looks like that it's like a
powder foundation one and then the
sponge is at the bottom in case you guys
are interested the color I am I got this
in the summer so my skin was obviously
darker but the color is NC 40 and this
is always good to have in case you ever
need to like touch up your makeup or
anything I really like having that my
purse the next thing I have is a tie to
go pen and
is a definite must have in my purse in
case you ever get makeup on yourself or
food or anything like god knows what
could spell on you at any given day so
it's really good to have this in your
purse it works very well so I like
having this a lot
what goes tissues and I love having
these in my purse because especially in
the winter months because I get colds
like crazy and somebody knows it's
always stuffy and runny and so it's
always good to have tissues so you don't
have to be all masked you can wipe it
all over your sleeve or try to like find
a bathroom to run and get toilet paper
so it's really good to have these little
travel Kleenexes with you a pen I have a
pen in my purse I guess this is good to
have in case I need it's no special pen
I think it's army strong pen I don't
know where I got this yeah I have it in
there another thing I have which is all
gone but I still have a little container
in my purse but it's on the three-hour
mint breath savers and these mints are
so good and I love them they taste so
good cuz like I used to get the Altoids
and those tend to be like a really
really strong for me I don't know why my
taste buds can't handle it I get like
it's like too minty for me but these are
delicious
I get the spearmint um flavor I really
really like these a lot
so I need anymore um and then that's
basically it then I just have headphones
for my iPod and then just like a bunch
of receipts and coupons and things I
don't need in here at all but yeah
that's it so I hope you guys liked this
video and I would love to see video
responses to see what's in your bag but
otherwise yeah I guess until next time
see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
