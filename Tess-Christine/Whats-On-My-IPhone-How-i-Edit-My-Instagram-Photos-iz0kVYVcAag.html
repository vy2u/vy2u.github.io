what's on my iPhone / how I edit my
Instagram photos video obviously this
has been very highly requested everybody
says that in the beginning of these
videos because it almost is like why why
do you care what's up my iPhone why do
you care how I edit my photos but I get
it I love watching these videos I think
they're very actually helpful as far as
like apps that people really like or
that are useful so yeah that's the thing
I'm gonna do for you guys today so I
really hope you guys enjoy it and let's
get started okay so this is my phone I
have the iPhone 5s in gold you can't
really see the gold part right now
because I have a case on it the case
that I have is this one from kids I
usually have one that has like a bumper
on the edges just that what that means
is it's just like a case that has kind
of like a raised edge all around it so
if you drop it on its face it won't
necessarily crack or at least help
prevent it which I should have on there
because some kind of notorious for
dropping my phone when I touch it I
let's see it's a photo I usually always
switch up my photos on my lockscreen
this is the one that it is right now
it's myself Julia Carey and Cara and I
took this when I was in New York City
and you opened on my phone this is what
it looks like I found this image on
Google I really like it's kind of like a
swirled color pattern starting off with
the top I guess apps up here obviously
there's the calendar that it comes with
the first app that I have is called
whatsapp this is really convenient if
you are talking to somebody that lives
outside of the country or is vacationing
then I have FaceTime camera obviously
Pandora
I love the John Mayer radio what else do
I love let's see Billy Joel radios
really good they're all kind of like
different vibes so it depends on like
what I'm in the mood for um Jack Johnson
radio obviously my mornings consist of
that what else do I like today's hits
radio is cool if you just kind of want
to listen to like radio jams or what's
kind of like the most popular obviously
today's hits that's pretty
self-explanatory so yeah that's that
exiting out of Pandora we have the
iTunes Store we have the YouTube app
obviously o'clock and then my social
folder I will open that one this is all
basically gonna be a shameless plug
because what else do I say with all of
these Facebook is mostly my personal
Facebook but I also do have a Facebook
page yes I still use Facebook and I just
post videos and photos and updates and
stuff on that
for Twitter this is probably my favorite
as far as talking to you guys I love
going on Twitter I just think I don't
know it's just the easiest for me to
talk to you guys directly versus all the
other ones I feel like my Twitter
followers are the ones that like get me
the most just because I always them like
tweeting my thoughts and like we always
have conversations so I really like
talking to you guys on here
moving on to vine vine is probably one
of my favorite apps ever I don't vine
personally I just I'm not very funny and
I used to when it first came out but it
mine are just really lame and I just
think all these people are just way more
talented and keep me entertained so much
more so I'll tell you guys some of my
favorites my favorite is Zachary P Anna
I think is how you say his name love him
I love ya clearly I love this one his
name is got dams though he's super super
funny Carrie and I quote him all the
time but then my all-time favorite is
definitely Krish he's just so funny like
this one
I just love party Johnny what's two plus
two oh this guy's awesome to you it's
awesome
his name's Cody Co he is so cool oh my
god this ER
the one direction edit seriously make me
laugh I just think they're so funny and
carry revine so many of them but yeah if
you guys want to follow me on here you
don't have to you by any means because
like I said I don't vine but I do revine
some pretty funny things Instagram
obviously the fave as far as like photos
go so when my Instagram looks like I
don't really know what to say about it
but I really like it so if you guys want
to follow me on that you can moving on
to snapchat I do have a public snapchat
I will have that either a text over this
right now or I don't know whatever I can
snapchat something right now there yay
okay so next up I have my photo editing
apps this is obviously all that I use I
have my photos in here so I have
afterlight facetune square ready V and
Photoshop Express so Photoshop Express I
got for some extra filters I've only
used it like once or twice I don't
really know how to get super fancy with
it so I don't really use that one all
too often and then square ready V is if
I do post videos on Instagram this just
basically puts that white border around
it so you can get the whole video on
Instagram instead of it cropping it
facetune I will only use if I want to
maybe like define my eyes or something
in the background or my hair or
something like that or if I want to get
rid of like blemishes this is super
awesome for that if you have like an all
pimple on your face and you want to post
a photo of yourself and you don't want
that then this helps you get rid of it
super awesome is probably the most
natural that I've seen but my main photo
editing thing that I use app is after
light as do a lot of people I've noticed
so the photo I took in the car obviously
so I basically just hit use my favorite
and go to things to do with this photo
or a photo depending on what it is is
I'll go into this tab and there's like a
brightness depending on the photo I will
either like crank up the brightness a
little bit I usually only do like up to
about 30 maybe like I said it all
depends on the photo so I like to crank
up the brightness a little bit I also
clarify it
I will crank it down a little bit cuz I
don't want it like too clarified so yep
do that and then if I want to I'll fade
it a little bit basically that just kind
of like I don't know makes it a little
bit more tumblr you lookin I think my
favorite filters to use are in this one
I go into original and I'll go into all
of I think it's yep olive that's like my
go-to one I really like that one I don't
usually crank it up all the way I'll
probably do it to about 50 to 60 and
then I'll hit go and then I'll either go
into guest which I really like and my
favorites are either Russ but that makes
it like a little too crazy bright for me
so I will usually crank it down a little
bit I'll either do Russ or I will do
which I did for this photo when I post
it is Horan Horan I think and this just
kind of makes it like a little bit
darker so I kind of crank it down a
little bit like this and then if I want
to put a white border on it what I like
to do is go in here original click this
and it puts a white border on it for
this one I just used the crop that
Instagram does for you and made it a
square I don't have an Instagram theme I
don't know it's just not for me just
because I like I don't have a theme to
my life like I just do it so I don't
know how to explain that so I don't have
like certain filters that I use like to
create a theme I just kind of do
whatever I feel like looks good or that
I want so if I go back into my Instagram
like you guys can see I just kind of
post whatever some are super colorful
some aren't so it just depends like I
don't have a theme at all so anyways
yeah that's kind of what I do to edit my
photos nothing like crazy special but
those are my favorite filters and my
favorite app that I use so after that we
went through that one I have references
which is just like the Weather Channel
Safari settings passbook and notes into
finance I have my Bank app my PayPal and
this one called kudos on it used to be
signed now I use this for documents that
I have to sign for different YouTube
stuff or just in general like I'm
signing a lease secret secrets it's a
lot easier than having to like print out
a document sign it and then scan it back
in this just has does it all for you
basically and now moving on to my fun
stuff folder in here I have
the hunt and this is so over talks about
on YouTube but I actually downloaded the
hunt on my own I'm not like being paid
to tell you guys about it I just
genuinely liked it it helps a lot with
like my get the look videos are certain
posts that I will do I really like it or
just in general like I'll just go on
here and look at like cute stuff and I'm
like hey like I like that and then I
will like see where it's from moving on
I have trivia crack which is fun I'm
sure you guys have heard about bad
that's a really fun game I'll kind of
show you guys a little bit about it all
my games are done now so I'll just start
it with like a random opponent basically
you just spend this little wheel and you
answer trivia questions and it actually
gets really fun when you're doing it
with your friends I get super heated so
like they'll ask you a question and then
you answer it let's see I'll just pick
one damn it
didn't get it right so yeah and then
it'll go to the other person and you
just switch back and forth until you get
all those little icons filled at the top
of it super fun I like it a lot next up
I have this app called shop style I
really like this app I use this like I
said a lot for my get the look videos or
get the look for less I'll look for like
a beaded top and it'll show me like a
bunch of them you can set price points
for how like expensive or cheap you want
it and then you can basically it just
kind of shops it for you next up for
lifestyle I have uber and Urban Spoon
I'm sure you guys have heard of uber and
then Urban Spoon is really nice if
you're in a place where you just don't
know where to eat you can pick like a
cuisine you want so if you're feeling
American breakfast Mexican Chinese
Carrie and I use this we were in New
York last we were trying to figure out
where to eat we're like we want
something super cheap so we'll click
that and they'll give you a bunch of
restaurants near you and then over here
I just have the apps that they kind of
give you so newsstand videos apps to
your contacts and then all the utilities
like I just kind of put all of these and
here the stuff that you don't use like
all too much except I do use maps a lot
so yeah that's it so that's it that's
all that's on my iPhone I really hope
you guys found this helpful be sure to
let me know in the comments below what
video you want to see from me next and I
will see you guys in my next video
