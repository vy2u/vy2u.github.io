going to be very short and sweet because
I've gotten a lot of questions on my
teeth and a lot of you guys are like hey
what do you do to make your teeth so
white and all that stuff so I'm just
gonna make a quick video talking about
my teeth for like just a little bit so
you guys know so you know I did have
braces and I know I gotten a few
questions on that and I had braces up
until only hat I only had them for like
a year and a half because I didn't marry
I didn't have very crooked teeth I had
um an overbite so I had braces for like
a year and a half and so I got them off
in like seventh grade and then after
seventh grade I knew I was like dreaded
if you guys have had braces you get like
warned that if you don't take care of
them right you could get those little
spots on your teeth like all over from
not cleaning your braces so I was really
worried about that so I took super good
care of them and then after I got them
off I started using Crest Whitestrips
I used the professional effects one
advance
there's the advanced vivid and the
professional effects and I used the
professional ones right when I got my
braces off because I was like so scared
that I was gonna get those spots on my
teeth so I just made sure to whiten
those really really good and that worked
awesome I don't want in my teeth daily
and I don't whiten them very often at
all but if I do whiten them now I just
use the crest 3d white strips and vivid
and these are the the cheapest ones you
can get they're the lowest two thirds
there's vivid advanced vivid and
professional effects and the vivid ones
the whitening level is only one and then
it goes up until three so it's like one
two three but this one's one and it's
only once a day and I get the ten
whitening treatments and I don't use
them every day I just use them I don't
know maybe like once a week if that so I
don't use them too often because as soon
as I got my braces off I used that
professional effects one and it is
worked like fine ever since so I never
had a problem with whitening my teeth or
anything or them not being white ever
since I use that professional thank
professional effects one so if you are
looking to just like
overall whiten your teeth right away and
have it last
I would definitely splurge and pay for
that professional effects one but if you
already have white teeth and you just
want to enhance the look of your teeth I
would suggest just getting the vivid
because I think they work just as good
and I definitely notice the difference
with these like right away I use them
you I'm pretty sure you all know kind of
what they look like they come in little
strips like this and they come with an
upper and a lower strip and it doesn't
go all the way back into your mouth it
only covers like your smile so um which
is all you really need because like no
one's going to see your back teeth so
it's not kind of pointless to whiten all
the way back there anyways but basically
you just peel them off they're really
flimsy little um strips and they have
this like they're all dotted on the back
with this gel treatment and you just put
those on your teeth and you fold them
over I would do a whole like little
tutorial on it but I think it's kind of
pointless because I feel like it's very
self-explanatory once you buy it but you
just put it over your teeth and you
leave it sit for um half an hour and
then you take them out you just pull
them out and then I always like to brush
my teeth afterwards just because it has
a weird taste and I like to make sure
that all the gel is off and then that is
all I do and I think they work great and
I would definitely recommend buying
knees over going to like dentist and
getting them professionally laser
whitened because that gets very pricey
and I think these work just as well so
that is seriously it for the video today
you guys wanted to know what I use on my
teeth I had a lot of people asking um
more than once and so instead of just
replying to the comment I figured I just
think whole video so now everybody knows
what I do and by the way I'm not being
sponsored by crest at all quest for
Crest Whitestrips at all this is just
what I've used I told you in seventh
grade when I got my braces off I use the
professional ones so um just so you know
disclaimer I'm not being sponsored by
them or anything um but you wanted to
know what I use so this is what I use
and I definitely recommend these you
should go try these out I believe this
was like thirty dollars at Target and
then they get more expensive as you go
up in advance
whitening treatment so I really hope
this video was helpful and you you know
kind of learned I mean I'm sure you guys
watched more than one video more than my
videos on YouTube so you'll be able to
know kind of what other girls say that
they use to whiten their teeth and how
it works for them I love this so I would
definitely recommend it and yeah I hope
it works for you and see you in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
