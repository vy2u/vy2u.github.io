haul video this is definitely a
collective haul however a lot of the
stuff did come from all the crazy cyber
monday sales I'm not much for Black
Friday it's not really my thing I can't
do it but I'm all for online shopping so
cyber monday is like my thing I love it
I meant to get this up sooner but
because a lot of it was from online
stores that they all have like different
shipping so I kind of had to wait until
everything came in and I saw everything
and then now I'm actually sitting down
to Phil Mahal but I'm pretty sure that a
lot of this stuff is still on their
sites I don't know for sure but all the
stuff is pretty simple so so yeah I
guess I'm just gonna get started ok so
the first item that I'm gonna show you
actually was not purchased online and I
just got done saying that this is all
from online but it's actually not I
remembered that I purchased this after
Black Friday but they still had some of
their sales in PacSun is where I
purchased it I only bought one thing
because I really liked it and it's this
it's just a maroon circle skirt very
simple it is textured a little bit which
I thought was really nice I don't know I
like wearing this with like the thigh
high stockings now or just like tights I
don't even remember all the prices on
the stuff I'm about to show you but all
the stuff was on sale I was really
excited when I got it because I love
this color especially for the fall and
winter so the next thing that I bought
is from Zara and I only want one thing
and it's this it's a skirt obviously
it's houndstooth print which I thought
was so cute I know it's really on trend
for the season the houndstooth thing but
I've always really liked this print but
I never could find a clothing item that
had this print that I really liked so I
found this one on Zara and it was on
sale so I really liked it um it's nice
too because it's a thicker material so
again because it's winter now it's not
even fall I can't even say it's fall
anymore but now that it's a winter this
will keep you know a majority of that
region you know covered up but I can
wear it with tights and and or stockings
something like that I think it's super
cute and I can dress it up a lot of
different ways so the next place that
ordered from was Nasty Gal they had
great like 30 to 40% off on
one day so I was all for it I love Nasty
Gal they have such cute stuff their
stuff can get a little bit pricey so
when I found out there's this tail I was
all over that but both of them I
actually bought the shirts that I bought
are sleeveless which is weird because
it's so cold in Minnesota right now but
what I like buying sleeveless or like
short sleeve tops boards I can wear them
underneath jackets and dress them up or
dress them down so this first one looks
like this it's black and has this lace
front and back to it I thought it was
really pretty because I can wear it
either under a blazer or a leather
jacket or just some sort of jacket and
totally either like make it casual or
dress it up for like when I go out at
night during the weekend something like
that I always like buying tops like this
just cuz I think they're so pretty and
flowy and yeah and then the other top
that I purchased from Nasty Gal looks
like this it buttons here it's
unbuttoned right now but it has a really
cute collar on it it's like a scalloped
black color and this is like a cream
white color I just think it's so cute
and pretty and I can wear like a
cardigan over this with even just like a
black skirt or some black pants anything
like this type of top just looks so good
with anything it's just classic so the
next site that I went to is Miss
Selfridge and I really like this store a
lot it kind of reminds me of a Topshop
which I am in love with the only thing
is like ordering from international
sites means that it takes forever to get
here or you have to pay a hefty express
shipping fee so that's the only thing
that steers me away from it but I do
really like the clothes and they had
great deals going on but the first thing
that I bought there was another tank top
it looks like this I really liked it
because it's like textured it has like a
velvety feel to it and I think it's
really pretty and like I said this is
gonna look so good underneath Blazers or
any type of jacket like a you can
totally you just make this work for the
winter even though it's so cold and it's
a tank top but I think it's really
really pretty and I love the floral
eprint that's on it because I'm all
about floral and even though it's not
spring and summer I'm gonna find any
excuse to wear it the next thing that I
purchased is a scarf and it looks like
this and this is what would you call
this like a plaid print um yeah it's red
and navy and it has like the end look
like this it's just so thick and warm
and like I said it's snowing like crazy
here and just like negative degrees out
so I need everything to keep me warm so
I saw this scarf and I don't have a
scarf like this at all I actually don't
even really have pattern scarves for the
winter I just have like solid color ones
so when I saw this I really liked it and
it's so warm and cozy though yes the
last thing that I bought from Miss
Selfridge was a jacket I love their
jackets they're they're so cute and when
I saw this one I had to have it
it's a checked print I think what it is
what it's called is like a checked P
coat it looks like this and it's navy
and white I just really like it and I
usually have like big fluffy winter
coats or like just maybe one or two P
coats so it's nice to have something
especially with the pattern because I
don't know I thought it was really cute
and it would match just about anything
in my wardrobe really it would like you
could wear this with a lot of different
things because the print isn't like
super over-the-top which is what I liked
about it it was a little bit pricey
because it was a jacket so you kind of
have to justify paying a certain amount
for a jacket the next site that I went
to was a sauce and I love ordering from
ASOS they have really great shipping
it's fast I love it so the first thing
that I bought were just basic black
stockings they look like this the ones
that I have are knitted right now so you
can kind of see through them these are
just solid black I'm loving the whole
thigh high stockings trend that's going
on right now I love it I love it so I
definitely wanted to get another pair
and these were super inexpensive so I
figured I was like all right the next
thing was another winter accessory and
it's this it's a beanie
I love beanies for the winter especially
like second day hair third day hair um
they're just so nice just to cover up
hair when you have like a bad hair day
they're just perfect you can throw them
on in a hurry like if I'm late for
school or anything like I can just put
this on and I'm good to go I know in
like high school and stuff you're not
allowed to wear hats during the day but
since I'm in college it doesn't really
matter so I wanted to get this one plus
I loved the color because you guys know
me and maroon I love it the next two
things are dresses the first one looks
like this I'm actually wearing this for
my graduation if you guys follow me on
Twitter you know that I'm graduating
from college on
so I'm really excited and I needed a
dress to wear underneath like my gown
cap and whatever and for after so I
liked this one because it matched it was
really it's not simple but it's like
subtle enough to where I can wear it
with like my black gown and then like
all the stuff that I have over it I just
really liked it and I thought it was
really really pretty and it's totally my
style with like the higher neck and then
like the flared out bottom I love that
style the next dress looks like this
it's from ASOS what the brand is River
Island I really like the print of it
again it's like the same fit-and-flare
style but this one has sleeves which I
thought was really cute and it came with
a necklace but it's not on right now cuz
I wore it for something else but it did
come with a necklace which was really
awesome anything with this type of print
or like this darker color theme I love
wearing especially during the winter
when you have to go somewhere nice
because you can wear it with tights and
booties and just kind of you know either
like a big scarf or a necklace a blazer
and less possibilities with this the
last thing from ASOS I thought was kind
of boring it's just simple it's just
like a huge long jumper um it's kind of
like a sweatshirt style it just looked
so cozy and comfy and just for like
those lazy days this is just something
perfect to have and it wasn't that
expensive so I figured you can always
use more comfy sweatshirts and sweaters
in your wardrobe so I really liked it
the last place that I went online was
Topshop I only bought one thing and it
was this it's just like a fuzzy sweater
it's a bomber style so it zips up in the
front it's so cozy I instagrammed a
photo of myself wearing this and a lot
of you guys are asking where you
purchased it from and it's from Topshop
when I got this I was really happy with
it so cozy and soft and fuzzy just super
warm especially for me over here chillin
and like freezing weather in Minnesota
like I need all the sweaters I can have
but that's it for this haul video I
really hope you guys liked it I feel
like I kind of rushed through it a
little bit but I like to keep these
videos kind of like short and to the
point I don't want to like bore you guys
but yeah let me know if any more videos
you guys want me to do I have a notebook
full of video requests that I'm getting
too I've just been like swamped this
past couple weeks with graduation stuff
I'm so excited to graduate from college
and then I'll have all the time in the
world
so yeah I really hope
guys enjoyed this video thank you all so
much for watching and I will see you
guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
