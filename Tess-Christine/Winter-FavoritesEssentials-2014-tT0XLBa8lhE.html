winter favorites video or I guess you
could call it a winter essentials video
you guys all know how this works
basically I'm just gonna run through
categories beauty fashion and lifestyle
and I'm gonna tell you guys what I've
been absolutely loving or that I feel
like I need for the winter season I
thought it would help you guys out a lot
and I got a lot of requests for it so I
definitely wanted to share it with you
guys today
so if you are interested please keep on
watching so the first category that I'm
going to start with is beauty and I'm
just gonna run through this stuff really
quick because I don't want to bore you
with long explanations first off you
guys know that I live in Minnesota so
it's snowing it's freezing cold so
there's a lot of different things for my
skin and hair that I do differently
versus the summer the first thing that
I'm going to show you guys is the Aveda
damage remedy and now you guys know that
I used to use the macadamia natural oil
deep repair mask and I still love that
stuff it's awesome but I thought I would
try something new since I've been using
a Veda color on my hair I wanted to use
more of a product that's geared around
that so basically all it is is a deep
conditioner I feel like it's really
helped especially with my ends that's
where I get really really dry hair is
this starts to get really dry and break
off like towards the end but I've
already noticed a difference in the
softness of my hair so I do use this in
the shower like once a week and then I
use when I get out of the shower I use
this and this is another thing that I
was going to show you guys
it's Ori ve I think it's orb or
something I don't know on top of like
the nice conditioners that I've been
using I get out of the shower and when
my hair is damp I basically just do one
pump and I put it focus it mainly on the
ends and another thing you can do with
this product is when your hair is dry
and you've just finished and finished
styling it you can use the same amount
and just run it through your ends again
and it makes it super shiny and silky
now as you guys know if you've tried out
the oils before these kind of like
nourishing hair oils is that they are on
the pricier side now this one is the
most expensive I've seen which really
really sucks because I've actually
noticed a difference with this versus
the other ones that I've tried because
seriously I tried so many and this one
I've noticed within like a month like
almost less than that it was so quick
that I started noticing a difference
really unfortunate that it's so
expensive but like I said or I guess if
you know with the oils you only need one
pump like super super small amount so
the amount you pay for any sort of
nourishing hair oil will last you for a
really really long time so then the next
hair product that I've been absolutely
loving is another herb or I don't even
know how to bounce this but it's another
one of these products and it's the dry
texturizing spray now this in specific I
guess wouldn't be something just for the
winter because I would use this all year
round but when I discovered it it was a
couple months ago so it's been one of my
winter favorites since I bought it
basically what it is is you just spray
it in your hair after you're done
styling it it definitely gives some sort
of a like a wavy texture to your hair
it's kind of like a Messier feel that
adds volume it kind of is a double for
dry shampoo as well so I really really
like this I spray it into my roots all
different areas I spray it in my hair
for more of a texture at the bottom if I
want it to look a little bit Messier not
so uniform
so I will use this and I love it the way
it smells is amazing the next two
products are for my skin and they are
lotion which is kind of you guys could
probably guess that I was gonna say that
but this one is the Aveeno daily
moisturizing lotion I love using this on
my entire body it just it doesn't have a
scent but it's like one of those no
scent that smells just like clean I
don't know I really like it and I think
it really helps with my dry skin
especially in the winter my skin gets so
dry and just like claustrophobic that
using a moisturizer really really does
help for my face I use the Cetaphil
moisturizing you guys this before I
really like it
this isn't just specifically a face
lotion you can use this on your entire
body because it's just an all-purpose
moisturizing lotion but I like to save
this just for my face because I found
that it's not super oily and it doesn't
break me out which is like my ultimate
goal I want something that moisturizes
my skin and doesn't break me out and
leaving me with like super oily greasy
skin because I already have oily skin as
it is so this one I really found that I
really like
the next products are all lip products
and the first one I'm going to start out
is just a moisturizing chapstick this is
definitely one of my winter favorites or
winter essentials because my lips get
super dry and cracked in the winter a
lip scrub and a chapstick is definitely
necessary in the summer I try to
moisturize all year round but I don't
find that my lips needed as much in the
summer versus the winter so I always
have chapstick with me the next two
things I've shown you guys before and
they are MAC lipsticks I love these
these are in specific my favorite for
the winter months because they are on
the darker side so the first one is diva
and it's just a matte cranberry maroon
lip and then this one is like a matte
red color as I showed you guys in my
favorite winter or holiday makeup and
hair look I mix these two so I put this
one on my entire lip the red one and
then the darker maroon color on the
outer half and blended it to make it
kind of like an ombre lip so I've been
loving doing that especially during the
winter months the next thing is my
favorite basic just like nude pinky lip
gloss it's this one by NARS I just love
it it doesn't leave your lips looking
too pink or too nude it's just perfect
I'm wearing it on my lips right now I
love it it's just like the perfect
all-around color the next thing is for
my nails and the first thing I want to
show you is this one I have two favorite
nail polish colors one is in my living
room and so I'm just gonna tell you
about it because on my nails now but
this one is wicked by Essie I love it
it's just a dark dark maroon color it
almost looks black it's my favorite
color to wear during the winter but my
also favorite color is the complete
opposite and that's this color which is
a bubble bath by OPI it's just a super
super light pinky nude color it's
perfect if you want your nails to look
clean and fresh but then I love this
wicked one if you want to go a little
bit more bold and dark so now I'm going
to move on to the lifestyle category
which is just kind of like miscellaneous
stuff that I have been loving for the
past couple months and for the winter
season first two items are gonna be food
items
the first one is soup I absolutely love
soup in the winter season just because
it's so warm I mean I love soup in
general but in the winter
I find myself eating it way more because
it just warms my belly and makes me feel
so good the two that I grabbed from my
cabinet I just grabbed two random ones
are the Campbell's homestyle ones I'll
either grab like that just a basic
chicken noodle or this chicken with wild
rice or just a tomato-basil one I'm
pretty simple when it comes to soup but
I do really like it in the winter
because like I said it just keeps me
more the next food item is oatmeal
I have salute love oatmeal I think it
tastes so good it's like one of my
favorite just like quick meals that I'll
have either for lunch or for breakfast
it's just like the best
I'll put either blueberries in it or
strawberries it just tastes so yummy and
then the next thing is another on the
lines of keeping me super warm and
that's coffee or tea hot coffee I love
it hazelnut in specific is my favorite
flavor
otherwise I will grab for a tea this one
is an English breakfast tea it's just my
favorite I love this type of tea I think
it tastes really yummy and like I said
both of those things keep me super warm
that's kind of the trend here with food
and drinks is like anything to keep me
warm inside and like comfort food is I
love it during the winter
my next lifestyle favorite thing is
right behind me and they are candles
I find myself burning candles way more
during the winter season than I do
during the summer because in the summer
I'm constantly like outside doing stuff
where is in the winter you're kind of
stuck inside if it's super super cold
so having candles around just makes the
whole atmosphere just feel more inviting
and warm I just love it then the other
lifestyle favorite thing that I
absolutely must have and just my
favorite thing in the winter is going to
the gym and you're probably thinking
what you're crazy but I actually really
enjoy going to the gym especially in the
winter because if you live where I live
it's so cold and so unbearably just like
uncomfortable to be outside that you're
stuck inside 99% of the day so to go
somewhere and get out of your house and
like go to the gym and get some sort of
energy output feels amazing to me and
for you guys comment I am working on
making a gym video for you guys like a
diet fitness thing I know a lot of you
guys were asking me for that and I see
your comments I'm going to do it I just
have to get everything together and plan
the video a little bit more for me to
make it just how I want it and also I
have to get permission to film in the
gym that I go to because that's also a
huge thing because I want to show you
guys what I actually do instead of just
talking to you about it so I'm working
on it I promise so now I'm moving on to
the fashion category the first thing
that I absolutely have been loving all
winter season is this onesie I'm pretty
sure it's inside out because I was
wearing it like last night but um you
guys saw this one's the end of my Selena
Gomez get the look video um so that's
the whole reason why I got it was for
that video but I've been wearing it ever
since it's seriously the most comfy
onesie ever it's like this fleece
material oh my gosh you guys I seriously
love it it's amazing so if you can get
your hands on a onesie definitely do it
because you will not regret it so the
next thing I am loving - we're turning
the winter months our fuzzy socks um
these are the ones I'm wearing now you
can't really see kind of but um they're
just like this grayish blue color I
don't know they're so fuzzy and warm and
I just love them I bought them at Target
for like 3 bucks so then the next
fashion things are pretty
self-explanatory
I mean mittens gloves hats warm boots
jackets all different types of jackets
there are things that I absolutely need
to have during the winter but instead of
me just kind of like showing you which
ones are my favorite I'm just gonna
redirect you to my winter lookbook
because i styled all of the pieces that
I'm absolutely loving this whole winter
season so I thought it would be more of
a fun video for you guys to watch
instead of me just sitting here
blabbering so I'm gonna have the video
here and in the description box so you
should definitely go check out my winter
lookbook if you haven't already then
also for my PopSugar video of the month
I styled a basic winter essential which
was my warm puffy jacket from Zara
I styled it 4 different ways for 4
different occasions so that's another
video you guys should check out if
you're interested in my fashion styling
videos so that's it for my winter
favourites or winter essentials video I
really hope you guys found this video
helpful please let me know in the
comments below what your winter
essentials or winter favourites are that
I haven't
because I love to try out new things and
I love hearing from you guys anyway so
just comment and let me know if you like
the video because you guys are awesome
and I love you all so so much so yeah I
hope you all are having a wonderful day
