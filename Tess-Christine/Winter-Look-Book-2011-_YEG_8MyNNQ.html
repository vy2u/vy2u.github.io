a fashion video and I have a lot of
outfits put together so I'm not gonna
waste any time getting into this intro
again this is not like the trends of
winter fashion this is just like my
winter fashion video like what I like to
wear during the winter so a lot of you
guys requested it so of course I was
gonna do it though let's get into it I
really hope you guys enjoy it and until
my next video bye guys
so for this first outfit I'm wearing
this tan pea coat from pimple I think
that's how you say it I'm not quite sure
I got it when I was studying abroad in
England but I really really loved this
jacket it puts together an outfit so
easy and it's super super cute and then
for my scarf I'm wearing this maroon and
black scarf from H&amp;amp;M and I love it it's
so warm and cozy so I love wearing it
and then underneath my jacket I'm
wearing a sweater from American Eagle
and I really like this sweater because
it's long and it covers my butt so I can
wear it with tights or leggings and I'm
wearing these tights from Target and the
boots from Urban Outfitters so for the
second outfit I'm wearing a sweater that
I got from PacSun and I did choose to
belt it with a belt from forever 21
obviously that's optional I really like
the sweater a lot I think the pattern is
really pretty for winter and I like the
colors in it I did choose to add a
necklace and this necklace is from
American Eagle on the bottom I'm wearing
tights from Target boots from Bearpaw
and a skirt bandage skirt from Urban
Outfitters
all right so this next outfit is super
casual but super comfy I'm wearing a
sweater that I got an England at Dorothy
Perkins and I really really like this
poncho sweater type thing because it's
really really thick and it's super super
warm so surprisingly it'll keep you
really warm under the tank top that I'm
wearing which I actually got at H&amp;amp;M it's
like a long tan tank top kind of thing
racerback and then underneath I'm
wearing a bandage skirt from Urban
Outfitters and then on the bottom of my
outfit I'm wearing tights from Target
you can also wear leggings with this
look too it would look the same and then
my shoes are from Zara all right so this
next outfit up that I'm wearing is one
of my favorites because it is so
comfortable the big sweater that I'm
wearing is from H&amp;amp;M I love this big
sweater it's probably the comfiest
sweater that I own underneath I'm just
wearing a black cami from American Eagle
I believe my scarf is from maurices it
was actually a gift from a friend I love
the colors in it and then my awesome
maroon pants are from new look in
England for those of you guys who have
that and my shoes are from River Island
in England as well alright so for this
next outfit I made this super comfy but
you can also dress this up a lot
depending on the shoes and accessories
that you wear but for right now I just
made it super comfy because since it's
kind of an everyday winter fashion but
my top is from H&amp;amp;M it's just a tan
loose-fitting
top that I got at H&amp;amp;M yeah and then this
hat is from Spain in Barcelona my tights
are from Target again and my shoes are
Bearpaw and I got these at t.j.maxx
alright so for this next outfit the
leather jacket that I'm wearing is from
Dorothy Perkins which again is in
England and the Kami is from American
Eagle and my flannel is from Hollister
but any flannel will obviously work for
this look my hat is from a store in
Barcelona again like the last one but
you can find these hats anywhere and
then my jeans are from American Eagle
and they're just the regular skinny
jeans and then my shoes are the Bearpaw
ones again
all right so this next outfit I love a
lot it's super cute but it's not very
warm because of the little holes in the
sweater but it still works the sweater
is from River Island it's a store in
England again sorry and my skirt is from
Urban Outfitters it's just a regular
bandage black skirt and my tights are
from oh I just stepped in nasty mud oh
gosh so gross but um my tights are from
Target these earrings are from forever
21 and my boots are from Urban
Outfitters so this last look is one of
my favorites the jacket that I'm wearing
is from a local store in my hometown but
the brand I believe is called Jack by BB
Dakota so it is accessible in a
different store outlet my jeans are from
American Eagle and they're just the
basic skinny jeans same ones as before
my shoes are from new look again for
those of you who are unaware it's a
store in England but these lace up
booties can probably be found in a lot
of stores this scarf is from Dorothy
Perkins and my hat is from H&amp;amp;M that is
it for my video I really hope you guys
