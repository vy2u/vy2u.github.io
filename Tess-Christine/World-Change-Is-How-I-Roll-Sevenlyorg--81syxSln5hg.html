bit different today today's video isn't
about fashion hair makeup or beauty or
anything like that today's video is
actually about a charity and I really
support the idea of giving back I think
it's really important for our community
our world and our nation to give back
and if we have the power to do it I
think it's really important so it's
really excited when a company called 7li
decided to contact me and asked me if I
wanted to spread the word about this
charity and of course I was all for it I
love the idea of it and I was very
excited to be a part of it the charity
that I'm talking about is called 7ly
this online website called 7li org I
will obviously have that linked in the
description box below basically what
they do is they feature a different
charity each week so each week seven Lee
they 7ly for seven days get it you to
make they feature a different charity
and you can buy a t-shirt for 22 dollars
and I think this is a really cool idea
because the money that you use to
purchase the shirt goes towards that
charity so for instance this is the
shirt that I'm wearing I'll stand up and
show you it it says awake our hearts to
end hunger so I just think that's a
really cool saying and I think that the
shirts are really cool too they're
really really fun and colorful and I
absolutely love them and my shirt this
week that I got my shirt was to end
hunger and help feed multiple different
children in a different country
basically their website is set up to
where you can purchase all these
different kinds of shirts um they
obviously the week the shirt is
correspondent with the charity that it's
what sponsoring so it has a design that
that obviously incorporates some part of
the charity that it's talking about so
this week with your $22 purchase of your
shirt on 70 org will help an abandoned
baby in China become adopted which i
think is really really cool I just think
that this charity is just amazing and I
love how they support different
charities each week it just kind of
shows the broad range of charities that
there are out there and how you can help
just by purchasing one simple shirt not
only are you getting a really awesome
t-shirt but you're also helping people
in need which i think is really cool
because every time you can look in your
closet and see this shirt every time you
put it on you can realize like how many
people you've helped and I just think
it's a really cool concept and a really
cool idea it's artists teenagers to find
a way to make a change and and you don't
really know what to do and what steps to
take to you know really help I just
think this charity is really cool idea
because it allows you to go online
purchase a really awesome shirt and a
portion of that money goes to charity
and you really didn't have to do much
besides purchase a really cool shirt
that you can wear all the time I just
think it's a really cool charity to be
aimed at young adults and targeting
people who really like these shirts and
would be attracted to these shirts and
want to wear them while also helping out
a charity and people in need and I just
think that sometimes we take for granted
things that we have and get lost in the
sight of everything and forget that
there are a lot of other people out
there who are a lot less fortunate than
us and are not as blessed as us and
really need the help and we have the
power to give them help it's just the
initiative of stepping up and taking
that time to give them help and I just
think this really really is an easy way
and a really great step forward to
helping out the world that is it for
this video today I know it's a little
bit different from my beauty video but I
just kind of wanted to step aside and
you know spread the awareness for this
charity because I just think it's really
important and these things are very
important to me besides my love for all
the stuff that I do for you I just
really want you guys to know that there
are other things in life that are
important too and especially this I just
kind of wanted to let you guys know
about this really cool charity that is
here and available for you guys to help
so yeah I really hope you guys all go
check it out I really hope you like this
video let me know if you have any
questions about any anything at all that
I mentioned in this video I'll be happy
to answer them in the quest or the
comments below and I will see you guys
next time bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
