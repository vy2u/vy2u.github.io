partly I only love my bed and my mom I'm
sorry 50 dub I even cut it out it on me
81 to bring a crusher sort of party and
you know me hey guys it's Kate of course
in effect with another video and this
video is gonna be a one month update on
my unist 30 inch bundles that I made
into a week so if you have not seen my
initial video on this hair I'll go ahead
and leave all the links to that video in
my description box just in case any of
you guys want to check it out so I'm
just gonna go ahead and give you a quick
refresher of what I have in my head so
they sent me four bundles and a frontal
and I believe all four the bundles was
30 inches and the front tool was 20
inches and the frontal was 20 inches and
it came straight like the bundles were I
think it was Brazilian Street I don't
know I'll leave all the details in my
description box because I might be wrong
this is basically the hair and its
natural state and I was talking to a lot
of you guys who I put up a post on my
snapchat asking you guys if I should
curl it or if I should just leave it in
its natural state and it looks like it's
like half and half I got people telling
me to cut it then I got half and half
telling me to leave it alone and then
other half telling me to curl it but I
don't really want this video to be
boring since it's a update video because
I did it just plan on leaving it alone
but because this is a update video I'm
just gonna give you all something to
watch so I'm gonna go ahead and just
curl the hair for you guys just you can
see how the hair is Carol okay so before
I even start curling his head let me
just give you guys an update because I
know that's which I've been waiting for
so I did actually wear this head like
three more times after my first video so
within a month I would has had like four
times well this is my fifth time right
now
from the initial time that I would has
had I did have it straight XII
I thought was straight I did go ahead
and currently because I wanted to see
how the hair looked curl and it actually
looked really good curl and it
definitely hold the curl so I didn't
have no pictures like I didn't take any
pictures of the headband current which
I'm mad about so that's why I wanted to
go ahead and curl it again so you guys
can see what it looks like and how it
how good it holds the curl but as far as
how it straightens of course you guys
know that if you watched the first video
that this hair straightens very well
like I said this is its natural texture
which I love what else can I say about
this hair oh I did not get a lot of
tingling when I washed his head and this
was my first time washing his hair and I
did not hardly get any shine in your
whatsoever like I don't even get any
shedding all the privates like to one or
two strands of hair tangling I still
don't get tingling from this hair even
in the nape area I do not get any
tingling like this hair is the bone so
yeah I don't want this video to be so
long and dragged out but if you're
interested in this head definitely hop
on it and so I am gonna go ahead and
curl this hair I like my location but I
might have to switch I'm gonna try to
figure something else so I can curl it
right yeah I'm gonna go ahead and curl
this hair really quick it's not gonna be
like real fancy it's just gonna be like
real quick I really don't know if I'm
going to speed up this video or if I'm
going to talk I might just talk and only
because I'm in like um talking move I
don't know
so how is everyone hello I never talked
to you guys I don't know I'm just not
really big on talking like I just I
don't know I don't talk whatever what I
mean it's cool um so yeah do see this
eye shadow y'all know that I never wear
eye shadow
ever the only thing I hate about the the
only thing I hate about these curlers is
the fact that the this pot don't go all
the way up which is weird to me I don't
understand but yeah back to my when I
shadow y'all can y'all see that oh I
just don't like putting eyeshadow on
myself
fun fact though a lot of you guys don't
know that I am actually a makeup artist
I've been doing makeup since 2009
I just don't promote my work a lot of
people ask me like a lot of people were
surprised when I started doing K videos
on YouTube rather than makeup but I felt
like everybody wants to be a makeup
artist you guys and y'all know what I'm
talking about like everybody and their
mother so I just felt like I really just
didn't want to be bothered with it and
it's a lot of other reasons behind why I
don't promote why don't remove my makeup
business or whatever but yeah I believe
I'll really pursue it ouch I'm really um
pursue it as much anymore because I'm so
into the weights now but yeah I
definitely do makeup I went to school
for everything even though I felt like
you really don't need to go to school
for it because I mean if you know how to
do makeup you just know how to do it
some people just some people are
self-taught and stuff like I knew I knew
how to do makeup before I went to school
for it but I still felt like and I
wanted that extra you know something
under my belt because back then I really
wanted to work at Mac and it was easier
to work there if you know you went to a
school and had like a certificate and
like your certificate food or makeup or
whatever and the school that I once he
was like
good so that easily could have put me in
the door for working now I don't know
why I wanted to work this little bit but
so yeah that just I didn't want to be in
that type of atmosphere so I decided to
just freelance and I started freelancing
probably none of you guys know that only
people will know that is the people
close to me and of course the people who
make up I did and like you know people
that know me I guess well yeah so anyway
I'm trying out this lipstick because
y'all know I really really wear like
purple lipstick whoa no that's a lot but
not this light of a purple at all so I
have like thousands of lipsticks that
like I just there and I don't never use
them so instead of not using them I
wanna you know try see which ones I like
and see which ones I don't like so this
is bat color pop of course because y'all
know I love their lip products this is
just taking too long for me I don't want
to say it let me see this way
so if you didn't know I freaking love
colourpop lip products and this is
actually this is actually what what what
collaboration it is freaking are not
alone super my son not unicorn what is
it my little pony yeah so my eye shadow
and what am I doing here y'all this is
just I think I'm gonna do it around
because and what decrese is this woman I
feel like oh my gosh this is not even
more you guys no wonder
oh I feel like these type of light
colors be making a teeth look yellow red
one other hand makes your teeth look so
freakin white but I love my red lipstick
yo if this light goes quiet I mean if I
like speed some up some parts up I don't
want to get copy written so if y'all
didn't know I love him that's my
beautiful brows see now this is much
better I don't know what the hell was
happening before hey God yep yep
you
yes oh I wanna do some different stuff
on my channel but I'm just so like I'm
not really stuff but I am stuck I don't
like I want to put stuff out that you
guys I'm gonna watch because I know you
really love weed single without them
that's um that's another reason why I
don't really do makeup on my channel
because everybody does it and it's like
do they really want to see me put on
some makeup like I don't know and then
one top of that like I don't be knowing
well I know looks but my eye the way my
eyelids is set up I don't like them
y'all need to fake so it's kind of hard
to see the eyeshadow for me
you
so yeah that's what it's looking like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
