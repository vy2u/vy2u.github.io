and I'm so mad that like the light is
officially going almost so yeah this
video is going to be pretty quick but I
just wanted to give you guys an update
on this levy hair 360 if you did watch
my initial review on this hair you know
that I made a way out of this hair and
I've been getting a lot of questions on
how the hair is holding up and things
like that now I'm gonna be honest of
course you know I don't wear this hair
every day or often but since I had it I
had one I have worn it around four times
and the four times that I did wear this
hair it's been absolutely life your like
when I say this has to be my favorite is
favorite this week that I've ever made
it's just like everything so I did not
watch the head yet sorry but um I just
been loving how the hair looks and as
you can see the hair still is solved I
have not received any tingling from this
head when I say I have not received any
tingling I have not received any
tingling from this hair shedding I do
get a little bit of shut-in here and
there but it's not bad or anything to
complain about because of course all
hair sheds but Tanglin not in an 8 not
nothing like when I say I don't get
tingling from his hair it's just like
super soft I love this look so let me
just update you guys on how I wear the
unit and stuff like that um before I get
started this is a human hair
I'm gonna leave my initial review to
this hair in my description box so you
guys can check that out um but yeah I
just mostly went like that I have the
win it I'm in a half up half down I can
also pull this up in a ponytail I know
some people complain about how it like
fits their head and
not really like they wouldn't be able to
pull their hair up into a ponytail but I
will show you so you can see that I can
pull this hair up into a ponytail now
I'm gonna tell you what I did
firstly I um I laid my lace down we've
got to be glue I do have a video on that
but yeah I laid my my like lace down
we've got to be glued so that's what's
holding the wig down now as far as like
how the back is holding down and I'm
able to put it up until a ponytail yeah
I did add clips to the back so it can
stay down but this wig is very versatile
it gives you that oh and I also pluck
around the hairline a little bit just to
make it a little bit more realistic
y'all I'm like when I say I'm so in love
with this week I met you can't really
see this week's true beauty but if you
want like a clear of a clear view on how
the wig looks definitely check out my
first video on this week but y'all if
y'all didn't know I was wearing a wig
y'all will probably think that this was
my hair or stuff like look at this you
guys
it just looks so ready so yeah what I
recommend is head I definitely will
recommend this head nothing has changed
I still like the 360 lace closure hands
down this has to be one of the best
weeks I ever made and it turned out so
good it's like perfect
I was thinking about selling it but then
I was like so I might so stay tuned for
that but like this is my baby oh when I
tell y'all this week that I made is my
baby like it never fails me I feel like
for something quick and easy like I can
just throw it on and it looks like this
or like if I want to pull it up in a
ponytail I can do that like if I need to
run to the store but I feel like this
week does not lay down properly without
me gluing it down or gelling it down
with the got to be glue so that's the
only thing that I really don't like is I
have to take the time to really like um
I have to take the time to really lay
the lace down because I feel like this
way it has to be like laid down with
some kind of glue or gel whatever you
use to lay your lace down so this is the
hair I'm sorry y'all it's so dumb and
I'm trying to use like this artificial
light in and it's just not working out
they're good but y'all I'd be feeling
myself in this week if you follow me on
Instagram I did snap something instant
snap this hair is just in case you want
to check it out cuz I think I'm gonna
put this video out today so yeah you can
really see it in the light and stuff
like that but yeah honey look at this so
let me turn around so you guys can see
the back and see that I could definitely
so this is what the back looks like and
as you can see I can definitely weigh it
up into a ponytail if I wanted to which
I already did and it looks super cute
and I don't I don't have any complaints
about this hair I just I don't have
anything bad to say about this hair like
the only thing I could the only thing I
can say maybe that would be bad as the
shut-in and that's not even bad because
all hand sheds like you're going to get
some shutting no tangle in when I create
it this week I didn't have any problem
so if you have any questions or anything
feel free to leave it in my comment
section down below and I will talk to
you guys later
hate you
in fact that of nature I like the way
that light in hearing like yeah this
light it's too high
yes and I guess wearing lazy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
