week one sent to me from elevate styles
so I'll make sure I leave the links to
everything in my description box if you
want to check out this week or other
ways that they have available one
insight so anyway this is as you can see
a bulb unit and this is by Bella Bella
collection never of am I like did a
review on them never even heard of them
until just now and I have it in the
style diva and I have it in the color D
blue this is what the way it looks like
and you definitely cannot see the blue
color um to me it just looks I mean of
course in purple I mean in purple of
course in cult I meant in color oh my
gosh
of course in person you can see you can
see the color but one is camera is
really not showing up it's true color
it's not like a bright blue or anything
like that is definitely settled um and
just the right amount of blue I feel
like you can see it more in like the
daylight or like the sunlight but it's
definitely a subtle blue um this week
definitely fits my hair big so if you
have a more um like normal to larger
size head this week will fit you so
perfect um yeah cuz I had on my head is
small by the way so I do have a lot of
room in the back and my straps are
adjusted to his tightest I'm if I didn't
mention this is a synthetic unit so the
wig did not come like this when I
received it the ends were a little bit
bent like that which I hate it so I took
my flat iron
I took my straight nut and just went
down on it a little bit and mind you
this week does have a
Yankee texture and it did not you it did
not lose its yuckiness
when I strained it so that's a plus but
now I feel like it's such a drastic
change from like the back to the side it
doesn't gradually go in like it doesn't
gradually go into a bub I feel like it's
just like extra long right here I don't
know I'm I'm really not offended at I
feel like I want to cut it just to see
what it would look like shorter so I
might do that I'm so yeah as far as the
part I really really like the part you
guys now the part is basically like skin
top it's like a little slither of lace
right there and then the rest of the
part is skin top so what I did was I
plucked the part where it was laced a
little bit and then I just plucked the
skin top a little bit like some hairs
out a little bit right here and then the
rest is just normal skin top so I only
plucked a little bit in the front
basically now some people might not like
this but you definitely can see that
like the like you can see where the lace
ends and then the UM and then like the
scalp begins it kind of has that like
indentation or like I don't know I don't
even know if you can see it but it has
like you can tell where the skin top
starts and I don't really like that so
if you wanted to put some concealer or
powder right there you can but I feel
like if I do but if I do that it's going
to mess up the naturalness that this
part is given to me so I just feel like
it probably would be best if you just
leave it along I'm just going to spin
around cuz I'm like getting anxious with
these pieces right here I just want to
cut them off so I am going to stay on
camera when I
why I thought happened this week honey I
have not received any tangley Oh any
tingling any tangling or shedding this
wig feels amazing this week is amazing I
don't know what to say it's amazing
online but as far as tangling shedding I
have not received any tingling or any
shedding I feel like these are one of
the ways that's going to last you longer
of course because it's shorter and my
BOB units always lets me months and
months so yeah and today start getting
stiff but it's easy to manage above
versus curls and all of it I'm just
going to speed it up as I cut because
everybody really should know how to cut
I'm not really a pro at this but I'm
definitely going to cut this off because
it's annoying me
okay so this is my end result and I'm
really really really really loving this
wig so yeah I felt like it turned out
really nice I'm comment down below what
you guys think about you know the cut do
you like it better before I cut it or do
you like it after I cut it so like I
said if you're interested in this wig I
will leave everything in my description
box I will leave links where you can
just buy it direct link so you can
purchase this week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
