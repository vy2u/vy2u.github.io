I'm so calm hey guys it's Kate of course
and I'm back with a another video so
this video is gonna be on this hair of
course and this hair was sent to me from
Sam's Beauty this is actually a bundle
hair that I made into also this is gonna
be a giveaway video for you guys so stay
tuned to the end so you can hear all the
details for this giveaway so what's so
special about this video will be mainly
gonna be focusing on besides the bundle
hair as the cat because the cap already
comes with a lace closure so if you're
lazy or just haven't mastered how to sew
your closure on to you can't have no
fear because this is an actual kit that
you can buy that already comes with a
lace closure so they have 2000's they
have the lace closure and they have
where that's where you can part cut the
hair that's within a closure any way you
want
and then they have a second style which
is the lace part closure and that just
comes with just the part so you won't be
able to part it anywhere it's just like
a set part this is by the brand la flair
unprocessed Brazilian version remy human
hair and I have the full bar for lace
closure cap and it is straight hair the
texture is straight and I have it in 12
inches and they did send me three
bundles of 14 16 and 18 and I basically
still had a whole bundle of the 14 left
over so it is nice bundle sizes that you
get I know a lot of people don't really
buy a beauty supply hair anymore but
this hair is actually good and of course
I had to go ahead and dye it just to see
if it died good because I know that was
gonna be like a lot of you guys this
question and yes it does take the bleach
pretty well the only thing I will say
about bleaching this hair is not going
to get as like
as you wanted to get so if you plant
don't bleach in his hair and you wanted
it to be like light like 613 like you're
not gonna be able to lift his head that
Brian I think this is the lightest that
you can go but I actually wasn't looking
to bleach the head like really like a
light blonde color and I really think
that this color is so nice it doesn't
look like brassy or anything this is
just how they came out and I really
really love the color and I actually
think that I did a really nice job on
the color I swear you're like I feel
like I'd be underestimated myself I
don't know why I'm so hard on myself but
I thought I took a look at this week I
was like dig this really sure enough
look like I bought this like this I
literally was slamming bleach everywhere
on this way it was no type of way that I
bleached this week I mean of course in
the top earlier I kind of like streaked
it a little bit if you do I'm saying
like I didn't put the bleach directly on
it like I stroked it with this brush
right held on like this brush I like you
stroked it like drip careful that's what
I did and that's just how it came out
and of course I did start at the bottom
and then I worked my way up that's why
the bottom is lighter than the top but I
actually really loved it and as you can
see like some spots are not as blond as
other spots because of course I was just
putting a bleach wherever it was not no
it wasn't a set place that I was
bleaching the hair because I wanted this
type of look and it actually came out
how I wanted it so yeah as far as
bleaching the hair you can bleach this
hair but it's not gonna get real real
light if you was looking for like a
light 6:13 blonde you're not gonna get
this from this wig but it does bleach
and it turned out beautifully from the
bleach this head did not get damaged
from me bleaching the hair it feels
exactly the same as when it wasn't
bleached so I definitely give this hair
a thumbs up on them so like I said I'm
gonna go ahead and answer a
clip of what this wig cap looks like it
definitely made things much easier as
far as making this week because the only
thing I had to do was so the tracks on
so I really appreciate that
I definitely love how the cap and
everything is because it is like an edit
cap and it does give you the adjustable
straps in the back and it also gives you
don't you know how to weeks come with
like the little tabs that you put like
that you kind of like can line at your
temples it comes like that also I did
bleach the knots on this closure and I
will say that the knots did not bleach
you with so ever and I'm really not
upset about the knots not bleach them
because as you can see the part looks
natural I did not pluck this part off
any powder or concealer to the part
whatsoever and that's how natural this
part looks you guys like look at that so
the only thing I'm when is my stocking
cap underneath and it is a nude color
but I didn't add any concealer or powder
I added nothing to put I didn't pluck
the pot this is just how it is and I
just think that it came out really
really nice now as far as how I cut it I
literally just cut this hair I just felt
like this length just fit more for this
style in this color it just added some
earth to this hair because at first the
hair was like down here and I just
wasn't feeling it so I decided to cut it
up to here and a little Barb and it
looks really good I definitely love the
messy type look and
