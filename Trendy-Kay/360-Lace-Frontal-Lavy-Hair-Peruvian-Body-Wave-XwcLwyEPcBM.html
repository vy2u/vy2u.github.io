hair review and I received his hair from
levy hair company of course you guys
know that I love me some levy hair
company but anyway this this video is
gonna be at a bit different because I
used to me reviewing wigs from levy hair
company but no honey I made my own wig
out of bundle hair so they did send me
um some bundle hair in this 360 lace
frontal closure which everybody is
talking about so when they exited I want
to review the 360 you know close your
jump off thing I was like oh yeah I
spring in my way cuz I want to try it
out even yet this is the hair and I
think that it's so pretty you guys and I
love the lips so I'm not sure of the
lips right now but I will leave them on
my screen and let you guys know but this
is three bundles and it is the 360
closure so I'm going to insert a clip
every when you get your bundles this is
what it will come in the same as how the
weeks come you will get a way cap and
these are my three bundles I have I have
16 18 and 20 I believe also have a 14
inch closure which is the 360 lace
closure and it just goes all the way
around in a circle so this is not going
to be a tutorial anything but I'm just
going to like give your idea of how you
can make your own wig so I just put it
on a mesh dome cap and sold it down and
this is what it looks like and for my
next track which is my longest I'm
putting at the bottom and I just doubled
it up and now I'm showing you the 18
that I added in the middle and then the
16 on top which I still had a lot left
but this is what you're going to cut off
and then once I cut it off it just looks
like a regular wig and it does come off
adjustable straps and it's really nice
I'm part of myself because it really
turned out good and this is how the week
looks and that's all the hair that's
left over so the wig is all completed
this is how it looks I didn't wash it
this is the natural curl pattern which I
really really appreciate this I mean it
just looks like so nice this is the
perfect length you definitely are going
to need like some got to be glue or
however you lay your edges down you're
gonna need it because you just know I
mean you can but I left some lace so
that I can have the baby hair so I'm
going to eventually I'm not glue but
like Jo mines down with the got to be
glued it looks so natural look at the
part you guys and I do have my nude
stocking cap worn but this hair is so
bum okay so the thing that tripped me
out with this whole 360 type of closure
okay so don't mind me right here you
bout to witness some craziness because
this whole conversation just went laughs
like I literally could not explain to
y'all what I was trying to say so yeah
comment down below if you can understand
what I was trying to say
Oh frontal I thought it was a great idea
and I was like okay I'm going to try it
but I was thinking how would that work
out because if they send me a 14 inch
you know 360 frontal closure and they
send me a teen I think this is 18 maybe
18 no I think the closure is 14 I don't
know whatever the case may be the
closure is shorter than the bundle hairs
so I'm like it is 14 in a bank because
you know the closure is like a circle so
it is 14 in a bit and then I'm
like an 18 inch or whatever interested
is with it can you be able to tell
underneath so that was my main concern
but actually it blends in pretty good
and you can't help so if you would like
me and was wondering well how would they
have they get from like short to long
back to short like it works out because
this is what it looks like and you
basically can't even tell well it starts
like that but you can't you can't tell I
haven't received any shedding from this
head it doesn't really tangle up I'm
going to leave this curl like this
because I just like how it looks this is
going to be pretty quick but overall
this looks so good so if you wanted to
try out the 360 um
front tools and the bundles to go with
it you can I think it's definitely worth
it and it's better to me than um a lace
closure because I don't know and you
don't have to use so many bundles
because I still have a lot of hair left
over like literally and this thing is
full so I feel like it definitely is
worth it um it's so easy to make it's
just I don't know it's better but I love
it
look at this hair I'm trippin because it
just looked hold on let me take this off
so I can show you guys the goodness of
this week because I know y'all want to
see it and how I put it on so this is
what it looks like under my hair looks
like underneath and yeah I don't have
like none of my edges out or anything
like this because this does come with
the baby s and I'm going to use their
babies in that mines because for some
reason I just want to have all my head
covered up so yes so I'm just going to
show you how easy it is just like put
this on and you're good nice I'm trying
to tell you it looks so freakin natural
and I did make this with an mesh dome
cap not the regular one but the mesh one
and I sold this to the mesh cap
laughs oh wow but yeah that's really it
is really not much to this hair I just
think it's so gorgeous
I'm going to leave levy hair company in
my description box I might have a cold
keep on cold for you guys so just make
sure you check out my description box
for all the links to this hair and
coupon codes and everything else and yes
I'll see you in my next video
