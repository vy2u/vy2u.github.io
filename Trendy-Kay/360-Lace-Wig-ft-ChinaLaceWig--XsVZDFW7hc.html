video and this video is going to be on
this hair that I'm wearing so if you
follow me on snapchat beeping you've
probably already seen this hair because
I do post like different stuff on my
snapchat and Instagram just in case you
can't find me on youtube you definitely
will be able to find me on Instagram and
snapchat mainly snapchat I'm up and down
with both of them like sometimes I post
on my Instagram event sometimes you know
I'll take a break from Instagram and
post on my snapchat but ethically I
posted a picture of this of me wearing
this and a lot of you guys liked it so I
just wanted to show you how I achieved
this look even though you this is kind
of like this is really old this braid is
super old but this video is kind of
going to be chopped in through because I
did all this stuff on like different
days and stuff like that but this hair
has been in this braid for a while now
and yet if I look different it's because
I don't have any lashes on or like my
face is not always um you know done up
or anything like that
so I would sit this wig from lace china
lace wigs and this is what the Peggy
doing looks like I'm just going to show
you the packaging because another clip I
try to show you all the packaged enemy
unboxing it taking it all out and I just
look really crusty in a mess and I have
stains on my shirt it was crazy
but um yeah so this is what the box
looks like that it comes in and it's
really nice packaging I think it looks
really sleek even though the black and
gold make them so then also the way they
come inside of this and I out at like
the Clint the rest of the clips of me
showing you you know what the wig looks
like - or not
so yeah overall this week is OK for me I
wouldn't say like oh my gosh it's my
favorite but if you are looking for an
affordable if you are looking for an
affordable lace front wig definitely
check them out the shipping was pretty
fast the hair is really nice it's I mean
this wig doesn't stand out from any
other wig that I had reviewed so it's
just this wing is just okay for me but
it's not a bad wig if you get one sense
don't meet does tangle in this wig does
shed the shedding is not too bad the
tables for me was not really that bad
either but you do have to detail this
hair I did also curl this hair and
straightness hair and the texture is
really good and it also keeps the curl
really good and I'll just insert a clip
showing you guys what um what the hair
it looks like straightened and what it
looks like when I took a piece and curls
it but I did use the got to be glue to
glue down the lace so that's how this
wig is stand out if anybody was curious
and what else oh yeah
this way they also come with baby hairs
but the baby there's this extra line so
I did go ahead and and cut them just so
they can look more realistic oh yeah so
if you are a person who likes baby heads
on your units this one comes with aeneas
but you just have to cut them down
because they're extremely long but yeah
I definitely love this wig in this type
of hairstyle um it is a little ratchet
right now because I've been wearing this
wee
eight for a while and I didn't really
switch it up it's just been integrate
for a long time to you so this is how
I'm currently when this hair and I just
got tired of the break so I just took it
out I didn't like re-watch it or
anything like that I just basically
brushed out the wig or whatever and I
just crowded with my curlers and it
would be smart for me to go get the
curler so y'all can see what I use to
hold on army right I'm sorry I'll be
more organized another time okay so
these are the Kremlin's that are used
for um well okay so these are the
curlers that I use to achieve this look
and basically I was just going any kind
of direction like it really didn't
matter I wasn't trying to make it
perfect but yeah so I use this and these
are hot tools professionals that's what
it says I got these for Christmas from
my little sister so yeah she bought me
these and I love these these go up to
4:30 and when I tell you these things
get so hot so thank you boom for Barney
these because these are amazing at first
I was like cuz like the clamp look at
the clamp like look how hot it is and
then look how short it is I'm sorry
cuz I'm really Rodney's and curls right
network that looks free so that's it for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed and I
will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
