you say is gotta let us be honest guys
it's Kate and I'm back with another
video so this video is gonna be a little
different because it's gonna be four
weeks in one video so if you are looking
for six thirteen week
yes blonde again you guys and I wasn't
about to make four separate videos on
blonde wigs because I'm kind of low-key
over the blonde
so these wigs were sent to me from
Missouri Hollywood and he actually sent
me three blonde wigs and then I already
had boy on my own a blonde wig from them
so yeah I just figured why don't I just
show you guys in one video so this is
where I I'm starting off with my wig cap
just so I can share these wigs with you
so if you are looking for a 6 13 week
then this is the video the video for you
or you might just like the style and
want to get it in a different color so
if you're not a fan of 6:13 wigs just
look past the color and look at the
style so the first week I want to do a
long two short alright well do this one
this is kensey and it's in the beyond
your majorly of beyond your imagination
collection so this is what this week
looks like and basically it's a moon
part week I don't know I feel like they
could have just did like a whole like
frontal or whatever the case may be but
we'll see so of course I had this in the
color blonde and the name is kensey if
you didn't catch that but yeah this is
what the star card looks like
already if you do have a if you do have
a bigger size head this wig is going to
be snug on you because my head is extra
small and my stripes it's not even
adjusted yet and my head is filling out
this way so I don't think that this week
is going to be a big head friendly I
couldn't open rayon so without any doing
anything I definitely love the curls on
this week see I just wish that they
would have sent me if y'all listening
out there noises please don't send me no
more blonde wigs yes I just wish that
this wig was in a another color because
the weight of these Carol's are set up
it's amazing so I'm just gonna brush it
real quick to see if I get any shedding
and I don't even really know if this is
probably from this week because I was
but when a blonde week this weekend and
that thing the shed
so yeah the curls on this is pretty good
so let me take this out and what I do
notice is it's very very thick right
here and in the middle I don't think
that this is lazy I just think that it's
track which is so the only Lakes parting
that you're getting is this putt right
here so no lace in the middle or nothing
like that and they give you this little
teeny bit of lace on a hand line right
here that's it so I went away this week
in this color like with a ponytail on
the top I don't know I kind of just like
the way the curls look so I don't feel
like I need to wear in a ponytail but
actually this wig is gorgeous oh my
goodness I was not expecting the curls
to look like this I definitely wish I
had this wig in another color and if you
like that high-up type of film I don't
know what you would call that but if you
like your wigs I'm at the hair like to
sit up like that it definitely works
look at this look at that pardon though
the pardon as a side part looks
absolutely amazing
so for these wigs I'm really not going
to cut off the lace because I don't want
this video to be too long but if I was
to style this way this is exactly how I
would wear literally and as you can see
it didn't take no type of effort that
looks amazing I probably would take some
heat just a little bit because it does
not lay down so I don't get any shedding
from this wig I don't receive its hanger
Lana yet and this week
is a Yankee texture this is really
really cute I'm definitely going to go
back in by this week and another color
oh yes honey this is really really
really really cute and already I felt
like you don't even have to pluck the
part or anything like that
all right so this is the first week
which I thumbs up I just wish that it
was in another color but overall I
definitely really like this week I'm not
really a fan of the moon that moon
part I I don't know I feel like it's
kind of pointless okay so let's move on
to the second week and this is a longer
one and it's straight this is from the
beyond your imagination collection as
well and I have it in a style Kitty
and in the color blonde of course so
this is what the packaging looks like
that is what the wig looks like on the
model so let's open it up basically this
is like the first week where offers you
the moon shaped pardon
I am getting some shedding straight out
with the pic so right here is three
strands of hair that's one so the
density on this is really nice it's not
too thick but not too thin it's just
like just in the middle yeah this feels
really really natural I did get a couple
of snags on the bottom so let me back up
so y'all can see what this is
look at my not really all up in your
face alright so I will say that this is
around 18 inches long
so actually I'm going to go and put heat
to it just to see how it lays and then
I'll be right back okay so I'm back this
is really nice once you like flatten the
top part now if you're looking for it to
be like really flat I do feel like you
can get it really flat but honestly it's
so thick up in this part like you'll
probably have to do it in layers and put
heat on it all the way up until you get
to this part if you get what I'm saying
just so it can lay flatter but I just
put the heat right here and it flattens
it out a little bit
okay yeah so moving on to the next week
and these the other tooth the last two
are short a week so this was also sent
to me and this is from the Sasi a lively
spirit collection and this is in the
style am i you I don't know how to
pronounce that but as am i you and I
have it in the color blonde of course
this is what it looks like
sorry I can probably see the glare would
let me take out
and we just try this
so now already I can tell that this is
big hip friendly it's definitely has it
definitely has more room than the last
week also the last two weeks
also this doesn't have any lace that you
cut off it just comes with a part which
you guys know I'm really not a fan of
you know the weights not coming with any
lace to cut off just because that part
up here just be thick but the part looks
really good it is really deep now as far
as this down I don't really know how I
feel about this okay so so far this is a
light yaki texture again this wig is
really dull it has basically no shine to
it so yeah let me just brush it so I can
see what's going on
so now we're moving on to the last week
and this was actually a week that I
purchased myself and this is from the
beyond your imagination collection and I
have it in a style Imani which I really
really loved this week I actually had
this wig and a color 1b 30 which looks
so gorgeous and I will show you but I'm
trying to keep it like 613 friendly so
this whole video is just on 613 ways
you
and the density is really thick and as
far as this shine there is no shine so
I'm just going to put this on for you
guys and actually Amani is one of my
favorite wigs if you did not know it's
kind of reminiscent of the Ivan week but
just as a side part as far as like the
thickness and how they feel and
everything like that they are exactly
the same wig just one is a side part and
I feel like you will probably have to
put more work on this side then this
side because this side leaves is so nice
and then this side it kind of like feels
like you have to brush it and make it
how you want it to be even though my
other wig I have and my other color I
have in this week both sides leave very
well so I guess it all depends on your
wig or the color that you have so
so as far as tangling and shutting I do
get some strands of hair not a lot but I
do get some shedding and tingling I
don't get any tangling from this wig
yeah
but yeah this is overall a really nice
nice wig I hope you enjoyed this video
let me know if you like in-depth videos
like this like straight out the package
of me trying it won't for you guys I
would really like to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
