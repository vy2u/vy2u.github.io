hey guys it's Kate of course in a back
with a another video so I'm continuing
my blonde streak you guys so I'm coming
at you with another a belong wig so this
one was sent to me from Sam's Beauty and
this is the new born free slimline lace
part wig and I have it in the style slw
26 and it's in the color 613 so this is
what the picture looks like which I feel
like this is a nice everyday type of
week I love this week because it has so
many color options so if you are into
the blonde type of wigs but you like
more of a dark route they do offer you
duck routed colors which I really love
so they do have a variety of colors just
in case you do want to purchase this
weight so anyway let's get onto the
construction so they come with your
typical construction sorry I got him so
it comes with your typical construction
which is two combs and a front one right
here and another right here it also
comes with a comb and a bag and
adjustable straps I feel like this week
is big hair from me but if you do have a
smaller sized head just go ahead and
adjust your strips and if it's really
good like it's nice and snug on my head
one thing I don't like about this week
is it doesn't come with lease like it's
not a lace front it's just a lease
pardon so with the lace part it doesn't
give you lease on the hairline it just
gives you a straight-laced part because
it's no lace on the hairline you don't
have no least cut off so that's kind of
like a good thing and a bad thing in my
case the good thing is I don't have to
cut off any lace the bad thing is that
it doesn't have any lace on a hair line
which I prefer at least on my head line
because it just makes it more natural
and I feel like when it's not any lace
on the head line it just makes it really
bulky up in here the Parden space right
here in the beginning it's like really
thick and I do have a method on how you
can make that
look more natural and I'll go ahead and
leave the video in the description box
but yeah that's basically what I did I
just use my method to make it you know
more natural and the lease to stay down
flat even though when it started out it
wasn't that bad or thick so if you don't
feel like cutting actually so if I feel
like you can definitely get away with
you know when it like it comes however
the part is very slim it's a lot of hair
in a part so you will have to pluck the
hairs a bit now if you don't feel like
plucking the heads you can probably
still get away with just winning how it
comes and I would say that you should
edge your concealer or finishing powder
into the puck just to make it appear a
little bit more natural but I went in
and I went ahead and plucked the hairs
out of the part just to widen it up a
bit and I feel like it looks really good
so this is what the part it's looking
like so yeah also I added a little water
and cut any baby hairs in this wig but I
did go ahead and use my god to be glue
Joe just to swoop some hairs on the side
cuz it was looking kind of naked
but yeah that's the only thing I did too
this week other than that the wig pretty
much comes like this this is a week that
you can just put on and go you don't
really have to do too much old you don't
really have to put in too much work am I
saying right you really don't have to
put too much work in this wig so yeah I
definitely think this is so cute it's a
nice little wavy messy looking bulb so
yeah if you're into bugs I think this is
a good one to get also you probably want
to use like some dry shampoo or baby
powder just the door down to shine
because it is a tiny bit on the shiny
side I didn't do anything to door down a
shine just because I don't feel like it
but if you don't like that shine if you
don't like your wigs shiny then I would
suggest you doing it but this is
basically what the weight looks like as
far as the texture this is
like a silky texture is not a Yankee at
all so if you're into the Moy Yankee
which you probably won't like this one
yes not I feel like it's not really it
might be like hmm no I feel like is more
on the I feel like it's more on a silky
side to me
also this wig does shed I've been
getting quite a few strands of hair as
you can see right here you probably
can't see it because the hair is blonde
but this is probably like five strands
of hair right here and yeah as far as
tangling though this week does not
tingle but it definitely sheds and
remember I didn't have no laces to cut
off on this week so I can't blame it on
that so yeah keep that in mind but
besides that this is actually a really
nice wig just that's it for this video I
told y'all I'm gonna be bringing out
some videos but they are gonna be quick
so sorry but yeah I love you guys and
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
