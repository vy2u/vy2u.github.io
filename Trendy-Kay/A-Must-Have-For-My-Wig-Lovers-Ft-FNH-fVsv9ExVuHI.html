how the game goes just want someone to
hold everybody needs somebody to be
there we're never loan I just want you
to save me
just want you to say
hey guys it's Kate and I'm back with
another video
yeah it's honey do you see this hair so
this week was sent to me from a Friday
night hair and I will here leave all
Friday night hair links in my
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested so the week I'm
wearing is in the style GI last 25 and I
have it in a color 1b I don't think that
this I actually do no wait I I think I'm
not sure I'll leave in my description
box if this wig is available in other
colors besides 1b but yeah I got this
week in a 1b and I'm gonna make this
quick because my camera is going dead so
yeah this is the car it does come with
umm it does come with tape just in case
you wanted to take down a lace but this
way it came with Hartley's and I feel
like when the lace is hard like it's
more secure so you don't have to worry
about gelling or gluing or taping the
lace down so yeah if you don't like
holidays just keep in mind that this
week does coming with holidays so yeah
I'm basically the construction of this
wig is your typical lace front it has
lace in the front so it gives you the
option to part it whatever you want to
the only thing about heaven
the only thing about this lace front is
it doesn't give you a lot of room for
cutting trees so what I like to do is I
like to just flip the head either to the
left or the right or do like a little
style like this because like I said the
parting space is it's not a lot of
parting space so it doesn't really look
a natural party because nobody wears
their part this short but besides that
the hair is absolutely gorgeous
so this camp size is a bit tight so if
you do have a bigger size here keep that
in mind my straps are adjusted so if
your head is a little big just maybe
don't adjust the straps but if you have
a smaller size head just go ahead and
the Jesse n strips and this thing is
actually fitting so tight I probably
don't need to adjust my straps my yeah
I'm definitely not a big help from you
so this week comes with two combs and a
front okona Bank and adjustable straps
and this is basically what the wig looks
like this is how the curls came and I am
going to go ahead and insert a clip of
what the wig looks like straight out the
peg
you
this week has shed a little and still
shudder it's not really been at all like
I would get like two strands of hair so
yeah it's not constantly shutting or
nothing like that but I did get a couple
strands of hair um as far as tangling it
does snag a little bit as I was trying
to like pluck the curls out with my
fingers so keep in mind that I feel like
this week it's going to tangle up on you
as time goes by but yeah for the most
part I just left the curls the way they
originally came I kind of like did like
this a little bit but besides that I
wanted to keep its natural curl because
I don't know I'm just feeling the way
the curls come already so basically all
I did was just put it half up half down
and that's basically where you put a
ponytail on the top and leave the back
out now as you can see in the clips this
came with like a bang condo or like
short pieces around the hairline so I
just decided to leave the short pieces
out as if it was like a bang and put the
rest up into like this little ponytail
which I really really really really love
this look it was a little bit long so I
went in and just clipped it a little bit
so it could be like above my eye and it
actually looks really realistic because
you can see the lace it looks like a
scalp world like this thing right here
y'all I am definitely feeling this hair
I'm feeling this style it is on the
longest side it is about 24 inches
stretched so yeah it's pretty long but
it's so nice it is lightly it's not too
thick but it's not thin it oh it's
definitely a nice density and I
definitely love the fact that they cut
these little layer pieces in the front
it definitely works for this type of wig
so yeah it definitely works with this
look I am really feeling this okay
Friday night
come through this week is bomb yes your
I am really feeling this look ya'll this
look is spicy okay like this sure enough
like okay I didn't found my look for the
day it's my third time doing a video and

most like what are we doing like come on
