review okay this week is so freaking
gorgeous I love this color to death
so if you haven't noticed the unit that
I have on my head is by free trust equal
and this is what the picture looks like
I have it in the color sop emerald let's
get into this wig
I do believe well I'm not sure so I'm
just gonna estimate how long this wig is
so I think it's around 24 to 26 inches
it's pretty long so the lace parting
right here which you can see but the
Parden is amazing when I got up close on
a part it was like of course the
hairline is always and then they give
you about this much space
that's real lace and then from there on
it's like a fake scalp
that's the only thing it has the skin
top part so it still really does look
realistic it doesn't um bother me so I'm
not like upset about it but it just was
a shock because of Mike oh but I mean
it's okay so if you're not a fan of skin
type parts then I wouldn't suggest that
you get this way go this week might not
be for you because it does have the skin
top um part and it only has a little bit
of lace so what I did do because the
lace part
like you could not really see the part
so I did pluck out that much to make it
blend in with the fake part so that's
what it's looking like this week does
come with two combs on the side they're
like not up here they are ones right
here and ones right here and then you
have a comb in the back and you have
your adjustable straps the wake fits
pretty good on my head
like when I first tried it one it was
okay but I still need the adjustable
shrimp so if it fit my head pretty good
but to make it more snug I'm you know
adjusted my straps to fit my head sides
so the cap I would say is a nice size I
think if you probably have if you have a
really big head then this probably would
be tight when you hit so yeah um when I
first got this wig out of the package
the curls did not look like this they
was like more uniformed and they kind of
was like I don't know you haven't seen
them synthetic wigs and they have curls
in it but they not blend it together
like they just have something like this
picture like it was something like that
but bends though I had this color it
looked like real Barbie ish like it
didn't look natural like real hair so I
just brushed it all out and this is what
it did when I did brush the curls out it
gave me kind of like a look like dry
like I don't really know if you guys can
see it really good in the camera but
when I brushed it out it kind of reminds
you of how like you bleach your hair and
it gets dry that's basically what it
looks like so I kind of like it and then
I
don't cuz it's giving me like a real
head type of feeling but it looks dry
though so yeah this has pretty soft it's
really soft um also when I got it out of
the packaging when I when I brush the
wig out this is all the hair that I got
so as you can see this wig sheds a lot
and like now it's still shedding yeah
like it's oh but that's all the head it
came out of this way overall I really
like the wig if you don't mind the
shedding I haven't got any tangling out
of this week out of this week but I have
got a lot of shedding so that stuff
doesn't bother me I love the color but
it's just gonna take me some getting
used to because this is like out there
but you know I want it to be different
and try something new so yes this is
what the wig looks like and this is Suzy
so sorry fall this weekend
okay so for those of you who wanted to
see how to wait look on the side as a
side part this is basically what the wig
looks like on the side so one more thing
before I leave I forgot to mention that
this week that this week is from wig
types
comm of course and this wig was also 35
to 36 dollars I'm not exactly sure what
the price was but I believe between 35
and 36 dollars so um yeah that's pretty
much it
if you have any questions feel free to
leave them in the comment box down below
and also anything that I think that I
left out that I did not say I will
definitely put it in the description box
