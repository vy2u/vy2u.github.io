back with another video so this video is
gonna be on this gorgeous hair and this
hair was sent to me from oMG her hair
and I'll go ahead and leave all the
links in the description box just in
case maybe you guys are interested so
let me just tell you the details on this
hair so I am wearing their own braids
light yaki bug style at least for an
indian birmingham that's the title so
the hair line is pre pluck the hair
texture is a light Yankee the hair color
is of course this light this own braid
Brown which it says same as pictures or
whatever the picture is that's what you
will put if you was to go and purchase
this way the hair length is 12 inches
the hair density is 150 percent the cap
construction is a 4 inch part in room
and front glueless lace front wig with
combs and adjustable strap the hair
color is medium brown and the weight
size is average which is like 22 inch
circumference so yeah like I said all
the information and details will be in
the description box just in case any of
you guys want to check out this wig this
is what that packaging looks like so
this is what the wig comes in and it
just looks like this and when you open
it up it will of course have the wig in
there it also comes with an elastic band
but you do have to sew this on you guys
and it also comes with weight caps when
I receive the wig it came straight of
course and I didn't even get any
tangling or shutting up
on me receiving the wig now I did go in
and bleach tinnitus which that was a
huge mistake you guys because I over
bleached tonight's and the bleach got on
the hair so it just looked a hot mess
even though I don't think that you can
really tell and camera or like in person
I think I did a good job trying to like
conceal it whoops the baby hands but I
definitely over not over plucked over
bleach the knots and I was a little bit
upset about that because like I said I
do love this weight so yeah I did go in
and bleach the nice and I also went in
and pluck the hair line now when you get
the wig I don't really think that like
if it's optional if you want to go back
and and pluck the hair line but me I
just wanted to look a little bit more
natural so I did go in and pluck a few
more hairs but when you receive it it
does look pretty natural well if you
didn't feel like plucking a hair line
you don't have to so yeah I bleach to
not pluck the hair line now this is part
of on the side and this is how much less
you get but when you part it in the
middle you get more party room to play
with so when you put it in the middle
this is where the lace tops so of course
it's much longer than this so keep that
in mind
once I bleach the knots I went in and of
course I had to wash this hair after I
washed it I still did not receive any
shedding or is handling you guys now I
do love the texture on this just
everything about this week I love I
haven't had any issues with this week
thus far I am like really pleased it
just looks so girly and flirty I
definitely love the curls on his wig
even straight it look really good
straight but I felt like I wanted to you
know curl it to give it a different vibe
so that's what I did like I said I did
go in and curl this with my flat iron I
think they was like think my flat irons
are like an inch and a half
if I'm not mistaken so yeah that's how I
achieved these curls and yet I do not
have any thing on the lace like two
later I didn't put anything on the lease
to lay the lace down I only adjusted my
straps and this is how it's fitting on
my head I have a smaller size head so I
did adjust my straps and I didn't use
the adjustable shrimp
I meant the little elastic band that
they provide you I just adjusted my
shrimps and this week like it fits so
good the lace laid down and everything
so I didn't have an issue if this week
being too big or anything like that so
I'm just going to turn around so y'all
can see this heavy
you
so also I'm definitely 11 the color let
me get up close and personal so y'all
can see this beautiful color and it's
like a chocolatey brown type color
almost like a color 30 if you familiar
with the color 30 look like but just a
tad bit darker than the color 30 but
along those lines it's really really
pretty I did use my god speed glue gel
for the baby hairs also I do think this
week came with baby hands but for me
plucking a hair line they kind of like
disappeared so I had to add some more
baby hairs and this week but I didn't
really go through him on the baby hairs
I just did it you know something slight
but yeah you can kind of see once I come
up close like me over bleach into knots
like I said it's not too noticeable but
you can definitely tell also make sure
you check the description box for a
coupon code for $10 off I'll go ahead
and leave it in the description bye yeah
that's pretty much it and yeah I'll see
you in my next video I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
