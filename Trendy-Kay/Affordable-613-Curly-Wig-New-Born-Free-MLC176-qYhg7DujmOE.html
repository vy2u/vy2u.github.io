controlling this better yeah
hey guys so I'm back with another video
and this video is going to be ordered
this hair right here and I was going to
tan from Sam City so I'll leave Sam
sweetie links in the description box
just in case any of you guys want to
check them out so yeah okay so I had the
news one free a magic lace curved part
lace front wig and I have it in a style
ml c 176 in a color dxy for six thirteen
now this is what the stock car looks
like and of course shoot freaking crazy
of not a villain I don't think anybody
will gravitate towards this way but
actually the wig is pretty nice now the
only thing that gravitated me to work
this week was the color the color that
she's wearing I love and I was like I
felt like the color will be popping with
this type of head so I wanted to get
this color that the model would land but
what if a client says that the color is
actually Brazilian blowing and on a
website they don't carry this color so I
assumed it was the the color that I had
with my head which is the DXY 6/3 to
come in for six thirteen for six
thirteen is basically like a dark root
which is number four which is like a
brown but it actually looks darker than
a number four the kind of looks for the
number two and then the rest of the hair
is six thirty thirteen color which is
the platinum blonde so yeah yeah I'm
kind of glad that I got this color cuz
it's like really really really popping
okay enough about this color okay so
onto this week this
not how the wig looks when you get it
straight out the pack now I didn't
really do too much to this wig but I
just want you to know that this is a lot
of hair so if you're not like a fan of
real big curly hair this probably
wouldn't be the way for you because the
hair on this wig is really thick and
it's really full so I had to go in and
cut some hair because it was just too
full for me I'm so yeah and originally
originally this is supposed to be a fat
part but I like how it looks more
towards the middle so I just kept it in
the middle it actually looks really nice
on the side as well so I do feel like if
you wanted to wear milk pot once a lot
both ways would look so long because the
wig overall is really a nice way now as
far as construction
it's just typical construction it has
two combs in the front a comb and
available suggestible strap if you have
a bigger size kid this wig will to
choose so nice I do feel like this is
big here for me but I do have my strips
adjusted so that's the reason why it's
good in my hair good so if you have a
smaller sized head like me I feel like
you can still wear this week you just
have to adjust the strap I don't like I
didn't any extra security like bobby
pins or anything like that because I
feel like the wig is the curve as it is
also the dark route is only towards this
hot pot it's not throughout the way so
be aware of that so when I receive the
wig in the mail I opened it up and I was
so pumped because I felt like the
weights that I had picked out to show
you guys was like real it is Mike it was
legit and I saw I felt like y'all was
really want to like it so anyway I
opened it up and I'm just looking like
in the back of my mind oh like I kind of
felt like this was going to be a dope
route 6:13 type of wig which it was
because I just felt like it was well I
put this wing or in this freaking wig
look so bad I look like a freaking cool
it didn't look so bad let me not see a
because I really much other to get this
wave this week is lit I'm telling you
and if you like big hair this hair is
let so anyway back to my little story of
so I put it on and I'm playing oh my
gosh
and right away I just put it back into
its packaging and everything like that
because I'm like I was presently on
showing you this wig because I felt like
it was just a total waste of my time
right okay so today as I'm getting ready
I did my little makeup and everything
and I'm like hmm a blonde wig with gold
so perfect well my makeup look this
camera I gotta get a new chemicals like
when I'm looking at a camera versus when
I look in the mirror I see something
totally different like I felt like I'd
be popping but then when I look in my
viewfinder it's like what what are you
doing girl anyway I put the wig back on
and you can edit in the mirror and I was
like okay I felt like the wig head
potentially so I was like maybe if I cut
it down it would be better and I just
basically cut the week there because
like I said it's so thick actually y'all
this ways reminds me of a week that I
just reviewed from Friday night it's a
wig is exactly the same like the texture
how I am how in that review I told you
all how like the back was a different
texture like it was more coarse and
curly than what the hell was that was
attached to believe so this hair is
exactly like that hair even though it's
not a lace part but the hair that's
attached on a perimeter and on the lathe
um the hair is kind of like a different
texture as in the tent this looks back
hair looks like it looks more frizzy and
cool too like hair and this one is more
the curls or define I'm not worried
about the different textures because you
can't really tell I feel like it all
blends in and comes together this week
really really looks really natural you
guys so it did
right here and I cut it right here like
I said it was a lot of hand so be aware
so this week does not have any shine and
that's what makes it look so realistic
it has like that dull dry looking look
yes like as if your head was really
bleach is giving me like the dry look
but I don't mind it because this is what
the pardon face looks like so I didn't
go in and plus my part I felt like this
to look I mean I felt like the part
really there needs to be plucked if you
didn't like one o'clock because I know
some people don't really like the
plucking their parts when their curly
units because they feel like the top
part is going to press up but actually
that did not happen to me at all like
the curls were still intact and mind you
I did not Plus this way out at all y'all
but anyway guys that's pretty much it
for this week oh yeah as far as tingling
and shuttin I have received a few
strands of hair so this week does a
little bit it's not crazy or anything
like that and as far as like tangling I
haven't received anything light of
course because I didn't run my fingers
through it but of course this way is
what a table I'm you can't even run your
hands through it because it's just like
really really curly so overall you're I
am very excited like I was not expecting
to love this week as much as I do I feel
like it just looks so freakin ik
you like I'm going to go ahead and turn
around so you guys can see what this
week looks like I don't really know how
it's looking at a bank because like I
say I did cut this wig so yeah but this
is what the front looks like
