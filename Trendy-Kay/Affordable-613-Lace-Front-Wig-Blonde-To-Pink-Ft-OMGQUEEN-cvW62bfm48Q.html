back with another video so this video is
gonna be on this heyo
and this hair was sent to me from OMG
Queen so if you're interested I'll go
ahead and leave all the links in the
description box so yeah basically they
sent me a six thirteen lace front wig
and I'm gonna have to read off like the
details for you or my phone but of
course y'all know when I get six
thirteen weeks are always like this
which I'm up and experiment with my
colors so if you're like me and you like
to experiment with colors or you just
like the color 6:13 definitely check the
link below because OMG Queen has some
great quality wigs especially two six
thirteen weeks also if you're not
familiar with the packaging looks like
this is what the packaging looks like
which is really cute of course I say
that all the time but I'm definitely
here for the paint so this is their
high-quality silky straight blonde 613
above lace wig and I have it in the
color 613 of course the hair type is
Indian version hair I have it in the
hair style so keep straight the length
is 12 inches the hair density is 150
percent which I don't think that the
hair density is 150 maybe 130 which I'm
not complaining about because you know
you don't want to have a density with
your vault the cap construction is kept
the glueless lace front this week does
come with baby hairs they also added an
elastic band which just helps adjust
better to your head size the hairline is
pre plucked and yeah that's everything
so of course I did go ahead and
dyed this hair I'll go ahead and insert
some clips of what this wig looked like
straight out the pack which it was
gorgeous but of course I just like to be
different so yeah and plus I've been
craving like pink hair so I'm like on
this pink hair streaks oh don't mind me
if you're not a fan of pig head just
like omit this video or just watch it
because you love me but yeah I've been
really crazy over pink hair lately you
guys I don't know if it's because of the
weather and it just fits but yeah so
anyway I'm gonna go ahead and insert the
clips and tell you guys what I did to
achieve this color so basically this is
what the wig looks like when I received
it and as you can see it's a really nice
6:13 color so I use three bottles of had
died but I only used well at first I use
two and then later on I use the other
one but I'll explain it and insert some
clips of that too okay so when I first
originally dyed this hair I used the
pink mania color and I also use the pink
petal now you guys know if you watch my
videos you know that I am a huge fan of
the adore colors but for some reason I
went to a different beauty supply store
and they offer this kiss brand which I
really fell in love with because the
color selection of this brand is just
out of this world so I ended up picking
these two colors now I did my day
purchase pink mania and two bottles and
I purchased the pink petal and one
bottle so at first I started on the
roots and I use the pink mania for the
roots and then for the rest of the hair
I use the pink petal and I'll insert
what that looked like after it was all
said and done but for some reason I just
didn't like the way it turned out so I
eventually went back in and I just dyed
the whole week the pink mania color
because of course
had one bottle left over this hair
definitely died really really nice you
guys I am failing this color it is a bit
bright and if you're not for the like no
roots then you can always in dark roots
to this week which I probably eventually
which I probably will do eventually but
right now I'm all for this color and you
definitely have to own this color like
if you're gonna win own it so yeah one
thing though
be careful when you do die the roots
because you want to make sure you get
close enough to the roots where you can
where you can't see the bond but you
also want to watch out for the lace
because the lace does die as well so you
don't want to really doubt Elysee
because it's just hard to get out I
don't even think you can get that stuff
out once it's on a lace but yeah so when
I first got this head my mistake was I
didn't go close enough to the roots and
you can still see like the blonde color
in the roots so that's my main reason
that I went back and just dyed the whole
week this color and of course the day
kind of get on the lace but you can't
really tell and you definitely can go in
and conceal it with like some finishing
powder or concealer whatever works for
you so yeah so yeah that's basically how
I got this look and I did not cut this
wig at all like I said before this week
did come pre pluck so you don't have to
pluck the hairline you don't have to cut
it the bub already comes a really nice
like this now of course I did watch this
head so this is what the hair looks like
in its natural state I don't know if I
inserted a picture already but I'll show
you what the picture I mean I'll show
you what the wait looks like and it's
straight state I definitely love the
natural state of its like a loose wave
which really looks nice and I think I
like this style better um so yeah I just
kept it in its natural state because
this was a six thirty
where you don't need to go in and bleach
tonight's because of course they're like
already bleached now they did say that
this came with like baby hair but I
didn't see no baby hey yo so I had to go
in and like create my own baby hairs but
this is basically what it looks like and
like I said this is a lace front wig
which I wish that the lace went back a
little bit more I'm especially on the
sides because you know if lace fronts
you get more legs towards the top then
the sides so me like heaven the part on
the side is just not a lot of lace on
the sides so I kind of like flipped it
over in a way where it doesn't really
look like you can see the part because
the part is so miniature but besides
that I absolutely love this so with
tinglin and Shannon I have not received
any tangle in whatsoever but Shannon I
did receive like a few strands the first
time I watched the first time I died and
washed his hair and then the second
go-around I received more Shannon so it
wasn't bad but it was more shedding than
the first time but like now I'm not
receiving any shedding from this hair
whatsoever and it is really soft and
bouncy again this is not a Yankee
texture either this is a silky texture
and yeah it's really nice I'm definitely
feeling this color it is very bright so
just be aware if you do decide to get
this color and recreate this look the
color is alarming you guys like it's
bright
so yeah just be aware of that if you're
interested in a 613 lease where i
definitely check out the description so
yeah this is what it's looking like and
that's pretty much it for this video if
you guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in my comment section down
