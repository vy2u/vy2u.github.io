back with another way review and this
week Weston to me from fantasy so since
BT sent me their new one
free magic late curve part wig and this
is in a style m l-c 156 and I have in a
color number two so yeah I still have it
in a pink and everything but I don't
know if you can see it most of you guys
are already familiar with this wig and
its thousands of reviews on this wig
already so yes this is the week and it
looks exactly like how the model is
winning and as you can see I'm sorry for
the delay let me take it out and see so
y'all know what I'm talking about
you really can't even tell but okay so
this video is going to be pretty quick
because as you can see this is like a
simple go to type of wig and I feel like
it just makes you look so mature and
sexy and I definitely love the look of
this box now the only operations I did
to this vault was I did plus the part of
course because it's the part I mean it's
okay but I feel that you need to go in
and plus the part
so this is what my part is looking like
then I just keep some of my baby hands
to the side so that's that another thing
that I did see this week was cut this
guy off to make it even was this side
and I kind of like had my part deeper a
little bit but that's about it that's
the only thing I did to this week and as
you can see it's really really nice it
is a really nice week so it is a yankee
texture and it's also not shiny so you
don't have to add any like baby powder
or dry shampoo because i know a lot of
people always eggs if the way is shiny
or not because they come
more say 20 shiny so yeah you don't have
to worry about this way being shiny now
as far as the construction out of this
week I'm not a fan of the construction
of this week the construction to need so
now this does have two cones in the
front account no I'm lying this doesn't
this week does not come with any cones
in the front so if you are a fan of
cones this way comes with no cones in
the front the only home that it has is
one and that's the one in the back so if
you like closing a unit and you feel
more secure wisconsin unit then you
might want to pass on this week or you
might want to take some bobby pins to
pin it down or have a you do to secure
it your way this week also comes with
adjustable straps now the only reason I
say that the construction sucks on this
week is because my strap like literally
broke but like when I say the adjustable
shreds broke like the little like hook
pieces that's on it in because when I
tried to like connect them together it
just unravel and when I say not just one
but both of them the hooks to both ends
just came on these and that was Street
when I got it out to pack I did have
this week for a long time if you follow
me on snapchat you might have saw me
snap in this week but if not I'll just
refresh your memory if I can find it and
I'll insert it somewhere but yeah I
really love to emphasize it I'm not I
don't wear this with often only because
the strength of rope I just don't feel
like it's very secure on my head um but
overall this is a really nice unit so if
you like me and you're looking for a
nice wig that you can make shorter into
life a little bulb definitely look into
this one because this tent out really
perfect and I didn't do anything but
sniff this guy off to make it even
that's all I did
even this side to make it look like this
side that's it so yeah this is what it
looks like
and
just going to turn around Oh hold on
before I pan around and show you guys
what it looks like also this wig does
not tangle or share it is a shorter unit
so I'm pretty sure this week will last
you longer the only thing you really
have to worry about with love units is
where I'm is when they suck it is sit
and they don't really have a lot of body
to it so like I said I had this property
for a whole month and it still has a lot
of body left in it and it just looks
really really nice but you know um yeah
I'm just made that the stretch kind of
broke but I still you know tie them
together and the part is really really
nice I already love the part so I'm just
going to turn around so you guys can see
what this week looks like all the way
around
so like I said it's really not much to
say about this way because it's kind of
it's just a regular knife cheeseballs
even still before arm before I cut it is
still a really nice book and like I said
I didn't cut that much off so yeah it's
just overall a really nice book like I
said I didn't have a problem with how
the way to look before I just already
knew how I wanted this bulb to be so
yeah if you guys have any questions feel
free to leave it in the comment section
down below and yes I will see you in my
next video guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
