saw every penny they don't know they
don't know
hey guys this K of course and I'm back
with another video and this video is
going to be one this video and yes it's
a freaking week so this week was sent to
me from a company called Kenny Esther
I'll leave everything in the description
box I think the style that I have one is
called cherry I'm not really sure but I
think that's what it's called and they
have a lot of things to choose from as
far as grading wigs and the styles are
just limitless like they're out of this
world as far as the styles you can
choose and it's just like I'm punctual
number one I'm pumped because people
that do this type of thing is so
talented first of all because the
is time-consuming and it takes a lot of
time but if your program really know how
to braid like that it's like a breeze to
you but for me I just choose not to
break normal because that stuff hurts my
fingers to the point where I think I got
carpal tunnel now so like I don't be
wanting to deal with all of that now
this week did ship via DHL and I did
like I said before I did do a video on a
braided wig probably like a month or two
I don't know it was a while ago and they
were also based out of Nigeria that
actually took a while for me to get
probably like three to four weeks
meanwhile this one was so much faster so
I don't know if they had like this style
already made and ready to ship or how
that works now these wigs are handmade
and you can tell they're handmade
because the ham ages it's like they put
a lot of care into it so you can
definitely tell but yeah
anyway this is what it looks like in
that packaging is so cute
yarn on me I'm a sucker for pink and
black and then the white like those are
like that was colors just go together I
don't know why but look the freaking
package I feel like this could be my
package and honestly but anyway it just
say Kenny Esther wigs
bringing out the real you and it has all
the information right here so basically
with these handmade braided wigs they
are basically made out of like a frontal
or closure my last braided wig was made
out of a frontal this one is made out of
the closure so it has the closure pleat
the Coppola it has the closure piece and
it's sewn like on a net like on a net
cap and the camp has adjustable straps
and then they also inserted their
elastic band which helps a lot
now from this just being a closure and
not a frontal if it's my head great-west
though I do not have to do anything to
hold the lace down at all the only
problem with it being a closure and not
too frontal is that you can't really do
too many styles like pulling it all up
in the front because it will show
everything if you get what I'm saying so
you're limited on the styles that you
can wear but if you like this style and
you feel like you're gonna want to weigh
it like this and keep it like this and
you're not going to want to switch it up
then by all means this is perfect moving
on this is basically what the waist look
what the wig looks like on my head and
I'm trying to like back up so y'all can
see how long this week is actually on me
I have to get the inches I think it's
like 30 or 40 something like that it's
really long and this is the pardon area
now the way these braids are I don't
know it's like a specific style that
these are cause I kind of know that
they're like feeding braids but it's
only the top layer right here where the
closure is that the braids are actually
clean rolled so yeah it's just all of
this is coral and then underneath it's
just single regular box braids
so yes and like I was saying you
wouldn't be able to like pull this up
because of course it's not like a
frontal which I don't mind because I
actually like the style of this wig but
the only thing I feel like you will be
able to do there's like if you wanted to
pull it like this which I'm a huge fan
of this wool style just because after a
while I get so tired of stuff been in my
face and I'm constantly moving around I
definitely like it like this and this is
basically like the only style that you
can really do for this week but yeah I
think it's cute but just keep in mind
that this is a lace closure yeah this is
a nice closure or closure piece so you
don't have the freedom to like do
whatever you want look like different
styles with this type of wig but it's
still cute one thing I do notice is that
in the back is kind of thin and I feel
like they could have added more braids
but besides that I freaking love this
wig but if I had to add my two cents I
will say that they should have added
more braids because I feel like when you
have to constantly position your hair to
make sure that you know everything is
right it kind of gets annoying
so yeah the size and everything are more
heavier than the back and it's more hair
towards like this part and then when you
get to the back it's a less hair even
though I don't think right now you can
see it but towards the bottom like all
right here I feel like the hair could
have been there
now when you win it like a bag you can't
even tell like where all the hair is
backing everything like you can't tell
but who's to say that something does it
happen I don't know if I'm like swinging
it to land
right I don't know can you see it
I really don't know y'all tell me if I
can give any kind of constructive
criticism it would just be too
don't be world stingy with the braids
like as a more brazen it because you
never know
