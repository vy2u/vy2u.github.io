can't right now when time fly by
change right hey guys it's Kayla back
with a another video so this video is
gonna be on this head that I'm wearing
y'all this is some bomb hair so if
you're looking for some affordable
bundle hair then definitely check out
this company I'm going to leave all the
links in the description box and I just
want y'all to know that y'all are gonna
be saying more of these videos from me
because I really have been into making
my own wigs and just like trying to find
someone get some affordable hair
companies to share with you guys so yeah
let's get started I'm so sorry this
videos gonna be pretty much all over the
place
I do apologize but I just wanted to try
out this hair some more so it's gonna be
like three separate clips so yeah oh
this is from a Santosh your hair I think
I'm pronouncing it right y'all but I'll
leave it on my screen just in case you
know I Jake their name all the way up
put sanusha I think that's how you can
allocate it so I receive and this is
what the packaging looks like this is
what this is what it comes in and of
course I think I received this this was
shipped via FedEx okay I'm having so
many distractions but it should be quiet
for now so I received full bundles and a
pleasure from this company and this is
power companies let me just show you
wine so this right here first off I
received like I say I receive sorry of
this videos everybody I receive a four
bundles from this I'll go to say I
received four bundles from this closure
I receive four bundles and a closure and
let's I have arm 16 18 20 22 and I have
a 16 inch closure so this is the 18 inch
bundle right here and on the top part it
just has the length and it also has
their name
well I did get the body wave hair so
that's what it is and like I said it's
packaged really nice and it does come
with a net over top of it and your when
I say I was a little iffy on this
company and you know with their hair
when I say I have never never never felt
hair like this before like when I say
this hair feels so good out of all the
hair I have reviewed I think this has to
be the softest hair and you can find
them on Aliexpress so this is a Le
Express vendor I'm not sure if they have
like a separate website outside of
Aliexpress but you can find a more Le
Express if they do have a separate
website I'll leave their website in the
description box but this hair is the
softest like all I want to do is play in
this hair it doesn't have a smell it
just smells like regular bundle hair I
got all four I'm really impressed with
this hair um I have not received any
tangle in or shedding yet but in the
next clip I will tell you if my thoughts
have changed on this hair but so far I
really really really am impressed with
this company especially for the price
like the quality is so super bomb this
is what the closure looks like which it
feels the same as the bundle hair it's
really nice and soft I am getting two
strands I got two strands of hair when I
ran my fingers do it so the closure does
shed a bit well I got two strands so
we'll see after I make my wig how it
holds up but for the most part is
definitely nice it has a three-party
three-way partners so you can put it in
the middle you can put it on the right
side or the left side and that's what it
looks like I'm not really a fan of
closures that already come pre putted I
don't know why I'm just I don't know I
just don't like it but um we'll see
basically what I did was I sold on the
bundles to a mesh dome camp and I so
doing the closure as well now as you
know in the previous clip I had four
bundles and a closure and I only used
three bundles so I did use the 22 2018
and then a 16 inch closure and this is
what it looks like y'all do not mind me
because I am I am a wretched mess okay I
haven't received any shedding from this
head still and I have not received any
tangles really and I also went in and
plucked my closure and this is not at
least I mean yeah this is not a lace
front so it's just like a regular lace
closure so yeah this is what it looks
like and of course I still pluck the
closure because I feel like it has like
that hard line where it doesn't look
natural and I just like to go in and
pluck it so that's what it looks like it
did come with baby hands but of course
when I started to pluck the hand line
the baby has kind of like faded away so
I had to add them back into there and
for my edges what I used was got to be a
glue of course and I actually like it
the hair is just so soft
I feel like this hair is definitely you
have to try out especially for the price
it's very very very affordable you guys
so if you're looking for some affordable
bundle hair and good quality bundle hair
for affordable price I feel like you can
definitely try it out over three bundles
I feel like it looks really really good
okay yeah so let's talk about my wig
making skills my wig making skills is
not that great I don't know what
happened I guess I lost my touch or
whatever the case may be but my wig is
way too small y'all I'm so disappointed
in the way I made this week if y'all
following me on snapchat y'all already
know from the get-go that I was already
having problems when making this week
because first off I got the wrong cat so
I was like oh so good thing I did wind
up getting like backup capes but the
other backup cap that I had was also the
wrong cap so I wound up having to use
this mesh dome cap and it's not like a
regular dome cap it's mesh so I feel
like the mesh one versus the regular
dome cap is like it's smaller so my
previous week I forgot what week I made
but I made a wig previously and I use
the mesh dome cap and in the back of my
head I was like the next time I make a
wig I'm not gonna use the same mesh
don't care because I find that it makes
the way too small in my opinion so as I
picked out two wrong camps to work with
the only thing left I could use was the
mesh dome cap so I was like oh my gosh
like I have to use this mesh don't care
so already off the brick I knew that
this wig was gonna fit me like really
small but I didn't think this go around
it like really went for me at all I
struggle trying to get this thing on my
hand y'all I don't know what I'm doing
wrong I'm down below anybody has this
issue with the mesh don't care if y'all
use that let me know should I just use
the regular dome cap because I'm really
struggling here in this department
I have a lot more wigs to make and I'm
just trying to figure out the best wig
cap to use to make my wigs because this
one is just not it so basically it's so
small I had to you it's so small to the
point where you know how something so
small you don't even fit when you're
here it just like pops off that's this
way it just like pops
it doesn't stay on there so I literally
had to hold it down I had to hold the
side pin it down and then hold the other
side pin it down it's just a hot mess
y'all freaking pretty and natural so
yeah I really really loved this hair so
far because you know I haven't really
what they're often to really get in
details to tell you how this gonna act
up but so far so good you guys I
definitely love the way this hair is now
this I have been wearing it longer just
to see how it holds up and I curled it
to see if it holds a curl good or not
and it definitely holds a curl really
well and overall I really do I like this
hey you guys I could have had this video
out much sooner for you guys but I just
wasn't feeling either clips but I'm just
gonna put it in there because I really
don't care at this point and um and also
I wanted to see how the hair will react
to me curling it and just winning out
more and stuff like that and I have to
say the only thing I notice is it sheds
just a little bit like right now is
that's like one strand it doesn't shed
like crazy or anything I feel like it's
pretty much normal
but this hair is really affordable and
for the price oh my goodness this is
some really good hair it's still soft as
when I first received the hair like I
said it does hold a curl really good and
I did go ahead and curl this with my
curly no I think it's like golden is it
go to hot it will be wise for me to get
it home so this is the Carla that I use
and this is like one and a half inch and
it just looks like this if you watch my
videos that I showed this in like some
of my older videos but yeah this is what
it looks like and this is I say go to
hat this is Hot Tools and it's a really
nice Caroline I really like this but
this is what I use to achieve these
curls
and for this they had three bundles in
it I feel like it's not like really
really thick but I definitely love the
density on this week so in a previous
clip that I showed you I was trying to
show you like the hairline but my
stocking cap was showing it all today so
I'm just gonna show you my headline
again which I stated already that I did
plus the headline and I usually pluck
all the headlines on my closure just so
it can just be more natural to me
because I feel like that line like it's
too harsh so I just went out I didn't
bleached and I saw anything like that
because this wig was already a fail but
I actually loved this wig and I'm so mad
well I love the hair on it um but yeah
the wig is definitely too small but I'm
working it out I feel like the more
weight the more it stretches out and
fits my head so that is a good thing but
I'm definitely loving this hair you guys
I just wish that I constructed the wig a
little bit more better but besides that
this hair is bum so like I said I'm
gonna go ahead and leave all the links
in the description box just in case you
guys are looking for some affordable
bundle hair and you like making your own
wigs definitely try out this company um
yeah I don't think I have anything else
to say yeah I swear I did not feel like
being on camera because the weather is
changing and when the weather change my
skin gets really dry because I had
eczema and like my eyelids like over my
eyelids are like really really dry you
really can't see it cuz I kind of like
moisturize my face we're we're good but
I can still feel the dryness and I'm
just a hot mess y'all um so it's
starting to get better but it was just a
mess and I just didn't want to be in
nobody's face with these crusty eyelids
or this crusty face so yeah but yeah you
definitely can't tell so that's good but
yeah I'm not the truck here
but I just wanted to throw that at Nate
