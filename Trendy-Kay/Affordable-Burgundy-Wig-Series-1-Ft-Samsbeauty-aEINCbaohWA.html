twinkle - baby we go baby go Jewish hey
guys so I'm back with another video and
this video is going to be on this
gorgeous week that I'm wearing and it's
going to be extra quick because you're I
set myself up with this one we kept this
door outside right now
and I have all this hair on so keep in
mind
big hair here it's a lot so you might
not want to wear this and the heat is
it's like really really hot but anyways
going to this video so this way one
sends me from m3/d of course it is the
it's a wig and the style name is with
lace electro and I have it in the color
and @tt
burgundy which is a dope word and it has
the birdie on the ends and the doctor is
not all the way through it's only at the
pardon so yeah just keep that in mind
but the color is so beautiful
y'all know that I live for these
burgundy colors don't grew or not I love
the color on my skintone I just I feel
like this color complements my skin
really well so yeah I didn't even show
you how to stock up but this is what the
stock car looks like and I'm gonna try
to rush through this video because a lot
of hair so this is a warning you guys um
this is a lot of hair so as you plan on
if you plan on wearing this and the heat
just be careful because a lot of hair I
personally me I would wear in hot hot
weather middle they give you three homes
and total on two in the front and one in
the back and it also gives you a just
stretch this is really comes with softly
of course because it says blithely so
yes Whitley's is the softly so if you
don't like that hard crazy lace this is
a good way to you because it
come with the softly and this is the
pardon space though it's not like a
lace-front with anything like that you
guys they just give you the least Cardin
and that's how much lay space you get so
if you wanted to go in and pluck the
hair out of the part you could just make
the part appear a little bit more wider
you can I kind of pluck some hair
towards the beginning I didn't go all
the way back or in this week I feel like
if you start to go in and pluck it it's
going to like pluck out the curls that's
right here this is how the weight comes
originally I did not pluck out the curls
I didn't brush them or anything this is
how big it is now keep in mind if you do
decide to pluck the curls out or take
your vent brush or anything to brush out
the curls this wig will get super super
big so yeah I just let the curls along
because I feel like this heads already
big the only thing I did do to this wig
is of course plus the part just a little
bit I didn't plus the I didn't fully
plus the part and I did some finishing
powder into the part so yeah also I went
ahead and just cut probably like an inch
off in the front just so I can see
because I didn't like all the hair my
face of course y'all know hi and we'll
set so yeah I haven't received any
tingling or shut-in from this hair what
else oh yeah also if you wanted to wear
this hair as a middle part you could I
tried it and it looks really really nice
that's it for this video if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave it
in a comment section down below and I'll
see you in my next video you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
