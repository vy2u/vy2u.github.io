baby we're gonna study legal hey guys
I'm back with a another video in this
wave was this me from the same city okay
so the wig I am wearing is be she and I
don't think I review a beachy wave
before that's the brand on my head I
can't remember but this week is called L
x LP 260 and I have it in the color red
line okay so if you haven't noticed the
trend basically this is going to be my
burgundy hairdo if you love this color
as much as I do you want to stay tuned
for my videos so if you're not
subscribed you want to hit that
subscribe button so yeah this is going
to be my burgundy histories and
basically I'm just going to be showing
you a different styles and this color
honestly actually reminds me of the visa
wig it also reminds me of Jada I review
both of those ways on my channel I
review the visa wig a long time ago at
least I think I do but I did own a beast
wig so that's what this weight reminds
me of it's the besa wig but i don't see
but i don't think either of those
weights carries this color like without
the dog roots so that's what I really
like about this wig now this wig is
actually longer than Jada and Visa Visa
and I even sent it right and the texture
is a Yankee texture but it's not like
overly a Yankee it's just like a Yankee
enough wig looks really really realistic
which I appreciate this week comes with
two cones in the front and a comb in a
bag so it has three combs in total and
it also comes with adjustable strength
so just in case you have a slaughter fat
head like me you
just the shrimp to make the way to make
the way to fish a hit more better man if
you have a bigger size pit after like
you fit this wig really great just don't
adjust your strength but I feel like it
would be a good fit so the fit one this
wig i think is universal i think it can
fit many hair shapes or head sizes it
just all depends on you adjusting your
strap so also this week does tangle I
haven't really got any shut-in
but the longer that she wears it has the
more they will tangle and the tail end
is mostly towards the end so I had this
is not my first time when this week I
had been wearing this wig I will say
that the ends will start to tangle up a
little bit
but I just keep my lord weight brush on
deck and but yeah you can always just
brush them out and then the wig is
slowly and it just goes back to normal
but keep that in mind as this week gets
older it will start to tangle a bit at
the end so this way comes with a deep
lace part and that's what the part looks
like and I did go in and plus the part
now I can't really remember if the part
was tight with it looks really fake but
I actually I don't think that the part
was like that I think that I just
plucked it to make it look more natural
looking by I think you can get away with
when the part without plucking it and
just adding your concealer or powder or
whatever you use to you know conceal the
part so yeah that's the only thing I
don't like is the fact that the around
where the part is the head really says
this where you can see the tracks but
you would have to like be all up on my
head in order to see the tricks so I'm
not really worried about it because it
still looks really natural but yeah the
part besides that is the part and
everything looks so natural I will say
that this wig is really hot so you
probably
won't run away this on a hot day because
right now it's freaking hot and I am
literally burning up y'all so yeah it is
a lot of hair they was not Cindy with
the hair when it comes to this week at
all y'all this hair is so thick it
definitely definitely reminds me of some
real hair it definitely gives you the
natural spill without it being like
overly Yankee because I hate that it
looks like some legit real hair and it
slows so nicely you guys so yes that
with the hair is looking like and like I
said it's really really really thick it
is really a lot of hair and it also is
really long so this is all the hair to
the front and like a you also can put
heat on this week so just in case like
the insert it to get like ready you can
take a flat line and just like straight
ends and it will go back now once you do
that I don't think that the wig will be
a Yankee anymore but that's something
that you can do window um is does to get
crazy-looking if you don't want to cut
it and you still want the limp on there
but if you don't care you wanted to cut
it um you definitely can do that to get
rid of the ready in oh yeah your overall
this week is my baby I really really
love this week look at their color I'm
trying to tell y'all this week is living
honey you can't tell me nothing
why bitch got Yankees bundle and Yankee
bundles for days honey
guys week we're so I know but for real
though like this does not look like a
week if anything I had a good eggs
 stolen and okay bitch like
this looks like somebody sold some good
old Yankee balloons in my hair
yeah that Italian Yankee so guys that's
