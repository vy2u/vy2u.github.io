another video and this video is gonna be
on this hair of course you're I'm Loki
excited okay this week was sent to me
from omg Queen and this company is not
new to my channel I have done videos on
their head before so this time around
they sent me this Carly above and I
freaking love this okay so before I get
into like talking about this hair or
whatever let me just give you all the
details on this hair and I also want to
let you guys know that this company is
having a Black Friday sale so they have
30% off everything so make sure you
check their website out just in case
you're looking for some hair now is the
time to buy some hair you're especially
y'all want your hair for the holidays or
whatever the case may be definitely
check out their sale if you're
interested in this week definitely check
out the links down below because you can
get some money off also I do have a
coupon code as well and I'll leave that
in my description box so yeah if I'm
looking down is because I'm reading off
the paper so this is the Rihanna wild
thoughts style curly hair cut bubbly
sweet version Brazilian ham and the
style number is BMW 15 which I will say
that this wig is on point in it it looks
exactly like how she hair her hair
um so yeah the hair color is a natural
hair color of course because this is
version Brazil your hair the hair type
is virgin brazilian hair the curl
amid the the style is so keycard hail
is 12 inches and I actually feel like
it's more honor lines of 10 inches but
they say 12 the head density is 150
percent which I feel like I feel like
it's a bit thinner than 150 percent but
one of the reasons I like this week is
because the density is not very heavy so
yeah the cap construction is caddy glue
this lace Franklin might I just add that
this week is affordable you guys this
week is only 120 yes I'm going to say
that again 120 dollars for this this is
also a lace front wig and this is the
part in space and this is as much part
of space as you get which I feel like
it's just this wig is lit y'all like I'm
sure okay because number one the quality
in this wig is everything the style is
everything the part is everything okay
so scratched it okay let's move on to
this video so this has your typical
construction it is a lace front wig this
is how much lace you get of course now
they do give you three cones in the
front two on the side one right here
which I hate this comb I hate all the
combs in the front but I mainly take out
the one in the middle because it just
gets in a way of the flatness when
you're trying to like really lay your
weight down even though I did not cut
out the comb and it is laying very flat
but I normally would take it out it also
comes with a comb in the back and
adjustable straps now the part when you
get it will be pre plucked but it's
going to be pre plucked and I'm like
halfway and then you will have to either
add your finishing powder or just pluck
the rest me I just pluck the rocks
because it looked kind of wet and I
didn't add any finishing powder or
anything to this wig this is just how it
looks it also comes with baby hands
which I didn't cut it down because they
were on the longer side only for my
synthetic wigs if I'm molding my baby
heads down I will use my guys to be glue
because it's more of a stronger whole
and I find that like the regular Joe
doesn't work on synthetic fibers like
it takes a while for it to hold down but
with my human head weeks I mainly just
used my eco styler gel because it's
easier to lay the head down because of
course it's just like regular like real
hair so yeah that's um that's how this
week is constructed I didn't go in and
bleach my nights and I didn't pluck my
hand line but if you wanted more of a
natural look you can just go ahead and
go in and pluck your hand line and also
bleach your nights but like I said I do
have a new stocking cap on underneath
and the part looks so good to me
like I said I didn't add any concealer
or powder finishing powder to this week
or anything like that so when you get
this wing straight out the pack it looks
exactly like this your um but I did go
ahead and wash it because the curls were
a little bit more tighter than this and
I want it like that more relaxed loose
natural look so the curls look exactly
like this they was just a bit more
tighter so I made it a little bit more
shorter so I did wash this week with my
head and shoulders because I could not
find my conditioner to save my life
y'all so I was just gonna like go wash
his head just use conditioner but I
couldn't find a conditioner so I was
like oh my gosh like what am I going to
use I don't want to shampoo the head
because then it's kind of gonna be dry
if you don't put condition at one
afterwards I don't know so I found some
head and shoulders and let me tell you
that drink smells so good y'all I can't
remember which one it is but its head
and shoulders and if you use head and
shoulders you know that it's like a
two-in-one shampoo and conditioner so I
just put that all over the head one good
time and then I rest it out and the hair
actually feels really good let me tell
y'all I have not received any type of
shedding from this hair yet and I have
not received any tangles from this hair
yet like when I say I'm in love with
this freaking head and mind you I've
been looking for this type of style now
of course I can easy create this hot
this style but the reason that I did
- is because like when you when you cut
a wig shorter it's thick and it gives
you like that blunt time to look at the
bottom and this you don't really get
that blunt look it looks more natural to
me
but yeah I could have like cut anyway
curly wig into the style or kind of like
made a wig and cut it into the style but
I didn't want to because the thickness
of it just wouldn't have gave me that
like natural type of feel this is like
the thickness is just right it's not
thin at all but it's not too thick with
just like too thick if you get what I'm
saying I can't really explain it y'all
but like the wig is on point okay like
this hair is definitely your everyday
type of week as far as like me putting
it on and did it take a whole bunch of
time no it did not like if you wanted to
win the week straight out the pack you
could all you gonna have to do is cut
off the lace and that's easy if you know
how to cut off lace but they have
thousands of videos on how you cut off
the lace if you are a knitter wigs and
just are not familiar with cutting off
the lace on your way I'm not gonna make
this video too long but I just wanted to
share this with you guys and let you
guys know about that sale that they have
currently going on so yeah I love you
guys and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
