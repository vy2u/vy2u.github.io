video is not gonna be hair related is
more of like a hall or a football hall
video featuring some handbags that I
purchased from Shion
and this is also going to be a giveaway
so yo this video is about to be a so
late
sorry but this has like huge and I
really know how I feel like this is not
even all the hey look it's a lot of hair
so before I start this video if anybody
is interested in his hair
this is Alyssa I don't know if this is
by Bobby boys might be by Bobby Fausto
y'all I'm not sure but it will be in my
description I don't think this hair tho
is good for the heat because this is
like a lot of hair I found like some
gold
y'all I'm not even playing my voice just
sounding with but yeah I'm like I'm
putting on y'all for real so I'm trying
to push on in just in case you I don't
know so yeah if you like like affordable
dupe bags then you'll like this one
so the first big I purchased is this bag
and I feel like your shake it's just
gorgeous you guys the quality is just
like a 1 I'm not really a fan of the
chain that they have on us because I
feel like it's just like a chain and
it's so short when you do like this like
definitely not gonna wear the bag like
that and I think I pay like $14 for this
bag if I'm at
not mistaken being you just open it like
this so yeah it still has the stuff in
it because I didn't wear it yet but it's
a cute little person and I really really
like it like I said the quality is
really really good so yeah on to the
next one and I'm gonna stay in the same
like style this chain I feel like is
better than that chain but yeah this is
what this one looks like and I think I
paid I want to say a nine dollars for
this but I'm really not sure all all the
details in the price I'm going to leave
in the description box anyway but I'm
really into like white purses lady so
yeah this is exactly the same size as
the other one and the same design just
in a different color
so I love the fact that it's red right
here and then I just show like these
colors together just like so classy and
I love gold like gold is life you are
like I do not wear silver whatsoever I
just feel like so it looks so stale no
shade to anybody who is sober but I just
don't like silver so yeah this is what
it looks like and it has like a gold
detailing and it has something written
in like some Asian stuff that I don't
know what it says but it does say vogue
2018 I can't read that so yeah the next
one is of one of my favorites you guys
and it looks like this and y'all I don't
think that this is a dupe for anything
I just think that it's just like a
regular Bank or whatever but y'all do
y'all see the colors look at me in the
detailer this is like some good quality
you guys and I definitely love the strip
on it so yeah this is what it looks like
and then you just do like oh cuz I'm
behaving a hard time with this
if you slide it up like that and this is
what it looks like in the inside and you
have to like unzipping it and of course
I still have like the tissue paper in it
because I haven't worn this one yet and
I have a lot of favorites but this is
one of them I just feel like this bag is
just it's me like it's so free through
you guys like it's me so the next one is
also one of my favorites um and it looks
like this so basically it's just like a
gold little purse and do y'all see this
hard way I want it like this is so cute
of course it's another like crossbody
because I'm just into crossbody bags you
guys so yeah it's like all go and this
bag looks so freaking expensive you guys
so on the side it's like this pet and
love a type of you know detailing and
it's black but yeah it's kind of like
patent leather it is pretty small you
can only fit like your color things in
here I probably can only fit like my
phone in here and probably like a small
wallet and like some gloves or something
but you're too cute the next one is this
one right here and I love the color it's
kind of like a rose gold metallic each
color and this is like plasticy like
silicone plasticky but this is a dupe
for like the Chanel boy bag I think it
is and this is what it looks like
everyone is yet Eva but I love the way
the material is it's very sturdy and
it's like it's like I don't know I can't
explain it but definitely a nice quality
I love the chain on this it's really
cute definitely love the color it kind
of smells like pull like plastic like
wanting to blow up circle things or
whatever if you don't know what I'm
talking about but yeah it smells kind of
like like pool stuff
trips blew up the next one is just like
that but in a different color and I
freaking love this color I think that
this color is gonna be so nice for like
fall and winter but it's exactly the
same size and y'all I freaking love
these little purses this one it's like a
green metallic type of feel and yeah I
really really like it it's so freakin
cute
I definitely love the material though
whatever the material is it's really
real nice and sturdy I have another bag
that looks exactly like those bags but
it's a bit bigger so this is what this
one looks like and it just looks exactly
the same as the same type of material
but this one is just bigger but yeah
that's what this looks like
and this is like a everyday type of
person I really really really really
like this one this is another crossbody
you can wear this as a crossbody or you
can wear you know like this oh let me
fix that but yeah that's what it looks
like and you have multiple colors in
this one which is really nice and it
just looks like this and the inside and
it's like pocket in the middle and this
one was really cheap I think I paid like
twelve dollars for this one
um the quality is okay it's not as good
as all the other bags but I definitely
really really like this one because it's
different and I just feel like it's so
fashion-forward
so yes honey I don't know if this is a
dupe for any bag next one that I got was
so cute but this is like my least
favorite bag that I purchased and it
looks like this and I think I paid like
four dollars for this I loved it because
it was like triangle and I felt like it
looked just looks so freaking different
like I didn't I don't see too many well
I don't see anybody at all walking
around in this type of bag so it comes
with like a little wrist thing just in
case you want to wear
this one a risk or just in case you
wanted to wear as like a crossbody bag
you could now the thing that I really
don't like about this one is it loses
its form like if you don't have this
really filled up then it just it doesn't
look like a triangle so yeah it's really
nice though I have it like really
stuffed so don't lose this home but yeah
I really like it but you can tell you
can tell that the quality is not that
great but like I said I only paid four
dollars for this bag and you definitely
can tell that I only paid four dollars
for it the next one is this one and I
love this I fell in love when I seen it
now this is like a torn one bag you can
wear this as a crossbody bag or you can
win as like a little fanny pack type of
thing which I thought is really cute and
it's like this grey color even though
when you like put it against another
gray it's very very very light almost
like a taupe color in a way but it has
two lion heads and when you open it it
just looks like this and this kind of
reminds me of this you know you know I
mean not the Chanel the Gucci
like Fanny tags or whatever I don't know
but that's what I get with like this
type of design right here I don't know
about the line hits the lion hits but
again but yeah that's what this looks
like and I just thought it was really
cute now I don't know it kind of looks
big and bulky when I tried away I don't
know if that's how it's supposed to be
or whatever the case may be but it just
looks so big around my waist so I might
have to get some I got definitely have
to get used to this type of style
because I don't know it just looks y'all
can't even see but it looks really
really big up against my waist so yeah
so of course when I like something I
in like most food colors so I decided to
get the black line because I felt like
the Blackland just will go with more
things so of course again it's a two of
money you can either wear as a crossbody
or you can wear it as a fanny pack the
thing about these I paid like nine
dollars for these I think I paid like
nine dollars 9 12 dollars I can't
remember but these you can tell
especially this one not so much what's
the great one so if the black one is
made like really poorly if you get up
close like it some strings hanging like
you can just tell like the quality is
not that great you can't tell from far
away but me I'm so picky when it comes
to my stuff so yeah I'd be like looking
for like mistakes y'all but yeah it's
not that good of like well-made but it's
still very nice and I don't know I have
to get used to these I might web has
crossbody bags rather than fanny packs
because they just look so big and bulky
on me but yeah yeah I get so many
compliments when I wear this bag but
this is what it looks like and this is
like a Gucci inspired bank and like the
detailing everything about this bag is
just so freakin perfect so this is what
the strength looks like and like I said
I get so many freaking compliments they
also have like four more colors in this
one but this one was just speaking to me
it was so popping but yeah look at this
detailing you guys it's really really
nice so you open it you open it like
that and like I said I did wear this so
some of my stuff is in here wait yes I
really really love this
and I had the perfect outfit to go with
this you guys so yeah that's what this
looks like it's really really nice one
of my favorites and this was the most
expensive most expensive bag okay guys
so move it one two the giveaway so I
will be giving away this Chanel replica
person which I freaking love I had this
foot some years now but I just never
freakin would I think I was in one of my
videos a long long time ago but
literally when I tell you this it's like
a perfect dupe and I felt like y'all
would appreciate a giveaway on this
because like it legit looks like the
real one y'all the only thing that
throws it off is this right here because
of course if you look at the rail ones
the real ones don't have like this gold
right here it's actually just black and
I think the red might be more red I
don't know but like it's like y'all look
up the Roman and then look at this man
and tell me that does not look
exactly like the real one the quality
everything about this bag is just like
it so yeah that's what it looks like so
