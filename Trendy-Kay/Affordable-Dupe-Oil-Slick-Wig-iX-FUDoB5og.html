harden your rather stressed add your
water they haven't seen you in a while
bitten say hi are you camera shy are you
streaming show mittens
hey guys so I'm going to begin with
another video and this video is put to
you about underneath out so yes I love a
style sent me this week so just in case
you're interested in sweet or interested
in reading of available in insight I'll
go ahead and leave all the information
and links that you need to check out
this hair oh yeah they sent me the red
carpet premiere lace front wig and I
have it in the shell RCP at seven eight
one Charlotte and I have it in a color
OS 1b peacock and this is what the stock
car looks like so yeah if you see
anything in the background I do
apologize but in it let's just get one
to this video okay so if you guys are
familiar with my videos you guys know
that I call it a wig basically almost
identical to this week the only
difference is the color of course their
coloring is basically a little bit
better than mine gel because you know
I'm not a pro or nothing like that but I
mean they do really look identical
except for like this one has a little
bang so if you like the way that I died
to make it look like this definitely
look into this week you guys because
this week is so fun and it's colored
this this is supposed to be also like
that's what they call it
so yeah this trend is definitely happen
I love the old slicked hair for sure and
especially when you had like the right
color just jumping off and I wish like
is really looks pretty so yeah I noticed
the black companies are starting to do -
all
care which I can appreciate so I'm going
to ride their wages to like it died
exams oh this is a synthetic leg this is
also a late part wig and basically with
lace part wigs it just gives you a part
with lace so they also give you two
combs in a front and a home in a bag
with adjustable straps now the concepts
in the front usually they'll have like
the cones on each side is simple but
these cones are like right next to the
pardon also this week they come with
lace to cut off so you just have to cut
off the lace and this week comes with
swiftly so you don't have to worry about
the part scratchy lace just in case you
don't like hardly this wig is a Yankee
texture it's not like overly Yankee or
anything like that but you can
definitely you can definitely like by
looking at it you can tell that it's
Jackie and by feeling it you can tell is
it a Jackie but it's not like rough or
coarse or anything like that like it's
really really nice the thickness on this
wig it's like really full is just me
around 16 inches it is a bit shining
where the duct root is and then once it
gets to the bottom like it's not shiny
all I mean it really doesn't bother me
but I know shine bothers some people I
mean the shine it's not OD that's what
I'm trying to say the shine does blows
me too but it's not too bad like it
doesn't look sick this so if you want to
go here and take some baby powder and
just put it like right on his top you
could do that with dry shampoo already
doesn't matter but just to get some of
that shine out if not it's optional
because to me I'm not going to boil it
in and then the bottom is not as shiny
like where the color is not it's shiny
it's the top but like I said it's
optional I'm not really stressing over
it so yeah and the part already comes
like really good you don't have to do
anything to depart
I didn't slept o'clock the only thing I
did was add some finishing powder into
the part and that's what it looks like a
so as far as like what I did to this
week
really didn't do anything seriously so
like I say this way this bomb is bomb
out to pack it actually looks like to
start hard yeah it's just a regular
everyday type of way that you can just
do one every day even if you don't like
this type of color but I think that this
collagen sets off this style so much
more but I mean if you like your natural
colors like one beating you offer one
one B and two and those are the only
natural colors that we have a bit
available in this way so basically this
is pretty much how the weight comes when
you get it the only operations I did -
this week was straighten it
straightening it because I did not like
the curve both parts that was going on
right here is a week
I don't know how them synthetic ways
they come like wolf a buck well this
week didn't come straight like this
actually came with like a pump so
basically where it is I ran my
straightening through it and this is
just look baby I just want to do
straight now as far as the bang part I
did not flat on like the industry in the
bang I just like it like this I also did
not cut the bangs y'all so I was happy
about that but the reason that is land
like this is because I did shift my part
over a little bit more to the side so it
can be a bigger part because I think
this the part comes like right here so I
wanted a deeper feel that the bank of
full in my face and I definitely love
the way that this thing is falling I'm
just like really loving this hair I'm
loving the color so if you are like
really loving the old click trend like I
am but you don't want to pay all that
money for human hair way to diet like
this you can definitely check out this
lead because I'm telling you all first
of all it doesn't even look like a week
it looks like I've dyed my hair yes
on the street I got my hand okay yes
so no but it legit looks like some like
your hair and you just gotta colored on
the part I'm telling you is everything
like no plucking on the fence
well I even straighten this way I did
not get like any snags when I ran my
fingers through but after I straightened
it with my straightener or my flat iron
I do get a few snags here and there but
it's not like fully tangling up in just
like when I wear my fingers good like
little snake and as far as shedding
I have not received any shedding at all
of course when it's we get older it will
 but now I had not received any
so guys that's it for this video if you
