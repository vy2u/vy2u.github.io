video so this is basically gonna be a
quick video I'm just sham this half you
guys just in case any of you guys are
looking for a wavy bug so basically I
was sent this week from oMG Queen which
is not new to my channel because I
always do videos on their hair that's
how much I love their hair they are
kinda up there as far as price and if
you're not interested just continue to
watch me or you can just exit this video
but yeah if you're interested I'll leave
all the links in my description box just
in case anybody is interested so um
before I get started on this week and
telling you the specs and everything I
do want to thank everybody for their
support as far as my wig line is
concerned so yeah I was not expecting to
sell out that quickly as you guys can
see I was not prepared at all and lately
I just been trying to balance like that
cuz that has been keeping me busy as
well as still trying to make videos for
you guys it's a little overwhelming but
I'm blessed and I love it but I'm just
trying to find a balance to like handle
everything I don't know I guess you
could say so yeah it just in case you
guys wanted to know when I will be
restocking it will be within the next
month so yeah just stay tuned for that
so yeah I keep more saying so yeah what
else yeah I just want to thank all of
you guys for the support and if you day
purchased my wig I would definitely love
to know how you like the wig bed good
just let me know how you feel because of
course it's always room for improvement
and
what I want to do I just are you so I
have no idea where I ended this off at
because my battery well no my my what do
I'm gonna call it what am I talking
about my my camera shut off because it
was two four had too much stuff on it so
yeah I couldn't get it out of your
alright so I'm reading this again I
don't know it's fine what of them so the
wig I'm wearing is called the sexy Kim K
Bob lace wig and basically the hair
color is a natural color hair type is a
version Brazilian hair the length is 12
inches the hair density is 150 percent
the cap construction is cap D which is a
glueless lace front wig this day come
with baby hair and a baby hair was
pretty naturally wasn't as long as I've
seen before I still want to hit and cut
them down the hairline is pre plucked
which I could tell they have llamas pre
pluck and it did come with an elastic
band which they started putting elastic
bands and a wig and it just makes it it
makes the lace lay better and just a wig
fit better in general so yeah I really
loved it they included the elastic band
what else was I about to say also it to
me it looked like the bleach with the
knots were bleached I'm not sure but if
you want a more natural look you can
just go back and I bleach it some more
but to me all in all I'm not complaining
about this wig whatsoever
like I said I love their wigs and
sometimes they can it be on the pricey
side it just depends on what week you
pick I think this week is affordable
I'll leave the price in my description
box but yeah if it's not I'll probably
say it in the beginning of the video
anyway but yeah that wigs are really
good quality I haven't had any issues
with their week so far if you have let
me know in the description box but yeah
I really don't have
issues with their wigs so yeah let's
just get one to tingle in and shut it
real quick before I like tell you what I
did so also I am gonna be inserting
clips of how the wig look originally and
everything like that so yeah this week I
have not received any tangling from this
wig and as far as Shannon literally I
only received two strands of hair and
that's when I watched his hair so yeah
as far as the curls are concerned this
is basically what you getting straight
out the box even though I'm it straight
out the peg box whatever even though I
did go in and wash it while co-wash I
just washed his hair with conditioner
and the curl pattern looks exactly the
same as when I received it of course
there was a little more defined but from
me finger comb in the waiting and
everything like that the curls became
less defined but basically this is what
it looks like and it looks really good
this is how the bub comes I didn't cut
it I didn't do anything to this week you
guys of course if you want it to look
more natural you can go in and pluck the
hair line which I didn't this is how the
hair line looks i also insert clips of
what the hair line look without me like
manipulating in front with anything like
that but yeah i just basically pulled it
up but like i was saying before i did go
in and cut the baby hairs a little bit
shorter just because i like my baby has
it look like marva open yes and my
robdds
are not that long so yeah i just went
ahead and cut the baby hairs a little
bit and how this wig is holding down I
did use the got to be glue spray but
like I said this does come with the
elastic bands so you really don't have
to use that to hold the lace down but I
just wanted to because I wanted it to be
like extra secure and yeah because
sometimes the elastic band it doesn't
hold the lace down right here by the
area and I knew I wanted to wear this
hair up in the front so yeah this hair
also looks good as a side part just
really sexy and stuff like that so yeah
this is my overall look I did also go in
and test it straight ahead just to see
if it would straighten and I will say it
does tree and beautifully so just in
case you want to wit wavy or you got
tired of the wavy look and went into it
straight you could so yeah it's a lot
that you can do if this week also like I
said this is a lace front but they give
you a lot of lace in the front so if he
was to part it in the middle your part
will be really big I hope I'm not
missing anything if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below
I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
