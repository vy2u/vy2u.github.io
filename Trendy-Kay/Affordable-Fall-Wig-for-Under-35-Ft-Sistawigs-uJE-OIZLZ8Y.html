get money huh feeling it
she pulling around I feel better she
pulling let around how I feel but
I heard you get away
is Kate and I'm back with another video
of course and this video is going to be
on this go just go just head that I'm
rocking and I received this week from
sister week so I'll go ahead and leave
all since the waves links in the
description box just in case any of you
guys interested and the week they sent
me is from the Vanessa collection and it
is the top seaside robust and I have it
in a color @db for 273 so this is what
the card looks like I don't really like
the picture up on the card it just looks
too Wiggy for me but of course you can
see that you can't always go by the
picture because this wig is absolutely
gorgeous it's definitely definitely
giving me fall so y'all can tell I'm
definitely hit put these winter seasons
because this wig is everything
especially this color has given me so
much life like the off seat is color
come on out I really like the color of
this week I then go in and dug in the
roots because I didn't like the streaky
look and the roots which before getting
this wig I knew that it would look like
that and that it didn't come with dark
roots but I already planned on dark and
over anyway if you like that type of
look
you can definitely keep the wig like
that you don't have to dump in the roots
but I wanted to dump in the roots
because personally I didn't like the way
it looked it just looked to finished for
me and I darken the roots with my
eyeliner pencil I'll go get it now
eyeliner pencil but it's like an
eyeliner marker okay so it looks like
this and it's called infallible super
slim liquid eye liner by L'Oreal and I
just used that to dump in the roots and
it worked pretty good the only thing is
it's transferable and my hands are
already crazy but it's not too bad I did
go over it with my car Lemoine and once
I
over with my curling iron I felt like it
stopped transferring so I don't know
maybe that's a little trick you can use
but I'm it is other ways to darken your
roots you can also use like temporary
hair temporary hairspray
they also so in a beauty supply store
these little one sticks like mascara
looking sticks the cover grades I think
that will work good for dunking in the
roots as well okay onto the construction
of this week of course this is your
typical construction they give you two
combs and the front on each side of the
part they give you a comb and a back
with adjustable straps I do feel like
this wig is became friendly so if your
head is on the bigger side you'll
definitely enjoy this week because I
feel like it'll fit you really well my
head is on a smaller side but what I did
is adjusting my straps like I always do
and actually this wig is fitting pretty
good with the strips adjusted and I
didn't have to like any bobby pins to
the side for extra security or anything
like that when you get this wig you
can't see the part at all it's like not
even a part there so I did pluck this
part a lot to get it to look like this
and I'm definitely happy with the
results I feel like it looks really nice
and natural so this wave also comes as a
right side part and the part is actually
not this deep is it actually comes like
right here but I didn't like the way
that looked I felt like I wanted to wear
my part more deeper so I just kind of
shift the wig to the side a little bit
more so that the park can be deeper and
it just looks better to me but straight
out the peg you really really don't have
to do much to this week but brush it and
I did go ahead and take my vent brush
and just brush out the curls but this is
pretty much how a comma I didn't cut it
anything it does have layers throughout
the wig in the big part already comes
like this and yeah like I said the only
thing I did was dark in the roots and
pluck the part and a my finishing powder
to it and that's it you really don't
have to put too much work into this week
whatsoever it just is like this like it
looks really really good
I definitely love the curls like they're
not too tight and they're not too loose
they're like in the middle also this
this week is a Yankee texture it's a
light Yankee texture and it's really
really full so this is this this week is
definitely full but I definitely think
this is a week that choice should look
into especially but a fall cuz I know a
lot of you guys a week shopping for the
false lash you went to season and yet
this week this color in particular is
definitely a color to look into like I
said I like him more with the dark roots
but that's up to you and your preference
I don't know some people might like it
like that but I definitely love love
love love this color I wish I actually
wish the color was like this all the way
through this color is just on the top
and then the bottom part is like four or
maybe 10 also I have been getting
shedding from this week it's not too bad
but it definitely sheds and I haven't
received any tangles yet but I'm sure
this wig will start to tangle on you as
it gets older and I feel like if you do
decide to cut this week it would still
look so good I definitely feel like this
week would look good
shorter just in case you're not into the
super long hair definitely try this week
shorter yeah
but yeah that's pretty much it for this
video you guys like I said if you like
this wig I'll go ahead and leave the
links in the description box just in
case you want to check it out so I'm
just going to turn around so you can see
what the wig looks like all the way
around
this color is definitely Friday uh I am
so in love with this color so guys
