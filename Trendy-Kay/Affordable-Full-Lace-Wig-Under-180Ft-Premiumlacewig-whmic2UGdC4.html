video and this video is gonna be on this
week that I'm wearing and this week was
sent to me from a premium lace wig and
if you're interested I'll make sure I
leave all the details in my description
box so yeah they sent me their non je
human half full lace wig Malaysian
street version hair 20 inches and there
are titles these company titles be crazy
but that's the title of this hair but
basically it is a color 99 J and
basically that's like a dark burgundy
color and the hair is a straight texture
and the lymph is 20 inches and this also
is a full lace wig okay so this week was
shipped via FedEx and I did get this
week really quickly this is what their
box looks like and it just says premium
lace wig fashion and beauty and then we
open it up course the wig is gonna be in
here and the weight was wrapped inside
of this plastic with the neck and then
this was inside of this little pink bag
which is really cute so this week also
comes with a comb which is kind of
bitten but yeah a cone this is a flimsy
comb though it also comes with lashes
bobby pins and a adjustable strap so you
can sew it one just in case
a little too big I think this is a
medium-sized we can't and it fits my
head good with my straps adjusted it
also came with a wig cap in this wig cap
it's nude and then this is just a
service card and it just tells you like
care instructions so yeah
also this wig like I said it is a four
lace wig it comes with three combs and
the front and adjustable straps like I
stated the wig is a medium kept size and
it actually fits me really good so I do
appreciate it but just in case you get
the size and it might be a little bit
too big for you you can always go in and
either bobby pin the size down if you
don't want to use like any gel or glue
to secure the lace or you can just sew
your band into now in the density hold
on let me see what the density is on him
so they say that the density is medium
density but it's definitely on a thinner
side but but I definitely like this
density because with wigs the look the
less intensity you have the more natural
the way it looks and you don't really
have to do much plucking now this week
already came pre plucked and when I tell
you this is the most natural suede that
I've ever received and I didn't have to
do anything to it look at this headline
go I did not do anything to this
headline so when I first received this
wig it was straight of course and I did
go ahead and wash the head and it was
like a light wave but I went back and
just straightened the hair out and then
after it was straight I was like I think
I wanted some curls so I'll insert I'll
insert a clip of me
curling the wig just so you can see kind
of how I got this look it's not like a
full-on tutorial or anything like that
showing you the basics of just how I
curled it really quickly but yeah this
is how it came out now I feel like this
has doesn't really hold a curl - well I
did spray some Aussie holding spray I'm
in this hair and it has felt quite a bit
from how I curled it but I actually like
the way it looks like I'm not going to
make this video too long because I'm
trying to beat the Sun and the Sun is
going down
so yeah I'm trying to hurry up before it
gets dark outside and then my lighting
it's just gone
but anyway tangling and shedding I have
not I have not received any tingling
from this hair but I have received
shutting from his head and shedding is
not bad at all
and mostly was from when I cut off the
lace and after I washed it I got a
little bit of shedding but like
throughout the day when this wig I don't
receive shedding and I also you cannot
receive tingling from this week but yeah
and this is also 20 inches and this is
where it comes on me excuse me that is
because I'm looking raggedy but I didn't
really feel like change him for this
video and underneath I just have my hair
braided straight back I had 12 21 a
straight back and I did not wear a
stocking cap and this is what the party
looks like I would suggest when a
stocking cap or just bleaching your
nights so that you can really see the
parting space but I added a little bit
of finishing powder in my pots but I
wasn't really worried about it because I
knew I was flipping a head over anyway
so yeah I just added some powder where
you can see the pot and how I have my
legs secured is I use my got to be glued
holding spray and that's what I use now
I don't really use the gel anymore why
don't use the gel anymore I just used to
hold this break because I feel like it
gives me a better effect one thing I did
notice about this head when I was
curling it is that when I looked on my
curlers I had like black residue on my
curlers and then I had to check the head
because I
like okay is the hair burning but
actually the hair didn't burn or
anything so that was kind of odd to me
but I just wanted to let you guys know
that it did like leave a black residue
on my curling iron but as far as like
the hair the hair is still nice it's not
tingly at all it's really soft and
overall I really love this hair I think
that this wig is constructed really well
and I feel like when you get it you
don't really have to do anything to it
so if you're looking for a week where
you don't have to do anything to it as
far it's like plucking the hairline and
all that good stuff definitely check out
this week because the hairline to me got
me like it's really on point
to the point where this you can't see
the line
where you can't see where the lace
starts or end
that's how serious this is so I will
give this company a thumbs up for my
first time trying them out so if you're
looking for a week or looking for a week
this color and you don't want to dye it
definitely check out this company and
yeah that's video I hope you guys enjoy
and I'll see you next time soon don't
you ask me I think that's so good about
him yeah yes but you know this recording
my struggles with started you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
