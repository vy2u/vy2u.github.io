guys I'm back with another video and
this video is going to be an update
video when the kinky straight hair from
Lady hair company so I'm not sure what
the wages call off the top of my head
but I'll leave it like somewhere on the
screen so yeah this is gonna be like a
two month update I wasn't actually going
to do an updated video on this um
honestly because a whole bunch of
reasons but I'm not no babe reasons
because I freaking love this big butt on
my be head um so yeah let's just get
into this video it's going to be pretty
quick because I really don't have much
to say it's like really not much to say
about this week okay so I know most of
you guys are probably wondering like why
does this week look so different from
the original review so the initial
review on his head I won't curled it and
it looks so beautiful
um mind you should I even did I start
talking about the tail or should I do a
recap sorry I'm looking at my phone okay
so I'm all over the place I'm sorry I
just decided to wait as Han today so I
was like saying well since I'm wearing
it I'll just you know do a video or
updated video on its head
so this is why my organized but I'm
always not organizing all my videos cuz
you know I just go off the top of my
head so bad with me you guys okay now um
if you didn't see the first review I
mean if you didn't see the first video
on this week then I'll go ahead and
leave the link in the description box
I'm just in case you're interested in
seeing the initial review for this hair
and how it looks because it does not
look anything like how it looks before
so yeah also this is 18 inches was not
80 inches anymore but it was 18 inches
and yet it was the kinky Street texture
this also is a lace front meaning you
just
least in the front area and and it is
human hair so it's not like synthetic is
hemant hair and everything like that but
like I said I might be missing some
stuff so I'll leave it in my description
box so yes on to this hair okay so I'm
not even gonna lie like how really just
act up this hair um so after I wore this
head and the wrong curls I went in here
and wash the hair and I deep
conditioning all that stuff even though
I really didn't need to be deep
conditioned or anything like that but I
just did it just because and it still
felt the same because the hair so
amazing anyway and it was just soft and
nice no no major tangling or shedding no
tangling at all I did get a few
strengths of shedding that I wash the
hair I let the hair edge right and then
after that I was wearing his hair in a
ponytail and I will come like a champ
over it and that's basically how I was
wearing this way to be honest with you
guys I didn't even wear in that one girl
style for um for long time a lot of
people actually thought that with my
head like everywhere I went people just
thought it was my hair so I guess that
would be a good style if you do have
this wig try to wear in a ponytail and
put a little cap over it I'm head I'm
telling you you had people thinking it's
your hair and so after I kept on winning
and the ponytail for a while of course I
got tired of when in a ponytail so I
decided to curl the hair but when I felt
it it was just like all one length and
it didn't look right to me I felt like I
wanted more body because y'all know what
I'm talking about if y'all ever had
Street hitting your curls it and it
wasn't cutting no type of layers it's
just it doesn't really look that good so
I went ahead and I was playing Sam let
me just cut some lens in the front so I
can get a little movement with somebody
going on in the front area like towards
my face so I ended up cut in this video
and I just couldn't
stop cutting it and I just cut it in now
it's right here I'm looking at I'm not
even while I am met because this is
really a nice wig and I actually like
enjoy when in a ponytail and then but
I'm looking at it and know that I can't
cut this hair in a ponytail anymore it
kind of hurts my soul but I mean it's
okay um I don't know um so this side
basically was chopped and screwed yo
when I say this side was so funky I was
like oh my god I was this close to
throwing this wig away because I was
dead heated I was like oh my gosh like
there's no returning from the dead so
anyway since this style was like super
short and choppy and it was just a mess
and then this I actually was ok um so
yeah I didn't really have an issue with
this time but it was movable this side
so what I did I don't know if you guys
ever you know cut your wig or cut heavy
form and click layers in it but like all
the layers we're kind of towards the top
part and then it kind of made the bottom
layer of the hair looks extra thin
that's hot as I was it looks so flowy
and the lid was just like flowing and
then once you got to like the bottom
portion it was just like hey like the
hair looks thin and shrinky like it just
looked like 2 different weeks basically
so what I did is I decided to cut it up
here because that was the only way that
it was going to work it wasn't going to
work any other way so that's what I did
I basically just cut it up to here and I
was like I might as well just take
it all around and you know make it into
above so this is basically how it looks
and by all means is not perfect at all
so don't judge me or because this I
messed up like I asked this wait all the
way up but I mean it's cool we all live
and we learn and and now it's to the
point where it's just like the curls are
doing
want to do you like this putt it looks
like don't you know how back in the day
when people used to weigh them little
that little flip the move flip things
that's what it looks like it looks like
it's trying to like flip up and I'm not
about their life so yeah I really don't
know well I mean it's cute I'm I got to
stop being so hard on myself you oh yeah
basically I ejected swig up but that has
nothing to do with the quality of this
week I will say overall the quality of
this week is amazing if you have not
purchased this please already go check
it out if you're into like the more
natural looking type of wigs like kinky
yaki hair check it out she got but they
don't have anything else to say about
this wig like I said I will leave all
the details all the details about this
week in my description box I'm just in
case I didn't mention anything or just
in case you guys didn't see the first
video and you want to go purchase it or
