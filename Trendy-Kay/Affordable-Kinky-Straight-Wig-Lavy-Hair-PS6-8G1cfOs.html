hello West outside my god hey hey guys
I'm back again with another wave review
and this week was with me from a landing
hair of course you guys know I am a huge
fan of a levee hair I'll make sure I
leave the links to this way just in case
you anybody is interested in my
description box okay so I had this in
their Burmese version hair and I have it
in a lace front and it's in 18 inches um
I just really been into the shoulder
length weights in the shoulder length
hair so yeah this is 18 inches and of
course it did not come curl like this it
did come really thick and straight so
yeah it's just like a really thick
texture and it's kinky like a Yankee
it's not like to ruffle anything like
that it looks like hair blowdried like
it looks like African American hair
blowdried one thing that I'm just a
little iffy about is Burmese head like
I've never had my meet a before I feel
like honestly all this hair is the same
in the same origin I feel like whatever
I mean it's nice hey a good quality I'm
not complaining about it but yeah so
Burmese fall I know this could be
Brazilian handsome nose but anyway I
love the hair I'm definitely not
complaining because this hair y'all if
you're not familiar with leathery hair
company it is in affordable wake site
and they sell a virgin hair and you can
get it in different textures different
origins and you can also get a full lace
wig or you can get a lease from wick you
can also get you part weeks it's just a
many varieties of wigs and textures that
you can choose from at an affordable
price so yes this way that I'm wearing
is
they're late for a Yankee unit on to the
construction of this wig they gives you
two combs on the side right here over
here and it gives you a comb in the
middle they also give you a comb and a
bag full adjustable stress now I can't
remember which side wait disease I'm not
really sure about all the details will
be in my description mark so make sure
you look under my description marks now
the way to fit a little big the lace is
soft it doesn't come hard and the lace
is Oh so unlike the brown side which I
think you can pick you're late you're
late
color now this week also comes with baby
head but they are really long so I
wasn't actually able to work with them
the way I wanted to because they're long
but I also didn't want to cut them
either so I just kind of like smoothed
it to the side a little bit but yeah
back to what I was saying about the lace
the lace is soft lace is not hard so I
feel like was this way you can actually
glue it down and shut it down whatever
you want to do just to make it more
secure because I find it that it it's
not really secure now when you just look
at it you it looks like it's on there
securely but it's really not so yeah but
for the purpose of this video I just
wanted to show you guys the pants so I
didn't glue it down but I felt like if I
was like one out somewhere with this
hair I was definitely gel it down with
the got to be glue just so it can stay
in place but this is what the wig looks
like and I'm really really loving to me
I did take my wand Carla and I did I
just Herald the hair what's that and
this is what it looks like so yeah I
felt like long curls won't really look
nice with this type of texture hair so I
just do some long curls in here and just
hook this to the side a little bit and
it really is really really nice
definitely a nice thickness so yeah now
as far as Pangolin and shut-in
I had not received any tingling or
shedding from this year I'm not saying
that this week is not going to tangle
and shed it's just another words just as
good tingle so yeah but you won't
really have an issue with tangling and
shed this hair is just really really
nice this looks really natural now like
I said this is a lace front wig so they
only give you they only give you a room
like three inches of parting space but
it's really it's a really good amount of
Pardons and yet overall I would
definitely suggest this wait so if you
are looking for like a Yankee type of
wig then I definitely suggest check it
out this week I promise you you won't be
disappointed so I guess you guys that's
it for this video if you have any
questions about the task feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
