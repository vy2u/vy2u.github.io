let's cancel everything tomorrow oh it's
get caught in the moment but hey guys
it's Kate of course and I'm back with
another video so this video is gonna be
on it this hair and I was sent to him
from oMG Queen
so I'm when they're Brazilian a
lace-front wait and I have it in a
natural color the hair texture is Yankee
straight with bangs so I didn't cut
these vanes in a wig this child came
also the hair length is 20 inches the
cap construction is a cat the glueless
leash front week the week density is 150
percent which I don't really feel like
it's 150 maybe 130 it also comes with an
elastic band and then they say that the
bleach bleach the knots are bleached and
the hairline is pre plucked which I feel
like it was so yeah like I said all the
information will be listed in my
description box just in case you didn't
catch that will you miss some parts so
yeah of course if you're not familiar
with oMG clean hair this is what the
packaging looks like which is really
cute and it just has their name right
here and it says thank you and of course
I love the color scheme because black
and paint just like so long to meet you
guys so yeah this is what the way it
came in and you'll get a comb but at the
moment the comb right in here because
I'm using it and yeah it won't come in
something like this and then on the bag
it just gives you all the hair
information so yeah and then the weight
was stuffed in this and also it came
with a neck won it so yeah that's how
the weight is packaged which is packaged
really well ok so like I said before
these bangs they come like this and they
longer which I like that because it just
gives you it just gives you the option
to cut them down if you wanted them to
be shorter just to like frame your face
how you away your mango how you want
your bangs to be worn so yeah I don't I
don't think that I recorded this hair
before I like cut the bangs down this is
how the hair came so it is pretty
straight I didn't have too flat on it I
literally just put these two buttons
right here and kind of like cut this
down a bit and kind of like cut the
sides a little bit just to kind of frame
my face I absolutely love this way you
guys I have not received any shedding or
tingling yet I really do not believe
that this week is a hundred and fifty
percent density I definitely think it's
like one of 30 and it's not they don't
anything but it's just not one hundred
and fifty percent density so yeah you
can get anything in backroom I do
apologize I'm going to try to speed this
up because I do have videos that I'm
trying to get out for you so this is
just me like not like a full-on review
but me just share this week with you
just in case you like penguins you might
want to look into this wig but yeah one
con that I do have with this wig is that
up in this part is just like totally
bulky you guys and I'm not feeling it
because I didn't wear this wig before me
filming this video and like I was
uncomfortable the whole time like I felt
like people was looking at the top of my
head that's how bulky it was so I feel
like this style works better for this
week unless you really will have to go
in and like pluck a lot of hair out I
feel like this hop was made as though
like you're just getting a soul in or
like a glue in and they kind of put that
like closure when you don't have no
leave out and they put that like circle
closure right there
that's how this week was constructed and
I did go in and try to plug some of the
hair out but it's just it was just wait
too much for me so yeah like I was
saying that's the only con for me is
that this part just makes this wig look
extra Wiggy and faith so the only way
that I would feel that I feel more
comfortable when this wig is it being up
just because it takes away from that
bulkiness but yeah I wore this hair down
and it I was just like on edge the whole
time I was so uncomfortable
so yeah far as like the texture I love
love love the texture I love the length
the quality of the hair is really good
but yeah that's basically it also I
wanted to mention if you was to get this
wig just know that you wouldn't have to
like really glue this way down because
like I said it does come with the UM
adjustable band and with the adjustable
band it fits to any size head so if you
have a smaller size hit you would just
need to adjust that band and literally
this wig it's like so bomb as far as how
it fits me if it's really good and of
course you don't have to do anything to
like the hairline or anything like that
because it's covered so yeah I like this
hair I think saying this style is
definitely a look I really really love
what I did to it so yeah let me just
show y'all how frickin flowy this wig is
and yes you can see like on the side you
can still see like some scalp it
definitely looks very very very natural
yeah that's it for this video I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
