my last review for today so I was sent
this way from B hair extensions so yeah
it came in a package like this of course
it was wrapped in like the little net
and then the plastic it was inside the
place eBay and then just like a baby's
inside of here and then it was inside up
to like the dho shipping bag so yet this
was sent to me on my DHL I think the
packaging was really cute with the
little bag and everything like that so
yeah I was I will leave all the
information in the description box for
you guys if you guys want to check out
their wigs or this wig in particular so
I didn't pick out a hammer head way I
was like let me do this in thetic wigs
because they're synthetic wigs really
look nice so this company definitely
held up to my expectations I'm like so
in love with this unit the only thing I
had to say about it is the fact that um
what I forgot I'm saying the only thing
that I don't like is the fact that I x4
22 inches and this thing is about 26
inches NOLA so I think I want to cut it
but yeah as far as like the synthetic
wigs I'm go you can pick out your length
that you want and everything like that
just like how you do for your version
hey my hair you can also pick out the
lips in the density for your synthetic
wigs as well think this density is like
150 if I'm not mistaken which is really
thick and just like the quality of this
hair for to be synthetic is really nice
and surprisingly yeah
and surprisingly this week has not
tangled yet since I got out the package
and brush through it and it has not
tangled up on me yet now I have received
shutting the shedding wasn't too bad but
it definitely sheds this week it comes
with three combs in the front area and
it comes with a comb in the back with
adjustable straps this also comes with
soft lace and I did pick light brown as
a nice color because you can pick what
color lace you want so mines is a light
brown alright y'all so you know I got
come on head and do my little disclaimer
but I am aware that my lace is showing
and it clearly looks like I have on a
lace front but I didn't bring any of my
head out to blend it all together but
y'all get the idea
and I should have went with medium brown
just because light brown feel like was
way too light like I get like a good
four inches of lace and because I want
to decide part I just shift the wig to
the side so that the lace can my side
part can still be alone versus it being
in the middle like the color is on point
I love it's kind of like a doll and she
blonde um I don't know if the camera is
picking up um some shine but when I say
this wig is very dull it doesn't really
have too much shine where it looks fake
at all and it has dark route all the way
through like it being so long but um
yeah cuz this is not 22 inches this has
to be like 26 inches it's really really
long this is definitely how the way
comes straight out of the peck um all
that it was brush eight the curls are
still in tech and it's just like that
loose kind of cute wavy look like it's
not really straight straight it kind of
has like a few curls thrown in it and it
does have long layers and I think these
wigs are a little more expensive than
Friday night hair but I think it's worth
it
because the part is the bomb
this is kind of noisy so you can heat
this week up I mean you can like put
heat to this wig as well it's just
really long I think I want to cut it to
like right here yeah I'm going to cut it
to like right here and as far as the
texture it is a light Yankee texture I
think you can also pick the texture you
want if you want like silky Yankee the
you can pick holiday so I think I did
pick like Yankee texture if I'm not
mistaken but it definitely looks kind of
on a silky style but when you touch it
it is a slightly a Koosh feel - I'm
really really really really loving this
hair like she's gonna be mad when I walk
through like oh like no but yes uh I
walk outside with all this hair it's
gonna be his turning ok honey like what
maybe like she think she is
yes who do I think I am who do I think I
am cuz I think I'm QC it's so cute oh
all right my camera is more dead so this
is the end of my video I will leave all
the information in my description box if
you have any questions about this wig
feel free to leave it in a comment
