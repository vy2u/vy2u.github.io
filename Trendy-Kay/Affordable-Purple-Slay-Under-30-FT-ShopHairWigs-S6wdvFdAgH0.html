I wanna from the pen to the side
you're funny like a real fool I won't no
way so say you're ill food like you
ain't nothin gonna to put your legs okay
guys okay of course and I'm back with
another video so this video is gonna be
on this hair and this hair was sent to
me from a shop hair wigs so if you
interested I'll leave all the links in
the description box so the wig I'm
wearing is in the style first of all
this is what the Vanessa it's like a
Vanessa wig and the style is super c9
viola I have it in a color pu r which is
abbreviated for purple mix soap you are
mixed so this is what the little card
looks like no mind it's kind of like wet
on the side okay so before I start let's
just give it up for this color and
that's the whole reason I chose this
week was strictly for the color you guys
the color was just speaking to me this
wig reminds me so much of my favorite
week which I've been wearing a lot
lately and that's by Cerises system so
yeah this week looks kind of identical
to it and it has like the same kind of
construction and this wig does not have
any lace so you do not have to cut off
any lace it just comes with the lace
part I know a lot of people don't like
when the way it comes with just a lace
part including me because the part is
just so bulky anyway also has two combs
and a front I'll comb in the back and an
adjustable strap I do feel like this wig
it's like a universe where I feel like
it's good for a bigger sized head and a
smaller size here so if you do have like
a small sized head like myself just go
ahead and adjust your straps so I'm not
going to make this video all along and
drink out but basically I have not
received any shadow or tingling from
this week yet but I'm pretty sure
whoof time I will get some tingling and
shedding but like straight out the pack
and everything like that
this week has not
give me any issues now I normally get
this question which one do I like better
this is the week or this week and I
actually like I still like the sister
wig over this week if you just was
looking for this particular color then I
feel like yes is worth forgetting for
the color and the wig itself it's nice
one thing I will say is you will have to
go in and pluck the part which I did I
didn't really do really too much to this
wig I did brush it out with my vim brush
but that's basically it and the curls
are more formed when you get it and also
I plucked out the part because the part
is really really tight so you will have
to pluck some hair out like I said it
doesn't come with lace to cut off so you
have to be really careful because I feel
like the lace and the front is
detectable so this week comes with a
little bit of baby hairs like around the
hairline so I did utilize my baby hairs
I'm not nothing too dramatic or anything
like that but I just did you know a
little something-something on the side
so yeah this is basically what it looks
like this is a yucky texture and this
wig is really really full it's
definitely not hot but it's really full
and I freaking love the length of this
because just like not too long and not
too short but just right yeah this is
pretty much the wig this color is
freaking gorgeous so let's talk about
this color real quick so the color is
like this purple color and then it has
like highlights of pink mostly towards
the end the ends of the hair that's
pretty much it for this video if you
guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
below and I love you guys if you're not

in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
