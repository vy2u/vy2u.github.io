oh you're my homie now hold it down hold
it down don't go for me now you were
found on me now are you proud of me now
are you proud of me now look down on me
now talk down on me now oh you might
hold me now hold it down hold it down
don't look of course and I'm back with a
another video so this video is going to
be on this hair and I will set this hair
from deserving Hollywood so just in case
any of you guys are interested I'll go
ahead and leave all the links in the
description box so the way that I'm
wearing is my sister's the wigs and it's
in the style cami and I have it in a
color on one beam so basically with this
week this is one of the new units that
they came out with and the construction
on this way let me just say it's
absolutely bomb y'all so basically this
gives you your typical construction it
has two combs in the front I'll comb in
a big and adjustable straps this week
also comes with soft lace so if you're
not a fan of the hard
scratchy lace you'll love this week this
week also comes as a left part yes
you're a left part because I know I get
a lot of questions of some of you guys
asking me what wigs come as a left part
so yeah if you're a left part type of
girl definitely check out this week also
the lace part is form you guys they give
you a deep lace part and I feel like
this way came pretty good like the
Parden on this way it came really good I
feel like you don't really have to pluck
it if you don't once you can just add
your concealer or finishing powder and
you will be good to go I didn't go in
and pluck the wig just a little bit but
once I put my powder into the pod like
it really came alive so I feel like you
really don't need to pluck it but I mean
it's off to you pluck it if you want to
if you don't don't
this week also comes with baby hair yes
so you don't have to worry about cutting
into
hell I didn't add your own baby hey
because it already comes with baby head
it actually comes with baby hair all
throughout the perimeter I don't know if
y'all can see that but it's like all
throughout the hairline and also right
here I just like slip this down with
some gel but it's not really staying
because I use my eco styler gel and
normally when I leave my baby hairs on
my synthetic wigs I use my got to be
glue gel only because it just holds the
synthetic fibers better versus like
regular gel so yeah they are coming up
but this I did not add these baby heads
these baby heads came like this okay
yeah as far as the style it's basically
like a asymmetrical cut when it's longer
on one side I'm not really too much of a
fan of that but I'll get more into that
towards the end of the video but anyway
this week has a little shine but it's
like more of a natural shine like this
week comes off as being a human hair I
feel like it doesn't look synthetic at
all so I love the density of this weight
I like how it feels it feels very very
soft also it is a Yankee texture which I
like but the Yankee texture is not
overdoing it like it's just right this
week looks very natural you guys if you
can see like it looks very natural if
you are familiar with my videos and
watch my videos like that I recently did
a above wig that I absolutely loved but
it was human hair so if you're looking
for that type of style but in like a
synthetic wig definitely check out this
week because so yeah this is basically
what the wig looks like of course this
is the longer side so with this side
okay I'm not really a fan of this side
you guys I just feel like it's too long
in a way it's something about this part
that just is not laying right for me so
we're kind of like it kind of sticks up
like it doesn't I don't know I can't
Lena I don't know young to see that but
like the curl it's just like I don't
know
so yeah this side I love this side like
I feel like it's the perfect bulb like
the way it's cut just everything about
this side I love and I just wish this
side will look like this side this is
just too much going on right here I
don't know I just feel like it's way
it's just too long and because this is
such a deep part it kind of like goes in
your face like this and see it lays
right when this is going towards your
Facebook who wants to walk around like
this all day like for picture if you're
trying to sleep somebody's like like
that would probably be a good picture
but not just on everyday trying to get
 done right that can't be in my face
like that so yeah that's the only thing
that I don't like I just feel like it's
just not it could just be reading I mean
I'm pretty sure somebody would like this
but I don't know for me I just don't
really like how this side is laying on
my shoulder I cannot explain it you're
it's just like you see that how it just
like flips a little bit and I don't know
I just I don't know I don't know
cute weak or whatever definitely love
love love the construction as far as how
it lays it lays so super flat you guys I
didn't put heat to it to make it late
flour anything like that like this is
literally how the weight comes
so yeah the only thing I did was at my
plucked apart a little bit and my
finishing powder this is a weak that you
can just literally cut off the lease and
put it all you need it edge your powder
and you good to go
i'ma turn around so you guys can see a
whole 360
you
but overall I really like this week you
guys I just feel like this part right
here is a little bit unruly but besides
that I really like it like look at that
y'all if we could state how I wanted it
to like it would be great but it's doing
a little thing that I don't like like
over my shoulder I don't really like how
its falling but this is really a cute
cute week so yeah that's it for this
video if you guys have any questions
feel free to leave it in a comment
section down below and I'll see you in
my next video I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
