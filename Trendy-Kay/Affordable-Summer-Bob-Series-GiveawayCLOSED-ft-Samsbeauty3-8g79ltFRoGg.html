another video for you guys
and this will be the continuation of my
summer world series or affordable summer
bulb series so yes so we shall continue
so this is also going to be a giveaway
video for this week that I'm wearing now
so stay tuned at the info okay so this
week was sent to me from Sands beach and
I'll go ahead and leave all seven CD
links to everything in the description
box just in case you guys want to check
this week out so yeah this is the magic
lace curved cut wig and I'm have it in a
style MLC $1.99 and this is going to
color too and I also have two other
colors which so I'm going to go here and
take this out so I can just show you the
construction of the way before talking
about it so yeah what's this one this
one is the DX dy x one B brown and it
just looked like okay it looks like a
blonde color it doesn't really look
Brown to me okay so this is what the
wave looks like straight out the package
and as you can see the cut is one point
you don't have to do anything but plus
the part and that's only if you want to
because the color looks really good
already now for this week that when I
did go in just a little bit to plus the
part but as you can see you don't really
need to plus the part the wig is not
shiny at all and it's a slight Yankee
texture with our life it does come with
Hartley um and they don't give you combs
in the front they only give you a comb
and a bit what's adjustable Shrek so if
you're not really a fan of combs and
this will be good for you because you
know it does it only come
the comb in the back and the comb in the
back is really the one that I normally
fool around with well I was what that
looks like and I just feel like overall
the construction is really good I feel
like if you have a really huge hit you
probably won't be able to fit into this
week will probably be smells on you but
if you have a like normal to smaller
sizes and I feel like this weed will fit
you a birthday I don't have my stress
adjusted on this week and I'm just using
a clip in the back and I feel like this
wig is not going anywhere but if you
hated smaller than mine which I doubt it
but if it is and you feel like the
weight is one call and you feel like the
wages want to come off you can always
like put bobby pins right here at your
temples to secure it the weight down so
it won't fall off or you know it
probably won't fall off because who's
really doing all of that movements that
you do so I just want you to know that
I'm really selling this book if you like
both definitely check out this book
because it's little it felt so perfect
you don't have to do anything the only
thing I did was plug my part and also
edit consistent always once a concealer
and I also added finishing powder to my
normally when I wear this I usually had
my baby hair out but for the purpose of
this video I just decided to go it on
which it still looks nice um and I do I
feel like the part leaves really fled
the way itself just lays really flat you
guys I feel like you don't have to put a
lot of effort into this week and it's
definitely everyday wig and you also can
address this wake up I've been to a way
I kind of look like how I did when I
would see the wedding actually because I
had this point if you follow me on
snapchat then you probably know what I'm
talking about but um I had this boy and
I had all my blood dress it was so cute
with this hair wait yo come one tell me
and it looks so natural like you would
like
looks like I cut my hand to a freshly
cut bulb like and the cut is serious you
guys it's not even it's not like shaggy
pieces anything like it looks so legit
y'all so anyway I have not received any
and shedding from this week whatsoever
even if they I plucked apart a little
bit I still have not received any
shut-in from this wig
I haven't even received any tingling
from this week and I've been wearing
this wig for probably about a month now
or a little over a month I actually see
this wig less and a very long time this
just give me that sexy mature look it
looks so nice so I'm going to go ahead
and it doesn't really like literally uh
I don't have anything to say but just to
tell you how to go get this week if you
have not already purchased this way
because y'all got experiences for
yourself like I feel like this is the
perfect synthetic book if you are
looking for like a short ball because
like I said I've been looking for a
short ball to hit right here for a
minute now and yeah so I'm going to go
ahead and show you guys what the blonde
one looks like one even though I didn't
cut off the lace but you're gonna get an
idea of what it sort of look like when
you receive it
and my hair is just in it's just look
great and I have it in a braid and I
just flip the braid up so yeah
and this is a middle part I want to
judge you shipping this wig around on
the side or anything like that is
strictly a middle club because if you
shifted to the side one side it will be
longer than the other one but do y'all
see this
so this one is just lighter this
actually reminds me of like a sister's
painting away and it reminds me of like
maybe a 27 or 30 or 30 I don't know
so this is mine is mole on a young side
and this one is more when those brownish
shots oh okay I can see it they can
paint it to accuracy but if you never
even saw this one like before they look
blowing but now compared to this one it
kind of looks gross oh oh oh so yeah
okay so these are what the week look
like like I say they lay so good and a
duffer is not all the way through I
definitely love this wig y'all like this
is my this has to be my favorite book
wig hand to the man so yeah I definitely
love this week it's been treating me
real good at y'all
y'all know I like Sean know how to wait
treat me this is a true me real good
like me and her are friends I would love
this wig I take her everywhere with me 1
