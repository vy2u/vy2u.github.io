movie they all gotta stand summit money
move if I feel now it's coming sounds
book - what boss - okay I can't interact
with another video of course and this
hair is going to be a part of my
affordable summer book series so yeah
this way welcome to me from the diva
trust and I have I don't know why my
hair is so stiff I think it's because
the camp is being but anyway we'll get
into it so the way I have on is by body
bus and this is of course the infamous
y'all y'all probably already knew dead
by the strumming I have this in a color
TT one be I and be like indigo blue and
this color I just have to say is amazing
I definitely definitely definitely
definitely love this color so so I'm not
even one like oh I definitely would
sleep that one is wig real hard but I'm
awake now and I actually really do a
like this wing down the only problem
with this wig is always sold out so will
not let me date Trey it's always sold
out in like the natural colors I just
felt like I really wanted to try it and
I didn't feel like waiting for a number
two to become available so I just went
here it was this color and I actually am
really impressed and I'm and I really am
glad that I did pick this color but I
still do want a color number two and
this week so yes but this way is
definitely popping your oMG this does
not look like synthetic hair what so as
this comes as a middle part and it's
strictly in the middle cause you can't
like to ship it to decide anything like
that because it's just as little as six
week has two combs and the first on each
side of the part it has a comb in a bit
and it also has adjustable shred I
definitely feel like this week is big
head friendly for sure because this week
is huge for my head if you follow me
here on
to watch my videos like that you know
that I had a tiny head and this thing is
definitely big I don't have my stress
adjusted I'm pretty sure if I just in my
stress it will fit even better but I
don't know I thought like I didn't want
to adjust my stress I mean it is not
coming off like when I do this but I
don't feel comfortable was how fitting
so before I walk out the house I would
definitely go ahead in it a bobby pin on
each side just to make it more secure so
I can feel comfortable with myself so
yeah this week is definitely present on
my Melanie or beyond sita's oh I love
this color I did not know how I was
really going to feel about this way in
general or this color but I actually
really really really like this year Kol
this is actually my first time like
trying to own everything like that I did
nothing to dissuade the only thing I did
was plus the part and I only plus the
beginning and then I quit because I just
felt like I was like we're not going
 this part because actually it
kind of looks the same like you can't
even tell that I plus the part so I just
stopped and edit my finishing powder to
the part I didn't let on this day I did
not do anything I didn't cut it this is
how it's cut and the cut is actually
really nice and it hits my shoulders
which is a good length for me now I
don't know how you guys are feeling with
this color but this way is definitely a
everyday type of wing I feel like you
can get away when this color every day
me personally our way this week every
day also this week comes with a soft
lace so of course if you don't like the
hot lace because there fall leaves a
low-key kind of like rubs and everything
sheer edges and we all want our edges
right just in case you know he wants
with your hair in a ponytail you know on
a boss buzzer but yeah we definitely
want to keep our edges so I know a lot
of people prefer the softly over the
hard way so yeah I like the soft lace
and I also like parties they both have
the
and cons so yeah but I'm not really
picky when it comes to choosing softly
softly over hoodies I'll wear any of
them so yeah but this definitely comes
with the soft leaves and also when I
noticed when I was plucking my part it's
easier to pluck the hairs out of this
soft lace because you know how sometimes
when you get it soft lace wigs and you
go into plus the part in the lace rips
well you won't have that issue with this
because I feel like the lace is just
really sturdy and secure so I did not
have an issue okay
moving along to tangling and shedding
the only con I had was this hair is the
shine soon as I forgot to pay if we shot
an actor I cut it it was shed a little
worse than what it was before
now the shine had subsided it's not
really that bad but it's definitely shed
even when I brush it is shed now I'm not
getting like hair everywhere but it
definitely shed so be aware of that
and I'm without ohh tingling I had not
received any tingling from this week so
we did one Pangolin but definitely watch
out for the shedding because this week
does a little bit more than what I
wanted to but I just feel like this hair
is so sleek ish and issues pending y'all
oh my gosh and the cut is some serious
honey yeah you're I am feeling myself I
have not snapped this yet but I'm called
to be flooding your snap timelines or
whatever your color I'm about to be
slightly over the whole bunch of snacks
so beware your because I need to take a
whole bunch of pictures with the tears
this is too cute om
I think I love it so much more because
of the color I feel like this color is
piped nothing like this color it's just
hot lacking and dropping
oh and cheese whoo so yeah if you're
interested in it we if you have not
already I should be said if you have not
already purchased this wig I'll go ahead
