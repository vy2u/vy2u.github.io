the man no no no sweet hey guys so mix
with another video and this video is
pushing by Friday night hair and the
week I win is the GLS 132 and I had in a
color TT 27 and basically that's a
duffer and then of the line colors which
is 27 when it ends keep in mind that the
dumpers are not throughout the way
they're only where the link is so if you
like the adopters throughout your week
um you probably won't like this one
because this one is not only through and
I feel like for me this certain hands
out and how I want to where I feel like
the stuff roots needs to be all the way
through the head if you hear anything in
the background I do apologize but I have
kids sound sick so I'm so sorry guys but
moving along to this week okay so if you
do like this week you always can add dog
groups with like a sharpie awesome
colored hair spray so it is fixable if
you would like to end up roots and your
week but I find it really messy so you
might want to be careful on that and you
know add with caution because it can get
messy so if you're not familiar with
Friday night here in a construction of
their units they started putting out
like newer units ahead more of a soft
the lace because I know a lot of people
who are complaining about their heart
lace now this has hardly so this is not
a soft lace weight and also the Parden
area versus the exhaust leaks because
there's always we come with more
hardened area versus they're harder next
week they come with less part in space
that you can play around with so on the
harder length they give you around like
2 inches with report increase versus
versus the soft the lace where they give
you like a four inches worth of clutter
space but you
I'm going to go ahead and show you the
parting and you really can't even see it
but that's all you get and I just did
the flip over my set was this week and
tucked it behind my ear this hair does
not come with baby hair so I took my
razor comb and I just cut baby hairs
into this wig and molded them with my
got to be glue gel and this is pretty
much how it turned out and I definitely
love the style now overall this wig
comes like this street I was a package
the only thing I did I did go ahead and
cut like the tips like right here off
because for some reason they had like
these long pieces only right hand oh
that was super long it is didn't y'all
know I like my walk to gradually be like
as one and it just was not doing that
for me if you want a website it does
look like that like you just tell how
it's going to look it doesn't look
exactly like Hollis on the website so I
knew what I was getting myself into but
I figured I could just go ahead and cut
them off and that's what I did and I
definitely love this type of messy bub
look it looks so effortless and just so
pretty now I will say that this week is
a little on a shiny side so I would
suggest you add in some dry shampoo or
color to eliminate the shine also this
week comes with two combs in the front a
comb in the back with adjustable stretch
I feel like this wig will be good for
any kids side so you have a bigger kid
or if you have a smaller size kid this
week will fit you where it is very
stretchy I just feel like you need to
adjust your shrimp Italy it is on a
smaller size and you will be I have
received a little bit of shedding and
that's when I cut the lace and other
than that I have not received any
shedding from this wig as far as
tangling I have not received any penguin
I did brush out the curls to this had to
make it a little bit more fuller and as
I was brushing out the curls it didn't
really tangle it kind of
a bit but that's basically it so as far
as like Tanglin Shedden I would say it's
pretty good that the part like the
hairline is not natural also you would
have to like create baby s or push the
tan line back a little bit so or push
the way back so it could be behind your
hairline because it's so much hair right
here is thick because the density in
front of the wig is pretty full
you could pluck the hairline if you had
the time to do that it is time-consuming
but I would suggest if you had the time
to do that you could definitely pluck
out the hairline just a bit or add some
baby hairs or like I said push the wigs
behind your hairline and leave some your
hair and fracas all up to you so guys
that's it for this video if you have any
