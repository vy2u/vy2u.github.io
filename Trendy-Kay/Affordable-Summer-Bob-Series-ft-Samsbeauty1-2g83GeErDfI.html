you don't need nobody that's where I was
- out of my cosmic stuff I was doing out
on my god password you don't need nobody
I swear I was doing on my god
welcome to my humble bub series King I'm
doing a summer web series so this is one
of the weeks that I will be showing you
guys so yeah this welcome to me from the
same Beauty so I'll go ahead and leave
all Sam's Beauty links in the
description box just in case you're
interested in its weight or want to
check out other ways that they have
available on their website so yeah let's
get started so the week that I'm wearing
is the sensational and princely Spartan
weight and I have it in the style with
ginger and I have it in the color tp1 be
30-27 so can we just start off by saying
the color is absolutely gorgeous
it just screams summer to me the way
that it's cut everything about it I
really love just the style overall how
it looks it really looks fresh and just
kind of like cute and I don't know I
just get like a girly vibe from these
color I don't know it's just doing
something to me this is a Yankee texture
it does look really natural this week
does not have a shine whatsoever also it
comes with a lace part it does not come
with lace to cut off so your person I
hate cutting off your lace you'll love
this way I'm the only thing about it not
coming with lace is the fact that it is
really big in bulky and the part is
definitely detectable so if you wanted
to go ahead and cut in the lace so you
can make it lay flatter you could and I
have a video on up showing you guys how
you do that so I'll leave it down below
just in case you want to make your part
late a little flatter so yeah but I
didn't do anything
into the part except for pluck it
because it is also tight in a heads like
a lot of hair doesn't look natural at
all and then I went ahead and edit my
finishing powder and this way also comes
with like baby hairs right here on a
perimeter so been though the part is
like the detectable I use the baby hairs
to kind of you know give me some baby
hair action kind of to take away from
the thickness in the front if you do it
in thin but yeah overall um this wig is
nice I just I'm really not a fan of the
part it could be it has potential to be
so much better than what it is if you
want to put in the work and fix in the
part but besides the part the style is
like so freaking pretty now as far as
the construction of this cap basically
they give you one comb right here which
is really really weird to me I don't
know if they forgot to add the other
comb right here I don't know but it's
just one comb just chilling right here
and then it's also a comb in the back
and they give you a Jessica shrimp I do
feel like this week it became funny but
it can go both ways if you have any
smaller sized head just a gesture strip
okay so I did get a little shedding from
this wig it wasn't nothing too bad and
it might have just came from me plucking
on the hair of the plot because I did
pluck a lot of tails apart so yeah it is
 but it's not this and also this
week has not tangled okay so it's a
couple things about this wig that I just
do not care for um so let me go ahead
and tell you guys with those things on
the first thing is the way the tracks
are set up in the back there's like they
are so going straight up and set it down
so kind of like go straight up and then
flip over I don't know but that's how to
wait to me I don't like how
yeah I don't like how the trip tricks a
laying in the bank I don't like how they
stole the tractor one two this week so
yeah that's the first thing I don't
really know a second thing I really
don't care for is this part right here
this part right here is extra freakin
thick yeah it's like not tracks right
here it's kind of like I don't know I
can't explain it but it's really like it
doesn't look how it feels because it
feels like really bushy like it if you
was to like do that like it just sticks
right up so yeah I'm really not a fan of
that so yeah I'm definitely not a fan of
it but besides that like I definitely
love this color I think the color is
like my favorite part of this week also
I definitely love the way that they had
like this cut so yeah and this is how
the way comes straight out the package
like I said the only thing I did see
this weight was plus the parts so this
is how it comes cut and everything and
yeah so I definitely feel like this side
is a little bit longer than this side
too but um yeah let me go ahead and turn
around through you guys can see what it
looks like you know all the way around
so that's it for this video I will see
you in my next video if you guys have
any questions feel free to leave it in
the comment section down below and yeah
I'll see you in my next video guys I
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
