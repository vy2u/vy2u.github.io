swear you don't need nobody that's where
I was two out of my dynamic with another
video so this video is going to be on my
stomach bub
very so this is one of the wigs that
I'll be featuring in this series so I
would sit this week from same beauty and
this is the sensational inference lace
party week and I have enough style Jaden
in the color burgundy with blue jeans
which is burgundy so this is what it
looks like so as you can see the wig
does not well my wig that I wear and
does not look like the picture obviously
and that's only because I just cut this
guy because mmm so let me tell you guys
about this week before I start telling
you my thoughts on this week okay so
first off this week does not come with
any lace to cut off so like I said in my
previous video if you are a person that
does not like cutting off lace or you
just don't know how to this is a week
that would be good for you because you
don't have to cut off any lace okay now
I know you're probably thinking like oh
the part it's going to be so thick no
honey
when I say they made this part so
perfect and when I tell you that this
part is laying so flat you guys so this
is a Yankee textured wig which I really
like is not like overly Yankee but is
definitely a Yankee natural texture wait
this week also comes with two combs in
the front right here each side of the
part I'll comb in a bag and adjustable
shreds I do feel like this week is the
kid-friendly so if you do have a big
aside page you'll definitely
that you really good now it can go both
ways if you have a smaller side pay
after like this constituency I'd just
adjusted my stress and this week assist
me really securely and I don't feel like
you know it's going to come off or
anything dog here or not I love the
burgundy color it's just my thing
I feel like this color excuse any skin
tone I just freaking love it so yes
let's get one two this week you guys
because I'm no keep up so the way I feel
about this week is when I first put it
on I didn't like it at all like I like
the color I like the construction of
this wig but the style was just a little
I do not like it
now this type of wig is giving me like
an old-school type of vibe like TLC Bob
okay because this is not your average
type of bull this bulb is hiked up in
the back which kind of turned me off a
little bit but and I feel like it turned
me off only because this part was long
like this part was short this part was
long and the way it basically looks
exactly like the picture and for me what
it hyped up in the back let me show you
guys so this is what the back looks like
which I actually really love the style
of the bag now that I cut this up
because it I don't know
so this is what the way it looks like
and after I cut the hair like open it's
how you see how this might gradually go
into the ball this side was not like
this it just looked really weird and
awkward so I cut it so that it can go
into the cut I just wanted the book to
look more in sync so I just cut this
side off and I just cut about this much
off and I really really really loved
this week you guys it took me a while to
get used to the bag because I'm like but
it's different and I just not tangle or
 I wasn't really surprised too much
with the tangling because it is a
shorter wig and normally you good on
Pangolin but Shannon I just expected to
get shedding and I did not get any shot
in from this week yes I'm pretty sure
two strands so to come soon but for now
I have not received any shedding I just
feel like overall this is a really good
summer wig I will say I do not like this
week how it comes originally with the
side long right hand and then headed
this part like short like that it to me
it just did not look right so I did
definitely have to go in and cut that so
as I cut it I just feel way more
confident about this wig I just feel so
good and it looks so good it's laying
and slaying my life you guys I'm so yes
also I do not have any of my hair out I
just created baby hairs and just cut
some hair in the front and then I
flipped it down with my god to be glued
this stuff is like Megan and tell me
what you think about this wig you guys
tell me what you think about the back of
this week do you like it is that a yes
for you is it a note for you but I will
say the way they have this heart set up
and for the price
like you just have to get it and just
cut this for y'all y'all won't be
disappointed just cut it off in ugochi
I'm trying to tell you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
