video is going to be a closed trial haul
because your gun just seems to love
these two videos so yeah let's get
started now I'm this video is going to
be on sample I'm a fool therefore they
were kind enough to send me a more basic
thing so of course you guys know that
already did a trial haul from them
before and I got a lot of good feedback
so when he asked me to do a another
trial hold for them I was like I'll buy
nice ok so I guess we'll start off with
a one piece and this is what it looks
like and it's like basically a nude
color and then it just has the
crisscross tire detail in the front and
you also had this open cutout crop
crisscross detail on this side and yeah
that's what it looks like and I think I
got this in a size large which if it's
ok I feel like it could be a little bit
snug kind of like in a back area
but yeah I'm nonetheless I really like
this swimsuit so the next one is a
two-piece high-waisted attitude and I
absolutely love it
so basically it's just a white bigness
you and this is at the top of the pike
and it has like the little palm trees on
it and then the bottoms are just
high-waisted and I baked it to
synthesize large now um this fits me
absolutely perfect I do wish that it was
a bit more highways because it's just
like just cutting it like it's sitting
right right right there above my navel
but for the most part I absolutely love
the fit and I just love everything about
it after like the print looks really
good okay so this bathing suit looks
like the two-piece that I just showed
you and basically it is a one-piece
and it cut out in the back and it just
has these um little clip so you can
close it but of course you don't know
what it looks like once I show you the
trailer portion but yeah and it also has
like mesh right here but it still has
the same kind of print that it does on
this type of material is really nice how
they have that because on a website like
you have to look really close to see if
it's mesh and I so yeah I thought this
was really cute now I feel like this
will be more for somebody I feel like
this will even was too cool for someone
with a larger chest size just because
it's like way too big on me up in this
area so yeah maybe I should have went
down the size I'm not sure but again I
got this in a size large or extra large
I can't remember yeah I got this in a
size large okay so next is a one piece
and it just looks like this basically it
just has like the cutout opening right
here it kind of looks like the only
thing that's keeping it attached
basically is the size so it kind of
looks like a high waisted two-piece set
it set except so the sides are attached
and I really like it if it's my body
really nice
my boobs are kind of like out underneath
like on the bottom I don't know that's
how it's supposed to be but I kind of
liked it so I just like leave it that
way but yeah this is really really cute
and this is in a size large so the next
item I got is another um one piece but
it just basically is open right here and
on the sides and it just have all these
type of cutouts and again this is like
the other one-piece bathing suit with
kind of like your boobs are showing
underneath which I don't really mind
then look I don't know call it slightly
I don't know I like it
so yeah I know
the swimsuit itself is too small or if
that's just how it's made for you like I
said I like it so this one fits okay I
don't know if I told you guys what size
this within but this is in a size large
okay so moving right along
now I'm the next swimsuit is going to be
and see this is what the top looks like
and it's just like this kind of like
blush pink
peachy type of color and it has like
that tribal print and then the bottoms
are like super super super high waisted
now the only issue with this is I didn't
know which way was the front in which
way was the back but I mean it I mean
the friend the back looks pretty much
the same so this one kind of looks like
it's a one-piece and it's just connected
by the sides like the previous bathing
suit I showed you but yeah I actually
really liked it I think the fit is
really really nice and this is and it's
size medium and the medium fits me
really really good so the next day the
suit I got is one of my favorites you
guys and it's just a two-piece how we
sedated you again
and place is hot pool oh yeah so this is
basically what it looks like and it's
just black with the mesh and it short
sleeves and then a head like a cutout in
a big and like this little attachment
piece to like clip it together so I just
think this is really cute and I also got
this in a medium because I felt like
with these type of with the hard cup
bras I feel like I need to be in a
medium soldier so like the cups can fit
me so yeah I went down inside and the
babies you said has the like the tops
like this so yeah and the bottoms just
look like this and these do kind of go
up like you're but it's kind of going to
be out so if you're not really into that
then you might not like that and also
these was not really is how
I want them to be like it was cutting it
real close um but for the most part I'm
going to write this Davis II because I
absolutely adore this agency I think
it's so nice and trendy and I really
really like it so yeah next one that was
a favorite of mine is this two-piece
high waisted baby suit and it just looks
like this and I'm going to show you what
the top part looks like but I can't show
you what the bottom part looks like like
as far as trying it on because I
couldn't even get it on my leg like it
couldn't even go up my leg so yeah but
oh my goodness I wish I would have got
the correct size and I don't know if I
mentioned but it's in a medium so
basically this just ties around right
here and has the mesh and then it has
like a detailing right here going in the
middle and then like the cup like
everything about this the top fits me so
perfect you guys it just looks really
good and then you tie it in the back and
these are what the bottoms look like and
of course like if you can see who I
can't fit into this like this looks like
a kid's bottom but yeah this is what the
bottoms look like which you're I could
get my butt into these I would set it
off okay because this was really weird
experiment on to the next one soon and
this one is another two-piece swimsuit
and I got this in a size local basically
it just the top is mesh and the bottoms
are black and the top basically goes
around your neck like that and it Clips
clink together in the back and I really
like the fit of this and everything if
it's me really good and I like to cut
out detailing when the bots when the
bottoms I think that it's really sexy
and just add some pearls to handle next
I have another two-piece and this is
another one that I'm
in love with I feel like this whole
colleges melt into my skin so basically
it's a teepee this is the size large and
let me just fix this top sazon really no
so this is what the top looks like and
it just has like the cutout details in
the front it's just like real strappy in
the back and it is a new color and then
the bottoms are high waisted and they
just look regular news so yeah I just
really love how the color looks on my
skintone and I just love how it looks it
looks really really sexy and I passed it
up with a bike chain I purchased from my
passion oh I felt like the body changes
set this bathing suit off so much so
yoga chains this summer is going to be
lit um it's so many cute words out right
now so yeah and you can wear them with
like swimsuits you can wear looks like
dresses you can wear with practically
anything just to set your outfit up so
yeah I thought that was really cute so
yeah this baby seat is definitely one of
my favorites and probably one of my
go-to though this next one is another
one of my favorites you guys and this is
a two-piece and it just looks like this
and it's tied up in the bag and it's
just basically like really colorful was
with nothing but tropical bright
colorful flowers which I really really
loved so yeah it just looks like this
and basically you tie it in the bag and
I got this in a size large so yeah the
top part does fit like really tight but
that doesn't change the same day I still
like it and it doesn't look fit so I'm
not really worried about it
so yeah in the bottom arm portion now
the bottoms
I like the or high-waisted but the only
thing I can say about the only bad part
is that the this part right here like
that little strap piece it doesn't fit
my
waste so yeah that's the only thing this
next one is another two-piece
high-waisted attitude and I'm not really
going to show that much of the Santa
suit on because it is a Sun so yeah this
one wasn't really my favorite but it has
like the cutout bottoms and I don't
really know if I'm really liking the
whole white with the blue and like the
slow print I don't know but yeah this is
what it this is what the top looks like
and these that part just ties around
here onwards know by like the either but
yeah and just like nuts in the front and
then it has like a little cutout kind of
detail whatever like this tie up
detailing in the back so yeah and I also
got this in a size alarm okay next is a
one-piece song the bathing suit and I
love it's like a color black type of
agency and the color is not really
showing up this is kind of like an
orange color but it's coming off like
unlike a yellowish or just color that's
really nice but anyway this just ties
around your neck like this and it has
the mesh detailing right here and then
it has like this orange color going into
this new color and I just really like
this bathing suit I do wish that I would
have got a smaller size because also it
fits like up in this part like it's it's
my book area real good like it's fine
but then we go to the bottom it's just
not fitting the way I would like it to
your needs to be tighter issues it just
fits really moving on to the next so
these last three I have three more left
these last three bathing suits I don't
know if I was really going to show you
to try on pushing out these bathing
suits but I'll show you what they look
like this one is a black and white one
piece if I can fix it
and this is just what it looks like and
it Criss crosses in the back and now I
got this in a size large it was kind of
like hiked up in a bag
I really didn't like that I feel like if
they would have added like adjustable
strength this would have been a fire but
here um and then the next one is another
one piece and this was just like crazy I
don't even know why I picked this out I
think I picked this out because of the
bag I felt like the back was so cute how
is tied up but this is this just did not
fit my torso whatsoever this business
suit is really really short and then
last but not least I really really like
this when I saw it on the website but
the way that it's set up it just I don't
know it I don't know it could just be me
maybe I need a smaller size but it's
basically like a mesh cutout right here
and then it has like a floral print and
it's really cute I just think that I
need a smaller size I got this in
extra-large I don't know what I was
thinking I was trying to go back to my
like the way the previous bathing suits
that I review fit but I don't know but
it is cute I just don't like the fit but
I think I am going to insert on the clip
so you guys can see what this one looks
like yeah I just wish it fit a little
bit better but definitely it's
definitely really really cute so yeah so
