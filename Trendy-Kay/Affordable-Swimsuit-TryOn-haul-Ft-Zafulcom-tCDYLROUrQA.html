with another video in this video is
going to be a swimwear trial haul so
example was kind enough to reach out to
me asked me that I want to do a triangle
haul so their swimsuits and of course I
said yes because we all know that spring
is here and summer is approaching and we
got to get our bathing suits on Dec feel
like we can't just be last-minute with
everything and then everything that we
want to be you know out of stock or
whatever the case may be so of course
this is an affordable website and they
sell other things besides swimsuits but
mainly everybody gets their swimsuits
from here because they are affordable
and shipping it's pretty good and it
comes fast and the quality of these
pieces are really good for the price
that you're paying so I definitely think
that they are worth it you guys if you
haven't heard of this company or if you
haven't heard of this website please go
check them out i'ma leave my link to
i'ma leave everything in my description
box just in case you guys want to go
check them out or just in case you like
the pieces that I chose I will leave the
direct link so you can purchase those as
well
so also with this not only because I'm
not going to show it in the Triangle
hall because it was just way too big now
this is a half piece how wasted on
swimsuit that I got and I loved it
because with the practical
juices and I loved it because of the
colors like this is one so like a green
and white type of print and then the top
is like a bright yellow I don't really
know if this short they go but I thought
it was really cute and on the bottoms I
just a way too big for me and so as the
type this whole swimsuit is like a
little big so basically the top goes
like this around your neck and then it
has like this opening right here and in
the back just you know it goes like that
and my whole boob area was out it was
like impossible for me to wear this
bathing suit so yeah if you do like this
bathing suit I would suggest you get
in like your regular size or something
because if that was way too big but love
the colors is just like so pretty and it
really looked nice on my skin time so
the next item I've got is another high
waisted swimsuit and this is white also
you guys you'll notice that I don't
really do a lot of color with my
wardrobe I need to but most of my pieces
are white and black so I'm sorry you
guys these are white in their mesh you
can't really see them but I'll put up a
clip so you can see what it looks like
one and it is basically how we sit in
the head like the mesh designs on each
side so this fits really good and then
it comes with this top and it just has
the mesh right here the little mesh
detail right here and it's just like a
regular baby food that strips in the
back it doesn't tie around the neck to
get to clip it one and it's just like
regular so yeah that's what that looks
like and this fits perfect I really like
the way that this bathing suit fit so
then next is a one-piece bathing suit
and this bathing suit fits a little
funky I don't know if I'm going to show
what it looks like on only because like
this top part okay so the top part is
like I feel like you wouldn't be able to
swim in it this is just something to
look cute in it also it has the mesh
detailing because you know I'm loving my
mesh so yeah it just pays the mesh
detailing on the side and then this
comes like all the way up to like right
here and then the back it just has the
straps going all the way down to the
butt
I don't know it's cute but I wouldn't
suggest you awareness in water or get a
smaller side and next is another one
piece and I'm pretty sure you guys have
already seen this bathing suit because a
lot of people have already reviewed this
one-piece but he is basically like a
one-piece in a material is like really
and thick you can tell that they have
some nice material it was nicely made it
looks like it's really nothing there but
it's like lace detailing right here it's
really pretty but of course I don't
think that this would be good to wear in
the water
I was definitely aware this was maybe
like some black high-waisted skinny
jeans with some Hills I think that
probably would look so pretty so yeah
this is from next I got another one
piece black bathing suit and this just
has like a lot of strappy cutout looking
things going on like on the side and it
has like that plunging neckline where it
goes all the way down in the front and
this was a bit too tight on me I felt
like it was squeezing me so bad that the
fit was like squeezing out of these
parts and it did not look flattering on
me at all I wish I would have went up a
size in this because actually looks
really good also all of these bathing
suits come with like the inserts that I
really don't like too much because they
just fly everywhere and it looked like
you have like a boob right here and a
boob right there I'm just not feeling
that but yeah so the most part of this
was like really good quality and I
really love this bathing suit it sucks
that it just doesn't fit the way I want
it to so a nexus is a nother one-piece
bathing suit that's mesh so I really
love the style of this magnitude and
basically it's just all black and it has
like mesh details like a realm the next
part and then when you flip it over to
the back it's like a little keyhole
cutout right here and then everything is
literally mesh and the size of mesh now
this I really didn't like the fit on the
back it didn't like fit on my back it
was just kind of straight so it made my
shape look crazy in a bit but
nonetheless I still really like this
piece next I'm pretty sure you guys are
all familiar with this mate
and it's like this tribal print bathing
suits and it's how we sit in his hands
just to cut out details on the sides and
this assists me really good at the
bottom sent me so good now let's talk
about the top the top is so huge like I
said I don't really have boobs I'm
basically slanted you guys so this my
boobs were just lost they were drowning
in this top and it didn't leather my top
oh yeah Origen so yeah I definitely love
this baby I just wish the top fit a
little bit more better but the bottom
sits so perfect you guys so yeah I could
actually got a medium honestly I really
could have got a medium but I wasn't
sure I wanted to be able to say size the
next piece is also a two-piece and it's
the high-waisted bathing suit and it's
just a black and white type of color and
it looks like that and it also has to
cut out on the sides because you're not
and just loving my cutout
type thing so I thought these were
really cute and then it just comes with
the matching black top and then a head
like the detail and in the middle of the
top like it does on the side so yeah and
this fits me perfect top and bottom it
fits me so perfect and I think that this
is so cute so then I decided to get an
outfit from the site because I thought
and I was like oh my gosh like this is
really pretty I feel like it will really
look good for my body and it does you
guys oh my gosh so let me show you
today's first so basically it's like
this two-piece and it's kind of like a
cream of white color and then it has
like the black stripes going down and it
comes with a matching crop top so the
bottom basically if it's like tight on
your body and just hugs you all the
right places
so you're if y'all don't have no booty
doesn't make you definitely look like
you got a little booty
he okay because it just hugs you all the
right places and then it makes it look
even sexy with the split going up the
leg so I just really like this and this
stops at my ankles yet it's not like a
little above my ankles and it is meant
to be like how we sit so then this is
what the top looks like this is the
front and then the back it just has like
a deeper of being and it has like the
little shrimpy school across and then
arms are kind of like they don't they're
not foliage the arms don't go all the
way down but they do flare out so yeah I
thought this is really really cute you
guys and it really looks nice and the
last piece I have is this cover-up and
it's just a long sheer blank cover-up
and it's really long I can't remember
what size I got this in I think I got
this in a size large or extra-large I
wanted it to fit a little big well not
big but I wanted to make sure it was
like long enough and it's just
absolutely gorgeous and it has like this
drawstring in the middle way the wastage
is in case you an extension and so yeah
I think this looks really cute like I
think this would really look cute pay it
looks like a black strappy body contrast
and then so this one top with some heels
oh my gosh girl because this is like
really long I'm it's red on the floor
that's how long it is so when you put
some Hills on with this issue's home
look so sexy okay so that's it for this
video guys I hope that you enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
