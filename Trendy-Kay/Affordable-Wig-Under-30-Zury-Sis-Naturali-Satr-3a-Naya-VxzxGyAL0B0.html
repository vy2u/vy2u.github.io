get jung-gu butter demanding and oh my
gosh it is that you can kiss any of the
hey guys so I'm back with another way
review and this week was sent to me from
elevate styles so I'll make sure I leave
all their links in my description box
just in case you like this week or you
want to check out other hair that they
have available on their site so yeah but
those of you who will follow me on
snapchat and Instagram you've probably
already seen this week I did post it on
my Instagram and my snapchat so yeah
this is my first time I'm hearing about
this brand or like wearing this Brandes
is my first time so this is the
naturally star and it is their pre
please part and it says deep and white
in and salt and natural so yes and I had
an inner color 1b and the style is 3 a
Nia Anaya how do you want to say that
but yeah that's what it looks like in a
weight overall looks like the pictures
to me um this is supposed to be like a
side part and you're supposed to have a
part it doesn't come with lace or
anything like that
it just comes with the lead part and I
just felt like I really didn't like it
it looked real bulky in and I mean yeah
you can't put heat on it so yeah you
can't put heat on this so it's not like
you can flatten the part or anything
like that so yeah I felt like it was but
just to you know do us apart but this
also is available in a lot of colors
yeah but I feel like this would look so
nice with um like as a
gray color like a dove deep burgundy you
like some type of red go that will look
so fire but yeah
let's just leave like some curls in here
is not all of them just because it
probably will make the wig last longer
and it just looks better because the
curls are really cute like I feel like
you wouldn't really need to pluck it out
like maybe fluff it up and that's
basically what I did and then I didn't
use the part because I felt like it was
just too big and bulky and I felt like
it just looked real fake but when the
part was right here
the hand was a little bit longer because
I guess the disposal school went to the
side so I just cut it to frame my face a
little bit and even it out with the rest
of the curls and that's basically what I
did to the fake and this is what it
looks like
I haven't received any shine and as far
as like tangling of course this is a
very coarse texture I'm pretty sure when
you ran your fingers through it it is
going to tangle so I suggest just like
leaving it a little bit but yeah um this
wig is so freaking cute like you can
move it if you don't like all the day
like when you're 48 because you feel
like you want to break out something
like you can scoot it to the side like
that and hit a little piece right there
like wow and then you can sort it out
and then you can like cool it down see
my issue with this video is that like
wigs like this s oh wow like the weight
stuff to like do like that y'all know
I'm talking about if y'all don't I'm
telling y'all like I know I'm not crazy
but like the wig stuff to do like this
and it goes into this type of form and
like it like that that's too short for
me like that doesn't work well with my
face shape it just looks real wet and
awkward to me I don't know so like this
is cute if the wig would stay like this
that's why I say it needs to be a little
bit longer for what a wave one
so it's crunching I'd like that like it
will already be long if you don't think
I don't know but that's kind of annoying
see if it would just like stay down like
this and then my like I really like this
winning it just just keep on shrinking
that's why I put bobby pins down here
too that's another reason up the bobby
pins down the bottom till I try to hold
it securely like I don't know
wait yeah you guys I really do love this
week yeah I'm just having a lot a type
of relationship with this wave right now
so yeah but I feel like this is so cute
yeah yeah if you are person s into like
the more natural ways and you like like
the more natural type of look definitely
try this week if you don't already have
this week I feel like it's just doing
something to my life right now like the
curls or this week are styled like
really really nice this looks like
somebody's actual hair so nice um what
do you guys think be like this or these
are likely to be longer or is it just me
I would really like to know you know
yours keeps the world and I let it but
um see is growing on me like it's
growing you know so but I think it in my
bag girl
they won't even believe this is a week
like and I feel like if you have a
bigger sized teeth this league will fit
you good if you have a small
sartet I feel like it would be a little
bit big but overall I feel like it's a
nice fit I did add some bobby pins to
the bag to hold the back down because it
is a little bit on my head
but I feel like it is pretty returning
the links in the description box and yes
I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
