review video from a company that I
received this hair from and this hair is
from le moteur and you can find this
company or vendor on Aliexpress and I'll
make sure to list everything in my
description box down below and links to
the hair as well as the state so yes I
hid in the and I'm reading off of my
thing because I couldn't remember but it
is the Peruvian loose wave human hair
extensions so this is what it looks like
and this is not the natural curl that um
it comes in its is a really really
really nice curl and now my battery
wants to go deep which sucks but so yeah
I have in the inches 24 why having four
bundles they did send me four bundles in
a closure which was 24 24 22 and 20 was
the 18 inch lace closure I did not use
the closure because I felt like I wanted
to UM wear my hair out so my hair is out
and the top area and I just made a new
part way out of this and then sewed the
perimeter down to my head so yes this
hair is so beautiful you guys like I'm
really enjoying wearing it and like when
I say this head does not tangle I do get
shedding but it's not really bad and
it's not everyday so I get shut in here
and there but I have not received any
tangles yet I had this hair for about
two weeks now - or maybe one and a half
weeks so it's doing really well so this

was pretty fast yeah I think I got my
hair in like 2 or 3 days which was
really nice so the packaging was also
good was packaged very well and it did
not have a smell to it or anything like
that when I received the hair and I will
recommend his head to anybody because
this is some bum hey you guys so yeah I
just took my flat irons because you know
I'm a fan of the loose curls and just
added some loose curls to it and this is
how it is so the hair does hold a curl
really well I didn't try bleaching it
but I'm pretty sure it will bleach very
so if anybody was interested in some
hair and they didn't really know what
vendor to look for or just having
problems finding the vendor peri
especially if you're ordering a head
from off a fairly Express cuz I know it
can be hard trying to find a vendor a
good one with good quality hair
definitely check out le moteur
they are so awesome so nice as far as
like communication and things like that
so yes this hair is not too thick though
and I have let me say they sent me four
bundles I wound up using I wound up
using 3 bundles almost close to four
bundles I had like mmm maybe like this
much hair left so it's not really thick
but it's thick enough so yeah eventually
I probably would end up using the
closure
I'm too the same when I get tied up my
hair being out I'm tying my hair out
already so let me just step back and
show you guys how long 24 inches come on
me and it's like really really long so
that is the limp and I'll show you guys
the back it's like really flowy and this
head is just bombed I'm not going to do
