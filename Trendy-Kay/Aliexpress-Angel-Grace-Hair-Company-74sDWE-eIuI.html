video it's going to be kind of quick
because I'm just like sharing some hair
that I was sent by a company from
Aliexpress so yeah if you're looking for
like some affordable bundle hair then
yes stay tuned so the whole time I'm
thinking I'm recording and I'm actually
not alright so let's try this again yo
okay so I was sent this hair from a
company from Aliexpress the company name
is angel grace hair company and I will
leave the links in my description box as
well as the links to this hair and their
website so umm again this is what the
hair looks like I was sent five bundles
total and a lace closure I have - 24 -
24 bundle - 24 inch bundles I have two
22 inch bundles and I have a 20 inch
bundle as well as a 20 inch lace closure
so yeah I do have all five bundles and
the closure in my head because I just
felt like I wanted this head to be
really thick and when I tell you like
this hair is really thick from the left
all the way down to the bottom like it's
not this hair is really really thick I
probably did not need to put all five
bundles in here and I wish I didn't but
I mean it's cool um what else when I
first received his hair like I didn't
get no shut in from this hair I did not
receive any tangle in it did not have a
smell the packaging was good I meant
that I did not um phone me like taking
it out of the package or anything but
yeah this is Brazilian straight hair I
did curled his hair as well and a whole
it's a curl like for a long time when I
try to straighten out actually like it
kind of didn't want to get straight and
then I left it long and I came back and
straighten it again and they got
straight but yeah this this head is gone
the only thing that I will say is or my
only complaint is the closure it's not
really a complaint I don't know
um the closure is a little bit on the
thin side I wish it was just like a tad
bit thicker than what it is because it's
like all the hair is like thick because
I did it five bundles and then when you
get up here it's like kind of like on a
thin side I don't know I can't really
explain it but I just wish the closure
was a little bit thicker but I don't
know if the closure is less density
because it's long it's 20 inches long so
yeah um I did bleach my nights now
you're I don't mess with no bleach like
as far as bleaching my nights I've never
bleached my nights or my closure or my
wigs I just feel like I'm afraid to mess
it up and if I mess it up I don't want
to go through having to like fix it
or anything like that but I was like
feeling in the mood to experiment and
see how my closure will turn out if I
bleached it so yeah it actually turned
out really really good and this is what
it looks like and I'm like so pleased
and happy with my dad when cause you're
like you know I just don't know I felt
like I was gonna mess it up but it
actually turned out really good so yeah
the closure um does not come bleach I
did bleach it and I didn't mention I did
this is a full unit that I made this
hair is like really long on me um yeah
so I don't know how I'm feeling about
the long hair right now especially like
this long bit though it's about to be
hot outside I might
cut it but I wanted a loan because I
didn't plan on wearing it straight I
planned on um curling this hair so yeah
I'm still like I don't really know what
I want to do well right now I'm just
rocking and straight but yeah this head
definitely holds a curl I'm very pleased
with this company um yeah I really I
actually don't have anything bad to say
that like this head is like really thick
from like top to bottom even I think if
I didn't have all of these bundles in my
hair and it wouldn't be like then
because when I took out the tracks like
it was like not you know how the tracks
thought like the head start being like
really thin when you get towards the the
end of the hair like it wasn't like that
at all so that was something that I
really like I'm kind of made I might
take some like tracks out because I just
feel like for the clothes a bit though I
feel like from the closure band a little
thin um I feel like the hair is like so
so yeah oh yeah like I was saying when I
was making this unit I did cut the wefts
and still after I cut the wefts I had
not received like any shutter like of
course I received like a little bit of
shedding from like me cutting it but
like after that like after I brush it
out after I made the unit like after
that there was like no shedding no
tangling like nothing it doesn't tangle
in like the nape area or anything and
let me show you all the heads to the
front but I don't even have to wear all
this hair to the front that's how thick
it is like so I just like put a little
bit up here cuz it's so thick and then
little bit on each side and I still have
like a whole bunch in the back it's
crazy but um yeah so if you guys are
looking for something affordable buy new
hair definitely check out this vendor
from Aliexpress see a called angel grace
hair company and like I said I will
leave the link to their website as well
as the links to this hair in my
description box and if you have any
questions about this help anything in
general feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below so yeah sorry
this was a pretty quick video but I just
wanted to UM share this hair company
with you because I actually really like
them
besides my closure but that's like not
really a big deal but yeah they actually
did thing with this like this is pretty
long y'all doing this this hair is like
super long because it's like getting hot
outside
I might just cut this ham I'm still not
sure what I want to do but yeah so
overall I really like this hair um if
you're wondering what's on my lips its
lax from colour-pop so yeah I'll put it
in my description box as well so um yeah
again let me show y'all this closure
because what I did my favorite
disclosure anyone live like it's so flat
like this probably has to be like the
best week I've ever made out of all my
years of weave making this has to be
like the best one that I've made</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
