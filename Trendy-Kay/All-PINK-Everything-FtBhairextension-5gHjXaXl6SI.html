know I go get is okay she'll be four
butterfly plotted in a lil I've been on
a leash or do you Alan over here lost it
your prettiest down in a chair and I'm
back with another weed review and this
week listen to me from be hair extension
so I'll make sure I leave all their
links and everything in my description
box so just in case you guys are
interested in this unit or just wigs
that they have on this site in general
so the wig I am wearing is their dark
pink waves synthetic lace front wig and
I'm looking down because I'm reading it
so if you're not familiar with me hair
extensions their packaging just looks
like this and it comes in a little big
like this and of course inside the bag
with just a week in a weightless wreck
inside of this and then a head the
netting over you know on the top see how
the curls come which I think are so so
pretty and this is how much part and
space you get and I really think you get
a nice amount of part in space and it's
more towards the middle they give you
more part in towards the middle or
morally towards the middle and then the
size is less lace they also give you
three combs in the front one in the
middle and two on the sides they don't
it doesn't come with a comb in the back
but I know some people don't like the
comb in the back anyway so and if you
feel like you need extra security and
the back you can always just pin it with
bobby pins and this way does come with
adjustable shrimp this way it also comes
with soft lace you also get to choose
what color you would like your lace to
be you can also choose the density you
can choose what length you want and I
feel like I'm missing something else but
I don't know everything will be my
description box so I have 18 inches if
you didn't want the way to be this long
you can get that you can pick something
shorter like 16 or 14 inches and I love
this we
because it doesn't look like shiny I
will say you could use a little dry
shampoo or a baby cotton if you wanted
to and it's more towards when you go
outside because when I went outside with
this week I was like it wasn't too bad
but I was like I definitely could use
some dry shampoo but other than that
this week is so pretty like it doesn't
come off like synthetic or plasticky or
nothing like it legit looks like some
human hair that's been dyed I switch so
the sides
I feel like this size is universal I
feel like it can fit any hair sighs
honestly because it has such a good
amount of stretch without it being like
too big or too tight it's like just in
the middle so I don't know yeah like
it's like I feel like I have a lot of
room in this week or so like I have
space in this week but the way to
stretch is set up like the stretch is
like it it's like stretchy so if you
like a jump to any head size I don't
know if I'm really playing that well but
yeah so basically I didn't do anything
to this week the only thing I did was
add my baby hairs to it because of
course my head is darker so I can't use
my own baby s and I wanted it to look
like more realistic and more natural so
I just took my eco styler gel and kind
of like just molded the videos around a
little bit the only thing I had to glue
down was my size and they're not even
how I wanted to be because my sideburns
kind of getting away of it but yet I
wanted I wanted my size to lay down
because I knew I was going to touch this
behind my ear so you can't really tell
that it's not like glued down officially
but I mean it looks like it so I ain't
even going trip but um
I don't know like this wig is doing
something to me okay you're like I feel
like a whole new person and this is
where it stops only so just in case any
of you guys a chariot to see how this
week looks part in the middle like it
does originally originally it is
supposed to void does come apart in the
middle so
[Laughter]
look at that color hey yo yo can y'all
tell that I really like this wig I mean
it's kind of different but I always feel
like you should step outside of the box
everyone to the blue moon even if the
loudness is to this video if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave it
