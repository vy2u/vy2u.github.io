review and this week was said to me by
this week was sent to me from elevate
Styles so I'll make sure I'll leave
elevate Styles website in my description
box as well as links to this hair so
this hair that I went is the sisters to
wait Steve app retweets part and I have
Anna styled diva H sista and I have it
in a color number two so this is what
the stop car looks like and I will say
that the way that the model is when her
wig is much thicker than mine is even
though this is a thick unit but I just
feel like hers is more fuller than what
mine is but if you do like thick hair
then you will like this wig because it's
really nice and yaki the layers are
really nice up in the front area you
guys know I can appreciate some good
layers towards the front I'm most of the
weights that I have just recently did
reviews on kind of all in the same style
but I would have to say that this one
has been the yuckiest I love was it the
Shannon wig in um follow me
so this is not really a long unit I
really love the length of this wig this
wig is around like 18 well it hits me at
about 18 inches long um I will say that
this part is a little on the thin side
but then this part part is really really
full so I'm not really a fan of that but
I am a fan of the layers and like the
thickness it just Falls
really really good I'm also a fan of the
part basically this is how the wave will
come you're not really going to have
to do anything you might want to take
your vent brush and just lightly brush
it but the curls fall exactly how
they're supposed to be this week is just
really really cute
I feel like this is a really natural wig
the part I'm loving the part I'm so in
love with the part now as far as like
the cap size is concerned this week fits
me perfect I do have my straps adjusted
um and this wig fits me really good I do
feel like this could be a big head
friendly as well um
so yeah I feel like this week will suit
any sides head but yeah this week is not
too tight but I like the fit of this
week I love the texture of this wig like
it's really thick but it doesn't really
look thick but when you feel it you can
tell like is really a coarse coarse
texture but this really looks like
somebody's hair I really like this I
definitely love the length because it's
not too long I'm definitely really a fan
of this head and I don't really like
overly thick wigs but this one is really
really nice now I will say that this wig
does get tingly a little bit towards the
end I guess because of how course it is
and it's just towards the ends um where
it gets the most tingly but I just run
my hands through it to like loosen up
the tangles or get the tangles out it's
not too bad and it does shed just a
little bit so I get a minimum shutting
and I also get minimum tangling now I
did try this week towards the middle
like at the middle part and it did not
work whatsoever because um the sides
were really uneven
one side was all the way down here and a
other side was up here so it is like
even as far as how you want the curls to
lay but it looks so crazy because the
hair is of course uneven it does not
come with any lace around the perimeter
it's just basically a lace part so yeah
it's no lace like around here it's just
the lace part so yeah if you don't like
hair in your face you definitely can
swoop it to the side like this and it
still looks really cute but I like it
more towards my face because you know
would give me like a grown and sexy type
of look so this is how how their minds
okay so that's pretty much it for this
video I am going to turn around so you
guys can see what this wig looks like in
a bag
you
and this week has layers like all
throughout the week which is really nice
I really like how is layered not just in
the front but all throughout the way so
yes that's it for this video if you have
any questions about this wave feel free
to leave it in my comment section down
below and yeah I'll make sure I leave
elevate Styles links to this wig in my
description box and stuff like that so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
