can't right now when time fly by right
now ten guys is K innovate with another
video and this video is going to be on
this hair and I will sent this hair from
Sam's Beauty so I'll go ahead and leave
Sam's Beauty links in the description
box just in case any of you guys want to
purchase this week
so the wig they sent me is from the new
born free collection and I have it in
the style MOU mio uo8 and I have it in a
color deep violet and this is what the
card looks like even though it doesn't
have like a picture or yeah a picture
one in the cart but I can be the picture
for y'all okay because this wig is lit
your I swear
so if you follow me at point a snapchat
or Instagram you've already seen this
wig and how old it is and how long it is
but yes I don't really think that it's
literally 40 inches but it's long y'all
it's real real long where it comes all
the way past my crotch okay um so let me
just get started on the construction of
this week before I start rambling off
and telling you how much I love it the
construction for this wig is your
typical construction it has two cones
and a fire a comb and a bag with
adjustable straps I do feel like this
week is big hit friendly for sure
because it's a little big on my head but
I made it work I just did my straps and
it's been pretty good I wouldn't say
it's fitting like tight and real secure
but it's fitting good um so yeah it's
also a laying flat as well so straight
out to pay
this way just lays really good it's not
your typical at least part week it's
called a u-shaped lace and it basically
looks like this like basically like a
lace front so you had the option where
you can part the way even on the right
side or the left side or the middle um
and they do give you a decent amount of
lace so that is what my part is looking
like I feel like I felt like it's blurry
if this video was blurry and some sorry
oh okay hopefully all the time I was
recording my video was not blurry um oh
yeah so like I was saying they do give
you a good amount of parting space and I
like my putts in the middle sorry I just
put it the hair in the middle and this
is what it's looking like I also went
ahead and pluck the parts you don't have
to pluck the part but I felt like you
really couldn't see the part that well
so I just went ahead and plucked out
some hairs it wasn't a lot um you don't
really have to pluck out a lot of heads
you don't really have to pluck out any
heads at all you don't once you of
course you can add your concealer or
finishing powder like I always tell you
guys but me personally I wanted to pluck
out my part so I did and I also added
some finishing powder to my part I also
had my baby has late I didn't cut any
baby heads in the week just because I
didn't want to so I'm working with my
own baby heads and this week also comes
with a soft lace and it was not hard to
pluck all the hairs because I know some
soft lace wigs is hard to pluck out the
part and this week is also a Yankee
texture and I
love the texture on here because it's
not like they didn't overdo it it's
definitely perfect it looks really real
the shine on this week is very very
minimum is not a lot of shine through
this week what also makes it a pair of
really natural so that's what I like
about it this really um I don't know
what they expect from this week when I
got it I don't know um this week does
shed I just got a big hunk of some hair
but it haven't been shedding all this
time this is the first time I shed on me
chum and it could have been from when I
cut the leaves but yeah so I did get
some shutting and I haven't received any
tangling yet and that's what I'm so
surprised about because I just knew that
this week was going to tangle like
straight out the box because it's so
long in a sense that I care but actually
this has not tangled on me yet of course
this hair will start to tangle but as of
right now this hair has not shingled on
me at all this is basically how the head
comes you guys the only thing I did to
this head to alter this wig was
straightened the bottom other's hair
because it kind of look sick as you know
how straighten that it can't be with
that little curve gonna end that's how
it was I didn't cut it it already came
with the legs which are really really
nice but you can see the lids are right
here which is really really pretty but I
didn't cut it so the only thing I did
was flip on it and I straightened the
ends and that was
I didn't Street straighten all of the
head because I still wanted to have that
Yankee texture I will say this color is
on point you guys if you decide to get
this week I highly suggest trying to end
this deep violet color and you're
definitely a color to wear for the fall
and it just I feel like it's gonna fit
so many skin tones if you're a light or
a brown or a darker skin it will fit you
I think this color is definitely
universal for the melanin girls so yeah
I definitely love this color it's
popping on his hair the density onus is
not too thick whatsoever and I think God
is not thick because I don't know I just
feel like if it was thicker it probably
would be more difficult to manage but
it's just like the perfect density for
stretch it really is and I'm just
surprised at this point this weed has
not tangled up on me yet and I have been
brushing it with my vent brush and like
you see how my fingers just go through
it with ease like I have not been
getting any tingling at all still really
no shedding but from when no I got one
string right here but yeah no major
crazy shedding and yeah I'm just like so
in love with this hair I definitely
cannot wait to step out in this weed
push you up because I'll be showing off
okay
so when you feel like this week it
started get all and frazzled gonna end
you can definitely take your straighten
up and just straighten the ends and I'm
telling you instantly it revives the
hair if you get tired of doing it though
you can always cut the hair shorter and
shorter but definitely putting a flat
from putting a straightener to it
definitely helps out the longevity for
these type of wigs this wig is insane it
definitely looks really very real and
this looks like some muddled hair for
sure I freaking love this week so I'm
going to turn around so you can see you
know the bag
so guys that's it for this video if you
have any questions feel free to leave it
