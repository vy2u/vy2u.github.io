back with another video and yes it's
blowing because I'm just not done with
my blonde hair yet y'all so I'm giving
you another blonde wig this was sent to
me from Sam's Beauty and it is the
sensational Empress lace part and wait I
have it in a style D and I have it in
the color 613 which this week is not new
to YouTube I've seen thousands of
reviews on his hair and I was like I
have to have it like the waves and this
like the curls and everything are so
bomb this week does come as a middle
part
it also comes without any legs to cut
off so it's just that at least part of
me which I do not like at all also it
has two combs and the front they do give
you a comb and a bag and adjustable
straps if you have a bigger sized head
you'll definitely love this week because
this is big hair friendly so if you have
a smaller size a week I mean if you have
a smaller sized head like me just adjust
your straps and you should be good to go
so let's just hop straight into this
week okay so I freaking love this wig I
love the style the only thing I don't
like is this color and I don't like the
fact that it doesn't have any leads to
cut off and it's just like that lace
pardon because you guys know like for me
when it doesn't come with any lace like
the part in space is a bulky and it just
doesn't lay right so yeah this is what
the part looks like the only thing I did
was I did go ahead and pluck the part a
little bit and I also added powder
finishing powder to the part and this is
what it looks like
I also edit baby hairs to this wig
because it needed it I did not
like the way this part looked in them
yeah I didn't like the way that this we
looked parted in the middle so I shift
it to the side and it looked much better
for me I feel like if this wig was in a
natural color I would love it so much
more but this week is very hard to work
with and I think it's because of the
color that I chose and I actually like
the color with this style but it's just
I don't know it's really really hard to
work with especially because I don't
like the construction of it so it
doesn't really come off looking as
natural as I wanted to but I tried to
work with like the front because that's
where my main issue came in it was like
trying to get the front to look more
natural because it is bulky up in the
hand line because it doesn't have least
to cut off in a headline if you do what
I'm saying so um yeah that was my main
concern was just the hairline how it
just doesn't look very natural
you could conceal that if you was to
wear the hair if you was the way the
part in the middle but bids though I
didn't like the part them into our head
I didn't have no choice but to wear it
on the side so yeah this is the end
results where I came up with and as you
can see this hair is really nice and
full another thing I had an issue with
was that the hair by the parting is a
little bit thin so it's hard to conceal
versus if you have a natural color it
probably would have been easier to
conceal because you can start to see
like the track showing a little bit if
you get up close to it you can
definitely see some of the track Shawn
so yeah keep that in mind if you decide
on getting this blonde color and you
pluck the part you will start to see
some of the tracks so yeah what else I
think that's pretty much it now
this wig is like a yekke texture it's
very full and it's a lot of hair as you
can see I definitely love the curl
pattern on this wig I love the fullness
it's not it's not this weight is not
shiny at all it is a very dull looking
weed now tangling and shuttin I have had
issues with the not the shedding but I
have had issues with the tangling and
this week it's very like tingly I want
to say tingly but it snakes a lot I just
got shadow sold this week does shed this
is my first strand a head that I've got
out of this week so far so yeah but as
far as like the tingling it does snag a
lot and it is pretty easy to detangle
but it's not like you can really bring
your fingers through this freely without
it getting snagged or anything see right
now so it definitely definitely gets
tingly a lot but as far as how it looks
it doesn't look like it's tingly but it
definitely gets
tingling this is giving me like
old-school Hollywood type of vibes which
I really really like I really love the
style I even love the color but just not
for this particular wig because the
construction is a little off for me I
think now they do have a wig that looks
exactly like this that comes with lace
that you can cut off so I might have to
try that out just to see how it looks
but I definitely love this 6:13 color so
that's it for this video you guys I hope
you enjoy and I'll see you in my next
show
