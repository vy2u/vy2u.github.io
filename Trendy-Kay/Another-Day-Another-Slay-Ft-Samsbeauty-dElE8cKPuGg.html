paid I'm a boss bitch snow I got to bail
hey hey they want to pro thing I don't
wanna do it
got the bell page my boss bitch snow I
got to bail hey hey guys okay of course
and I'm back with another video so this
video is going to be on this hair if I'm
wearing the same shirt it's because I'm
trying to get these videos off y'all but
yeah nevertheless this is the week that
I'm wearing and I was sent this week
from the same it's beauty so just in
case you're interested in this week I'll
go get it and leave all the links to
this week in my description box so the
week that I have one is the Y alright
alright know what week this is this is
not a new week but this is the yar alone
and this is what your stock car looks
like I have this in the color number one
so yeah definitely fill in the color
number one I said I was going to get
more into these colors and start like
when darker wigs on my channel so yeah
this is the color number one like I said
if you are not familiar with the yard
week they came out with just the
straight-up Yara wig and that's like the
shorter version of this week which I did
a video one I'll link that video down
below just in case any of you guys are
like new tweaks or new to the yard
epidemic so yeah basically I think y'all
was like the first blunt cut bub that
actually came out so basically this is
just a spin-off of the Yahweh and it
just made a longer version of that with
which actually I like this week better
than a shorter version I don't know
which one do you like the or like the
shorter version or do y'all like the
longer version I would really like to
know and leave it in the comment section
but yeah
me personally I love the longer one I
just think that it just goes better with
me
so yeah honestly I was trying to get
this way
and the purple color because I feel like
this wig would definitely be popping in
the purple color and it looks like this
oh hold on it looks like this is the
same color the model is wearing and I
think that's in a color titi and 99 J
purple but I might try to get my hands
on this color yah
it's always sold out it's basically
impossible for me to get this color so
one day y'all one day and before I start
talking your heads off let's just hop
straight into construction so again this
is your typical constructionist gives
you two cones in the front a comb and a
bank with adjustable straps this part is
a middle part and it also comes with
soft lace the laces and two Sophos like
in between high and soft so it's not
like that scratchy hard lace if you
don't if you don't like the hard lace so
yeah it also gives you a part in the
middle which I think I already said that
so yeah this is what the part looks like
and apart is really nice it's a really
long deep part
it also comes pretty naturally I feel
like you don't really have to pluck it
if you don't want to I did pluck the
hairs a little bit towards the beginning
and then I just added my finishing
powder into it also this week is a light
Yankee texture it is blunt on the
bottoms I didn't cut it like this this
is just how it comes it is a bit shiny
but not shiny to the point where it
looks fake I feel like if you wanted to
go in with your dry shampoo or baby
powder you could but me honestly I'm not
going to do any of that because I just
feel like it's running no need is
optional if you you know feel like the
shine is a little bit too much for you
but honestly it just looks it just looks
like a natural shine to me so yeah as
far as the thickness it's not too thick
but it's definitely not then at all it's
like in the middle it's a really good
natural density especially for the left
in this style I just think that the
density is really perfect also also this
week
with baby Hays yes another way to slang
in with the baby heads okay y'all not
love my baby is so I did kinda like
utilize the baby heads a little bit but
not that much cuz you know sometimes you
just don't want to overdo it but yeah it
actually comes with baby has light baby
is all through the perimeter that kind
of blends them with the rest of the hair
so you probably wouldn't know unless you
like really like pick through it to see
but yeah it definitely comes with baby
hair so I just laid some baby hairs
right there a little bit
I'm you really didn't have to if you
don't want to because the wig just lays
nice and looks nice
the headline definitely looks natural
the part looks natural everything about
this week just lays and looks so freakin
natural you guys and yeah this is what
it looks like it's not really much to
say this is definitely a everyday type
of weight it's so freakin cute you guys
oh yeah if anybody knows where I can get
this week from in purple please let my
sister know because I really would love
this rig this week and a purple color I
think that it would be a pop in but yeah
this is what the wig looks like this is
what it looks like in a bag and as you
can see it's nice and just bouncy and
flowy I haven't received any shadow from
this week but I did get like a loose
weft that I had to cut and the weft was
probably like that big it doesn't make
me love this weight any less but just
letting you guys know that yeah it was a
track that was loose and I had to like
cut it off because of course I mean if
you wanted to you could like sew it back
on it but I wasn't trying to do all of
that I mean but as far as that little
weft been loose other than that like
this wig is a bomb I haven't
any issues with it I haven't had any
tangle in I still haven't had any
shutting yet I'm pretty short as this
week gets older you will have tingling
and shut-in but from right now and it's
fresh state I don't want I don't want to
have any tingling I'll shut it
so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you have any questions feel
free to leave it in the comment section
down below I love you guys I will see
you in my next video yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
