review and this week is what do you guys
fans vide so I will leave sanity links
in the description box so yeah it is the
sensational impress this week and the
signing is Nova and I have it in a color
burgundy so this is what the card looks
like and I do also have this in a color
too so out instead of clips of what a
natural color looks like and though I
absolutely love this color first off
there is no dog fur so if you are a
person that likes doubler but you do
like this color as well you can take a
mascara or a sharpie marker or like some
hairspray like some color hairspray and
you can color the roots to make it
darker because the part is on point you
guys I did go in and pluck my part I
didn't add any powder or concealer to my
part I do have a brown stocking cap on
underneath so this is what the card
looks like
and this wig does come with soft lace so
be careful when you pluck your part this
way comes with two combs in front a comb
in the back which adjustable straps now
the combs are not placed at detention
area they are place at the parting space
so it's one comb right here and a comb
right here and of course I don't use my
comb except for the one in the back and
I have my adjustable straps adjust it
and this way it still fits a little on
the bigger side so the texture of this
week is a light yaki texture it is
pretty lightweight and just like very
Airy so even though this is a thicker
unit is very lightweight and I feel like
you won't be like sweating
uncontrollably or nothing like that
now so far I have not experienced any
shedding or tingling from this week even
when I plucked apart and cut the lace
from the headline it still has not shed
so that's a good thing I'm always
impressed by the shorter units as well
we could have seen LED so much longer
you know I have to point out that the
curls in the front of this wig are
definitely different from the curls in
the back and if that is more of a like
wavy type of body wave type of curl and
then in the front you have more of like
the feather drop curl type of look which
um it doesn't really bother me that well
but I do I mean it doesn't really bother
me that much but I do wish the curls
were the same as the front all the way
around but it's not bad now I feel like
if you're not a person that doesn't like
fooling with your wigs as far as like
styling them and you like your weight to
come already style and you don't have to
put in that much work to you week then I
wouldn't suggest you get in this week
because I feel like when you first get
it out to package you're definitely
going to have to put in that work to
make the wig look like something because
because of the curls not being the same
as the front it's like you really have
to tame the back to make it just all
flow together so I did go in with my
vent brush and I just brushed out the
curls and just made the curls fall how I
wanted it to and that's basically all I
did was this week to achieve this look
and I think that it came out really good
like I said I'm warning you you guys is
definitely going to have to work with
this week just to make the curls laid
like you want them this is definitely a
week that you can either dress up or
down I feel like you can go work in this
week you can go to church in this week
and I feel like if you are going out
somewhere or like partying or anything
like that you definitely can wear
at night and I feel like it is still be
lit so yes this is just all-around
really really nice week that's when I
was plucking the part it seems like it's
not it wasn't a lot of hair to cover up
one of the tracks so yeah it's not
really noticeable but if you get like
really really close like I'm saying you
have to be really close to my head you
can definitely see a track line if you
do decide to get this color you might
not even have this problem and as far as
the darker color wig I didn't have that
issue you can't see like the track
pieces or anything was that weak so
maybe it's just my wig I don't know but
beware of that but besides that problem
I am like totally totally in love with
this wig it's just okay so this giveaway
I am going to be giving three lucky
