hopeful and the change to changing my
hey guys I'm back with another video and
this video comment and this week
Westen's me from elevate south so I'll
go ahead and leave out of a sow's links
in the description box just in case any
of you guys are interested in this week
that I'm wearing or any week sitting up
on their site in general so yeah go
ahead and check that description bar is
this is so cute you guys okay so let me
tell you what this is so this is the
brown sugar human hand makes sounds
which of course y'all guys know that
that's not really human hair it just had
a human hair mixed so I guess it makes
the hair more human hair like so the
style is okay so the style is vs 1 to 4
and I have it in the color blue rain and
basically it's like a 1 be like in a
room area like on the sides in the back
and then at the top ends like it's still
duffer and then it ends it kind of has
like this blue point one but the blue is
sticky oh I didn't think I was going to
like the color but now that I'm looking
at it the color is really really nice so
thumbs up for the color because the
color is definitely on point and pretty
much this is how the way came when I
first received it out of the tech now
I'm going to insert a clip just so you
guys can see how it look when I got it
straight out the text I did cut this
unit down a little bit in the front
because I don't really like the front
pieces really long and hanging in my
face like that so of course I went in
and out so of course I went in and I cut
just the side a little bit in a little
bit in the front it didn't really I may
have made a huge difference for me as
far as I can see but it was like it
really changing a whole style of this
wig I don't think it did it but it still
pretty much looks the same so I'm going
to go ahead and sir
a clip so y'all can just get an idea of
what it look like but this is pretty
much it I did not do anything see this
week and as far as like styling what do
you think so yeah
so everything you need to know basically
does it share entangle no I have not
received any shedding or thing lament
from this way nobody should wait really
good when it comes to shed and tingling
you really don't get that out of showed
awakes now say I'm not going to say all
short we don't tango and shed like some
shall we do but this one is not tingling
and shadows at all now as far as the
construction this is the case release
for sure I have a smaller hands but I
had to adjust my I had to adjust my
stress and when I just might stretch it
kind of left like this big even though
my head's really not flat so that could
be it too but I would say this is big
head friendly for sure because I have a
lot of extra room now being a was
spitting up into this cat
it was definitely laying more flat and
straight but bends on my head is kind of
flat in the back you can't even really
tell it's kind of giving me a kid in the
van this thing is definitely became
friendly if you have a smaller size can
like me and you like this week I still
think that you can get away with it but
just keep in mind it is a it's a extra
room in the back but other than that
like once I adjusted my shrimp I don't
feel like this week it's going to fall
off my head or anything like that I
definitely feel like it's really secure
once I adjusted the stress it just has
like a lot of per minute and if you want
your weight to look flat in as well as
possible you don't want no extra room in
it do them same thing it so of course my
head is not laying flat in the back but
your kids the point this is just so you
okay like see what it looks like on but
this is really a great system
so that's it for this video guys if you
have any questions feel free to leave it

love you guys if you're not subscribed
