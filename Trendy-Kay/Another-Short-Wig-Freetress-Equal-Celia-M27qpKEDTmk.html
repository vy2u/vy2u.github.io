guys so I'm back with another wave
review and I do apologize in advance if
this video is a bit dark um yeah so yeah
we just wanna I'm trying to film and
like the Sun is going down and starting
to get duck you know time that sat back
so you know all kinds of complications
going on but yes I'm backyard with
another short hair review so yeah let's
just get started because I want this to
be pretty quick I have so many wigs to
share with you guys but to start off um
I'm going to be sharing this week with
you guys so yeah I hope that my camera
does me some justice because it is a
little bit dull but we just want roll
with it
let me see it back uh put some lighting
so yeah I'm not really sure of that help
at all but we're just gonna roll with it
so this wig is brought to you by since
the wig sister wigs was kind enough to
send me this week and this is the free
trusty quo extreme side part wig and I
have her in saleya saliyah cilia I have
no idea how to pronounce this name I
don't know but um this is what Kalia is
a clear I don't know y'all so yeah this
is what the picture looks like which
when I say it like the picture does give
this week justice I mean overall this I
mean the picture on it
make me personally want to buy it but
then I don't really know so yeah I
thought that this wig was bummed when I
looked at it and then they do come in
many varieties of colors so that's what
got me as well so yeah you know free x
equal came out with that line of colors
with the like the Pink's the Blues all
of that stuff so yeah I decided to get
this in a color ot rose pink I did
reveal weight from this line and it was
in like a pink gold color so I wanted to
try out this pink color only because it
is a little toned as heads like some
Browns going through it and things like
that
so I thought it would kind of be like
fallish but still if you wanted to weigh
some color it's just like subtle so yeah
this is what the wig looks like and yes
so if you're interested in this week I
will leave assistant wigs late mmm I
will leave sista weights links in my
description box and a direct link where
you can purchase this week so okay guys
so this is considered to be like a full
cap wig so it it does has like a lace
part but the way the lace part is set up
is it's like one of those lace parts
ways just like a scalp is not like
really like any lace that you have to
cut off or anything like that it's just
pretty much like a skin top type scalp
so yeah this wig also does not come with
any combs it only comes with adjustable
straps so if you are a person that likes
combs and your wigs and you don't feel
like you know strips are going to secure
your wig properly this might not be the
week for you but as far as like how the
wig is style like the layers and
everything this wig is bomb I'm really
really feeling this way the only problem
with this wig would be the parts so I
had to do a lot of I had to put it a lot
of work when it came to the part because
once you when you get it it looks fake
so I think I still have the
of me like showing you guys what I did
to the part to make it look more natural
and how it came or whatever I'm not sure
if I still have the clip but if I do
have the clip I will make sure I insert
it into in somewhere so you guys can see
I know many people are going to stay
away from this week because of the
simple fact of the parts which I mean
it's understandable because it's
annoying when you have to try to like
fix the part just the part just makes
the way it looks look like the part just
make the wig look really fake so yeah
this is the outcome of my part and this
is what my part is looking like
like I said if you don't want to put in
the work put in the work and to make the
pot look more real then you probably
just want to pass on this wig all
together because you do really have to
put in work in order to get the part to
look good and realistic so yeah I just
left out some of my edges a little bit
just right here to make it more
believable and I'm going to turn around
and show you guys what the back looks
like
I just cut that fabric that was
underneath of the wig so that the lace
could show because it's pretty bulky
like up in the top it doesn't lay flat
so you would have to cut like that
fabric to make it look more realistic
this wig does shed a little bit this wig
is also big hit it friendly of course
this way doesn't tangle but it does shed
a little bit it's OK for me it doesn't
make me like the wig less so it's okay
but it does shed a little bit to be like
a shorter wig and no tangle in yes this
week is became friendly um if you have a
smaller size here I feel like you can
still get away with it so if you have
any questions feel free to leave it in
the comment section down below and yes
I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
