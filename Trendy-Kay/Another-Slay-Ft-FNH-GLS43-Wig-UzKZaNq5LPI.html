okay of course in our back with a
another video so this video is going to
be on this hair and this head was sent
to me from a Friday night hair so if
you're interested I'll go ahead and
leave all the links in my description
box the week I'm wearing is in the style
GLS 43 and I have it in the color 1 beam
now I'm if you're not familiar with
Friday night hair it does come with tape
just in case you want to tape it down I
wouldn't suggest taping it down because
the lace is already hard and it's really
no need for the tape the lace is secure
and everything so you don't have to
worry about that so as far as the
construction it is a synthetic lace
front they give you about two inches
worth of lace paste it also comes with
two combs and a front I'll comb in the
back and adjustable straps now as far as
it being big hair friendly I do feel
like it it is it can be big hair front
II just don't adjust your strips if you
have a smaller sized head like me then
just go ahead and adjust your strips and
you'll be good this is so freakin cute
you guys it's kind of like a pin curl in
a way I'm going to insert what the way
it look like originally which it looked
like like pink curls like if you was to
take pink hair your hair and take it out
that's what it looks like to me
you
all I did to this wig was brushing out
with my vent brush and these are how the
curls turned out which these curls are
so freakin gorgeous do you see this now
y'all know I'm all for the baby hairs
and you know I like to you know sleep my
little edges asleep my little baby hands
but this time I just didn't feel like it
but actually I think that this week can
work without any baby hairs or anything
like that I know everybody is not fun
the baby hairs so yeah but it can work
as you can see I feel like it still
looks pretty natural without anything
this is what the hairline looks like
which the hairline is okay if you wanted
to go in and pluck your hairline you
could do that so yeah I just flipped the
head over because I just felt like it
would look better with these curls now
with tangling and shedding I did not get
any shedding yet from this week but I
did get tingling you know it's not too
tangly but it definitely taken tangles
more towards the end which still that's
like it doesn't bother me because I know
how these synthetic wigs can get also
this week is a silky texture and it does
have a bit of a shine to it now before I
branched out the curls it was really
shiny I mean kind of dulled itself down
after I brushed out the curls so this is
basically what it's looking like it
doesn't look too bad but that's it's
it's Hsieh preference if you want to add
some dry shampoo or baby powder just to
dull the wig down
you could this video is going to be a
really quick you guys I'm just here to
share these wigs with you guys so just
in case y'all looking for some wigs um
definitely check out this way this is
definitely a nice everyday and type of
weight especially for work but then I
feel like you could dress this up or you
can dress it down it
doesn't matter so yeah this is what the
wig looks like if you have any questions
go ahead and leave it in my comment
section down below I hope I'm not
missing anything but yeah this is
basically the wig I freaking love it
it's so like classy definitely looks
nice with this red lip so yeah that's it
for this video I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
