like two weeks and one day so I'm going
to roll once again anyway this is the
Friday night hair GLS GLS 35 in a color
1b and you guys know what the little
card looks like that it comes with I
don't know if any of you saw my last
Friday night hair review um hair review
yeah hair review but basically I had
picked the wrong way so this is the way
that I originally want it but I got
something different so I went ahead and
got this one because I really really
wanted this unit so this is what the
unit looks like and this lighter is
going to kill me so this is what the
unit looks like and you guys like look
at this this is a lot of hair and it's
so long it's like it has to be 28 inches
long
um this is a very very very thick unit
and um it has two columns in the front a
comb in the back with adjustable strap
and this is the parting space they give
you the same amount of parts based on
basically all their wigs so yeah that's
what the Parden looks like
my light so this was basically just a
really quick um review on this unit that
I'm wearing which I'm like absolutely in
love with this unit so if anybody is
looking for um a wig from Friday night
hair and you really are not sure what
you want to get or just like a curly wig
in general this is a really nice full
curly long wig if some of you are not
like really a fan of the long hair you
definitely can cut this shorter and it
still will look really pretty
um but I mean I like wigs short or long
it really doesn't matter to me so I
think eventually I will end up cutting
this week but I definitely um don't have
a problem when the unit the way that it
is but I just wanted this to be like a
really quick video just to you know show
you guys this unit because I think a lot
of you will enjoy um this week okay the
only thing that I will say about this
wig is is super long um and it gets kind
of thin like these curls seem really
tight up here and I guess because from
the we've been super long like the curls
kinda a more lucid towards the back area
so yeah I was thinking about like
cutting it to maybe like off right here
because it would still be really long
but I just didn't like cuz let me see
all of the head to the front yeah I
don't know I'm still thinking anyway um
this uh this is how the curls come
originally so yes I just left them alone
most of my curly
units I don't really mess with the curls
because I think once you start brushing
out curls and stuff like that if it
really doesn't need to be brushed out um
it makes the wig it doesn't really make
the weight less long so yeah I pretty
much try to UM leave the curls how they
are if I like the unit and I don't feel
the need to brush the curls out so yeah
this is how um the wig originally comes
so as far as like tingling or shedding I
have not received any um I have not
received any um shedding but that's only
because I don't really run my fingers
through it because I don't feel like
it's necessary so I'm pretty sure if I
tried somewhere my fingers through this
it will tangle a lot but I feel like
curly units you really don't have to do
much to it at all and as far as like the
shedding is concerned like it does shed
a little bit not that much like just now
I got I don't know if you can see that
you probably can't because this light is
like but um yes so I got a
little bit of tangling out of this and
this is like my second time when this
unit so yeah I'm like really in love
with this big curly that you guys so
real quick also if you're not really a
middle person you can definitely throw
this head to the side and wear it on the
side and it looks really gorgeous
either way so just keep that in mind
I hope you guys enjoy this quick
await review um so yeah if you have any
questions about this unit feel free to
leave it in a comment section down below
and I will get back to you um I'll be
sure to leave everything in the
description box so I will see you next
time you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
