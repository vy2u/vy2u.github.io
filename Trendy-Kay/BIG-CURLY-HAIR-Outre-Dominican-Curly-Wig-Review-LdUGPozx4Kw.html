this is some big hair like this is a lot
of head like it's pretty much
overwhelming that's how much head is
like just look like what so if you like
big hair this is the video for you have
a wig so this is our trade quick weave
batik mondo hair and this is the style
Dominican curly in the color 430 so this
is what the picture looks like I believe
that this wig also comes as a full wig I
think it's like a lace part wig don't
quote me on it I'm not sure but I do
think it does come as a full unit so if
you're not like really a fan of the half
wigs and leaving your hair even though I
don't leave my hair when I wear this
unit um cuz it's so full that you can't
even see the front and I just brush the
top or just you know make the top coming
here and then leave my baby hair out and
then I'm good to go
so yes y'all let me tell you about this
week though so yeah I don't really have
much to say about this wig but a lot of
people were asking me what week this was
when I posted a picture on my Instagram
so yes that is this way it is the outre
dominican curly wig half way so yeah
don't really have any complaints on this
way this way this hella cheap you should
go get it especially especially if you
like big curly hair and the colors on
point I will try to find a site that
carries this week because I wanted to
order me another one and the bitches is
sold out so yeah I'm going to try to
link um a website where you can go to
order this wig um yeah I even tried to
get this wig from my local beauty supply
store and know
he carries this unit so yeah sorry if I
sound crazy but my nose is a little
stuffed up but yeah it's like the
dumpers is not all the way around it's
only in the front area but like what
this head is like super cute um this is
me like this is the wig not even plucked
out like it was that big that I didn't
have to pluck it out or anything like
that like all that it was put it on my
head and cut the front a little bit
because the front was longer you could
do so many styles waiting for this hair
I just like it when the side better but
you can do like um a half up half down
and it would still look so pretty but
like this really looks like some real
hair the this week is not shiny at all
um it does come with as far as if you're
not familiar with half wigs half wig is
basically like a wig that you put on
halfway we're not even halfway I mean it
depends but most people like leave their
hair out in the front to make it blend
in with the unit um so yeah and they
give you like a big comb in the front
and a big comb towards the back with
adjustable straps so yeah this way
doesn't really shed I haven't got any
shedding out of this wig and as far as
tingling I'm sure this wig tangles but I
don't know because I haven't did
anything to it but put it on my head but
I haven't plucked out any of these curls
or anything like that
and again this is one of those wigs
where the more you add the more it just
looks even better
so if you like don't like just come like
this hair is big so I wouldn't suggest
you getting this if you're not ready
because you gotta be ready for this like
this is like some nice hair but yeah
that is um my little video on this hair
just in case anybody was interested in
knowing what hey this was so yeah I will
leave the links and everything in my
description box and yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
