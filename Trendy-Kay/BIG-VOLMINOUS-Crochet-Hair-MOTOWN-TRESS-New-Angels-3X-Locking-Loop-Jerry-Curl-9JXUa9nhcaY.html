get by my team I'm fine
shut it really Wow hi looking like it's
broke okay guys so I'm just going to
start now by saying yes this is a lot of
hair so if you don't like the care this
is not the video for you because as you
can see honey this is a lot of hair but
okay so real quick you guys my hair is
definitely in my eyes like for real and
it's really bothering me so if it's
bothering you I'm so sorry but I was not
about to record this video over
basically this is crochet hair and I
will send this crochet hair from Motown
trust and basically they sent me that
it's called the angels multi peg 3x
block and loop jheri curl and it's in a
color 9 IJ and I'm just going to show
you what package you look like so this
is what it came in and basically they
give you three bundles and in each
bundle it comes with 20 loops so and
totally give you 16 I'm in 1660 um loop
hair so if that sound right but
basically yeah so anyway they sent me
three pics of those and what I did was I
made a wig out of it I guess you can
call it like a crochet way cuz I just
crocheted the hair into a wig and as
well if you're a person like me who just
likes to take their wigs on and off or
don't like winter
have for long periods of time or don't
want to sleep in it because I don't like
to sleep in weights at all or anything
like that like you just want something
temporary this will be perfect for you
so basically the wig cap it's a wig cap
and it has braided core roads all the
way through so basically you would just
be looping or crocheting on the hair and
that's basically what I did and it's so
easy I didn't show you guys the process
of me going it's because this was my
first time and also it's lots like
thousands of videos on how to crochet
hair so if you're not familiar with
crochet hair or you don't know how to
approach your hair um just type it in a
search engine and I'm pretty sure you'll
find thousands of reviews or tutorials
on how to crochet and sent me the lemp's
18 and all three pegs now this does come
in 18 inches and it also comes in 12
inches I wish I would've I wish I would
have got the 12 inches because I cut a
lot of hair off it was just too much
still now I still think that this is too
much hair for my face frame I just feel
like it's really swallowing me um but I
like it so it's kind of like that
love-hate relationship I have going off
this week because I do really like the
big hair but I don't really know if it
fits me that well like the color fits me
at least in my opinion I think that the
color fits me but I just think then this
is just way too much hair for my face so
I don't know tell me God tell me what
you guys think because I would really
like to know um is it too much or or do
you guys like it I mean you can be
honest you never wanted my feelings
nothing like that
but um I really like to know I think
that the more I wear this the more that
it grows on me because at first I was
like oh my god
like what am I going to do with all this
hair it just does not look good at all
so I started doing my makeup and once
like I did my makeup and put it on like
everything started to come together so
yeah but I took a lot of hair off I cut
a lot of hair off so if you do plan on
making like a crochet wig and you want
it to look like this I will suggest you
buy the twelve inches instead of
eighteen because you're going to cut
most of it off anyway so another thing
is when I first receive this hair it
kind of was crunchy in a sense like it
looked very shiny and kind of like
crunchy like if you ever said I don't
know I can't explain it but if I had
pictures of course I'm going to insert
what it looked like but yeah it didn't
look natural looking and looked fake and
artificial like it didn't look like
natural hair like right now this looks
like some big curly just beautiful
natural type of hair so in order to
achieve this look basically what I did
was I separated all the pieces when I
say I went one by one and separated all
the pieces I'm pretty sure I missed a
few pieces but for the most part I went
and I just separated all the strands and
it took like that shiny look away and it
looks much better and more natural so if
you do plan on making this wig and you
want it to look like this make sure you
pluck out the hair because you're not
going to get the results that you want
um it looks much better plucked out so
just keep that in mind because you don't
want to be walking around looking like a
little crunch bowl okay so this hair
also comes in multiple textures like it
comes for it goes from like a loose curl
all the way to the kite it goes from a
loose curl all the way to a tight curl
so basically is body wave
and curl corkscrew deep wave jheri curl
and water wave and yeah now they only
come in 12 and 18 inches nothing like in
between that is just 12 or 18
it was definitely pretty easy to make I
thought it was going to be much hard and
tedious than what it was and actually it
was it without really really fast so I
definitely love the process as far as
like making this wig because it was just
super fast yo I didn't change my shirt
and everything if you follow me on
Instagram or snapchat some of you may
already see me in this some of you
probably already seen me in a shirt girl
when I say this is like my favorite
shirt I cannot get enough of it but yeah
I got this from 521 it didn't come with
the rip so nothing I was trying to be
you know fancy or whatever so I put like
my own rips in it but yes honey like I
live in this freaking shirt and I just
thought that it completed the look a
little bit I don't know what kind of
look I was going for but I feel like it
all just like came together for her oh
yes yeah overall I really really like
this still getting used to the bigness
and fullness of this hair but it's
definitely definitely really really nice
and I'm so proud of myself so yeah if
you guys have any questions leave it in
my comment section down below I'll make
sure I leave
motele tress links and everything in my
