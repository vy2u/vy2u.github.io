wig was sent to me by sister wigs
I meant from sister weeks so yeah this
is the lace fronts which first of all
this is um from body book and it's a
lease for I Swiss lace it is in the
style ml f 127 Quinn and I have it in a
color 430 so this is what the card looks
like and I'm an iron I wouldn't even say
that I have been eyeing this week but
I've seen this wig on different websites
and the way the front look and they got
that I was like no but when I looked at
the picture when I looked at the wig one
the mannequins head it looked different
from how the model is when it so I just
went off of how the weight looks on a
mannequin usually I go off or how to
weight looks on a mannequin because nine
times out of ten that's how you will get
the wig cut just look like the mannequin
which wasn't too bad I felt like I was
still wanting to work with it which you
got to work with this week so if you're
not like willing willing to work with
this way then don't even get it just
like keep it moving they do give you a
good amount of lace part in space and
the part looks really good I will say
that the part did not look like this
when I got it it was like really jacked
up and really tight so you will have to
pluck this um you will have to pluck the
part another thing that I don't like
about this wig is the fact that it comes
as soft like that Swiss lace so if
you're not a fan of the soft lace then
you probably want to pass on this week
especially when it comes to pluck in the
part you have to be very careful with
plucking apartment you have the soft
lace because it can rip very easily and
that's what happened to me I got like a
couple
was up in this part are you but you
can't really tell you yeah you can't
really tell but it is a few small holes
in the unit this week there's not really
tango a man shared that much but it does
tango or awful a lot and I comb the
curls out everything like that the end
start to tangle I wouldn't say take a
really bad but it tangles
um but yeah as far as like how the way
it came it came how the start cart came
as far as like what the curls look like
that's how he was on the bottom so
that's how it look and I just brushed it
out with my vipra I didn't have to go in
with my sharpie marker and darken the
roots because they had the blonde going
all the way up and I just was like not
feeling it
what a card they do this head I mean
they do have the model Wayne this week
as the middle part I do not advise you
to wear this week as a middle cut when I
say it looks crazy I mean if you can fix
it then that's fine but it look crazy
and y'all know I like my middle parts
but it looks so bulky up in here and
then it was just like all this bigness
right here and then when it ends is just
look really thin so the best way to wear
this wig is on the side which I like it
I like it a lot better now when I first
tried this on and my sister was around
she was like girl you look like you
straight from the 70s because some kind
of way it just like was falling in my
face I can't explain it just look a hot
mess but I mean like I said again if
you're willing to put in the work this
week will turn out really a bomb in a
glamorous I do like how this wig looks
now um so yeah as far as like um the
shine on this way it is it has like a
natural shine I don't think that you
need to do anything to get rid of the
shine um it's not one it's kind of on
the silky side
but it's not like really Sookie I feel
like a heads like some yak eNOS - yeah
and as far as my part I did it pile up
at ya
I added powder to my part but not powder
but like I hope y'all don't think I'm
talking about like baby powder or
anything like that but like um makeup
like I edit some loose powder I forget
what it is i'ma show this is the powder
that I'm talking about and it's the
Studio Fix I have an intense e45
and yeah I just add I add this into my
part so it works out fine with me I'm
not really a fan of adding anything into
my part but lately I've been doing that
um but yeah sometimes it just depends on
how the part looks so yeah this actually
is like my second time doing this video
over only because the first time it
looks so jacked up you know I was like I
cannot like I'm really gonna have to
move it to the side and see and then my
lipstick with this color it just I don't
know it was a little off and I wasn't
feeling it so yeah y'all know how I felt
about recording two videos on the same
way I just be over if a room for you
you guys have any questions as far as
this unit is concerned you can leave it
in my comments section down below and
I'll try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
