guys so I'm back with a nother weight
review and this wave listen to me from
omg hair so I will make sure to leave
their links and everything in the
description box so they sent me the
Brazilian version natural curly hair
full lace wig dark black color um and
then it says VFW 12 and the hair length
is 24 inches the hair color is a natural
hair color the hair density is 130
percent they kept construction is they
kept to glue this Feliz we kept the
capsizes average and the lace color is
light brown so yeah okay I'm going to
insert a clip and show you what the wig
looks like um with the way it look like
originally when I got it out the package
and everything like that
you
if I received the other day was wash it
um
because normally I mean not all the time
will I wash my wigs when I get them
because sometimes I like how the curls
are and I want them to stay
so I just wait like that and then
sometimes I just watch your girls look
exactly the same
I didn't really watch it I just go wash
it today of course I use my Aussie
condition is called
Aussie moist so yeah I just um used that
to wash it I didn't add any products or
anything to the hair I didn't even leave
the conditioner in the hair i rinsed out
and this is what it looks like and I
just let it end your lace goes all the
way around you like that about this way
I also cut the comb from on top because
they didn't have a comb like right here
I don't know I just annoys me and if you
was like to push your hand in middle you
can definitely see the comb through the
lace so I don't really like that this
week also came with baby heads and I did
keep the baby heads on there but the
baby has was extremely long so I did cut
them down well just on this side because
this is where I was wearing a baby hair
but all right here like the baby hair
are still extra long it kind of reminds
me of like a bang like not even baby
hairs but it's just like a bang so yeah
um basically I don't have any of my hair
left oh I did not bleach these nights I
do have a I'm like new stocking cap
under here um and I didn't add any like
concealer or anything to my part it's
just like mad murky look I'm the only
thing I did was use some of the baby
hairs on the side and just um edit a
little bit of water and some eco styler
gel so I shut in entangling I have not
received any tangling from this we now
shut in I did receive a little when I
say little like a little
amount of shedding when I was co washing
her hair and it was probably like five
strands of hair and to me that's really
nothing um after I washed the head like
I have not received any shedding at all
I also loved the density of this week
because it's not like overwhelming with
not a lot of hair but it's also not
really thin and see-through so I really
like that about this hair I feel like
it's like the right density um this is
what it looks like in the back
so the only thing that I have a problem
with is that the cap is a little too big
okay yeah so that's it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
