this video hope you'll do you notice
anything different leave it in the
comment section down below I think
everybody is already going through this
one out but yes I'm just gonna leave it
a video because I'm little King Kong
wait hey guys come back with a another
video and this video is going to be on
this gorgeous hair so if you follow me
on snapchat negan's you guys already
have seen this hair so yeah but this is
what the hair looks like in action
because a so this Harrison to me from
beauty forever which is a vendor from
Aliexpress so if you're not familiar
with this company you definitely need to
go check them out because they're well
from my experience like the curly hair
is the issue guys so yeah I will leave
all the links in the description box
just in case you guys want to check out
this company because I know for all my
people who order hair bundles of the
early Express that sometimes the hair is
not the quality sometimes you don't get
your hand the vintage is B BS altogether
the hair that I'm wearing is in
Malaysian curly hair and I had in four
bundles and a closure
Alysse closure so yeah and I'll just
insert what everything looks like and
the inches I have is a 20 inch lace
closure and I have 26 inches in all four
bundles and this is where the hair stops
on me which I can appreciate so yeah of
course if you straighten its hair it
will be of course longer so basically so
far from the company like the
my service is a 1-1 point it was like
the Tank Engine and the shipping is a
one I got my I mean I received my
package within two days y'all know lot
and I think I got it via FedEx I'm the
packaging was nice and I'll make sure I
insert clicks of what the hair looks
like when I received it out of the
package and I first received his hair
out of the package the West was nicely
made I did not receive any shedding um
when I ran my fingers through the
bundles also there was not a smell and I
know when you order the hair from
Aliexpress sometimes the head comes with
a smell it has to wash or sometimes even
if you wash it like the smell won't even
come out so it was no smell and I'm real
big with mouth I don't want my hair to
be sinking so I did go here and just
make a wig and if you don't know how to
make a wig its thousands of reviews here
on YouTube to teach you how to make a
wig so you might want to check some of
those out because this video is not
going to be like a tutorial or anything
or me making this week it's just
basically giving you my opinion or my
first impressions on what I think about
this hair so far so yeah basically what
I did is I made a ways out of it now I
did go ahead and bleach my knots and I
think that it turns out really good as
you can see the part is really really
really realistic so yeah and I'm not
really a pro at bleach in Korea or
bleaching nuts I feel like every time I
bleach the nice it just never turns out
the way that I wanted to but actually
they're not on enclosure bleach really
well so excess bleach my closure I went
on ahead and started to make my wig now
as far as like the cats that I use to
create this wig I use like a stretch
mesh cap I already know exactly what
it's called and I don't even hit a
packaging but it just looks like a dome
cap except that it's net and it's like
stretchy will mesh and it's stretchy so
that is the case
that I use is this is actually my first
time all my second time using this type
of cat but I feel like when I use this
versus the regular don't care my wink
come out smaller than what I would like
it to so I don't know maybe next time
I'll just stick to what I know but
actually if it's real if it's really
really really really good like if I
would have messed up or anything this
way probably would not suit my head so
when I first started to sold the trick
onto my mesh cap I just doubled the wet
underneath like so in the back and then
when I got closer to the closure is when
I started to sew on the West like single
instead of like doubling them up so that
I sold all the Hat ones to the cats I
went ahead and watch the hair and I let
it air dry for about two hours outside
and it's right really fast when I like
let it sit in the Sun so yeah I wasn't
about that waiting like a whole day to
come I headed driver yet and it dried
within like two hours and I didn't
really watch it like with shampoo and
conditioner I just kind of like go wash
it I just use conditioner and the
conditioner I use was the or the moist
conditioner which that's my favorite
conditioner I used it on all my head
even my own hair
so yeah this is basically what the week
turned out looking like the curls are
soft they're not too tight but they're
not too loose and that's what I really
like about this hair is it so airy and
the curls are not tight like I don't
want the jheri curl
type of curl as you do anything but I
don't want like no loose curl way it
looks like a wave but this legit is like
really nice curls like they're really
really pretty
so yeah this way it just looks really
freaking and natural so yes this is my
initial thoughts on his hair and so far
I am really loving it
you guys so if you're looking for some
affordable curly hair just affordable
hair in general I'm Google here and
