this video is going to be a little
different because it's not a wig review
anything like that as you can see by the
title so yeah basically i received a
beautycon box is basically like a
subscription box yeah i think it's
pretty neat and you know i just wanted
to share it with you guys so yeah if
you're wondering what's on my head i do
have the in a wig on and this is anna dr
30 so yeah but let's get started with
this box this box is is it is a
subscription box and yeah they just give
you like a whole bunch of neat stuff
which i will show you in the video and
basically all of these products that
they send you in this box is worth over
a hundred dollars of products um so yeah
what else so yeah just basically say
seasonal and trendy accessories some of
our favorite makeup brands and a special
golden ticket basically the golden
ticket it is for every season and
basically they put a golden ticket in
your box so if you receive a golden
ticket you could get like gift cards and
stuff like that what else can you get
the gift cards range anywhere between
fifty and five thousand dollars so yeah
so I thought it was really neat and I
always wanted like a little subscription
box thing but I wasn't too sure you know
what to get so I thought this would be
neat so hey so like I said this is what
the box look like and when you open it
and says oh hey BFF love your gift ?
show us post intake and they do have
like this like
which I thought it's really cute I know
my camera probably is not picking up the
metallic feel of this wrapping paper but
I thought that was so cute so yeah sure
let's get started so when you open it on
when you open it it will look like this
and it just has a lot of nice stuff in
here so once hot basically it is a
picture of Lady and this is Jojo and I
guess this is who created this this box
like with the items in it I guess she's
the one who put it together for this
month and this is the fall box so yeah
and I will have a coupon code listed
below so if anybody was interested in
receiving or subscribing to get this box
um there is going to be a five dollar
off coupon code and i'll leave it in the
description box so yeah this is her um
and then they give you who they give you
this paper right here and I guess it
just basically tells you everything
that's in the full box and a full box is
what I have so yeah and then if they
tips but perfect unboxing so yeah I
don't need that because I'm just want to
do my own unboxing okay so yo I'm
excited um already like is a lot of
stuff in here so I don't know how long
this video is going to be but yes so yes
so the first thing is this they're real
and I guess this is the sample hope this
is the sample size this
is I think it's by benefit yes my
benefit it's their mascara if you
haven't tried this this is actually
really good um because i have purchased
this a whole bunch of times and i'm like
addicted so that's good that they sent
this so if you never tried this before
you might want to try because it makes
your lashes so long so yeah that's
really neat this is the set the sample
size though um they also give you baby
lips so I guess it's like a lip gloss
and yeah i'm not sure what color this is
but it looks like a new color oh it's 25
a taupe taupe with me so yeah this is
what this looks like and i love new
colors so i think that is really neat
and then you have the l small stipple
brush so yeah I have plenty of these but
I mean if you don't you like stippling
brushes yet it comes with a sibling
stippling stipple stippling brush it
comes with a stippling brush so I don't
like the way that sound stippling but
yeah it comes without fresh so that's
nice i'm also on one of these two so
they also give you l toys you know to
keep that breath fresh if you know your
breath is like a little tart um so yeah
I mean my birth not taught right now but
I just want to see how these days but
yeah this is cute like you okay sorry my
battery one did but like I was saying
these are really neat because you can
throw them in your bag and you know how
like you don't eat like oh you be hungry
and you start to get like your breath
start to be like road right and tart
like you can pop one of these in your
mouth and be okay until you get
something to eat so yeah I thought that
was really cute the next product and
this in this box is skin fix and it's
Henry pea cream so yeah this is nice you
can throw this in your bag and go just
in case your hands are dry or anything
like that so I thought that was cute um
they also have what is this conair color
grips and it's basically like a little
brush it's like a mini sides brush also
this is good you can throw this in your
purse so you know when your weave or wig
is out of place you can brush your hair
so I thought that was really really cute
it also comes with um these finger rings
which I thought is really cute because i
love finger rings i want this video to
be super long you guys but I don't know
but um okay so they also um send you a
color pop this is their colour-pop
lippie stick so i thought that was
really cute and it's the color lbb met
so yeah when i first opened this i
thought it was this color I mean before
I opened it I thought it was this color
but it's not it's actually like it's
actually like a red color it's actually
this color right here so I'll do a
swatch so you guys can see and this is
what it looks like if you're not
familiar with the colour-pop lippie Stix
so yeah it just looks like this and
let's see so that's what that looks like
so next it comes with another color pop
and this is in the same color but it's
the lippie pencil so this is what it
looks like and let me take it out so you
guys can
see the packaging so yeah this is what
the lip pencil looks like and here's the
same as that color so yeah that's the
lipstick and that's the lip pencil so
this is really nice I wonder how it will
look on my lips because I'm not really a
fan of this color so yeah I don't know
um what is this this is I'm guessing
it's an eyeliner and it's in the color
purple this is what it looks like and it
has the smudger a little smudger piece
on the end and then it has the pencil on
this part so yeah that's really cute I'm
not going to open it though because it's
just too much tickle 32 you try to open
it so next state sends you they send you
a necklace which I thought was really
cute this isn't it cute necklace I'm
really not I really don't wear necklaces
like that so yeah that's pretty cute
though I'm more like an errand and i
watch type of girl but yeah this is cute
though so you would get this in this box
it also comes with the glam grooves
headphones so or earbuds so that's what
they look like is really nice especially
when your especially when you're working
out if you like to work out or go
running this would be really neat so yes
that's what I use mines for so thank you
for that then it comes with a real
techniques this is the fine liner brush
so
that's what that looks like I don't
understand why the box is so big for
this little brush like I just I don't
get that but okay um but yeah it comes
with a fine liner brush by Real
Techniques oh yes you will get this in
your phone box and it also comes with um
a scarf I'm guessing this is a scar so
the colors in here are really really
really really pretty I don't think that
they look like fall colors more like
spring but this is really cute that's a
really cute school and then it also
comes with this little bag I guess it's
like a makeup bag so you can put like
everything they just gave you in here so
I thought that was really cute so the
last two things and this box is this um
five dollar this is just for your bestie
so it's a it's like a little coupon code
off so yeah that's really cute and then
this was the last thing in here is
twenty percent off for pizza so yeah I
don't know where this is located
probably not here cuz I never heard of
Jack the neck so um I don't know I don't
even know if I'm saying the last name
right but yes okay so that's the end of
