is not in service at this time
hey guys so I'm back with a another way
grid this week listen to me from shaking
go so I will leave their link in the
description box so yeah um this unit
that I am wearing is the equal I guess
it's free trust equal three-way lace
part front lace link yeah um and
three-putt three-way pot it just means
you can put it in the middle or you can
put it either on the right or left side
the only thing about these 3-way
putting's and stuff like that is they
don't really give you a long part but
that's fine because I don't really care
if the part is normal short when it
comes to curly units but if you like
your parts long then yeah you might not
like this one because the lace on this
is you don't really get that much so the
style name is victory and I have it in a
color Opie for 30 yo I really loved this
wig alright so I know I should have came
on camera and shoulders but the curls
were just more defined when I got it and
all the day was a finger comb the curls
out really gently I didn't like go over
or anything like that because I still
want the curls to kind of be defined but
I just wanted to be a little bit bigger
even though swig already was big when it
came out the PEC but yes if you look
like big curly head this is another
gorgeous unit for you so yeah I haven't
received any tingling but I didn't
receive a little bit of shedding which
was not bad at all it's still shedding a
little bit but I did cut into the
hairline so that might be the reason but
this hair is so soft and fluffy
and it is a lot of hair but it's not
like it's a little hot it is a little
hot so um I didn't cut right up ahead
because it was a little long it came
like right here and there are two combs
in the front a comb in the back with
adjustable shrimps at least I think so I
want to cut this wig but then it's like
I don't want to cut this week I feel
like if I cut it I might regret it
because I already like how it looks but
I feel like I want to cut it like right
here like shoulder length I don't know
are you if you don't know me your norm
and patient and I'm just gonna go ahead
and cut it because I feel like it might
be popping if I cut it so yeah this is
what it looks like and I'm about to cut
it pray that I don't mess it up so I'm
just movin it snip like right across
here and we'll see okay guys so mm-hmm
I cut it I actually really like it oh my
gosh and I just cut it going straight
across and it's so freakin cute
that is it for this week if you have any
questions about this way feel free to
leave it in my comment section down
