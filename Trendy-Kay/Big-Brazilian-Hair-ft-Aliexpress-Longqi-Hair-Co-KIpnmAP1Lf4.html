background because I'm just comfortable
right now
so yes excuse the background with this
green and brown that looks unpleasant
but anyway um so I'm coming over here to
give you a review on this hair that I
have in my head now so let me start off
by saying that this hair is from
Aliexpress and the company's name or
vendor is long a hair company so I will
make sure I have everything in the
description box down below if any of you
guys are interested in this hair so in
my head basically
I have um the Brazilian wave and I have
the inches well I have four bundles in a
closure I have two 26 inch bundles I
have a and I have two 24 inch bundles
with a 16 inch lace closure this is what
the hair looks like and it's really long
I felt like I wanted to go for a long
enough Vin's though the hair is curly so
about this hair you guys I mean the hair
is good it's really affordable so if
anybody is looking towards getting some
curly virgin hair I definitely suggest
you to check out this company because
like I said it's very affordable now is
it worth it yes I think that it's worth
it I had this hair for a while now the
only thing that I don't like is that the
closure doesn't match my bundles like
it's killing me I cannot deal with your
hence your like if y'all here
is my bird and he's laughing at me so
it's not funny but anyway let me get up
close to you guys like can see sorry
about the lighting but yes okay so this
is my closure which I think the closure
is really good the hair it's my textures
it does not match like this is more of a
loose curl and then on top the curl is
just so I don't know it's tight and
frizzy like it's really frizzy and it's
really like bothering me so that's the
only thing that I really don't like it
but as far as tangling and shedding I do
get shedding um you can expect shedding
from curly hair curly units curling
anything because it's just wanna shed
oh yeah sheds but curly hey you tend to
get shedding more because of like the
tangles that you get from the curls and
it just sheds it's not like like overly
shedding or anything like that like but
the hair doesn't shed so expect some
shedding and it's far as tangles this
head that's really good um with no
tangles like I can run my fingers right
through it and it's like really good as
far as straighten this hair like I can
straighten it I have straightened it and
I have you know tried to normal state
and it went back to his normal state I'm
about to get frustrated that's basically
it on the hair I really love this hair I
was excited to make um I was excited to
make a unit out of this hair so yeah I
really don't have anything else to say
like I said um this is a really good
company and the hair is really
affordable the only thing that I don't
like is the fact that my clothes
doesn't match the bundles but I was
thinking about like because I did so
this unit this time I didn't do the glue
method so I'm thinking about like
redoing a wig and make it into a you
part and just have my hair out maybe I'm
not sure I'm not really sure what I want
to do with this unit but um another
thing keep in mind when you're
purchasing curly hair that it is like
you have to it's high maintenance like
you have to work with this hair because
it's curly hair and I really didn't
think about that when I wanted this hair
I didn't really think about the upkeep
and my hair is naturally curly and now I
can see why I don't wear curly heavy I
mean if you don't have a problem like
trying to do something with the hair
every day or so I mean you can take like
a little water bottle I meant like a
spray bottle and put water and
conditioner in it because that's what I
do for this and it detangles it and
whatever I was like it works really good
um but yeah curly hair is just not my
thing that's why I don't like my natural
hair and you never see my natural hair
because I'm just not a fan of the upkeep
in the maintenance this is all the hair
to the front and I did cut a few layers
in this unit because I felt like my
closure being 16 inches and then the
bundles being 26 and 24 really like it
was not working so I had to you know
make it all try to blend in together so
I wouldn't be looking silly but um yeah
this is what my closure looks like I
don't really know if you can't even see
the part but I didn't really put much
effort into it because I just want
to show you guys the unit um but yeah so
this is just a little review or
show-and-tell on this hair that I
received from long hair um monkey hair
company and from Aliexpress and I will
make sure I list everything in the
bottom of description box and feel free
to give me guys I mean feel free to give
me guys back and feel free to give me
your suggestions guys like if you have
any suggestions on what I could do to
make my closure look better or anything
because again it's always good to have
other people's opinion and you know
learn from other people because there
might be some stuff that y'all know that
I don't know and I just don't know y'all
I feel like I look crazy only because of
this closure like it's really bothering
me like I love I love like the rest of
the hair I think it's so beautiful and
then I got this frizz ball up in the top
area like I don't know what to do um so
yeah I'm definitely gonna be wearing his
hair I already have wanted but I just
don't know like what to do because after
a while with a hair really dries cuz
right now it's still dead so like you
can see like the top area when it dries
is so friends out like where's the car
with like it's a little bit of curl so I
don't know if this goes for it this goes
for all of their closures but this one
definitely
don't match I know the bundles are
definitely definitely worth it you just
gotta be careful on the closures because
I don't look at other people's videos
where they had this problem with their
closure and not latching shut up
so yeah but this head is really big I
used all four of my lentils I only had
like this much left over yeah but I
absolutely love this hair I just need to
figure out what to do with this but I
probably will just eventually just take
it all out and redo over with either no
closure or a new closure but yes this is
the head this is the Brazilian wave and
I have it 26 26 24 24 with a 16 inch
closure so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video besides um my bird yapping off at
the mouth he only doing that because he
know I'm trying to film a video I
absolutely love it I just I mean it's
not really really bad but you can
definitely notice the difference between
the top part and the bottom part the
bottom is way more defined and yeah so
yes I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and if you have any questions feel free
to leave them in the description box as
always and yeah bye you guys
this hair definitely definitely
definitely looks natural like this short
enough looks like some real hair
and you know I don't know whose natural
moves not but for all you natural people
that had like naturally naturally curly
hair um it kind of reminds you because
don't you know how some of your hair is
like a different texture and you'll get
frustrated because you like some parts
are like real nice and curly and that
other puss would be like what the
like this what this reminds me of that's
why I said it's like so natural because
people real happy like that like the
struggle is real like some you
happy like yeah it's like my curls just
popping and then some of them weak like
like what happened like anyone patchy a
head it's like real wrong and I'd be
sitting up there like what but yeah you
guys that's enough of my talking ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
