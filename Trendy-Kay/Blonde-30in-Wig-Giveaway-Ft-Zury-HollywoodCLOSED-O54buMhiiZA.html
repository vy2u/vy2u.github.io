be mixing with the rich guys it's K of
course and I'm back with eight another
video so this video is going to be on
this week now where it and it's also
gonna be a giveaway video as well on
this hair and another color not this
color but I'll show you later on in a
video but yeah I'm stay tuned at the end
for all details to this giveaway so I
received this week from Missouri
Hollywood and this is the sister wig
beyond your imagination and I have it in
a style
Aulani and I have it in the color blonde
so this is what the stock card looks
like so if you haven't noticed these are
longer limp wheats are really trending
right now so this is the 30 inch lace
tweak that they came out with so we just
go on hop straight into this video okay
so basically construction is your
typical construction it has two combs on
the side a comb in the back and it also
have adjustable straps this wig is big
head friendly for sure this week is huge
on my head so if you have a smaller size
head I would not suggest this wig
whatsoever so it also comes with soft
lace and they provide you with a part in
the middle although I did was shift the
part on the side so if you wanted a side
part you could shift this wig to the
side but yeah it comes as a middle part
I didn't really like the way the middle
part was looking I just didn't so I
shifted it to the side and this is how
it looks
that's basically it for construction now
this is a yankee texture it does have a
little bit of shine if you wanted to go
in and add some dry shampoo or baby
powder you could to dog down the shine I
would say that she probably would need
to go into the part because the part
does come really close together so I
feel like you have to go in and pluck
the part I tried to pluck the part but
the lace is so soft like it just kept me
ripping on me so I just was like forget
it and just edit my finishing powder now
if you're more care
than I am I feel like you can succeed at
plucking the part but I didn't want to I
didn't want it I didn't want the
problems with this week okay so I just
stop and just edit my finishing powder
and this is what it looks like this week
does not come with baby hairs I did go
and add the baby hairs on the side just
to make it look a little bit more
believable so yeah the colors okay for
me you're not like my blonde wigs but I
don't know about this one y'all this the
only problem that I had with this week
is the part is not so good then the the
camp size is really big also this wig is
just it's then like where is the hair ed
Vince though this wig is blind it just
makes the thinness look really more
noticeable really more much more
noticeable because it is a lot of a
lighter color so you can kind of like
see through it like this is literally
all the hair to the front you guys also
I did get some tingling not really much
shedding from this wig a little bit of
shutting but not much at all but I have
got tingling towards the ends and you
can start the toe that the ends are
starting to get a little bit frizzy but
that's a quick fix you can always add
heat to this week and it was straight
him back up but yeah the ends makes me
want to cut it off so guys me personally
I'm not really a fan of this week I
really had high expectations for this
week and that's probably why I'm more so
disappointed just because we already
know that other companies came out with
the longer week with the longer units
which are a really good constructed well
thick and everything so I just thought
by them coming out with this like they
would have been on board as far as how
to construct this wig and just to make
it a little bit more fuller because
do you have like other wigs that look
like this now the color selection I
really love the color selection of
course you know they come out with all
of these nice colors so that is one
thing that I like I like that this way
it comes in a lot of neat colors that's
for sure
like if I'm being honest I really just
think that they need to add more hair to
this for sure because this is just not
it for me I feel like a person who is
just like so thirsty for some 30-odd
ship of bundles but I can't afford four
packs ahead and I only get two this is
what that looks like like girl I'm just
gonna make it work with these two
bundles okay no I can't because I'm the
one who'd be like girl where's the rest
of your under with it like this no so
overall it's okay wig I just don't
really like the thinness but I mean you
want to try it out here's your chance so
yeah we're just gonna go into the
giveaway so basically I'm gonna be
giving this week away and this is what
it looks like this week is in the color
some arty peach which is a beautiful
beautiful color it does come with dark
roots so this is basically what it looks
like I don't know if I really want to
take it out but I am I'm not really
going to take it out take it out but I'm
just gonna show you all color everything
is really really nice so yeah this is
actually the better one I like this
I definitely love this one over the one
that I had one but of course my makeup
it just was not gonna look right with
this color hair so I was just like let
me show you guys the Blancas actually I
was gonna do two giveaway on a blonde
but I feel like y'all will appreciate
this peach one so much more because the
peach one just looks way way better than
this one
