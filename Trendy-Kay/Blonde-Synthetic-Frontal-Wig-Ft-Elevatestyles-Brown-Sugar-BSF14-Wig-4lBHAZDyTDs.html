spoonful I'm gonna beat dolly Annika to
close on a game Brown my feet are
my talk I'm a speaker today watch me
y'all niggas TV oh dear but I'm down
this week wasn't me from elevate style
so if you're interested in this week so
anyway - they have it or anyways that
they had in general I'll make sure to
leave the link in the description box so
you guys can check it out so the week
they sent me is by brown sugar it's the
frontal Elise human hair style mix which
is not human hey you guys - just like
heads of human hair blend so it still
synthetic and it's in the style
BSF 14 and I have it in a color honey
ish which is like a blonde color but
it's different types of blonde going
through him so okay
first off let me give you the
construction before I tell you what I
think about this week so yeah basically
this is a synthetic lace front week so
yeah just a lace part is basically where
has the lace in the front and you can
put it wherever you want throughout the
front of the way it has two combs in the
front of home in a bag and adjustable
straps this week is definitely big hit
front of you guys so if you have a
bigger sized head you'll definitely love
this wig now if you have a smaller sized
head like me this is it's cutting it
because this is like way too big for my
head and I'm just trying to make it work
so basically what you can do if you find
that your wig is too big for your head
you can always and and elastic bands to
the week if you want to but I'm pretty
lazy and I don't like sawing or extra
stuff to the way to like adjust it to my
hair sides if you're lazy like me and
want to take the lazier out you can
always add bobby pins to the side to
secure it down now I don't have bobby
pins but if I was to go out I would
definitely put bobby pins on the side
just to secure it down because I don't
you
homes also this week came with softly so
if you did want to sue carry the lace
down by a glue or gel to it you
definitely can do that I feel like if I
were to edit some kind of adhesive or
you don't gel or glue to the lace it
would have fit or laid down better but
you can definitely see up close well
probably not but you can see if you get
like really close that the lace is not
completely laid down so yeah I would
have to do some adjustments like I said
and bobby pins or whatever the case may
be
Freddie it's really full and it
definitely is a really long now the
texture is silky it's not a texture at
all and like I said as far as the color
it came as one blowing cut without one
pawn color but it does have like some
Browns and like light and dark blondes
along with some brown colors it did not
come with duck root so that is something
that I customized myself because I felt
like and the root area was just the
color was too streaking everything I'm
saying look like streaks so I went ahead
and dumped in the roots to make it look
a little more natural and I definitely
love it with the roots darken so what I
use to a dump in my roots is this what
is it it's actually by L'Oreal and it's
the infallible super slim liquid
eyeliner and yes it is a eyeliner but I
feel like it's much easier in not as
messy so yeah you can use you know
something like this you can also use
like hairspray or one of those what is
it called like for gray hair I forget
what it's called but you know what I'm
talking about like it's like a little
one a cover gray head that works well
that works good as well so yeah anything
you want to use a marker you can use it
to make
it's like it's not best series so yeah
that's basically what I used and yeah
this is how come I didn't have any baby
heads this week does not come with any
baby heads I didn't add baby has the
only thing I did to this lid was a dark
root I didn't pluck the part because I
feel like it looks really natural I just
put it this way in the middle you can
put it on the side like I said it is a
lace front wig so it gives you the
option to part the week whatever you
want to so I just decided to put it in
the middle because that's how I like my
parts and this is what it looks like now
I will say that this wig is really
really full so if you're not a fan of
really full big hair then you're
probably not gonna like this because
this is like a lot of hair you guys I
definitely like the wave pattern illness
this is how the wig originally comes I
would have brushed the hair out but my
head brushes in my car and I didn't feel
like going to my car to get it so yeah I
just basically a finger combed it yeah
and this is what it turned out to be I
didn't really do too much to it
um so I braided this part I was thinking
about like bringing both sides and like
kind of pinning the braids to like the
back I can't even get it out I was
thinking about like braiding each side
and pinning the braids to the back and
just because it is a lot of hair but
then I finished the first brand I was
like that's that friend okay I'm just
gonna leave it like this and then I
added some jewels to it just - you know
liven it up a bit but I definitely loved
how it came out I don't really think I'm
that much of a fan of this color the
color is pretty definitely with the Dove
roots with all the dopers it was looking
scary oh so yeah overall I really liked
this week now I do get shut in from
quite a few strands of hair has came out
so far since I've been laying it it's
not like crazy crazy shedding but it
does
it also tingles at the end so keep that
in mind because it is a lot of hair and
it is long I definitely get it tingling
towards the end not real like crazy
tingling but more so of snakes and I'm
still getting a little bit of shedding
so yeah I'm overall I like this week I
definitely would have liked to try this
week in a different color um so yeah I
think that it would be nice and like a
natural looking color but you know I'm
going through this phase with this
blonde so I gotta try out my color hair
but I'm definitely loving this whole
look it's definitely giving me gypsy
vibes all the way yeah I really really
like how this style turned out so yeah
and let me show you all the hair to the
front because like I said it is a lot of
hair and I didn't want to be looking
like nobody's lying so that's why I kind
of like braided the front because it was
like whoop this side out it was like a
lot in my face so yeah I definitely love
how it came out that's pretty much it
