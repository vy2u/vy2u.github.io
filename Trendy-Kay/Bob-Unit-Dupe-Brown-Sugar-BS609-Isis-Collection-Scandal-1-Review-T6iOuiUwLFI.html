for you guys and this is going to be two
weeks in one video and this these wigs
are from Diva tres calm um diva trust
was kind enough to send me two units and
um I didn't really know that they was
going to send me two units basically
what happened was um when he reached out
to me I was like oh this is cool because
I did a review on a bob unit and I
actually you guys did you want me to do
a dupe for the Bob unit so I thought
this was a good opportunity for me to
pick out a Bob unit from David trust
Ben's dog has been since the way that
was like well just to me and Bobby in it
so I gave them two options um for above
that I would want to review and they
ended up sending me my two options so
basically I have like very similar units
yeah um if that was the case I would
have picked out one Bob and picked out
another unit but um so you can see I'm
starting off with my way cat because um
first off okay so um the first unit that
I received is by who is this by brown
sugar 3 I feel like this is from Pisces
but I'm not really too sure um so this
is um the brown sugar silk lace human
hair wait let me just show you what it
looks like so this is what it looks like
and this is the brown sugar silk lace
hair and hair um I don't think this is
human hair this is the human hair blend
and um yeah I think this is like from
the ISIS collection I'm not sure but
okay so
yeah I got this in a color one so this
is what it looks like um mind you I
don't even really think that neither one
of these weights are I mean they're both
units but I don't really think it's a
good dupe for the human hair wig that I
did a review one um now yeah because
it's not like really a middle part type
of unit but I did after I received these
units I did a fine above unit that was a
middle part Bob unit so I will leave
that link in my description box if
anybody really don't care for these
units but somebody did a review on that
unit and I was like snap like I needed
to get that week but I didn't see it so
anyway let's get into this unit so I'm
going to put this on and show you what
it looks like I'm just going to put it
on on camera and then what I'm going to
do is the ones that I like the most
I'll just cut the lace off and show you
the end results because I feel like I'm
not going to keep both of these units so
one of the units I'll just keep the lace
on and one I'll just cut off so um yeah
this is what it looks like this a is
supposed to be like a natural scalp
slight looking thing but um I don't know
like it's definitely like a lace front
and it's not like a lace part like you
have to do some work to get your part to
lay down wherever you want to have you
part now the thing that kind of like the
thing that kind of tripped me out about
this unit is the fact that when you look
at the picture I was like okay like
she has it on the side and then this
model right here I don't know if you can
see but the part is in the middle so I'm
like okay like I can make this way into
a middle part in it will be even no
because when you make it into a middle
part like the hair is definitely not
even at all like it's not even and then
this side looks kind of like crazy and
then this side I feel like it just flows
like this how it flows this I really
don't so I feel like the hair should be
on this side so yeah as far as the
texture of this unit it is silky on the
hair is it is a nice density like it is
thick um and the tips go from ear to ear
so yeah so this is what this one is
looking like I don't even think I told
you the name of this the style is BS
6:09 so yeah that's what it looks like
um I like this one though this is cute I
feel like it kind of got like a crinkly
texture to it
it's but it feels more silky than
anything um it's not shiny at all I
don't get any shedding um no a lot
there's a lot of and it just came
out um yeah I get a little shed in an
old tangle in though and this head is
like extra extra soft so yeah this is
what it looks like in the back okay so
yeah this is wait number one I
definitely love this unit is really cute
um so let me try out one the second one
and see which one I like best and then
we can go from there okay so this is the
second week that I was sent and this is
by Isis is to break carpet um premier
and the unit is called scandal oh yeah
our CP seven to two scandal one and I
have a color number one so this is what
the picture looks like and this one is a
lace part you guys so it's not like the
first one where the first one was
basically kind of like a lace front but
they did give you a very good amount of
hardened space and you can put it any
way in the front yeah they gave you a
good amount apartment space from the
first unit um but this one is just like
a straight up
this one is just like a straight-up part
on the side so this is what the part
looks like and it looks like you would
have to cut I may not cut but pluck this
unit hmm um and the one before that one
was the least was soft this lace is
heartless hold on so yeah this lace you
can definitely see it's more flexible
and this one is the hard lace on both of
these wigs are in a color number one
this the first week has two combs in
front of comb innovate and adjustable
straps I didn't say that and this week
that I'm about to try out one has two
combs in the front or combing the back
and adjustable straps here for the first
way I didn't show you guys but this is
what the inside looks like in their cap
um I don't know what's been supposed to
be like fake silk base I guess so but it
definitely does not hmm it don't it
doesn't it doesn't give adult oh it
don't look any different to me like it
still looks the same so the fact that
they put that little fabric right there
was pointless to me but okay so this is
the second unit that I'm trying to
assist scandal unit and I'm just one to
put this on in front of the camera I
feel like y'all be going through the
most when I put on my wigs that's why I
never put them on um in front of the
camera because like it just take me
forever hold on like I do like this and
I'll be like I don't know so
okay so this is definitely a cute one
um this is really cute but again like if
you guys were looking for that middle
part type of bulb then these units are
really not it but I mean if you just
like and went above affordable bub unit
and general these two bulbs are really
good options um what else I really like
this unit this unit actually reminds me
of a unit that I already have and that
is the Rihanna unit I forget if it's by
sensational or model model I don't know
but it's called Rihanna it's the Rihanna
Bob Bob and it's really affordable and
it comes in a lot of colors so yeah this
is what it looks like and this is what
it looks like on this side
I feel like I'm just not going to cut it
off neither one of the least I don't
know like I wish I could hear you guys
talking back to me like bitch pick
number one or number two or yeah it's
like we want to see what that looks like
with the lace cut off like I don't know
because I feel like I already have a
bulb unit and I could just give this one
away and not mess it up so I think that
y'all probably would appreciate that
more so I don't even think that I'm
going to cut off neither one of these
laces even though this one is my
favorite I think I think I would
probably would cut this I really like
how this one looks um I feel like the
texture and the hair the first one feels
more better than this one
this one feels a bit more on the coarser
side um like the first one felt like
some sure enough really good hair like
this one feels like some somebody's like
natural hair it feels good is what I
don't know I just feel like the quality
and the first week was better than the
quality in this hair but um I definitely
like the cut of this more better than
the first week and I like um what else I
like um I forget what I was going to say
oh I like the fake that I like how the
lace is even though I do like hard lates
but I just don't like the hard lace
before it's cut off like if you do them
saying like I love Harley's don't get me
wrong but when I try on my wigs I don't
like the Hartley's but once it's cut off
I like the Hartley's I don't know but I
mean if you like a soft lace over the
hard lace then you probably want to go
with the first week first but yeah again
if you're interested in
units um you can purchase them from diva
tress calm as far as like tangling and
shedding um that's another thing this
one I don't get any shedding from this
week but the first week I did get
shedding from that week and as far as
like tangling I haven't got any tangles
from this unit let me show you the back
so this is what the back looks like I
think this is my favorite though um even
though it's good things about the first
one but overall I really do love the way
this looks on me again this is the part
um but yeah I really really really do
like this wig I am doing a wig sale so I
will let you know when I have all of my
wigs up on my site and I think I'm going
to add these wigs to the site as well so
I'm not really going to mess with it
because I feel like you're going to want
the wig in good condition and y'all can
cut the lace off and do what you want to
this unit so yeah for that purpose only
I'm just not going to UM want to bother
with cutting off the lease or anything
like that but you can definitely get a
feel of what this unit will look like
and I think yeah if I had to choose this
will be my favorite wig but I have a wig
like this alright here you guys I hoped
you enjoyed this video again I believe
neither trust link down below to um both
of these units</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
