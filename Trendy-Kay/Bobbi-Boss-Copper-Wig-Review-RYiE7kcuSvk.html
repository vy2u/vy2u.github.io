another wig review and this wig was sent
to me um from Sam's Beauty so yeah if
you're not too familiar with Sam Beauty
which everybody should be go check them
out I will leave the link in my
description box so yeah they sent me um
what is this
Bobbie boss copper MLF 74 copper that's
the like the style and I have it in a
color for 30 so ya this week is popular
on here I saw a couple of reviews on
this unit but I'm just like it's not
really it's not my favorite but I feel
like if it was in it like if it was in a
different color I probably liked it like
a color color but this unit is just not
doing anything for me like it looks good
on a lot of people that I've seen do
reviews on us but just not me I'm just
like not feeling this unit at all the
part is actually pretty good because all
the day it was edit powder into it
I didn't even plug this part it is kind
of a short part though um but yeah you
can definitely see the part this unit is
very thick and it's yaki um so you can
see it is like a shoulder length
probably like 10 inches I don't like
this unit y'all like um I'm a blame em
yeah just this unit is just not for me
I'm just not feeling this unit you guys
tell me what you think I don't know I
just um it just doesn't do
for me I think I need in like a color
food to be poppin I thought the 430 will
be cute but the 430 is actually pretty
dark for 4:30 in my opinion so yeah um
this wig is pretty snug so um if you do
have like a larger size head you might
even get away with I do have my straps
adjusted really tight though so um yeah
it is on the snug side though but that's
probably because of my shirt so I don't
know what I'm talking about right now um
this does have combs it has two combs on
the side um don't ever come is a comb in
the back and it has adjustable straps so
this is what the unit looks like it I
haven't got any shutter on tangling from
this unit um this is a pretty short unit
so as far as like tangling you cornered
the witness a couple times and then it
might start tangling up on you and stuff
but um other than that normally my
shorter way it's less longer than my
long weeks anyway so yeah um this is
what it looks like the other side this
is what it looks like in the back and
this is what it looks like on the side
so yeah I'm sorry this is like a short
video but I really don't have too much
to say about this unit oh yeah and it is
like soft lace so if you're not really a
fan of soft lace then you're probably um
well not like this unit because it does
come with the soft lace I'm more of a
fan of the holidays but I mean it's okay
to me it doesn't really bother me that
much so I mean it's a it's a um it's a
nice wig I just really don't like it on
me I feel like it ages me so yeah
yeah you guys tell me what you think I
don't really know about this week but
again this week is from a Sam's Beauty
so go check them out I will leave the
link to this unit as well as the as well
I will leave the link to this unit as
well as their website in my description
box so yet if you have any question any
question
