another wave review so um this is going
to be the wig that I am reviewing for
you guys today and this is a Bobby butch
unit and this is like my first time ever
reviewing um um Bobby Bonds brand so
yeah I'm really feeling like Bobby boy's
weeds nebulae but anyway so the name of
this unit is m89 9e vitro boy veteran i
don't know um
and the color is tt99 j / purple and
it's the same color as the model angle
look at this freaking way go like this
wig is given me so much life it's crazy
okay so basically I have two of these
units this unit I was searching for this
color everywhere and I finally came
across it so I purchased this unit then
I went and I also have a second one from
head to beauty and they sent me a color
um TT 1 b / turquoise this is what it
looks like and yeah hey - booty sent me
this so I'm gonna um I'm going to try
this one on so you guys can see what the
color looks like but for now so yeah
this is what this color looks like
and hmm I think I have them I think um
shutting as well um I feel like I have a
unit like this already what is what is
it what is it in the same exact color I
think it's the McKenzie wig I think I
had it kind of reminds me of that way if
you ask me but this one is meant to be I
don't really know if I want to keep this
color or not I'm still thinking on it
it's kinda cute though
look at that though that color is so
pretty
yeah so this is this color right if you
guys are interested in purchasing this
unit you can definitely find it ahead to
beauty.com so let's get into this wig
review so the way that this construction
the way construction is set up is it has
no comb so if you guys are like a fan of
combs and unique homes in your unit then
this wig would not be for you because it
comes with no combs the only thing it
comes with its adjustable straps so yeah
no combs just adjustable straps me
personally I don't like comb so this way
come in without any combs is like a plus
for me because I just use the adjustable
straps but my head is very tiny and I
feel like this wig is a little bit on
the bigger side so if your head is like
normal to a larger size head this way it
would be perfect for you because it does
fit really loose on my head and I had my
shut my straps adjusted to its tighten
so it can't get any more adjusted than
what it is so yeah I probably feel like
I need to take like a bobby pin or two
bobby pins and put on each side but I'm
not sure I'm still I don't know
so this wig also just comes with a lace
part there is no lace on a perimeter
that you have to cut off so it's just
only the lace part in is not like a lace
front where you have to like cut off the
lace around the hairline so um the
parting space is decent I really really
like the part in space sometimes I'm not
really a fan of wigs that just come with
the lace part without like the lace
hairline only because they make like up
in here like really thick and it doesn't
like blend in I don't know maybe it's
just me but yeah it's something about
like up in here where it's like the lace
is thicker and you can't really blend it
in and
I really like the part though the part
is the part is really good so as far as
like the texture of this hair um it is
on the Yankee side it's definitely not
shiny
oh this is like a very dole um we it
makes it look even more realistic with
this color line it is also thick so that
is a good thing it's not like too thick
but it's in the middle it's not like
overly thick or anything like that but
it's definitely not a thin wig so I feel
like you'll like it um what else this
year is 18 inches long so it's not too
long um yeah so this is what it looks
like on the side this is what it looks
like in the back and this is what it
looks like it definitely comes as a
middle part which I'm loving because
y'all know I love my little middle part
even though I've been wearing side parts
a lot lately but um yeah this unit is
shutting um and shedding light though I
don't know doesn't see that but um yeah
that's the only thing that I really
don't like about this unit is it sheds
so I don't know that's for me plucking
the part but we'll see now as far as
tangling I do get tangles like this this
bottom layer part like a little bit bit
towards the ends is where I'm getting
most of my like tangling we're not even
really tangling but more so like snakes
here and there but that's about it
that's it for this video if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in a
comment section down below and what else
oh yeah and you can find this unit on
hair to beauty and I will link the
website in the description box as well
is the light to this unit so yeah bye
