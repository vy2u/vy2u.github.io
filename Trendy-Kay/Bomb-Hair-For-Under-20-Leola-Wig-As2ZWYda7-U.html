keep trying to get over anything a
threatened and lied to me I spent five
on my banker when she loved my diamond
ring okay guys so I'm back with a
another wig review and this week one
since me from sister week so just in
case you like this wig and want to go
check it out
I'll leave sister with links in my
description box so yeah and before I get
started on talking about this wig
I just want to make a disclaimer yes
this is a lot of hair so if you are not
a fan of c-care this is just not the
video for you but I promise you I got
your next samples okay so this week sent
me the model model premium wig and style
Leola Leola yeah I think the same
announcement and I have it in the color
ot PI or OTP I a yellow cheap I um so
yeah this is what the card looks like
and then on the back we have the same
girl wearing a blonde color and the
picture right here this is the color
that I'm wearing now so yeah
also this way it comes in a lot of
colors so yes so I know some of you
probably like something that looks like
floral floor is by free trust equal I
believe yeah I think is very trust equal
and they are like twin sisters they look
exactly the same basically but the only
thing is floor is always sold out in
this particular color so I'm looking
like that look like the same week to me
and then they ended up handing this
color available in our life I gotta get
it like bring that to me please and when
I put it on this is just how it is
besides me cut in the front a little bit
this is how it is and I have not plexus
laid out at all you don't have to pluck
it out if you pluck it out I'm sure it
would just get even bigger this also
reminds me of the Dominican curlies I'm
the Dominican Carly wing it's just as
big is that week so yeah just
issue wanted to know exactly how big
this is yay this week is a full cab unit
um so it's not like a leased part or
lace front wig or anything like that but
it does come with skin type parts and I
don't really care that I don't really
care for the skin type up because it's
so darn any like powder or anything to
the part it really all of this hair you
know and nobody is going to be paying
attention to the parts so yeah but it's
skin type just in case you want it to
know
and also this week does not come with
any combs because it is a full cap unit
so it only comes with adjustable sure it
doesn't come this way also comes with
baby hairs but at the baby hands are
pretty much unruly and you can't really
do too much to the baby hair so what I
ended up doing is I ended up just
brushing out my baby hairs and yeah I
think it turns out really good and I
feel like for the most part it looks
natural now I'm you Ken which I would
suggest pull in summary I just I was
just a little bit to kind of blend it so
you won't see that like indentation off
kind of like if it was like a half a wig
but not that much hair just like a
slither up yeah I just um I think that
it will hide this little bad thing right
here but this head like I said this hair
is super big that nobody can even tell
because it's just it's been less weight
you can just pretty much throw this on
and you're ready because you don't have
to do no plugging now I did why is my
veteran wounded again anyway now I did
cut this part off and that's optional
you really don't have to but I wanted to
come more towards my face y'all know I
love this look so yeah I just cut a
little bit off so this is what this wig
is looking like and this way just gives
me so much like you guys I really
enjoyed this week and the color is
poppin like it's really on point you
guys if you won't get this wig I
certainly suggest that you get this way
and it's
color I promise you won't be
disappointed I feel like this is a color
that just goes with any type of skin
tone it's for shedding and tangling I
have not received any shedding and I
haven't received any Pangolin
obviously this wig would tangle or
tangle or you if you start to comb
through it you can't even really comb
through it and I wouldn't suggest you
combing through it just because it's
super curly and it's a lot of hair and
even if it's tangle you still wouldn't
even know the difference if it was
tangle on table because it's just curly
hair anyway so guys that's it for this
video if you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
