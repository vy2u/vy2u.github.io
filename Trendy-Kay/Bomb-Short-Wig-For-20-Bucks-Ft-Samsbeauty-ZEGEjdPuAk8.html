and a goofy a venice' you know there's
other Kamiya you know I believe
Oh
I'm ready
hey guys it's K of course and I'm back
with another video so this video is
going to be on this hair and purchases
hair from a Sam's Beauty so I'll go
ahead and leave all the links in the
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested in this week might
add that this week is not new to YouTube
whatsoever also this week is really
really really affordable so if you're
looking for a short affordable wig
definitely check out the links in my
description box so the wig I'm wearing
is from red carpet premiere and this is
a 4 week this is not at least week it
doesn't come with a lace PO anything
like that so the style I have this
weekend is RCP 178 Keisha which is just
Keisha and the color is f1b
30 and this is what the stock card looks
like and basically if you're not
familiar with 130 I made a 1 B 30 that's
basically like a 1b and then it has
little streaks of the color 30 which is
like a dark blonde color or honey blonde
color so yeah this is what it looks like
so first off this comes with two combs
in the front it doesn't come with a comb
and a bag and it also comes with
adjustable straps now I'm going to tell
you guys that this week is not big hit
from these I have a really small head
and this week without the strips
adjusted fits my head really snug and
tight so again if you have a bigger size
head just stay away from this week now
if you have like a normal to smaller
sized head I feel like you can get away
with this week this is basically how the
week come straight out of the pack it is
like put this on your head and go okay
the only thing that was different is I
felt like all the hair was basically to
the front I kind of look like Elvis
Presley and I don't really like that
look so I kind of just separated the top
is what
did and this is what it looks like I
didn't brush it I didn't like this is
this isn't you guys so I'm going to turn
around so you can see what the week
looks like all the way around I will say
if you plan on wearing should we please
have your hair flat in the back I'm
pretty sure you can see it bulging a
little bit because I do have a ponytail
in the back but I mean it's kind of flip
okay so as far as the texture this is a
silky texture this is not a Yankee wig
so if you're into more of a Yankee
texture you're not going to get this out
of this week so yeah I feel like it
still looks natural the shine on this is
not shiny whatsoever
this also is heat friendly oh he's safe
so you definitely can put heat to this
wig if you wanted to I personally
wouldn't put heat to it just because I
feel like the curls are really nice the
style and everything is really nice
now one thing I do notice is that it's
like the hair is more heavy right here
and I feel it in my soldered I need to
cut this off like I'm just itching to
cut it off but I don't want to mess it
up because I'm not sure because I still
like this look but I just see I just
want some of this like going like some
of that needs to be gone and I wish this
was live yo so y'all can tell me what
y'all think
versus right now in the comment section
and I already did it I don't know but
I'm thinking that I'm going to cut it
because I already had my students handy
right here I don't know if I'm going to
regret this or not you're um but yeah I
think I'm just gonna cut it down just a
little bit and I'm sure you guys want to
see how I cut it down but my face is
pretty small and I just feel like it's
kind of like swallowing my forehead hole
so yeah I won't go ahead and just cut it
just a little bit to see what its gonna
look like oh my gosh I don't know I've
never been so scared so kind of weak
only because you really don't have to
especially if you're if your face is
more bigger than my's you definitely can
get away with the extra hair but for me
I feel like yeah I'm definitely gonna
cut it okay so I'm gonna cut it yo am i
required okay see like is really really
long
you
okay you're on make I had to dust off
all the day hair that was in my face but
yeah I don't know if you can tell the
difference before and after but I
definitely can tell the difference look
at that like it's just so much better
right here I don't know what do you guys
think am I overreacting
oh can y'all really tell the difference
because I feel like I feel like I can
definitely tell the difference it
doesn't matter as long as I feel better
and secure about when this week so yeah
basically I just cut it down a little
bit like I said if you have a bigger
face than me you might can get away with
all the hair or if that's just how you
want to look you can definitely keep
your wig like that I'm not saying that
you have to go ahead and cut some of the
hair down and I actually didn't cut a
lot of the hair like this is all the
hair that I cut which is not a lot but
it was just like I don't know what's
bothering me you guys so yeah overall
I'm definitely loving this week I've
been sleeping on this wig you guys like
I've always looked at it but from the
stock cards it's just like you wouldn't
want to get this wig just by looking at
this picture because it absolutely looks
a mess on the model I mean clearly it
looks and looks bad on the model before
I get off of him
tangle and shut him so short a wig
you're not gonna get any I'm not going
to say you're not going to get any
tangle in but it's rare that you'll get
tangling with shorter weeks now shedding
you do still get some shut-in with
shorter wigs but I haven't received any
shedding yet from this week I'm sure I
will as the week gets older or maybe I
won't it just all depends but yet so far
so good
I definitely recommend this week I
really like how it looks it looks like
really nice especially with the earrings
and stuff like that I definitely love it
like spread out I like this type of look
definitely love it it's giving me like
old-school
especially with these earrings like but
yeah tell me what you think I really
really like this I really love this
color that's it for this video if you
guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in a comment section down below
if you're wondering whistle my ellipses
and YX lip gloss in the color natural so
yeah I love you guys and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
