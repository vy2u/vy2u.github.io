we together I moved on for the better
don't you ever I went down but whatever
and there's some people make the work
I just take it day by day
of course and I'm back with another
video and this video is gonna be my two
week update on the beauty forever
Brazilian body wave hair so if you have
not seen my first video on this hair
I'll link it in the description box
sorry if you hear any noise by our link
it in the description box down below so
you can check that video out so yeah
just a little recap I did they did send
me a bundle hair and I made it into a
week and they sent me four bundles and a
frontal and they sent me to lengths 18
16 18 16 14 and 12 with a 10 inch front
tool or 12 insurance who I can't
remember but everything will be in the
description right so definitely check
out the first video because I give you
more details about my wig making and all
of that as far as like the limps of the
bundles and all that goodness of so
basically this is just going to be my
two-week update as you can see the wig
is looking a little different from my
first video but I definitely wanted to
go ahead and die this hair because I
didn't die the previous hair that I had
from them and that was the Malaysian
curly hair but that hair held up so good
and I was just curious to see if their
hair still would be good if I dyed it so
I just decided to go ahead and die this
and I was just insert clips and
everything of the dyeing process for
this hair but now I didn't go for a
blonde blonde color because that's just
not the look that I was looking for um
for this particular wig I wanted to go
with a more brown color and actually is
the color is more brighter than what I
wanted it to be but I think that's
because I didn't leave the dot one long
enough I can't remember off the top of
my head what color the dye was I think
it was like
I know I got cinnamon brown and I also
got like Siena it might have been seeing
I don't know but I'll leave clips in
like this video somewhere so yeah I
decided to bleach the hair and literally
the hair lifts within seconds so you
don't have to worry about leaving the
bleach on for a very long time because
this head lifts within seconds so once I
put the bleach all over the hair I
decided to rinse it out I didn't want to
wait so it can get lighter because like
I said I wasn't planning on making this
hair to light anyway so as soon as I put
the bleach on all and so as soon as I
put the bleach all over the hair and I
didn't like literally put it all over
the hair I just put it more towards the
ends I took the head and I rinsed it out
and once I rinse the bleach out I went
ahead and used my fuzzy conditioner and
I conditioned the hair and then it
turned out like a good blond color it
was just a tad bit lighter than the
color that the wig is now but yeah I
went ahead and blow dried the hair and
then after I blow dry that I
straightened it and this is what it's
looking like I did cut the front a
little bit but as you can see it's still
in the same style that it was when I
first made the wig and I definitely love
this style I didn't plan on changing the
style I wanted to keep this style but I
definitely my main concern was sin if it
took to bleach good and it absolutely
did the hair is in the same condition as
it was when I first received the bundles
the hair is not damaged whatsoever so
yeah overall I'm really loving this hair
you guys I am going to give you an
update video on how this hair is holding
up from being process so if you watched
my previous video the first video on his
hand I did tell you guys that I over
plucked the
but I just moved the part to the
opposite side and lately I've been
liking my pop on this side I don't know
what that's about
I'm really not like I don't stick to one
side I typically change it but I feel
like I like it on this side I don't know
it might change within a week and I feel
like I want to win
on the right side who knows but I
definitely been loving my part on the
left side so I changed it because the
plucking she wasn't that bad
on this side so this is what it's
looking like
and y'all this looks so natural to the
point where my sister thought I died my
real hair yeah I did cut a few layers
just in the top area and I think I want
to go back and like cut some more but I
get to scissor heavy with though I don't
really want to mess up the wig so I try
to like restrain myself from cutting so
if you are interested in the beauty
forever hair and you're thinking about
dyeing it definitely go ahead and dye it
because um it definitely takes good to
bleach or whatever the case may be so
yeah I'm not gonna make this video too
long I think I'm sitting in like all my
videos I'm not gonna make this video too
long
but I'm really not I just wanted to come
here real quick and update you guys on
this hair and as you can see I'm still
loving this hair and I don't know the
next time I update y'all on this hand
it might look totally totally different
who knows but so far so good you guys I
definitely think that beauty forever has
to be like one of my top go to companies
