and this time this video is gonna be a
little different because I'm going to be
reviewing this head that I received and
this is the hair that I'm wearing now
hair is from a company called the
world-version Hair Boutique
so yes this is what the hair looked like
I received 24 I received four bundles
and the closure 24 24 22 20 and a 14
inch silk vics silk base closure so this
is the head I'm really loving this hand
right now I'm so for all my females or
males who like that virgin hair this is
raw version hair if you're looking for
like some good quality virgin hair then
this video is definitely gonna be for
you because this is some really nice
hair and this is the Brazilian natural
body wave and the head did not come like
this I will insert a clip towards the
end just showing you guys what the
packaging looks like and what the hair
looks the hair looked like coming out of
the packaging so when I received the
hair i did x4 brazilian body wave and
when I received my hair it came like a
Shirley Temple curls so our contact that
the lady who was really nice and they
they definitely have good customer
service so she just told me that she
made a mistake and she sent out the
wrong way she told me to just wash it
and everything and it should look like
the closure cuz my closure was a silk
base um
Brazilian body wave closure and then the
bundles was the wrong it didn't match
basically so if you guys are interested
in this company and this hair I will
list everything in my description box
and the links to everything wanted you
guys to be aware that it is based out of
the UK so shipping might take a little
longer yeah I don't know probably not I
don't know definitely love the end the
results of what I did with the hair so
yeah this is what the hair looks like
let me show you guys my silk based
closure which is right there honestly in
my opinion I'm really not a fan of the
silk base closures the partn don't get
me wrong it does look really realistic
like I didn't do anything to the part in
space but like up in here
it's like lace and then it's a so picks
is like so based Parton but like it's
kind of like lace first and it doesn't
really transition from your scalp to the
lace closure is kind of hard to blend I
mean some people who love silk base
closures but I'm not a fan I feel like
lace closures really work better for me
the hair is frizzy but I think that
doesn't have anything to do with the
company itself I just think that that
was me because you should expect um
expect your hair to be a little like dry
or frizzy after bleaching it and yeah I
bleached it a lot so and it still looks
good at at the bleaching it um so yeah I
definitely really bleach this in there
but
it still looks good as far as tingling I
do not get any tangles you see my hand
going straight through and it's like
curly I don't get any tangles I do get a
little shut-in but I did bleach the hair
okay guys so this is how the hair came
and it was packaged in this beautiful
box and now I'm showing you what the
hair came in which is these plastic
things the twenty four twenty two twenty
and a closure and this is just how the
hair looks outside of the packaging and
this is how the hair looks up close
which is really nice and this is what
the closure looks like which is a soap
base closure and the Parden is amazing
so this is all the head together and it
was one bundle missing that I didn't
show you and I just washed it and this
is everything together if you enjoyed
this video and if you have any questions
about this hair feel free to leave it in
the comment section down below
and I'll make sure I respond back and
like I said if I'm missing anything I'll
make sure I put everything in my
description box and links to this
company in my description box so yes
I'll see you next time guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
