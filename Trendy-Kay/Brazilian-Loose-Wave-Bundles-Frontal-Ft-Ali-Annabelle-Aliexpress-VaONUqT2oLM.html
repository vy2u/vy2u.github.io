got a head song got the try kinda okay
of course and I'm back with another
video and this video is gonna be on this
head that was sent to me from Ellie
Annabelle so just in case you're
interested I'll go ahead and leave all
their links in my description box so
yeah basically this is a bundle head
that I made into a week so let me just
tell you what this hair is before I
start talking about it so they sent me
the Brazilian a loose wave remy hair
100% human hair this is the title but
basically it's Brazilian loose wave hair
and they sent me four bundles and a
frontal and this is my first time trying
out a frontal as so yeah
but they sent me four bundles of 28
inches and they sent me a 20 inch fresh
this is my first time I'm making a wig
with a frontal because normally every
time I get bundle hair I just use the
what is it the lace closure because
that's just what I'm comfortable with
making wigs out of and it's just I just
use it all the time so I'm like okay
when every stuck to me I'm like let me
just go ahead and try their frontal so I
wind up making a wig out of the bundle
hair and the front tool and I have to
say that this is actually it really
turned out really good this is some foam
hair I received the frontal from another
company so I made that wig first and
then I made this week second so of
course it was all about trauma so I kind
of like messed up on the first week that
I made but then when I made this one it
turned out way better than the first
this is
hair in its natural state so I didn't do
anything to it like this is how the hair
comfortable this is not how the head
comes but it pretty much looks like the
same curl pattern as when it came but I
did go ahead and wash it after I made my
week absolutely loving the curls on this
week I feel like it's just like so
beachy and I definitely love it I love
everything about it I love the left um I
noticed enough it's probably not for
everybody but like I said it's Bundle
hair so you can get this and in shorter
lives they offer you ten inch to twenty
eight inch so this is the longest length
that you can get so of course I'm gonna
go ahead and insert just like clips of
what this hair looked like originally
and that means how you guys like even
though it's curly I can still run a wavy
I can still run my hands through it it's
so soft and bouncy the hair looks
exactly how it look when it came on and
it it still has the same exact curl
pattern don't you know how like when you
wash the head the curl pattern just
disappears and it's just not the same
curls as when you got it not this honey
like this hair remains the same it still
has the same curls as a date when I
first guy also as far as shipping I did
receive this hair really quick I
probably received it within like five
days if not faster than that
so yeah the shipping it was really nice
the customer service is definitely on
point because I know a lot of people
look for good customer service of course
so yeah the customer service was
definitely on point the shipping was
definitely on point and it was packaged
well like like bundle heads typically
packaged most of the time so yeah but
anyway when I received the bundles the
bundles was easy for me to run my
fingers through the weft was really
constructed well there was not any
shedding that came from either bundles
before I even started making the wig I
did go ahead and reach the nuts on this
and this took really well to bleach the
bleach I meant the Knights bleaching
very well they turn instantly and I
didn't have no mistakes like the bleach
getting on the hair or anything like
that and I think I only left the bleach
on the knives for like 10 to 15 minutes
and they turn instantly
also after I finished bleaching the
knots I went to here and pluck the
hairline because I will say the hairline
did not look natural at all it had a lot
of hair just right there you know how to
it like like that it didn't look it
didn't look real at all so if you decide
to get this hair you definitely will
have to pluck the headline for sure but
I like to pluck my headlines after I
bleach the nice because I feel like the
head comes out easier so that is what I
did it wasn't really hard to pluck out
all the hair because the hair just you
know came out easily I did use all for
the bundles because when you get longer
hair you get less hair if that makes any
sense so the longer the hair is the less
hair you get versus if you get short
hair you'll get like a lot of hair so
yeah so I did use all four of the but
you'll definitely be good with four
bundles but like I said if you want to
if you want your hair thicker then you
could go for five but four bundles
definitely worked out really way that I
made this wig I went in here and washed
it and when I washed it I got light shed
it wasn't like OD shut no nothing like
that
like the shedding wasn't bad at all and
I feel like most of the shedding came
from the front so anyway from when I
plucked the hair line but yeah I did not
get a lot of shedding in if I had a clip
out inserted of how much shedding I got
from this hair but yeah it was not a lot
at all and the hair did not tangle up on
me like it still has not tangled yeah
yeah after I washed it I let it air dry
and when I let it air dry this is how it
came out of course like the curls were
more like clustered together but I just
took my fingers and finger combed them
apart and this is what it looks like
after I finished making a week
like you will need to cut you will need
to cut this accordingly to your heed
sides or whatever but I didn't cut them
off I just was like I'm just not because
I don't really know what I'm gonna do it
this way yet so yeah I didn't cut those
off yet but this is what it's looking
like
so this is what the pardon looks like
it looks really good and of course I
didn't glue down the lace or anything
like that so that's what the hairline
looks like the plucking it like I said I
didn't glue it down but if it was glued
down it would look so good
anyway if anybody is interested in this
hair um definitely check out this vendor
now this vendor is from Aliexpress this
is the Aliexpress vendor and I know a
lot of times people always want to find
like good vendors from Aliexpress
because it's a lot of bad ones out there
so yeah definitely check out this went
vendor they are called le and about and
I think the hair is really bomb so I'm
gonna go ahead and leave all the links
in the description box but so far so
good you guys
so yeah I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
