pick up enter me she be mixing with the
rich pseudo plug seeping Nancy the one
ain't caught of guard shell stretch you
don't trip Betsy on my boss saw with
fire
gotta choose someone
screaming hey guys is Kate of course and
I'm back with another video so this
video is going to be on two wigs that I
was sent from well not two weeks but
it's gonna be on a wig and it's also
going to be on a bundle head that I was
sent from why wigs so if you're
interested in any of this hair that I am
going to show you in this video you can
just check the description box because
all links will be in the description
really get into too much with this wig
so basically the first thing they sent
me was a wig of course and they sent me
a 613 weight with dark roots so I'll
just insert what the way it looked like
originally and know I'm lying it wasn't
with dunkers it was just as straight up
six thirteen week I have really been
filling the yellow hair so I just went
ahead and dyed this hair yellow of
course I didn't want my whole week to be
yellow because I felt like that was just
going to give off too much of like a
fake look so I definitely wanted to add
some dark room I didn't really think
that the duct roots was gonna turn out
good and he actually turned out really
really good this week it's just like I
wouldn't recommend this week like it's
okay
but it's definitely not my favorite in
6:13 week so we're just gonna stick some
more on the bundles because I don't want
y'all to be disappointed if you give
them saying now the hair is really good
but after I after I dyed the roots the
wig just started shedding uncontrollably
like it was so hard to detangle you guys
like I didn't think that this week was
actually gonna survive right now the
hair looks like it never even like went
through any type of issues or I had any
problems with it but trust me so it
looks good it got very well I'm also
gonna insert the color because I
normally dye my weights love adore sent
me
permanent hair dye and for some reason I
don't think that a door occurs yellow at
least not in my beauty supply store so I
wind up using a different brand I'd say
now right now as the item went through
war with this wig it actually is really
really pretty I'm getting no Shannon I
also do not get any tangling but again I
don't know how the wig is gonna be after
I wear it and then I have to go and wash
it again that's the whole thing so I'm
really not too sure when this way at all
but but yeah it's a 360 way and
basically a 360 wig it's just at least
going all around all around the head so
really it gives you the option to pull
the head up if you want it to so yeah
that's what it looks like this is the
week they sent me like I said so okay
wig if you want to take your chances so
free but yeah I love that bundle head so
we're going to get onto the bundles that
they sent me so basically they sent me
three bundles of their body wave I think
it was Brazilian
body wave bundles they sent me three
bundles and a front tool and the front
school was 20 inches and the bundles was
26 24 and 22 inches I used all three of
the bundles and the front tool to make
my wig and I didn't have any hair left
over like it fits so perfectly so this
is what the hair looks like now when I
originally got this hair it came as a
great color and of course if you watch
my videos you know that I've been trying
to get this color so I just thought why
not just put blue over the gray just
because I was looking for that type of
the color and it actually came out
really really good you guys the wig
itself came out so good you guys when I
received his hair I did not receive any
shedding from the bundles and he Tanglin
like the bundles was legit that's why I
was kind of hurt about the weight but
I'm like
okay you did want to purchase from this
company I suggest going with there but
new hair versus their wigs
in my opinion so I did go in and bleach
my nuts on my closure and I also used
I think it's sky-blue I'll go ahead and
search clips of what I used to achieve
this color so the hairline did already
come pre plucked but I just went in and
plucked it some more just because the
front school itself was like a high
density it didn't look unnatural or
anything but I just wanted to thin it
out some more what else like I said I
did go in with my adore hair color I
think it's called sky blue and I mixed
that with some 20 volume developer and
that was just to lighten up the blue
color because the blue color was darker
than what I wanted the hair to be so
yeah I just I just mixed it with that
you can mix it with conditioner the
first bundle I tested out I did mix the
color with conditioner but then my
conditioner ran out so I had to use the
20 volume developer I feel like when you
use the developer over the conditioner
you're gonna want to shampoo it and like
really get that developer out of the
hair because you don't want that stuff
like sitting in the hair versus
conditioner because conditioners really
not gonna hurt the hair so yeah and this
is what it turned out to be a show you
was minimal I did not get a lot of
shedding from his head as far as
tingling I still have not received any
tingling from this hair and might I add
that this curl has been holding up
really good and to achieve these curls I
used my my burro curler I use it in all
my videos so you might have seen it
before I don't feel like getting it but
yeah I just wrapped it as I was as if I
was one car
the hair so yeah that's how I achieved
this look and I just did the half up
half down and I think it came out really
really pretty you guys and I did use my
eyes to be glue hair spray just to
secure the lace so this is what the hair
looks like up close and of course I did
do like some darker shades of blue and
then you have some lighter shades of
blue I just wanted to give this week
some dimension so yeah it really really
looks good you guys I'm so pleased with
this color this color is just like
everything okay so guys that's it for
this video if you're interested in this
hair I'll go ahead and leave all the
links in my description box so yeah you
