back with a another video this week was
sent to me from a Friday night hair so
if you're interested I'll go ahead and
leave all the links in the description
box just in case any of you guys want to
check this week oh honey the wig I had
one is in the style of GLS 32 I have it
in a color 1b I'm not sure if this comes
in another color I believe it does
so yeah if it does I'll make sure I'll
leave it in my description box
well yeah I'm pretty sure it comes in
like a blondish brownish type color I
might be wrong yours so don't quote me
on it so anyway let's get into this
video so if you're not familiar with
Friday night hair basically it's like a
website that sells mostly a synthetic
lace front wigs they do sell about wigs
like human hair but nobody really gets
that everybody goes there for the
synthetic lace front wigs so the
construction of their wigs are all the
same is a synthetic lace right it gives
you this much parting space which is
like the two inches worth of parting
space which I actually think that it's a
little I felt maybe it's in my head but
I feel like it's a little bit deeper
than what it normally is I don't know
also it comes with tape just in case you
want to take down your lace but I
wouldn't suggest using the tape because
friday-night hair their wigs come with
the Harleys and with the heart lace
that's basically secured like it's
already secured on your head so you
don't have to worry about like gelling
using got to be glue using tape or
anything like that but if you want your
weight more secure then definitely go
ahead and use the tape but me personally
I don't use the tape this way it comes
with two combs and a frontal comb in
about and adjustable straps if you do
have a bigger size head I feel like hmm
this wig might be a little
snuggling you I'm pretty sure you
probably can get away with it but just
letting y'all know if you got a bigger
size head this might be a little snug on
you because my straps are adjusted I do
have a smaller size head but before I
even adjust my straps this way clothes
fit me good it's not really a lot of
room left in the back to play with so
yeah but y'all first of all this is a
lot of hair this is also some long hair
so if you don't like a lot of hair mmm
probably won't like this week if you
don't like a long hair you probably
won't like this week because this is
just like some running on a beach type
of hair okay this is like so gorgeous
and I'm just trippin because I feel like
me picking wigs out from Friday night
hair it's kind of like so stressful
because I felt like I feel like I didn't
already did a video on almost all their
wigs so when I came across this one I'm
like what I didn't do a video on it now
it'll be a trip if I did do a video on
this and can't remember but I don't
think I did a video on this so we good
y'all this hair is freaking gorgeous so
when you first get it out the pack of
course the curls are gonna be more
defined and I basically just took my
vent brush and brushed out the curls now
you're all gonna get some shut-in and
you are going to get some tingling the
tingling is just like you don't want to
keep going brushing its head so once you
press it brush it out I feel like that
should be it for you because you're just
gonna disturb the curls and just get it
all fustrated and mint and it's just
gonna tangle up on you and you won't be
mad and frustrated as I was brushing out
the curls it did it was getting tingly
like now you can see just let your know
like I cannot run my fingers through
this um so yeah but I feel like it looks
good so it doesn't matter I'm not
tripping over the tangles as far as
shutting it shed a little bit and that
was after I cut off the least I'm good
like I just love this wig so I don't
care um
that is kind of like its handling up
because it looks great now if you want
your curls to last longer I would
suggest not brushing out the curls and
actually the way the curls came
originally are so freakin beautiful the
curls remind me of like long curls like
if he was to wanna curl your hair that's
what it looked like this is very
lightweight so it is good just in case
you know it gets really hot now probably
wouldn't wear this on a super super hot
day that's just not gonna happen
but I'm definitely gonna slay this week
in the summertime like this summer this
week is coming out so yeah this is what
it looks like you're like this is so
pretty and with the red lips like go you
can't tell me nothing you can't tell me
so of course we're Friday night hair
they don't really give you too much of a
like lace to work with this is the
amount of lace that you get one this
week which I'm not really too bad about
it
I do wish that it was longer but I like
this how this style is part of in the
middle so if you wanted to flip this wig
over you can also do that that looks
really really pretty and also what I'm
thinking I'm gonna do with this wig it's
putting it in a half up half down with
these curls and that style oh my gosh
like that's gonna be so cute yours
it's so many things you can do with this
wig as far as styling um and even if the
week starts getting old or you don't
want it this long you can definitely
just start cutting up and it will still
look nice like y'all you literally have
all of this hair alright guys I didn't
talk show head off but that's it for
this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in the
comment section down below and I will
see in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
