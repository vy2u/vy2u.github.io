baby wiggle - baby wittle baby baby hey
guys so I'm back with a better way
reveal if you hit anything in a back row
I do apologize but it's been real fun
trying to report in a quiet place so I
hope you all can forgive me so yeah so
let's talk about this week you guys
because y'all know how I feel about my
short weeks when I find the right one
and this is the right one so if you all
looking for a little short week for the
summertime girl you might want to check
out this one so this is first off this
was just me from a sister wing so I'll
be excessive eight links in the
description box just in case any of you
guys want to check this legal this is
the sensational buff weight collection
and it is pretty bumped in it's 100%
human hair and this style is Maude
Mohawk and I have it in a color too so
this is what it looks like and I
definitely love the fact that this is
like a true number two so yeah I'm going
to go ahead and answer the clips of how
it looks straight out to pay
No
you
Oh
your I love weeks like this that's like
style I feel like it fits my face really
good this actually reminds me of the sad
fringe when I cut it but it's just like
so perfect I feel like you don't have to
do anything to this wing if you wanted
to wear this weight straight out the
package you could now this is curly not
safe because this is 100% human hand so
if you wanted to curl it you could while
honestly when you get it straight out
the pack you don't even have to Carol is
like I just combed and styled it to my
liking and spraying my face a little bit
y'all know that I love my cyber and
candle darlin
so yeah I just like try to fix it to how
I want to disappear and I just feel like
this type of style just complements my
face well so yeah just do what works for
you but I absolutely love it if I sound
a little different it's because I'm
getting sick y'all so yeah but oh my
gosh
and all of the books collection wigs are
absolutely gorgeous like I feel like
although those weights on this line you
can't go wrong with so yeah if you're
looking for in short human hair wait
that cheap is I don't know what and I
sort of let you a good amount of time I
definitely suggest you go with the
lovely the only thing I can say that a
lot of people might not like most some
of you might not like it the fact that
it does not have combs in the front so
if you feel like you need combs in the
front to secure your wig you're not
going to like this week but you can
always add bobby pins to the front just
to secure it just in case you know you
want extra security now that does have a
comb in the back which I am using and it
also has adjustable strips now you guys
if you have a larger size head this wing
is not going to work for you also don't
even like try it because my head is
small and I don't have my stress
adjusted or anything in this
it's me like so perfect you guys I don't
have no bobby pins and afraid I don't
have nothing and I feel really secure I
feel like this when you stand on my hand
it's not going anywhere if you have a
smaller size head like me this way would
be perfect for you because it's
definitely a nice fit in Smith's
type of wing so I'm just want to turn
around so you guys can see how it looks
well I have not received any shedding
from this way yet no shedding it all but
normally show the ways they do shed but
they're normally good with the shedding
and tingling because of course they're
short so I have not received any
tingling and I have not received any
shedding yet and for those of you who do
not know who is in a full cat came ahead
unit so it doesn't come with any combs
only comes with one comb in a bit and
adjustable stretch this is not like a
lace front wig or least public or
anything like that so it doesn't have
like unleased
part the wigs that it sound more like
this it was like more shorter on the
sides and back and they're longer in the
front I feel like it's my face a little
bit more better even a shorter wave like
the pixie cut ways I like those two but
between those two short style weeks I
really like as far as like how they look
for me and stuff like that so yeah like
this wig is lit like God some I slap him
all myself I got all my summer hair
ready or no lie like I'm about to
unleash it on y'all I'm not even playing
I like to get I mean flipping like I'll
be sleeping a lot y'all but if you're
wondering what's on my lips is honey
child I think that's what it is I'll put
it in the description box but I believe
that's what it is
child Chile Chile Chile child I had that
on my lips and I had my lips tonight was
brown lip liner I always lie my lips
with brown lip liner but yeah and that's
like color talk I'll leave it in the
description box if I remember but if I
don't you got this video as reference
but yeah that was on my list and also
the earrings that I had one because I
know I'm probably going to get a lot of
questions on where I got my earrings
from but actually I got my earrings from
rainbow y'all don't sleep on rainbow
it's kind of tacky a little bit but if
you go in there like I feel like you can
find some stuff in there as you look
especially jewelry the jewelry P papi
I'm not even gonna lie so I don't sleep
on rainbow y'all tell me y'all what kind
of vibes you're getting from this
I don't know I feel like the whole look
is cute and just I don't know I do not
know I'm getting a vibe
no but this hair is definitely list and
it's really really soft yeah I had no
complaints this is like pretty much
perfect oh I didn't want alteration
off-camera and that was cut this side a
little bit because I felt like this
sideburn was a little bit more longer
than this side burn but yeah I just took
my races home I raised the comb and kind
of like shortened it like cut it just a
little bit and I felt like it's
definitely much better so that's it for
