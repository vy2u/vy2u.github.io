with another video for you guys and I
promise you guys that I'm going to be
bringing you new content so this will be
a haul video and this haul is sponsored
by Ike a house Ark a house was kind
enough to send me some of their products
from their website to share with you
guys mind you are already shop off of
arcade house and I would recommend this
site anyway so I will leave arcade house
website and the links um in my
description box if anybody is interested
um so yeah let's just get into this
video and before I get started if
anybody is wondering what's on my head
it is our trade I meant I'm Trey it is
free trust equal follow me and I do have
a video up on this hand so um if you
want to check it out I'll make sure I
leave the link to this head in my
description box okay now I have like a
variety of things
um it's not just one set thing like one
set product um I have like um makeup
products and skin products and like
nails I wanted to show you a variety
just so you can get a feel of what they
sell basically is kind of like a one
line beauty supply store I mean they
don't without selling the hair they sell
all the knickknacks and my B ish stuff
basically um I really love arcade house
for their lashes um and also their cheap
lipstick so yeah I'm going to start with
face products first and basically like I
just got some mess because I'm like
really into my skin a lot lately because
I've been breaking out like crazy so I
did pick up some face masks and I have
one two three six
seven eight so I do have eight face
masks and basically they look like this
why do have different brands or whatever
come on ball tomorrow's profiles or some
huh so like of course when I was reading
all of them I was like oh I needed so I
wanted up getting everyone because I
felt like I needed all of them for my
face I don't know I'm kind of a type of
person where I just can't have one or
something I got a head like all of them
so yeah I thought that was really neat
so I cannot wait to try these out I also
got these revitalizing cooling pads for
your eyes look at that y'all tell me
that's not cute so you can put these in
a refrigerator and basically I missus
insta cooling and Susan leave pads on
for 10 to 15 minutes and remove so yeah
I definitely can't wait to try these out
and next I got these firming under-eye
hydro gels and yes is a revitalized
plumps Titans and refreshing refreshing
hydration so yeah I do have like slight
bags under my eyes and they're worse
when I wake up so yeah or if I'm like
extra tired so I want to see if these
work to reduce my puffiness and that's
what these look like which I think are
super super nice so now we're going to
move on to lashes so lately I've been
getting a lot of questions on what
lashes I'm wearing and I happen to be
when the 702 lashes and almost like all
my videos lately have been me when these
lashes your these are like my favorite
lashes and they're only a dollar what a
dollar you can't be dead so yeah
if you like this alarm perfect 615 lands
these are the dupes for them they are
exactly the same flash so I got eight of
these lashes which are 702 I'm an in a
brand our King house I really really
loved their lashes and then I saw that
cream lashes head on 7:02 lashes as well
so I got five of those just because I
mean I wanted to see I wanted to see I
don't know I just like the way they are
and I wanted to try them in a different
a different brand basically but these
ones are 149 and these ones are a dollar
so I would suggest just sticking with
the arcade house lashes but I just want
to be extra and try different brand just
to see and I also got Ike a house lashes
in DW I guess that's the style and he
just looked like wispy lashes and I got
five of these so that's all the lashes
that I got because um I already had
purchased some lashes from Ike a house
not too long ago so I was kind of
already stocked up a little bit so yeah
I didn't get too many lashes because I
didn't want to I just wanted more
variety in this whole cuz I know y'all
just don't want to see all lashes city
different and so next I got the Ardell
last grip and this is for your strip
lashes and it's just in a color dark so
yeah that's all the eye products that I
had and then I'll move on to nail
polishes and I get some nail polishes
and these nail polishes all by um NK I
guess there's meat decay and of course
you know these nail polishes are only a
dollar and I have so many of these and
it's hard because most of the time when
I pick out nail polishes and I get home
I it's like the same like I picked out
the same nail polishes for some reason
so I try to be a little bit different
and gay
is that I know I don't have but honestly
I had this color already this blue color
let me take it out for you guys
something so I have like this blue color
already which is really cute and this is
in blue set fire and then I have this
just regular black nail polish because I
don't own any black nail polish I don't
even really wear my nails black eye
women like a dark dark burgundy color
but never black um then I have this
gremlin and grin but I feel like I have
a color similar to this in OPI brand but
I don't know and then I really don't
wear orange nail polish but I felt like
I wanted to try some orange nails so I
got this color orange right here I
thought that was really cute and then I
just got a regular clear because you
know you can't have too much clear nail
polish of course and then next I got
these little la colored nail duets and I
just thought that was so freakin cute I
only got him for the glitter parts and
these were only a dollar I was like what
I wasn't expecting them to be this
little dough to be honest with you I
don't know why I just was expecting them
to be bigger but I mean that's fine and
then you just take it out like this and
I cuz that was so freakin cute so next I
got this I don't even know what it's
called but it's basically let me show
you all first because I'm excited cuz
I've been wanting one of these for a
while and seeing a lot of people who
have these but basically it's like a
quick way to clean your brushes without
having to wash your brushes so basically
you just swivel your brush inside if I
can open it up
come on oh really they don't want me
open it like come window okay this is
getting embarrassing I'm here to turn
off this camera as the five years okay
so this is what the inside looks like
and kind of like a brillo pad if you ask
me and this is just something that was
in the middle but yeah it kinda is a
little bit softer than a brillo pad but
that's what it looks like and you just
will be your brushes in here and um and
it just removes all the eyeshadow color
and then like if you want to say you
want to use the same brush um you can
like xeu finish using one color you can
take it and brush it in here and it'll
clean off all eyeshadow and then you can
pick up the next color in use it and the
rest of the products that I got were lip
products so anyway we want to start off
with these what is this Nick okay and I
already own some of these and I like
them so much so I wanted to get more in
different colors so so I did pick up
five of these Nikkei lipsticks and these
are really good quality and they go on
so smooth and creamy where you don't
have to keep on layering up your lips
just to get the color pigmentation or
the color payoff so that's why I really
like these I do recommend these if you
don't already have them or you haven't
tried them I definitely think you should
try them out now they're not like a true
Matt met like your liquid lipstick Metz
um I find that lipsticks are not a true
Matt versus the liquid lipsticks of
course but yeah I definitely love these
I'm a swatch one just so y'all can see
what the color looks like and this color
is coconut and that's what it looks like
and just gonna swatch it on my hand
for you guys look at it back right and
I'll first cross our love coming up
Rangoon oh but last time
next I have these lip glosses by
Nanticoke oh I believe they are
pronounced and yeah I didn't really
think that these will popular I never
even heard of these lip glosses before
and then when I got a mini mail
something just was like research them so
I researched them and I found actually a
lot of videos on these lip glosses but
they were from so long ago um so I guess
they was popping like back then um but I
guess they not happy now but they pop
into me honey
so yeah I just got like some nudie and
brown colors and these don't really oh
that you have a name so I got it in
France right
okay I think I'll be coming so I picked
up two of the Nikkei matte lipsticks as
well and I do also own these lipsticks
as well and I wanted to get more colors
because I do really like these lipsticks
so I have it in the color I don't even
think these have a number on it I mean
they have numbers on it so this one is
22 and 23 they don't come with names at
least I don't think no they do so this
is new brick and I have pink nude so I'm
going to swatch new brick just so you
can see so this is what it looks like
and this color is so freakin pretty
that's the color right here look at that
and like I said they're creamy and the
pigmentation one of these lipsticks are
crazy like they look like some nice
quality
lipsticks which are really really nice
so then next your creepy but next I got
um what are these these are the amuse I
think I guess that's how you say a moose
or muse and it's the long-lasting lip
clutter lip lip what did I say these are
long lasting lip colors so yeah this is
what it looks like y'all I don't know if
y'all can see that but it looks like a
lipstick but it's actually not it's
actually mark had just one up but I will
try or open this one so it's actually a
lip gloss and I wasn't sure about these
these were only a dollar
um as well I wasn't really sure about
these because I didn't know if it was
like just a regular liquid lipstick or
was it like a liquid lipstick that turns
mad so I lucked up and it actually is a
liquid lipstick that's mad so I was like
yes and I got all of I got all of the
colors so I was like yes I'm glad I got
all the colors and I thought that these
were so cute because I'm just a sucker
for packaging I love the packaging
because it actually like it looks like a
short enough like lipstick but it's
actually not so I'm just going to swatch
this one now the only complaint that I
have with this one is whoa they were
only a dollar but you are going to have
to layer on these liquid lipsticks up
because they do go on streaky I know for
this color because this is the only
color that i swatched so then my biggest
fan you guys that I'm just like so proud
of myself about is the
these liquid lipsticks and these are the
niekirk a 24-hour lip color and so I got
seven of these in a Med I didn't get all
of the colors like instead of getting
all the colors and the other liquid
lipsticks that I showed you I should
have got all the colors in here but
these what one the more expensive side
will not expenses but they was like
$2.99
I believe they were $2.99 so yeah the
packaging is really nice and basically
it comes with a a primer a lip primer
and then on the other side is their
matte liquid lipstick I'm just going to
a swatch one for you and this is in the
color eggplant and the other liquid
lipsticks that I just showed you and let
this goes on so freakin creamy all like
look how creamy it is look at that and
that's eggplant oops that's a plant
right there and then I'll read off the
rest the other liquid lipsticks that I
just now showed you they don't come with
the name at least I don't think yeah
these ones don't come with a name so I
wouldn't be able to tell you what name
it is but sergeant I'll tell the boys I
promise long time little girl right well
with her and Mandy oh and the only kind
that I do have about these is the fact
that the tops come off of the little lip
primer things they kind of come off a
bit um not all of them came off but a
couple and you just gotta keep on
putting them back on so that's the only
thing I wish that the cap was more
secure and last but not least I got some
concealers because if you did not know I
am a concealer junkie as you know
everybody is familiar with the LA girl
Pro concealer but they recently came out
with the knobby um what are these they
are then knobby or Nabi I don't know how
to
pronounce them but it's in a bi Nabi um
concealers in their package exactly like
the LA girl Pro concealer and it says
all-in-one concealer with the brush and
when I say it looks exactly like the LA
girl Pro concealer only difference is
the price they now when la girl Pro
concealer is came out there used to be
$1.99 but now on I can't house they are
$2.99 and these are $1.99 so I was like
I want to try it out to see if it's
anything like the LA girl Pro concealer
so I did in y'all this stuff is exactly
the same it's a little bit thinner
that's the only difference this is a
little bit thinner and I have the color
yellow and I have it in the color sand
but I will say if you're not a fan of
the LA girl Pro conceal is because you
feel like it's too thick this will be a
good alternative because it's really
good coverage it's really lightweight
and it's not that thick but they're
basically the same concealer if you ask
me in the knobby ones is a dollar
cheaper so you guys that was it for this
video I'm also a thumbs up this video if
you like these type of videos as well
and feel free to leave all your comments
in my comment section again I will leave
a Kate house link in my description box
and they do have a twelve percent off
coupon code and I also leave that in my
description box as well so yeah I hope
