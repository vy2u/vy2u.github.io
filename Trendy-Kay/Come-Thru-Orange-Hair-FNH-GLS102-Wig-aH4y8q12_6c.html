abandoned and can I know I don't matter
yeah but I know I had to have it in for
the money in my status I mean you said I
got that just running 20 bedrooms
yeah if they didn't run my version
everyone water hey guys so I'm back with
a another week review yes so this week
was this to me from a frightening hand
so I'll miss y'all leave all Friday
night head links in the description box
so the way I have one is the GLS 102 and
I had it in a color TT 2714 which is
basically like orange colors that's
basically what it is is like it's orange
so yeah it does have the dark roots
which I really like but keep in mind
that the doublers is only where the
laces and then everything else is just
this one solid color in the back so if
you're not really a fan today I wouldn't
suggest this week also if you had a
bigger size page I wouldn't suggest this
week only because I have a really small
head and this way it fits snug on me um
I do have my stress adjusted to it Titus
and before I even adjusted the strength
the wig was still like nicely fit on my
head still fit my head really good so
yeah keep that in mind but this is what
the wig looks like and it's absolutely
gorgeous the color is really nice um
this is a longer unit it's like really
long it comes like all the way to my
list so I'm thinking about cutting it
because I'm just not feeling it being
super long so yeah I might just cut it
to like right here um but before I cut
it I just wanted to show you guys what
this week looks like and everything like
that so yeah I did leave a little bit of
my hair in the front right here they do
give you around with two inches or
Felice in the front are you so we
so if you're not familiar with Friday
night here in their construction I'm in
the construction of their wigs they give
you two cones in a fryer come right here
a comer here they give you a comb in the
back and it also gives you a decibel
strip so yes as far as tingling and
shutting I have received a little bit of
tangling and a little bit of shedding
I received most of my shedding after I
cut off the lace and it's far as
tingling like your night I mean that's
crazy to think that you're not going to
get tingling with this week because it
is so long like this is a lot of hair
the thickness is really nice it is a
really nice density and it is not Yankee
it's on the silky side so yeah but my
hair it doesn't get tangled towards the
end part I can't really run my hand
through without any snakes so yeah I'm
just going to go ahead and it cut off
the bottom and then I'll come back and
show you guys what it looks like so you
guys like that and this is the end
result and I just cut it to right here
which I think it's just way more better
and more comfortable and less tangling
because that weight was just like way
too long even though sometimes I love my
longer hair but today we just map today
today so yeah I did cut it in as you can
see nothing changed as far as like the
curl pattern or anything like that it
still remains the same and I just think
that this wig is really really gorgeous
so yes you guys look at said this wig is
really really pretty I'm not sure if
this comes in a natural color but
everything will be in my description box
if you guys are interested in this week
I'll definitely leave link so you guys
can go and purchase this week but yes I
definitely love how it turns out after I
cut it so yeah yeah let me know what you
think you guys like it before
do you like it
we're old you like how it looks now I
feel like the wig looks very short of
two bins though this is such a bold
color
I feel like heaven long hair heaviness
weight along one type of it being a bold
color already which is too much for me
so I definitely think it looks much
better
so yeah I'm sorry this is going to be a
pretty quick video but I have really
nothing to say about this week so yeah
if you have any questions feel free to
leave it down below and I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
