review and this week and this week was
sent to me from elevate South so I'll
make sure I leave oh elevates tiles
links in the description box just in
case you guys like this wig or want to
check out some of the other ways we have
available on it website so yeah this
week they sent me is uh as the brown
sugar glue this lace in the hairstyle
mix of course this is not human hair it
just has some human hair mixed with
synthetic fibers so basically it just
mixed the hair I guess feel like human
hair if you will I don't know but um
yeah it's definitely not human hair I
had it in a style BSG 201 Chelsea and I
have it in the color sr2 cotton pink so
lately I've been really instilling the
pink a wig I don't know this because you
know spring is here and summer is
approaching but pink and blue and that's
gonna be like my thing for spring in
some of y'all so if I am reviewing a lot
of pink reefs just bear with me it's
only because I'm loving the color but if
you're not crazy about this color you
might just like the wig so let's look
past the color if you don't like the
color um my personal thoughts on this
week is I don't like the weight at all
that's why it took me so long to film it
even though I really really love the
color so I did a little tweaking because
as you can see this looks nothing like
how to model in it and I am going to
assure you guys how I got this look so
okay guys this is what the packaging
looks like and I just have my hair
braided down really flat this is what
the weight looks like and it comes with
soft lace and it's very flexible and
this has three-way clips in the back to
wig homes in the front and it has that
little adjustable strap but not really
it looks really sophisticated yo it's
not like your regular
Everage synthetic wig cap construction
so yeah I really like that now that was
what the way it looks like what this
thing want to say so imma try to you
know stay with the flow but yeah now I'm
just cutting off the lace and everything
you guys and I must say I don't really
hate hate this week like that I'm you
guys effort it took me until like just
now to really appreciate this week now
you guys I'm just putting the wig on X
I'll cut off the lace and everything
like that and I did end up cutting baby
hairs into this way this is what the
weight looks like out really wasn't a
fan I tried it on before I did this and
then took it off so that's why it's kind
of like tingly like that but it's not
really is tingly as it looks and as far
as shutting it douche it a little bit
but the shedding in tingling is not bad
at all and these are the baby heads that
are cut in this week
I felt like I needed some baby heads
just like spices wake up because it was
looking so dry but I will say the color
on this unit is so long so again now I'm
just going to take my back to be glued
back to whatever is called and I'm using
that to tame my baby has first off I'm
just going to tell y'all I should smack
myself because first of all is just too
much baby he is going one and then
what's this got to be glue gel a heart
and sofa so after I did my baby hairs
like I couldn't even correct it because
they were stuck to my head like this was
a disaster
I did cut them down because they were
too long but I didn't show that on
camera but I eventually cut them down
because this oh my god I'm so many to
myself I don't even like watching this
because it just makes me cringe
I just wasn't on my issue when it came
to lay my baby head I mean it's okay
whatever
so yeah I'm trying to fix it but yeah I
do eventually cut it or whatever
so now I just did the flip over method
and it works best for this hair and it
just made this whole wig come alive by
just flipping all the hair over and I
will say that this week is a bit on the
shiny side so you could add some dry dry
shampoo or powder so this is what the
way it looks like all the way around and
this week does not have dark roots all
the way around which is has dark roots
in the front and also this way is then
in the back and from it not having dark
roots
it kind of just fell out so I did play
around with this hair and I feel like
once you work with it as many things
that you can do with this hair and I did
the half up half down I'm a half up half
down yeah I think that's how you call it
whatever so yeah it turned out really
cute like I said it took me a while to
get used to it but I like switched it up
and all of that in wood all day I don't
really hate this wig as much but the
style was just a little bit off of me
but I mean though the wig itself is
really good just in case anybody was
interested so yeah so guys into this
video if you have any questions feel
free to leave it in the comment section
down below again this week it's from
elevate style so I will leave the links
in the description box and yes I hope
