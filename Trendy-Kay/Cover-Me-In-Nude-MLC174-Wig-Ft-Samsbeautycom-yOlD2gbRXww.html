show you
you got a Russian being another
song
hola inside already special nights but
we should just run in the car won't you
let me in it imma get you switching
different positions that I was hey guys
so I'm back with a another wig review
and I'm really excited about this week
review because this freakin wig is so
bomb like its lead I can't even lie life
has been discovered no but Cersei um I
would sit this week from so this is the
new born free magic lace curved part
magic lace front wig yeah it's finally
born free the item number is mlc one
seven four and the color is a dxy 4/6 13
basically is the duck root and then the
platinum blonde okay so let me tell you
guys about this unit um so first off the
construction of this unit I really don't
like that's the only downfall when it
comes to this week um because if you
have a smaller size hit like me this wig
will fit you extra beyond there are no
other combs besides the one right here
and the one in the back so altogether
they give you two combs and they give
you adjust Abul strengths like more of a
natural shine to this wig which I like
so it doesn't look play sticky or fake
at all like this week is the bomb I did
nothing to this wig at all I didn't cut
it
I didn't flat on it I didn't go
straighten it because I know people be
laughing when I say flat did go in and
pluck a few hairs out but if you're lazy
and you don't really like dealing with
plucking out your parts then you can get
away with not plucking out the part and
just add your concealer or finishing
powder to your party I just plucked a
few
oh and I added a little bit of finishing
powder and ended I promised y'all when I
was adding concealer into my putt that
not concealable finishing powder into my
putt that it wasn't this light but
apparently is showing up extra light but
don't fear I did not walk up the house
like this because that would just be a
mess but yes so don't try come for my
life y'all all right I love you bulls
okay you guys so I forgot to mention
tangling and shedding when it comes to
this week so basically I have not
received any tangles from this unit like
I can run my fingers to it and it's like
butter I swear to you and then as far as
shut-in I did receive a few strands of
hair but it wasn't all crazy and out of
control
and yes I did forget to turn all the way
around so you guys can see like a 360 of
this week job when I got this wig um the
roots were like a brownish color and
then it went to the 613 color but I
didn't like that the dog was like brown
so I took my um I took my mascara and I
just dug it up the roots a little bit so
cuz I don't know I just like black roots
abettor i just want you all to see this
cut it looks so nice like look all this
goodness y'all y'all cannot deny this
most of you guys should already know
about this week and I know I'm late
hopping on the bandwagon but you know it
be like that sometimes but for those of
you who don't know about this week
this is where I come in it because I'm
going to let you know right now that you
need to go get this wig this wig is bone
do you see this week so that's it for
this video if you guys have any
questions about
this week or just anything I'm feel free
to leave it in the comment section down
below and yes I will see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
