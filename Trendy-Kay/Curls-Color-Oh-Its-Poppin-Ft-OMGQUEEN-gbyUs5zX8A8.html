with a another video so this video is
going to be on this hair and this hair
was sent to me from omg clean hair so
I'll go ahead and leave all the links in
the description box just in case any of
you guys are interested in this week
that I'm wearing okay so we're just
gonna hop straight into this video I
don't want this to be long and draped
out so yeah also this wig is kind of on
the pricey side so if you're not
interested you can just leave this video
but if you are or if you just love
watching me then yeah just keep on
watching so this week that I'm wearing
is their Indian version hair and it is a
lace front wig so the style is deep
weave the hair length is 20 inches the
hair density is 130 cap construction is
basically a glueless cap so you don't
have to like do any extra steps to try
to get your lace to lay down I'm also
this week did come with baby hairs let
me see bleach nASA says bleach nuts yes
which I don't really think that the
knots wore a bleach they didn't really
look like it to me as far as the
hairline is pre plucked which I feel
like the hairline really was plucked
because I did not do anything extra to
the hairline so yeah I didn't even
bleach the nuts on this hair I just left
it as is I felt like it looked you know
natural so I just left it the way it was
the color of this wig was a natural
color and I did go ahead and bleach this
head because of course I wanted to see
how it will bleach basically after
bleaching this head this is how it came
out now this is how the curl pattern
look which I feel like it didn't really
lose its curl texture I still like the
way it looks
I'm stuttering I still like the way it
looks the curls did become a little
looser but I still overall like the look
of this so this is the hair and it's
natural state after it's been edge ride
and yeah of course like some of the
curls are gone right here because I've
been messing with this and one of my
fingers through the hair the bottom part
is basically how the curls are and I
really like it's how I achieved this
color is I bleached the hair with like
the b/w bleach like the regular powder
bleach and I use 40 volume developer I
left the hair I mean I left the bleach
on the head and so like it got like
blonde so depending on what color like
depending on how light you want your
blonde to be is when you know when to
rinse it off so yeah basically I left
this on for about 15 minutes and the
crack was smoking a soul my show like it
heated up so much that I thought that I
was gonna damage his hair but I actually
didn't get damaged and yeah I'm really
proud of myself so the colors that I
used to achieve this color is and I
didn't go to the store I literally like
I didn't feel like it I literally looked
at what I had in the house and yeah I
just scraped some colors and mix them
all together and this is the color that
it came out to be and I think this is
more like a pink magenta type of color I
don't know if it's like really showing
up true to color on camera but yeah in
camera it kind of looks a little red but
it is kind of red but still it looks
more pink than red so the first color I
used is intense red and it was like I
have about a left of this and then I use
Fiesta fuchsia and these two about a
door and then I found this and this is
by Clara professionals is the jazzing
and I got this in a future plum and I
mixed all three of these together and
this is the color that it came out so
yeah I really wanted something red but
this is actually I really like how this
turned out so yeah as far as like how
the hair is holding up basically
I bleached the hair um no let me start
from the beginning so when I did receive
this hair it was really nice like the
curls and everything was popping but I
wanted to see how the curls look you
know if there's been washing everything
so the clip I'm about to show you is
what the hair looks like after it's been
a wash and the curls were so freaking
beautiful so yeah that's what it looks
like after it's been washed so after I
wash the hair I did not receive any
shut-in after I bleached the head and
rinsed it out and it did shed a little
bit but still it wasn't a lot of
shedding and I didn't get I didn't get
any tingling after I bleached hair I did
go ahead I did go in and deep condition
the hair so yeah I'm after the heads
been bleached like it does still feel a
little bit like dry but it looks healthy
um it does get a little snakey but don't
get a lot of tingles but snakes like I
definitely get snakes but oh no you can
still run your hands through this hair
and yeah this is what the hair is
looking like like I said I didn't bleach
the knots and I did not pluck the hair
line this is just what it looks like
sorry you can kind of see my stocking
cap for you so yeah this video is not
going to be too long but if you are
interested in this hair definitely check
out the description box this head is
holding up beautifully I freaking love
this hair it looks so super natural
which I really really like now I don't
want to make this video like extra dry
but I feel like I want to do something
to the head but I don't want to do too
much because I actually like how this
looks and how yeah I just like how it
looks and looks
like Messi like a beachy type look which
I really really like but I feel like I
want to add some braids in this hair so
that's what i'ma do just because just
because I'm freaking extra yo so yeah
I'm just going to add some breeds to
this hair just to give it a little
pizzazz
I feel like you can't really see this
one but you know it's fun so this is the
hair you guys and yeah I think that it's
cute
