but you're doing something hey guys it's
Kate of course and I'm back with another
video so this video is gonna be on this
week and this week was since me affirm
Salmons beauty so I'll go ahead and
leave all the links in the description
box just in case if you guys aren't
interested in this week I'm wearing and
so the wig I'm wearing is by Harlan one
two five
I don't really think that I don't really
mess with Harlan one to five wigs but
they actually are coming out with some
great wig so check them out just in case
you know you've been overlooking holla
one to Fox cuz they really are they
really are starting to you know come up
on their weight game so dishes by Harlan
once you file this is the Swiss lace wig
I have it in the style LSD 91 this is
the six-inch deep part and it says extra
long 42 inches and I also have this in a
color number one okay so before I start
let me just give you a backstory on this
way so I purchased this wig when it
first came out and I loved it so much
literally your this is one of my
favorite wigs or favorite current wigs
I'm thinking about doing a whole video
on my current favorites if you would
like a video on it one oh my
you know current favorite wigs leave it
in the comment section down below and
I'll definitely get that video out to
you guys so anyway I like this wig so
much that when Sam's Beauty wanted me to
do a video on one of their another one
of their wigs I decided to choose this
one again simply because it's another
way that I like and I get to keep it and
I wanted to do a giveaway or this week
so we are collaborating for a giveaway
for two lucky one is to win this weight
so stay tuned at the end for details on
the giveaway y'all if you recognize how
I am so in love with this hair I've got
a video on some version
I think it was by Annie and about if I'm
not mistaken and it was long it was like
26 or 28 inches and it was really long
and it kind of reminds you of this type
of wave pattern going on but I feel like
that wig looks exactly like this week so
if you did watch that video and like
that hair this is a great dupe for that
week that I mean let's just start off by
saying this is a big hint from the Union
Union this is a big hint from the wig so
if you do have a bigger sized head this
way is going to love you because this
week is really big if you have a smaller
head like me bobby pins are going to be
your best friend because I legit have so
many bobby pins holding this week secure
because it's that big but I love it so
much so I don't even care I'm going to
utilize the bobby pins to text your
segue down so yeah this week is the
kid-friendly this also comes with a lace
part so if I meant not next part but I
made a dent in this part but it also
comes with lace that you have to cut off
and let me just show you guys the
tension and I don't think I did so this
is what it looks like and it is a lace
front wig so of course it comes with
lace on the perimeter that you have to
cut off it also comes with a this part
in the middle this is a middle part wig
if you wanted to if you wanted to wear
the part when the side you definitely
can just switch it like let's go bright
and it will be fun as a side part but
yeah this is how long the part in spaces
and it's really really good now I would
say you have to go in and pluck the part
and our endpoint wrinkle here insert
Clips it's not going to be a mere and
the way it's actually going to be my
sister because we had
a video that we was going to do together
and I was featuring this week in the
video but it didn't turn out right but
she's actually wearing the color 1b this
week comes in three colors a blond color
without duck fruit just a straight-up
six thirteen color it comes in a 1 and a
1 B and those are the three colors that
this week comes in I wish that it had
more color variety but I mean it's cool
but the clip that you're saying now
she's actually went 1b and if you're
taller ladies you'll definitely see you
weigh this week will hit you and it
still will be so long my sister is 510
and this is what the weight looks like
straight out of the package on her the
only thing I did was pluck the part and
created some baby hands which I actually
think this week also comes with a little
bit of baby hairs in the front of the
week so yeah that's what it looks like
and yeah it's a super super long so of
course I'm Way shorter than my sister so
I had to cut off the end and just in
country that like all of their hair like
you definitely can cut the bottom just a
little bit and I cut off quite a lot and
I can see it's still very very low
looming this week is over there because
I had them lenses and I just want to
show you how the week look at that it's
been worn a few times this wig has been
warned about four times and it still
looks good
mind you I do get shedding and tangling
from this week this is a longer unit
straight out the pack and started to
tangle up a little bit but I feel like
if you don't really mess with it as much
then you'll be fine so I don't really do
too much like these are the curls with
owl-like I didn't do anything to the
hair when I put it on I just let it be
because I love the way the curls look
and after wearing it for a while with
our brushing or
or doing anything I might like finger
comb did a few times but this is how it
will end up looking as you can see like
I can't really run my hands through
anything like that but I don't really
care like it still looks so good as you
weigh more this week it looks like it
gets like thicker I don't know like when
you first get it it's kind of like the
density is when a chin size is not
really thin it's like a perfect density
but as you wear it the wig gets more
fuller and I don't know it just looks
really really natural to me like some
virgin hair so I just like to put this
to the back because this is a lot of
hair you guys and it is a very high I
freakin love this wig look how flat it
leaves and everything this wig is truly
truly doing so as you can see it's down
all the way to my butt and like it just
looks so freakin realistic in just this
wig is everything to me you guys it's
not really much to say about this wig is
perfect in my eyes I know that it's
still like it doesn't really shade that
much but tingling that's gonna be your
main problem with this week but me
honestly I wouldn't really do nothing to
this week I would just wear it honestly
and like pluck the part of course and
you know fix a little baby hairs if
you're into that but it's really nothing
that you need to do to this week I hope
it's not missing anything the shine on a
wig is fine it looks like a natural type
of shine so yeah if you wanted to a dry
shampoo or baby powder you could</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
