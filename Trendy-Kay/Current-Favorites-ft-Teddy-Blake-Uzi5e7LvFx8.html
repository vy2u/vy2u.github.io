it cool
yeah hey guys I'm back with another
video and this conference video is going
to be a little different because it's
going to be my favs video well for the
month of February which February just
passed and now we're in March and I just
felt like being extra so I'm being extra
for this video because you know people
do it all the time they get dressed up
just for the cameras yes I like it
though I feel like it's so fun and you
know Esther's in yes
so anyway Oh everything will be linked
in the description box and I will have
links to everything just in case you
know you want to make this yes babe as
well so yes that vacuum cleaner is going
to irritate me but you know don't mind
it the first thing that we're going to
start off with is this purse and this is
from a Teddy blink and I was this is
what I fell in love with this purse oh
my goodness is so small a cute so most
of you might be familiar with Teddy
blink because it's thousands of reviews
on this brand this bag is light honey I
just think I got it I fell in love with
it I just feel like it's so different
and it's just so small yeah I feel like
this is just perfect for my type of
style at the moment so yes and the strap
is really really nice it's all where you
want it to be in if you're taller you
can definitely adjust your strips and
have it hang longer if you want to and
this is a real suede loving so this is
what it looks like and it is really
small I've seen a thousand of reviews on
this brand and all the purses was
basically
so everybody got the same purse I have
not yet to receipt
I have not yet to see a review on this
back right here so I was like this is
really really cute
in fact that nobody took the time to
like get this I guess there was a
feeling that but I'm definitely loving
this even though the price is still like
updated price is in the hundreds but I
definitely think that it's worth it
because the quality is really really
good and yes I would recommend this
company I will definitely leave the link
to that purse in my description box in
case you guys want to check that out
if you don't know I'm so obsessed with
perfumes and I just love to smell good
and that's just like my thing so this is
Coco Mademoiselle by Chanel and oh my
gosh I'm not really a fan of Chanel
perfume I just found them to be I just
find them to be a little bit like
overbearing and strong in my opinion as
the couples that I do like don't get me
wrong but this one is my favorite and
I'm not really like a perfume type of
specialist or it's really good with like
the notes just trust me when I tell you
I have like a good sense of smells I
don't know if that even sounds right but
I'm really good when it comes to my
parents and like I always get
compliments on this this one and it
smells so good and they really just go
with my body chemistry like is really
really amazing
yes it's like Roman sexy I'm more of
like a sweet type of girl but I love
sweet smells but this one is kind of
like on its peach side but it's just
like a groan like when your man walks in
the door he just want to come all over
you like bestest person right here so
I'm pretty good since we are talking
about a perfume my next all the time
favorites for this month because I just
had so many persons like I always switch
out but this is why so month petty yes
and
I love this perfume this glib y'all and
y'all have not smelled this perfume
y'all need to try it is on like a sweet
side but it's still like it's so like
sweet in my instance oh my goodness it
smells so good you guys but I can't
really tell you like what it smells like
I just can tell you that it smells good
and if you have not heard it
y'all need to smelled it so go to you
like your locals
I think they saw this before I know they
tell us and also since I got this from
awesome I will leave links to this
person just in case you want to get it
but I don't know I'm a little iffy on
purchase like I have to go smell them
first before I you know I am I had to
well I have oil perfumes that I just
looked up and order them offline without
smelling them and just read the reviews
and I ended up really liking them so
that's like a 50/50 but yeah this is the
wise now Mon petit and I love this
person so much it'd be happen so so next
to Hollis

jean jacket and it's distress and you
