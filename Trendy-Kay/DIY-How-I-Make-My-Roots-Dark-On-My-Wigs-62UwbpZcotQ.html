video just to show you guys how I duck
in my roots
on my own stream Wade so this is
basically my outcome of me darkening the
roots um to my extreme wig so I know a
lot of people were interested in seeing
how I am you know dunking my roots and
yeah so this is basically what it looks
like and then at the end of the video
I'll just put a clip up of me showing
you guys how I duck in the roots but
this is what it looks like and you guys
know you guys know that I wear the part
to the middle but I did also darken the
roots on the side so if you want it to
wear
yeah if you wanted to wait a hair to the
side you can definitely do that
so yes you guys this is my outcome hope
you enjoy this video you guys and I will
see you next time bye okay guys now I'm
applying my wig to my foam head and you
can purchase these foam heads at your
local beauty supply store so I went
ahead and purchased some spray colored
spray from my local beauty supply store
as well and now I'm taking a card to
cover up the part and it really doesn't
matter what you use as long as you know
it's something that you don't need so
I'm just spraying one side of my wig to
give me a darker vert and then I will do
the opposite side and I will tell you
guys that you're going to need gloves
because this is like really messy so
that's what it looks like and then now
I'm taking it throughout the front of my
wig and I'm only spraying this in places
that I want people to see the darker
route I'm not doing this all over you
guys so that's what it looks like and
now I'm going to take my ELF pencil or
like a marker and I'm just coloring in
all the spots that the spray did not get
so I hope you guys enjoy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
