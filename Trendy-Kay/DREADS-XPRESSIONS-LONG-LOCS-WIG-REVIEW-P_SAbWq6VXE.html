by lace front because it's a lace front
lace front wig expressions maybe is from
expressions so this style is called long
locks and I have it in a color number
two so you guys let's get into this
video because I haven't like to talk
about okay so if some of you have been
following me for a while I did a while
ago post a video and did a review on a
unit that I had and I hated the unit and
it was supposed to be box braids so yeah
my experience with that was not very
pleasant and I was very skeptical on
whether or not I wanted to get this unit
but this unit was only forty-one dollars
so I was like I wouldn't really be
taking a loss on because the other unit
that I purchased was like seventy
something dollars and I was pissed about
that unit but um this one was only like
forty dollars so I was like okay let me
get this unit because I don't really
mind explosion on forty dollars because
I might just like it so yes I did
purchase this wig from wig types that
calm and I will leave the link and
everything in my description box to this
unit also wrong
I think this unit is really cute but it
does have some things that I do not like
so much this unit has two combs in the
front area and it has a comb in the back
with the adjustable stress now this is a
lace front unit but there is no lease
it's just lace that I had to cut off
basically you might as well say this
half-wit basically because it's no lace
you cannot part this anywhere you don't
even see the lace so yeah that's another
thing about this unit is when you
receive this unit it is pretty thin in
the back and in the front is where most
of the hair is um it is puffy up in this
part which I don't really care for um
but I mean it's not it's not that bad
now in the top area I feel like they do
look like dreads like they didn't master
it it looks like as if like you got your
head right like it looks like dress and
it looks like you're taking Plex out
like braids no should know how you
freshly get your hand retwist it and
then they braid it for you and you take
it out this is what it looks like so I
feel like I'm very pleased with how they
did they did this um as far as the ends
I'm not really pleased about because I
mean dreads don't really look like this
one and it looks like you can like take
it apart um but again it doesn't really
bother me that bed um
this does have it ear lace
and it comes like all the way down um to
your ear so I do appreciate that just in
case you wanted to put it up um right
now I just have my baby hairs out and
that's it but like I was saying um it's
definitely a lot of hair towards the
front area and then when you get to the
back area is
very thin um I think if I was gonna say
oh now what I really really really
really really really really really
really hate about this unit is the fact
that let me turn this vo so you can see
now like it's like real like empty back
head like where is the rest of the dress
and then they had like these short
pieces to make up for it like this is
crazy like I don't I don't like that
that's not going to work for me like so
you have to like position but basically
you have to bring most of these back so
it will cover it up otherwise if you
have it going all towards the front area
like you can see all of this and this is
this is tacky to me like that's that's a
no-no I really do not like that or I
don't know what they were thinking maybe
they just got lazy on making a unit it
was like okay we won't put some short
pieces of track right here to make up
for it no like that's ugly so yeah
that's a big problem for me I really
don't like it I feel like it's so nice
and full in a front and then we get to
the baggage just like hello like where
do I see a dress it's like it's kind of
crazy to me but it is many things that
you can do with this unit I always
wanted some dreads but I'm not that bold
to dread my hair so yeah this will do um
I need to find a way to make this part
not as bulky because it's like a lot a
lot a lot of hair like up in the top huh
and it's just so bulky
um but yeah and the fact that you don't
have a lace pardon so it doesn't really
look like freshly done dreads maybe you
can get away with like you have dreads
and you just never got them retwist it
in the roots of growing out that's kind
of the field that it's given me like
grown out dread tight looks this week is
pretty long I would say stretched out
it's probably about 24 inches but yeah
just look at that light that's really
cute but if you can find ways to do
certain things with it without this back
showing because I like it going to the
side like this but all the hair is
basically right here and then we turn
around BAM
like no hair right what so yeah so let
me get close so you guys can see what it
looks like and it's pretty nice um and
it does look exactly like how the model
is wearing it so you will get what you
see yeah I like the low up dude - as
well so again I purchased this from
weight types calm and it was only 41
dollars because they had was having like
30% off or something like that so it was
44 but then now it's 41 so yeah if you
answer it if you're interested in this
unit I will link everything in my
description box but I'm overall I do
love this unit um besides you know
things that I talked about but I mean it
was only $41 y'all so homie you get what
you pay for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
