brothers getting perfect time and steady
that's a rummy really fun you know I
like fr we are we about week
hey guys so I'm back with another video
and this week was into me from elevate
South so I'll make sure I leave all
elevate styled links in the description
box just in case any of you guys are
interested in ordering this week or any
weeks that they also on their website so
yeah I'm going boy and leave that down
below so this is outraised area and I
have it in a color number two and it
also says it comes with swiftly which
that is true because the link is stuff
so if you don't like heart lace then
you'll definitely love this week because
this way it comes with soft lace and
it's nice and stretchy this way has a
three columns on the front a comb and a
backless adjustable shrimp now and oh
this is a side part it's one comb on
each side of the part so to comb right
here a comb right here and it also is a
comb right here and then they give you
combs in the back with the adjustable
strap I would say that this week is
big-headed friendly so if your head is
on the largest side I think that you
could get away with this way my head is
very small and I do have my strengths
adjusted and it's still a little bit big
on my head but I don't know if I
mentioned this but this is a synthetic
unit also this week is a Yankee texture
so if you're into like the Yankee unit
thing you'll definitely love this one um
so yeah this is what it looks like and
it's definitely natural now this does
come as a side part and the part is on
the right side so if you like your parts
on the right side then you'll also like
this week so yes and this is the part in
place and I did plus my part I feel like
if
you really didn't want to plug your
punch you don't have to you could just
add the powder but I felt like I wanted
to
plus my parts the way it's also behind
my hairline and I just had a little bit
of my baby hairs picked out just to make
it more natural but I love the way it
lays and lays so flat on my head and it
just looks really really natural one
thing that really bothered me about this
way is the part the part is not really a
deep side part so if you weigh your hair
anyway your parts to decide but sure you
like that like deep side part you're not
going to get it from this weight
literally the part is like right here
it's like a couple of I guess like a
centimeter away from being a middle part
which I really don't like so what I did
was I just shifted the week over to the
side a little bit to give it a more
deeper apart but once I shift the wig
over to the side this side was longer
than this side so what I had to do was
go in and cut it so it can match this
side which I was rushing so I really
didn't do that much of a good job but
you'll get the point so another thing is
I would probably cut the front of this
because it's only like a small portion
that's like cut to frame your face and
then the rest is long I don't know it
just doesn't blend in correctly so yeah
I might go in and cut that but besides
that this week is so nice and it looks
so natural
okay so I have seen a couple of they go
my shirt leaning to the side again like
you're strong and my body I swear my
body is like it it's like you know I'm
saying like it's even like it doesn't
hang to the side like one side is not
lower than the other one it's just the
way I be sitting and when I play my
videos back like my whole shirt be
leaning to the side and I just irritates
me so bad and it just messes up my whole
video so now I'm like the FBI and
always like stoic in my shirts for real
because I just don't want it to be lean
in like looking crazy but anyway method
it how could I have not received any
tingling on shut-in from this week yet
no is a shorter unit so you won't get
too many problems with tangling when it
comes to unit system this love y'all if
y'all have not heard of this week on how
to suggest that you guys will check this
wave out cuz I'm pretty sure you guys
are really going to enjoy this week I
definitely love this week this week is
definitely limit
again this week is from elevate South
I'll leave all their links in the
description box so you guys can check
them out um I'm not going to announce
the winners on my Instagram yeah after a
while I just really started really
thinking and I'm just sitting here like
that really don't sound right it would
be kind of pointless for me to announce
the winners on my Instagram if I don't
know I just feel like it would kind of
be pointless so basically what I'm going
to do is instead of announcing the
winners or my Instagram I'm going to
announce it on my youtube channel here
I'm going to announce it on my channel
and I'm still going to announce the
winners orange Saturday I'm still gonna
announce the winners Saturday evening
and yeah and I'm only going to have the
video posted for 24 hours so after the
24 hours is up like always it will go on
to the next person now if you are a
winner and you do see your name when I
want you to leave your email address in
the comment section of that video if no
one claims their prize and you are the
next runner-up or the next winner
I'll just contact you under your entries
I'm comment oh yeah I hope that was not
too confusing but like always I'll leave
everything in my description box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
