another video so this video is going to
be on this hair and this hair was sent
to me from a Friday night hair so yeah
if you're not familiar with Friday night
hair I'll go ahead and leave all the
links down below so you can check them
out but the way they sent me this time
is the GLS 148 and y'all do y'all see
this wig like this wig is spicy oh my
gosh like this is just I don't know like
how do they have for sure everyday type
of week for sure okay I'm back um I'm
getting so many interruptions and stuff
like that alright if you're not familiar
with Friday night hair if you was about
to say if you're not familiar with the
construction of Friday night hair and
their wigs as far as the wigs are
concerned basically is this week cup not
all the wigs but most of their wigs come
with hard lace now this way it comes
with hard lace like I said is a new unit
so they did add a couple new units to
their site the last video I did was on
one of their no units I wasn't really a
fan of that one but this one right here
y'all I like it
I love it so yeah basically this comes
with hot lace I think the lace color is
like a medium brown they do offer you
one to one and a half inches of part and
space just in case you want to part part
the hair and of course the space gets a
little like the part and space gets a
little slim so you can't really do too
much part on the side but in the middle
you could if you wanted to side part you
definitely can like turn the wig around
and place the part so the part can beat
on the side if you do them Sam so yeah
this week also comes with two
homes in the front a comb in the back
and adjustable straps I do feel like
this wig is became friendly so just in
case you have a bigger sized head I do
feel like you can possibly fit this but
the air tabs I don't know if they're
gonna come all the way down on you now I
do have because my head is small and I
do have a room inside of this week so as
far as like the head part I think that
you'll be able to fit it but like the
tabs reaching ear to ear um you might
have an issue with that if you do have a
larger size head because the ear tabs
for me our belly and making it so yeah
this way comes
just like this straight out the pack the
only major thing I did to this wig is
create baby hairs because this week did
not come with any baby hairs so I
basically just cut some baby hairs in
the hairline and just molded it with my
got to be glued Joe I feel like a mold
in my synthetic hair we've got to be
blue gel just works better for me
instead of regular gel because the
regular gel just does not hold the
synthetic fibers down if this boy will
be quiet you're you know as the wig gets
older I'm pretty sure it'll start to
tangle but for right now like the wig
has not tangled the week has not shed I
didn't cut off the lace and I didn't go
into the headline or anything like that
so still the way did not shed at all
what else can I say about this week Oh
shine okay as far as shine it is a it's
a bit shiny I feel like it's either or
like if you don't feel like you need to
put any powder or what is it dry shampoo
to kind of like dull the wait now you
really don't have to like it's not the
shininess is not being me personally I'm
not gonna do anything to eliminate the
shine because I feel like it's not that
shiny in my opinion it's not like it's
not shiny to the point where somebody
would be like oh my gosh like that's
fake is synthetic ill like no it really
looks really really real one thing I do
wish that they would
put more colors out for this particular
style because I definitely will love it
in like a red color or like a burgundy
color I think that it would be so dope
if it was like in a burgundy red color
so yeah move it 1 2 mic on and I only
have one con about this week and that's
that the curls in the back are not like
as consistent as the curls in the front
mind you if you wanted to put this as a
middle part the curls are even where you
know what I'm talking about because I
have this problem with most wigs where
the curls when both sides are just not
even and they don't go like they don't
go not towards the face but away from
those these curls are even and it looks
good as a middle part as well so if you
plant on wendice as a middle part it
would definitely look nice the front is
just a so bomb and it's like so fluffy
and full that you kinda can't even
really tell that the curls are just like
not like the front but I'm going to turn
around so you guys can see what I'm
talking about and you probably can't see
what I'm talking about but it stores
mainly like the bottom part I don't like
how the tricks are going cuz it's kind
of like flipped up it's gonna flip
downward now this week is it's not like
it's in the middle between thick and
thin like it's not them but it's not too
thick it's just like just right so I do
I do feel like the look I do feel like
the density and this way is just like
perfect especially for the type of
hairstyle that it is and everything like
that like I'm definitely loving this
week if you cannot so yeah I really
don't have too much to say and I'm not
complaining at all I definitely think
that is a nice style and I hope you guys
like it I definitely would recommend it
this week are definite
we love this week like I said the curls
in the back are not my favorite but
because I just love the way the front
and leaves and everything like it
doesn't even matter
and it probably don't even look that big
I definitely love this head with this
outfit I did purchase this um this
outfit from my fashion open just in case
any of you guys were interested
so yeah this is what it looks like it's
actually a two-piece and it has the oh
you can't see it but it has like the
stripes going down the side and this is
wide leg pants so yeah or flare whatever
you wanna call it so yeah that's what
you know that's what I'm gonna day you
feel me so yes y'all like it's so bouncy
its flowy do y'all see this let me just
show y'all what it looks like and even
like if you just a flip it on the other
side like just look at it it's so
freakin cute
I cannot take this y'all
still cute on the other side you could
talk about how you eat if you wanted to
see it's like some unruly hair that's in
the back that just goes wherever it
wants to go but yeah that's what the
hairline is looking like and I'm yeah so
let me show you the parting space this
is the parting space that's that's it
that's how much part of fish you get but
just look at that y'all like look at
this side I don't see that buddy and
then so this is if you wanted to we're
in the middle which I don't have my
brush or can't really you know give you
a little full effect but that's
basically what it looks like
yeah you got to work with this side
though but it definitely goes in the
same direction but yeah this I'm just
like feeling this so much no no cheesy
about you oh you got a new bitch you
think you got a new bitch we'll think
again come
she ain't got nothing on me
she ain't got nothing on me
she can't try anything as you can see
like it just goes back to being great
like it's that simple
like this is lit y'all
