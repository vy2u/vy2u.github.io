the blocks new or visit door my jig go
back in time I put up an air raid hello
five eight I'm Way put up on you that's
what I won't do Magnus you say too much
hey guys so I'm back with another wave
review and this week was sent to me from
RPG hair company so yeah I'll make sure
I leave um their link in my description
box if you guys want to check out their
website or if you guys are interested in
this particular unit but yeah um I
actually really really like this wig you
guys it's really nice it's really boom
you when I say I want to insert clips of
me putting on this way and taking it out
of the package and stuff like that when
I say this wig already comes ready to
wear I did not have to do anything to it
like I had my flat irons on deck and
everything like I thought I was going to
have to pull it on his hair or straight
in his hair and I didn't like I didn't
do anything I didn't pluck the part um
none of my hair's really oh I do have
the I do have the wig behind my hairline
slightly but that's about it when I say
I did not do anything to this hair this
hair is so soft it's like butter now
mind you it does have like a Yankee
texture to it not is not really like
silky silky but it's not like really
yaki Eva it's like a nice medium so of
course this is a bulb unit and when I
say the tight is cut to perfection like
it's not not too long not too short and
it's just going all the way around like
I really like this look um but anyway
let me read you what kind of wig this is
and they do have all the information on
the bag sorry my light it's stopping you
guys
seeing the words wedding this style is
lfw 10 the hair color is same as image
so basically it's a 1b and then it
gradually gets it gradually goes into
the color number four which I really
really appreciate that it looks so nice
I love the dark chocolate like so
anywhere the handle off is 12 inches the
hair density is 150%
the cap size is a small and this is a
lace front wig so it's not a fully
straight weight it's only a head foot I
meant it's not a full lace wig it's only
a lace front but as you can see they
give you enough part in space where
basically they wasn't stingy with pardon
so that's one thing I like about this
week as well that the part in space is
really nice they give you about four
inches of parting space and also if you
have a smaller head like me a small
probably won't do because this wig is
huge on my head and I have my straps
just it I don't have my straps adjusted
um in this week still fits me big but
besides the wig being big actually it's
really nice now if you like this week
and they don't come smaller than a size
small you can always um you can always
take an elastic band or some sort to
secure the unit if you feel like it's
too big on your head I mean I am using
my combs only because it's too big um
you know I don't like using combs but I
had to in order for me to feel more
comfortable with when this week because
if I was not using the combs this week
with definitely fall off my head so it
is like a lot of extra room right here
and also it's kind of bunched up in the
back from UM from me adjusting the
shrimp's but I am going to turn around
so keep in mind that this week head is
actually really really big
my head but overall the cut-in how it
looks looks really good so don't try to
come for my life your I know it's kind
of little bit jacked up but we know why
overall I really would suggest this wig
I love this wig I have nothing bad to
say about this wig um when I cut off the
lace I did not get any type of shedding
afterwards I didn't get any tangling
this time I did receive this wig around
like three or five days I can't remember
exactly but it was around like three to
five days I'm also the head not coming
for smell or anything like that like
before they contacted me I've never
heard of this company before but their
hair is actually really good quality is
so bone like the UM the part I mean the
nuts are not bleached either and I
didn't even any powder or anything to my
part this is how the part will look I
will leave RPG hair links in my
description box as well as direct links
to this hair just in case any of you
guys are interested in checking out this
wig or you want to purchase it um I
don't think that you're going to be
disappointed I really know it I'm
telling y'all this wig is the truth I
just like it so much more because the
color with the ball I don't know if that
even makes sense but the way this color
is set up it just makes this ball so
much more sleek ish in just like nice I
love this chocolate color on my skin
your
everything will be left in my
description box so check that out before
you ask any questions and yeah I'm going
to UM insert a clip of how I applied
this unit 1 to my head it's pretty
simple it's not like like a tutorial or
anything like that it's just showing you
guys like the hair I'm out of the
package and stuff like that so yeah I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and I
will talk to y'all later so this is what
the packaging looks like and don't mind
the hole in the box I stepped on it but
whatever so this is what the way it
comes in and the wig has three combs in
the front a comb in the back and
adjustable straps and they do give you a
nice part in space like a nice amount of
potting space so my hair is corn rolled
back and now I'm just putting on my wig
cap that keeps on falling off so after I
put on my wig cap I'm going to put on
the wig and I'm going to place this
slightly behind my hairline when I say I
didn't put no effort into this wig at
all like I just put it on my head and
that was it I didn't insert my clips I
inserted my combs because the wig is
huge on my head but yeah this is
basically it and I was failing myself at
the end y'all but um happy Thanksgiving
and I hope you enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
