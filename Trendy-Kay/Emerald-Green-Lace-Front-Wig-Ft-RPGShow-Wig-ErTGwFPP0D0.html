man in Manila as we like it McCain K of
course in a mixed with a nother video so
this video is gonna be on this hair and
this hair was sent to me from RPG show
so I will hear it and leave all their
links in the description box just in
case any of you guys are interested in
this week now if you're not familiar
with RPG show which most of you guys
should be if you are into like human
hair wigs but yeah RPG show is pretty
popular I don't think I ever did a video
on their head before I'm not sure but
they all want a pricey side just letting
you guys know so keep that in mind like
if you not about you know spending all
that money on a wig then I totally
understand but so the wig I'm wearing is
called emerald green human hair least
wig and I have in the color and we're
green of course it's the same as the
pitcher and the length is 20 inches the
hair texture is silky the hairline is
pre plucked a line which I feel like it
is a pre pluck have I because I didn't
go in and pluck the hair line so I will
say it is pre plug the density is two
hundred two hundred percent density
which I felt like the density is two
hundred because it's a nice thickness
going on the lace color is light brown
the cap construction is a cat B which is
a lace front cap the cap size is the
size one I don't know if that's like a
small I'm gonna answer clips of how this
way came originally because when I
originally got this week it was curled
and me and his wig was heaven some
issues but now I feel like it's much
better so let me just insert like the
construction and everything
of this week and how it look originally
in
okay so when I first received this week
the color straight out of the pack like
a bitch straight out the box
the color was bomb I definitely fell in
love with the color the only kind I have
about this color is the fact that it has
duck root but the darker it's not really
consistent I feel like they just put the
color or like the bleach anywhere so
like right here for example you see how
right here it's kind of like close up
and there you have more dark fruit like
towards the front and it's inconsistent
all the way through like right here is
more duck fruit then right here and then
in the back it's like practically no
dope root like all the back was kind of
just bleached and then like right here
of course is a little bit of duck root
but that's still actually when the lace
is because the lace goes all the way
back here but when you get to the
western hair it's like it has no duck
root really so keep that in mind also I
noticed that the hair was very dry and
damaged when I got it um of course it's
much better now and it feels really nice
but when I received the wig it was
really hard and it was hard for me to
comb and hard for me to run my fingers
through it almost felt like somebody
sprayed spritz on the hair the hair
actually was like I guess over-processed
or whatever so I went ahead because I
wasn't wearing the curls anyway that it
originally came in I wasn't wearing
those curls cuz like I said it was dry
just felt really bad so I went ahead and
washed the wig when I washed the hair of
course the blue dye just started running
out of this week it still runs like if I
was to run my hands through it like I
can get
a little flus tent on my hands so it
hasn't like transferred onto my clothes
but my hands it has so anyway I washed
away the color still remains the same so
I am happy that the color is still how
it was when I originally got it so X I
washed it it was very very tingly as I
was trying to detangle the head it was
very tingly it shaped quite a lot and I
did get like little pieces of grouping
of head that was on my hands and stuff
so you can tell that the hair was
damaged so I will here insert clips of
that just so you guys can see what I'm
talking about so after that I went ahead
and deep conditioned the hair because I
felt like it was in dire need of a deep
condition so XII deep condition it like
you still could tell that the wig was a
little bit on the hard side it wasn't as
soft as I wanted to be but it was
definitely better than when I got it so
I just let the wig edge right and I use
my Chi he protected even though I didn't
put any heat on it yet
so I put this on it while the head was
wet and when I went to go straighten the
hair is when the hair just snapped back
to reality and it feels so soft like it
never was processed or color or anything
it's so nice and bouncy so I don't know
what is going on with this hanger but
after I straight in the head and like
put heat to the hair is when it start
acting right because I was really
disappointed when I first received this
wig but after I put heat to it like this
hair is really soft I haven't received
any tangles from this hair I haven't
received any shedding actor arm after
straightening the hair
yeah it's so bouncy it's really nice it
smells really good I went in and used my
Pantene pro-v I think it's called
moisture renewal
I used that shampoo and conditioner for
this hair and it feels amazing you guys
but I'm telling you when I first
received this way it was not I didn't
really care for this wig but now I
actually love it so yeah if you're
looking for a color like this definitely
check out this week like I said it is on
a expensive side and I don't think
paying all that money that you should
have to go through doing all of that to
get the way to act right and should
already act right and when you receive
it but um I will say it feels so much
better is acting so much better I do
love the fact that this is a lace front
but they give you so much lace to work
with in the front part I also like the
fact that this wig leaves super super
flat now I did have some flyaways and I
don't know if the flyways was from the
hair kind of like breaking off as I was
washing all this is what the hairline
looks like and this week is stuck to my
head but this time I did not use what is
that I did not use the guys to be glued
gel I only use the free spray so I did
not know that you can just use the
freeze frame by itself and I didn't use
got to be glue just right here for the
baby hands but besides that I use
nothing else I did not put anything in
my parts um I do have one a new stocking
cap so that's why the part it's like
that I didn't put like any powders or
anything no concealers I didn't do none
of that so I definitely love the way
this is looking like
the headline is bum it looks so natural
so guys that's it for this video if you
guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
below and I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
