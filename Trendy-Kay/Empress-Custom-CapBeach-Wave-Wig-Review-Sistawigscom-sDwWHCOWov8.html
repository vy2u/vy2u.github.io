so if you're not familiar with them go
check them out I'll leave the link in
the description box so yeah I received
this way from sister wigs and this is
the Empress lace wig lace front edge
it's the stocking cap we custom lace wig
without them and I have it in beach curl
in a 1b so I'm pretty sure all of you
guys are familiar with the custom lace
wigs by the Empress collection or
whatever um yeah that's what the picture
looks like and actually on a picture I
think that the wig the wig looks really
good so yeah um this is what the wig
looks like is nice and full and big so
as far as the part the Parden on this
one this wig is really really good um
and it does have two combs in the front
it has a comb in the back with the
adjustable straps and it only has this
much lace it's not from its ear but I
mean that doesn't bother me that doesn't
bother me so yeah I'm going to show you
guys what this week looks like and yeah
so
this is what so this wig is just not
doing anything for me like this I mean
it's a lot of hair it's just like blood
has like no type of like I don't know
and then this like they're not really
curls they're kind of like waves in a
way like I'm pretty sure this wig will
look really nice on someone else but
this week does nothing for me like I
don't cover Lee I don't know like this
is just not a good way for me it kind of
looks like as if like don't you know how
to look good today called a micro mini
like the little micro mini braids and
then how to ends look that's how this
wait looks um I'm pretty sure like
somebody can hook this wake up though I
mean it is nice and full I haven't
received any shedding from this wig I'm
pretty sure this week will tangle up on
you already I can tell but I can't run
my fingers do it but yeah this is what
the curl or creme or I don't know what
you want to call it but it looks like
this um this wig is around 18 inches
long so yeah this is the Parden space I
really don't have much to say I'm just
like um not a fan what is going on with
my life
okay I'm just um I'm just not a fan of
this unit you definitely can win this to
decide as well um
yeah it's okay I mean I'm just not for
me
but it is a nice unit as far as like the
thickness and the fullness is concerned
is not a lot of hair on your head um
it's not like way down overly heavy or
just like overwhelming but it is a nice
amount of hair and um overall is um it's
a nice wig I just don't like how it
looks on me and the curl pattern kind of
like threw me off but um yeah cuz I
really don't see this being like a beach
wave like yeah
so again if you're interested in this
unit you can purchase this from sister
waves calm and I will leave the link to
this wig in my description box as well
as a link to from sister wigs website so
