on fix my shirt sorry I just did a wig
review on a short week
Dasia so if you did not see that one go
check it out
this week that I have is the canoe being
easy five week so is by Empress lace
wigs and this is what she looks like now
this week has gotten around a lot on
YouTube it was so many reviews on this
hair and I don't know I was skeptical
about getting it because I don't know
like nobody-nobody really like won me
over to say you know oh my gosh I gotta
get this week but I'm like hmm it's $19
let me get it just to try it out and
that's what I did I wanted this from
Wiig types back home in a color too
before I put this wig on I do have my
hair braided down it's an inverted
braids which is French braids the reason
that I had two on this side and one on
this side is because if I wanted to do a
middle part I will put my part right
here and then I wear my part on this
side is the side part so that's the
reason why I have to freeze right here
also I do inverted breeds because I find
when I do cornrows if they're not small
then they kind of like they tend to you
know rise or like you can see it it's
more flattered if I do the inverted BRE
if I
bring my hair with in big braids
basically so um yeah and I just have it
flipped in the back and bobby pin I do
not have a wig cap so yeah my head is
like all over the place but um yes
that's how my hair is and that's
basically how I wear my hair when I put
my wigs on so this is her and I'm gonna
get more into I'll talk about it but um
this is the inside of the wig I did put
concealer I mean not consider powder in
the part area it is two combs on the
side I guess that's if you will want to
cut this open but and we not doing that
so I don't use the combs it is also a
comb in the back and it has adjustable
straps but yeah so I'm going to put her
on and I'm gonna come back and show you
guys what she looks like
okay you guys so this is hurt when the
camera does it justice because I
absolutely hate this way you guys I do
not like this week at all like in person
this wig is so ugly than me like okay
first of all when I got this week I
didn't really like the curl pattern like
um for side part okay so I'll show you
when I get to you know putting it on the
side but besides that the part there was
no part so basically you had to plug it
out which I'm not complaining about
because I have to do that once almost
all my wigs um it's the cat is so huge
and that's my main problem because my
head is so small that like it's so thick
up in here like you
Oh y'all can't see what I'm talking
about y'all have to see this in person
but I did not like this week you guys
like I really don't and this is not
really how the way came the curls
basically do look like this um but I
went with my flat iron and I you know
went quickly and I also cut a little bit
of layers in the front but I don't like
this wig at all I really don't it's so
happy and big for my head it does not
leave flat um also it's really thin like
up here it's really full and then when
you get down here it's like so thin um
so basically it looks like bulky and
then like thin I can't explain it but
like I do not like this wig at all like
I probably I don't know you guys tell me
what you think like I really don't like
it
as far as shedding and tangling yes when
I first took this bad boy out the
package like it shed so bad
and it tangles like a lot um see in the
camera it looks cute like I like it in
the camera but in person when I'm
looking at myself in the mirror I'm like
no like and I think I will be more
comfortable if the cat fit my head
because I can work like I can tweak
these curls like I just did when I you
know took the flat on and change the
curl patter and make it a little bit
loose but I just feel like it looks
really bulky up here like I feel like it
looks so bulky so yeah as far as like
shedding it does shed but I mean it's
not really a big deal to me
tangling it's a longer wig so of course
it's going to tango
this way is probably about 22 to 24
inches maybe 22 inches because my belly
buttons all the way down right here but
yeah like I mean right now you're
probably like Carol be quiet like that
wig is nice but I'm telling y'all I do
not like this weight like I really I
don't like it I really don't like I like
the fact that how I changed up the curls
a little bit in there looser now but
this is what it looks like in the back
so yeah so let me come back and show you
guys what it looks like on the side but
let me get closer um I already showed
you my brief header in and how I had the
part in the middle so that was the
purpose of putting my part in the middle
and on the side so this is what the part
looks like and I did put concealer now I
can see a powder underneath the weekend
so yeah I'll be there okay so this is
what the wig looks like on the side I
mean it's okay on the side I just don't
like the fact that okay so the curl
pattern basically this side sorry
this out of the wig goes like feather
back this side goes this way I do not
like that I needed to go the opposite
way which it doesn't in that irritates
me so bad so it's just so like you I
know y'all see they look at it like
that's the wig that's not even my hair
underneath light it's just like buckle
II and big now don't get me wrong this
way looks nice on other people but I
just knew it and this is why I was so
skeptical because this week is like it
been around for a while now and I was so
skeptical on getting this week and I
should have went what's my first
instinct and that was not to get the wig
because I absolutely hate this way like
this will be a good week for somebody
else but just not me like I want my $19
backyard like for real like I did not
like this week at all this is what the
part looks like on the side I want to
meet some Valentine's they have like I
don't know like see this side like from
right here it's cute
and then like all of this up in here
it's just but like if I was like the
poles one side like that gonna be cured
but I don't know like I really I don't
like it so I probably will never wear
this wig but this is what she looks like
you guys this is easy the easy 5 wig by
empress lace front wigs and this is what
the package looks like so I mean it's a
whole bunch of wigs on
YouTube floating around for this week so
yeah and this is a color - I got her
food from wig types and she was $19 so
yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I'll
see you later bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
