video I had this outfit on but it's the
same day so yeah um let's get into this
review okay so I have the infamous wig
that's going around all over YouTube and
it's pretty old right now and I'm just
hopping on the bandwagon so yes this is
Rihanna and I have heart in a color too
this is by empress lace wigs and this is
what the picture looks like so right now
I'm like really into short wigs right
now I don't know if it's because of the
trend because you know short hair is
definitely back in or it's in at this
moment so I am loving the natural looks
in the short hair right now so like I
said in my previous video I watered
three weeks from wig types calm and yeah
surprisingly all the wigs that I
purchased from there I absolutely love
like all three of the wigs I like like
it was nothing wrong with none of the
week so I was like yes what are the odds
that I like all three of the wigs that I
purchased so yes this is um Rihanna is
so many reviews on YouTube for this week
but I absolutely love it this little
piece would irritate me I just literally
took this out of the packet package and
plopped it on my head I did remove the
lace um so yeah the only thing that I'm
not really a fan of but I absolutely
think this is a gorgeous wig is this
little
then right here like I wish it was a
little bit straighter but I guess with
with time it will
you know straighten itself out or I can
just take my flat on and go shoot but
other than that like this wig is so
pretty it is so natural like come on
like this is so pretty yes like this
looks like my real hair um this is what
the part looks like I don't know if you
ever see that but that's what the part
looks like the part it's actually okay
so yeah the part is actually really good
um like I said in my previous video is
really optional if you want to pluck out
the hairs and apart because like weeks
like this like y'all know what I'm
saying maybe some wigs that you get and
like you can't even see the part but
this is actually okay part like you can
actually see the lace part so like I
said it's optional either you can go
without plucking it and you can put your
powder or concealer whatever you use to
make the part more prominent or you can
just pluck it is up to you I probably
will pluck my part bends though I like
to pull out some of my hair and blend it
in with my part play yes so this is what
the wig looks like and I just think it's
absolutely gorgeous laughs hey I look so
much older immature like this one it
always like grown women weeds but yes
this is what the side looks like and
what the back looks like I don't know if
y'all can see that but but I will
probably have to bring my hands right
in a ponytail so yeah and look at that
side like that cut is off the hook okay
like that is really nice but um your I
love this week like this is so cute
and like I don't even know what I was
about to say but yeah I love this wig
and like you can like tuck it behind
your ear
of course I wouldn't with like that I
will pull out my hair in the front but
just see you guys can see my ears
already
um but yes like I just wish this was
like not all up on my throat like that
like I wish she was like hanging in a
little bit but it's cool um this is so
cute yes you guys so if you guys have
not experienced the Rihanna week you
need to get it because I think by now
everybody should have at least one bob
week or one Rihanna week it doesn't even
have to be Rihanna but yeah like the wig
speaks for itself it's absolutely
gorgeous and it's so simple and all you
have to do is really you clap it when
you're hit like I don't think any I
don't think any work is really required
for um for this wig so yeah it's like
this is definitely everyday week just
clap it on and go so yes this is what
the wig looks like
from the side from the other side and
the back I'm not really knowing how to
back look like y'all but yeah excuse the
bump if you can see it I can't see so
yeah
this arm I forgot to mention that this
wig has two combs in the front and then
it has like these miniature like two
teeth combs like one is like right here
right here on the other side and then in
the back I guess that's if you was to
cut the the lace off and you could just
secure it like that but yeah it has two
combs right here and then it has three
baby combs and then it has a comb in the
back and it has adjustable straps I'm
not sure if I mentioned how much this
week was but I can't even remember I
know it was no more I know this week was
no more than 25 dollars but I'll be sure
to leave all the information that you
guys need and in the description box so
yeah you guys tell me what you think
about this wig yeah cuz I absolutely
love this wig I don't like what it's
doing to my forehead though it's like
what's really out there but who cares
this is really cute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
