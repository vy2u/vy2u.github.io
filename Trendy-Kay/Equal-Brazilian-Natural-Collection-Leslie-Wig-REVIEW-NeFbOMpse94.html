for you guys today and it's on my head
and this is the wig Leslie and this is
what the packaging looks like and I have
her in a color
non non je I absolutely love this wait
you guys it is like the perfect length
because I was tired of the long hair and
I just wanted something simple but still
cute and I came across this wig and
surprisingly I only came across two
reviews for this wig so I loved this wig
it's so gorgeous it's so natural looking
and the length is just like perfect for
me um yeah the color is not really
bringing up is true color so yeah but if
you guys are all familiar what a nylon
Jade looks like which is like a dark
burgundy yeah that's what it is it's
kind of showing up a little bit I'm this
comb head I meant this comb this week
has a comb right here right here so two
combs in the front a comb in the back
and it does has adjustable straps yeah
so the part is like really good like I
can't complain like the part is on point
I didn't do anything to the part this is
basically what the wig will look like
coming straight out of the package but
yeah I think I am going to pluck a
little bit of my part out but not that
much because like I said it's optional
like this part is really good where you
probably will only have to put powder on
it to make it stand out just a little
bit more and that's it but yeah like you
can just get up and go with this wig
like is so
pretty yeah it does
tangle in the neat area but that's about
it it's not it's not really bit like
it's not bad
um and it does shed a little bit like
I'll get like three two or three strands
when I run my fingers through it but
yeah this wig is gorgeous I did purchase
this from wig tights I'm not sure if I
already said that this wig was twenty
five dollars so yes this is like the
bomb like I'm loving this week let me
just put this over top of my sweater so
y'all can get an idea of what the length
is I think this is around like 14 yeah
14 inches this is so gorgeous and it's
so full and if you keep like messing
with it with your finger like finger
combing it it gets bigger but yeah so
this is what it looks like
this is what it looks like in the back
not too long okay yeah so I just brushed
it and this is what I use - sorry got
hair in it but this is basically what I
use for all my wigs to brush my wigs out
with this wig I brushed it and it just
went back into that wave pattern but you
can play around with it with your
fingers and it will get big but I like
it like this this is cute so yeah you
guys this is Leslie and yeah I love her
she's so cute
I'll see you guys in my next video
please tell me what you think so see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
