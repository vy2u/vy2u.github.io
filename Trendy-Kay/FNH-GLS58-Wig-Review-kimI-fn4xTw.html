Brian I'll just make a we smoking Mary J
dunkey I suspect when we crush dating
guys so I'm back with a another wig
review for you guys and this week is
from Friday night hair of course you
know I got to give you a review on
Friday night hair so this is the sorry
so this is the GLS at 58 that I'm
wearing and I have it in a color one day
get it like one take a look and so I
have the style GLS 58 and I have it in a
color 1b so this is what the wave looks
like overall this is just a really
really pretty week it definitely looks
natural I wanted to lay a little flat
like right here but this is how much
party space you get and I just have my
part in the middle now when you receive
this week of course it comes with lace
all the way around that you have to cut
off so basically this is how the wig
will come um I just like kind of like
finger combed it out you can have the
option of wearing it Eva or like freshly
you know how it comes out the pack which
the curls was not bad just look like
like not plucked out a little bit it
wasn't bad I'm sorry I didn't show you
guys but overall it just looks like this
me plucking it out just made it made it
a little bit more fuller but yeah this
is how basically the way comes I just
cut off the lace in I have some of my
edges out because we wear these type of
weights that the lace I met the hairline
really doesn't really look that natural
so you probably would have to pull some
of your hair out but that's not really a
big deal and I mean they do give you two
inches worth of parting space so yeah
it's not really much to talk about this
hair is
hopefully soft it is like a silky type
of texture it's not Yeti or anything
like that as far as the length is around
18 inches stretch and about like 16
unstretched and this is what the curls
look like I mean this wig absolutely
looks so pretty I love this wig how it
looks in the middle for some reason I
was gonna win you know towards the side
but I was like no I had to do my middle
puppy so if you're not familiar with
Friday night hair wigs this wig has two
homes up from a coma back and adjustable
straps this week fits my head so
perfectly so if you have a bigger size
head um I wouldn't really suggest this
way to you because it is like it fits me
like really good so I feel like it
probably would be mad tight on your head
or whatever so it you're probably I
don't know but now as far as tangling
and shut in this week does tangle in its
wake does shed um it tangles a little
because it is a curly wig so I wouldn't
suggest you keep running your fingers
through it it's not like a tight curl
wig though so mmm I don't know but um as
I run my fingers through it like I do
get snags here and there but it's not
like Oh detangle a way it's like oh my
gosh it's unbearable like I don't want
this wig no it's nothing like that
um but being a curly unit is only so
much finger combing that you can do into
the wig starts to like really tangle up
on you now shut in this wake does shut
up shed a bit I don't know this because
I cut the lace off the way but yeah this
um was just for me running my fingers
through it and I got all of this I mean
it's not too bad but keep in mind that
it does shed also keep in mind a is a
synthetic this is definitely a everyday
weight you can wear this wig to work you
can wear out you can you know do
anything wait on a date it's super nice
um this is what it looks like to decide
which I like it to decide as well but I
like it better in the middle and I
didn't pluck the part or anything like
that the only thing I did was and my
powder to the part but I love how
natural this wig looks like it looks
really really natural Oh another thing I
don't really like about this week is the
fact that it has like little short
pieces I don't know if you can see it
like sticking up right there which I
probably have to cut that off but yeah
heads like a little SH like some short
pieces sticking up right here at the top
of your head so yeah
also this wig is full um it's just like
a natural density the more you play with
it with your hands the fuller it gets so
when you first get it out the package is
not as full as this and then once you
keep on playing with it it just gets
more full which I like is definitely
just feel so soft it looks really really
natural</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
