review and this is going to be the week
that I'm going to be revealing so let's
get straight into this week you guys
because like I am filling it so okay so
the way that I have one is by a free
trust equal and it is taxi so this is
what it looks like on a model I don't
know if you guys can see that and I had
this in a color Soh 627 613 so yes I did
purchase this from wig tapes calm and I
will have all the links to this unit in
my description box as well as the price
okay you're like I don't know what's
going on with me anis blonde colors but
I don't know like I'm only my blonde
streak right now and I don't know what's
taking over me you guys but I cannot
help it and usually I wear blonde or
lighter colors more towards the
summertime but I keep on saying all
these blonde wigs and they are just like
so perfect so I don't even care pump
summer I'm wearing it now so okay so
about this unit this unit comes with two
combs in the front a comb in the back
and the adjustable strap this week fits
pretty good I feel like if you have a
normal to larger sized head this way it
will fit you good if you have a small
head I will just use the adjustable
straps like I have and um the wig fits
me good it doesn't fit really tight but
it's secure enough where I feel like
it's not going to fall off or anything
like that so this unit is about 18
inches long which I love the length of
this unit I feel like you definitely can
wear this every day
um benzo is growing I probably would not
wear this ever
then again probably I probably would
weigh it every day this has a lace part
which is really really amazing um it's
not like a full lace part um basically
how two-part and setup is all of this
right here is skin top and then they
give you this much of a lace part in
space so I did um pluck out the lace in
the front pluck out some of the hairs
because you couldn't really see the part
right there and I just made it blend
into the skin type part I did not add
any um concealer or powder to the part
this is just how it looks after I
plucked it and I'm happy with it I feel
like I don't need to do all that extra
stuff to it so yeah I think it looks
really realistic I also love the fact
that these little flippy things is like
on a point like they're not uneven at
all they match and I'm just loving this
whole look and I don't think I did a
straight unit in a minute so like I have
no complaints about this unit you guys
like this wig is everything so as far as
tangling and shedding I don't get any
tangling at all and I don't get any
shedding I have worn this unit about two
times already and I have not received
any tingling or shedding they wasn't
like throughout the whole day that I
wore this unit but for me just did like
whiff for the time that I have I haven't
really received any um tangle in oh shut
now I did we see I received a little bit
of shedding but it's not crazy
um like right now in us and I did
receive shedding after I cut
the lease off and now I just received
like two strands of hair which is not
bad at all
but as far as like it tangling up on me
I have not received any tangles yet I'm
pretty sure though that this unit will
start to tangle the more I wear this
unit because it isn't that it can end I
mean it's going to take with no way
around it
so yes this is the unit I highly suggest
this wig because I mean look at it it's
bomb you guys like I'm not going to do
you wrong like I promise like you are
going to love this unit and they have a
lot more variety of colors to choose
from just in case you don't really like
the blonde color they have dark colors
they have just go check it out I'm going
to leave the link down below to this
unit so right now I'm going to give you
guys a 360 so you can see the wig all
the way around
oh yeah um I know this video was pretty
quick but I'm doing a lot of videos
right now and it's really nothing I have
nothing negative to say about this way
it's perfect um I forgot to mention as
far as like the texture it is like a
slight slight Yankee texture it feels
like but it's not like overly Yankee
like it kind of got like a Yankee feel
to it and then it's kind of when a silky
sides like in between um it's not really
really really Yankee but it definitely
gives you like a natural feel um as far
as if this wig is shiny no it's not
shiny at all so yeah you guys this is it
for my little wig review if you have any
questions or anything feel free to leave
it in a comment section down below and I
promise I'll get back to your comment so
I'll write back to you and I'll see you
in my next video you guys
