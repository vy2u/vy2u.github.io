review for you guys and it is week that
I'm currently weighing on my head and
this is a Friday night head unit and it
is the GLS 52 this actually reminds me
of the GLS 15 that I did a review on so
the only difference between this one and
the GLS 15 is that this one is a little
bit longer and I have this in a color I
believe o BL 950 it's kind of like a
purplish color it's really not showing
up on camera but it's absolutely
gorgeous
this is I'm your typical Friday night
hair unit when it comes to like the cap
construction and things like that
so this is a lace front unit and they
give you about two inches worth of
potting space it has two combs in the
front a comb in the back with the
adjustable shred as far as tangling and
shedding I'm pretty sure this wig will
tangle because it's so curly but I'm not
going to like brush out the curls or
anything like that I'm gonna leave them
how they are and this is how the curls
come originally out of the packaging so
yeah this is a lot of hair I think I
want to cut it just to like frame my
face because it is a lot of hair so yeah
I think I want to cut it but this is
actually how the weight comes originally
and you can definitely wear it to the
side and you can weigh it in the middle
I want to wear this in the middle but it
looks really crazy
right now in the middle because it's
just a lot of hair like I wish you guys
can see the color but I'm going to take
a picture in this week and I will post
it on my Instagram
so hopefully the color will come up and
the picture so yeah this is what this
unit looks like yeah I think that I
really want to cut it cuz right now it's
just like here like it's really big
okay you guys so I'm back and this is my
finished result one this week I had to
cut it because it was just way too much
hair for me so yeah this is what the wig
looks like after I cut the wig and I
absolutely love the way it turned out
and I just basically cut it to frame my
face because it just looks so crazy with
all that hair in the middle all the hair
it was just like overpowering on my face
so I'm absolutely in love with this hair
and this look I really think this is one
of my favorite curly units from Friday
night hair so far um and the color is
just everything you guys like I
absolutely love this color casing put it
back
so yes you guys I am doing another
giveaway and this giveaway will be on
the Friday night hair so it will be two
winners that will receive a Friday night
you know so basically how to enter this
giveaway you have to be subscribed to my
channel and you have to be following me
on Instagram so leave a comment in a
comment section down below state in
which wig you like best out of all the
weeks from Friday night head that I did
a review on again I will leave all the
links to my reviews for Friday night
hair and the description box and also
leave your Instagram name as well you

already done a review so yeah Friday
night hair really does not have a
selection of colors for the units so it

color and I also believe that this comes
