review and this is the weight that I'm
currently weighing on my head down so
this is by Friday night hair this is
another one of their gorgeous gorgeous
yet this unit is a pretty nice length
that I'm really really really feeling so
this is by Friday night hair and this is
the GLS 40 and I have it in a 1b I don't
know if you guys can see that
okay you guys so don't mind my shirt I
know it's rarity but I haven't um got
dressed yet so please excuse my clothes
anyway this is the unit and the curls
look like this is basically like a loose
wavy curl and this is how the weight
came originally out of the packaging and
this wig is about 20 22 22 inches long
it's not long at all this is one of
those wigs where you can just put this
on your head and go kind of like a
everyday unit just to sew on and go so I
haven't really got any Tanglin I have
received a little shedding but nothing
crazy and it was basically after I cut
the lace off so that's probably why I
got most of the shut in there and yeah
this time unit also has one comb in the
back and two combs in the top area with
a dress adjustable straps and I had my
adjustable shreds to the tightest and
when I say this thing is so secure when
my head is so secure so the cat size
fits really good if you have a smaller
petite head so look at this you guys
this is what it looks like up close and
it's so beautiful you guys like I'm
really really feeling a Friday night
hair
I'm units
and this one just became probably one of
my favorites so yes I'm trying to pick
out what hey I want to wear today that's
why I'm not dressed so yeah it might be
this one so let me show you guys the
part really quickly and this is it a
laced and they do give you a good amount
of parting space and it's around like
two inches of parting space if you want
to part this bad boy in the middle it
still looks really really nice it
definitely looks nice in the middle on
the side I think it was out at Edison
wheel beside
so yeah this wig is really really nice
and you can purchase this from Friday
night hair calm and all of their
synthetic units is basically fifty
dollars so yes so again I know a lot of
people are looking for units and um kind
of like torn between which unit they
should get or really don't know what to
purchase from Friday night hair so this
is maybe a option for you if you're
looking for something in this style so
I'm going to give you guys a quick 360
of this unit
you
so guys this is it for my quick rip wig
review I hope you enjoyed this video and
as always if you have any questions
about anything feel free to leave it in
my comment section down below and I will
get back to you and yeah this is the wig
Friday night hair comb go check it out
so I don't think I have anything else to
say okay you guys so I always forget to
do this
sorry about my lion um but anyway so
yeah if you're wondering what's on my
lips I am wearing the Maybelline matte
lipstick and this just came out this
collection recently so yeah this is what
the packaging looks like and it's called
six nine six and it's burgundy blush and
again this is their matte lipstick by
Maybelline and that's what it looks like
and this is what it looks like so I
thought that was really nice and it is
definitely met so if you wondering
what's on my lips yes it's this and I
also have a brown lip liner under it and
I just put this all over my lips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
