wig review for you guys today and like
this hair is everything you guys like I
just put it on my head for the purpose
of this video but yet so it's not slate
but it can be so this is a Friday night
hair unit and this is the style gos GLS
I'm 74 and I had this any color one
being again if you follow me on
Instagram then you've already seen this
hair so yeah this is the GLS 74 from a
Friday night hair so yes this is what it
looks like this is a lace front it's not
it doesn't have the L part and this unit
so it's just least from ear to ear and
they do give you like two inches worth
apart in space so I don't know if you
guys can see that but yeah I just put
this week on my head just to show you
guys what it looks like but if I was to
weigh this out I would definitely leave
some of my hair out in the front and
they have the two inch part in space
because the part space is way too short
and it doesn't look real because you
know everybody wears they put long well
at least I do so it doesn't really look
real to me that's why I went I get the
Friday night head units I normally get
curly units because it's more natural
you can get away with having a smaller
parts or you can just like throw your
head to the side
it will look natural but this one yeah I
would definitely have to leave some of
my hair in the front so it can just look
more realistic but this unit is like
really big and glamorous and I
absolutely love it um yes you guys it is
a lot of hair so I know this unit is
probably like maybe 26 inches and yeah
it's got like that curly feel going on
um one thing that I don't like about
this unit is the fact that where the
lace is the curls are more straight
versus the hair in the back if you
understand what I'm saying
like um it's just not really curly it's
more um straighter so yeah it's still
pretty though um this unit tangles a
little bit um it doesn't really share
but it definitely tangles um and I did
brush the curls out um before I put this
unit on with a vent brush um so yeah the
curls would still be like this they just
a little bit more defined when you get
them when you get the unit straight out
of the package so yeah I just brushed
out the curls and this is what um it
looks like you guys tell me what you
think about this year I'm curious to
know because I'm one I love it but I'm
kind of one of the fence about it
because um the pardon and this style um
I'm really not sure but so if you guys
are like curious to see what it looks
like as a middle part I will calmly show
you that so
like I don't have a brush in here or
nothing like that so I'm not sure how
this one turned out but I'll do my best
so this is what the wave looks like with
the hair party to the middle and again
like I stated before you can definitely
see how the hair that's when the lace
part is way like straighter than the
hair that's on a track part so just be
aware of that um that is a ish like like
for the street but um I really love this
unit like look at this curl like it
really is big and glamorous but that
pardon with this style hair like it's
too short is gonna kill me and I don't
really like to wear my hair out um
because I just don't so
so that's it for this video you guys I
hoped you enjoyed if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in a
comment section down below and I will
link everything to this head in my
description box so yeah let me know what
you guys think and again you can
purchase this from Friday night hair
dot-com so you know this is maybe an
option for someone it definitely is a
lot of hate you guys so be aware of that
and the fact that it's really long so
it's it's a lot of hair you guys so I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
