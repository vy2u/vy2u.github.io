ever lie get by mighty fine
start it really what hi looking like
it's bad hey guys so I'm back with a
another wave review and this week was
sent to me from Friday night hair so of
course I will leave Friday night hair in
my description box as well as links or
direct links to this hair just in case
you feeling it so much that you want to
go ahead and purchase a girlfriend I
understand so anyway this is the GLS 15
no this is the GLS 73 and I have it in a
color TRB 35 so basically this color one
camera I mean camera the camera is not
doing it any justice but it's coming off
more red than anything which is really
not this red in person is more of a
burgundy color mixed with 350 so them
two colors mixed together that's the
best way I can describe it but if you
are not a fan of long hair you're not
going to like this one
I mean you can still purchase it i would
just suggest that you cut it i feel like
when you cut it it wouldn't take away
from the wig well yes this wig is extra
extra extra room so I would say this way
is probably like 26 inches long I just
love the curls I love the way that this
week Falls like everything about this
wig gets me excited I'm not even playing
but this is definitely a holiday wig for
real I'm not sure if they come in a
color 1b but I'll make sure I list it in
my description box because I feel like
this week will be so cute as a natural
color as well um this week is fire so
this is a synthetic unit and if you're
not familiar with the construction of
Friday night hair units basically they
give you two inches worth of parting
space to interest towards the top area
and then when you start moving down
towards this way it's less lace and less
potting space that you can part yeah so
it also comes with four two combs on the
side a comb in a bag and adjustable
straps you're here is on the bigger side
I feel like you can get away with this
cat but of course my head is small so I
do have my straps adjusted Ben's though
this week is on the longest side I would
have to warn you about I'm going to warn
you about tangling because the longer
the units are it seems like it tangles
really easily because of the left mind
you I haven't received anything yet
because this is my first day with it but
over time I'm pretty sure that this is
going to tangle so if it does start to
tangle
really bad I would suggest that you just
start snipping the ends up because I
think that it works better that way but
they only give you duck were in the
front area and then um after that it's
like they basically they only give you
Doug with the lace is and then in the
back it's just this color with no dauber
that's one thing that I'm just not a fan
of because when I pull it to the side
like you can clearly see um there's just
one
and it just I don't know I just don't
like it like that but it's definitely a
quick fix you can go in with a marker or
some black hairspray and just spray the
roots if you wanted to also this is not
a Yankee way it's pretty
silky it's not too - Sookie I don't know
it I don't know yeah it's a silky wig I
feel like it doesn't have any type of
yet texture going on so your look at
this okay so I'm sorry if this video is
like really loud in the background but
between my son and the bird I don't
wanna lose worse Oh
oh by the way I did not do anything to
this unit only thing I did was finger
Coleman when I got it out the package
and cut off the lace I didn't cut this
wig I didn't brush this with our finger
comb did um yeah I did nothing to it but
finger combing and this is exactly what
you're getting when you get the
wingstreet out of the package I feel
like this week is not shiny at all I
feel like it's definitely one the
natural side
so that's if its video and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
