stop right there now I know it's a lot
of you out there that are not fans of
ebony line and I was wondering myself I
was not offended at me line um I didn't
have like real bad experience with them
but it was an incident that happened
where they just sent me I think they
sent me my color choice number two
instead of my color choice number one
and then when I went back one there they
still had the color my color choice
number one so I was like well why would
they send me the color choice number two
it's just like people felt like they was
doing what they want to do basically but
anyway they reached out to me and to do
a review for them and I told them like
hmm I don't want to know um how I feel
about this now previous to them reaching
out to me to do a review I have been
getting most of my wigs lately from
ebony lines at home I felt like I'm not
too many people mess with evany lines so
that being said everything they had was
like in stock that was out of stock
somewhere else
so I was just like I took the chance and
nothing really happened so that's
basically what I've been doing just
getting everything from ebony line
because nothing is sold I don't have any
lines like literally every they have
everything on them so when they reached
out to me it was like can you do a
review for us I told them you know other
people thought it's how people thought
about them and they have like a bad
reputation and all that stuff and I was
like well we know we just try to make
things better or whatever like that so I
felt like I should give them a chance
because I have been
purchasing my wings from there lately
and they've been on an ish so if you
feel like you want to give them a second
chance and go ahead and order this wig I
will leave their links and everything in
the description box um and if you don't
you just don't feel safe with ordering
from them
I understand it's cool but um yeah so I
was sent this week from ebony lines and
this is from sisters two ways and it's
the a line a line H era that is the name
and I have it in a color 9rj Oh hold on
this is what the picture looks like
which is just like so long I've been
wanting this week for like ever and I
just never got around to getting it um
this is definitely a nice look for the
phone these weeks come in so many nice
colors but I just felt like I wanted to
do the nine nine J and a lot lately I've
been like running loving matching my lip
color with my hair I don't know what it
is but I don't know I just feel like it
goes together but like it really looks
nice when you first get it out the pack
its balm already um it doesn't come with
lace so that means you don't have to cut
off any lace um and the part looks good
too
I did not do anything to the part I just
edit powder into my part I didn't pluck
it or anything so these are one of the
ways that you can just take it out the
pack and just like put it on your head
and go like you don't really have to do
anything to this week at all that's how
I bomb this week is the cut is like
serious now remember if it had combs I
know I have a comb in the back I think
it has two combs in the top area and it
does have adjustable straps so I did
take my flat iron and I just I'm
straighten this part just the front area
and then I also took like two inches
off because I just felt like I didn't
want it that long so yeah maybe like an
inch or inch and a half not really two
inches I have not received any tingling
and I did not receive any Shetty I had
nothing bad to say about this week this
week it's absolutely perfect as far as
the shine on this week there's really no
shine with this color it's like a
natural type of shine I don't know how
it is with other colors cuz it's
different but this color it this week
looks absolutely natural like it looks
really really good so this is what the
side and this is what the back looks
like and it's just overall like so cute
girl like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
