this video you already know what time it
is
y'all seem to enjoy these type of videos
so a hair go with another one we're
going to be trying out this outre
timeless pineapple ponytails so I have
two pineapple like faux conical
ponytails this I have one in a style
Sophie in a color number two and this is
what it looks like and then I also have
by the same brand outre and this is in
the style cutie and I have it in to t1
bu which is burgundy
so I think I'm gonna try the burgundy
one first I will set these from shop
Hedwig's comp so if you interested I'll
go ahead and leave all the links in the
description box so yeah the first one
we're going to start off with is the
pineapple ponytail cutie and I have it
in the color two-to-one Burgundy
if you watched my previous video before
this video I did I like high ponytail
using bundle hair but this is actually
the same ponytail from the last video I
just kind of like finesse the top and
kind of like redid the baby heads and
brushed some up because well this style
you're not gonna really be able to see
my baby hairs anyway so let's get
started so this is what it looks like
and of course it comes in the net Drive
so yeah basically if you're familiar
with a ponytail it's exactly the same it
has the drawstring that's right here and
then it has like this extra piece with a
clip and it looks like you're gonna hit
the clip this like close to your edges
but I'm not about their life because my
hair is like I need my edges okay you
want to make sure your ponytail is nice
and tight so this is the tightest I
could get my ponytail so you just want
to cook it one oh my gosh yeah you just
want to hook it onto your ponytail and
then you want to tighten it and then
after you tighten it I'm just going to
go ahead and wrap the string around the
pony
and then i'ma go ahead and stick it in
oh okay so I might have to use this clip
I really don't want to but I don't know
what they clip its together so this is
what it's looking like straight out the
peg straight on my head and y'all I
could do some things with this like I
actually really like it
you
so you can actually wait like it was
when I first put it on I feel like it's
cute but for me it just didn't really
have no type of style to it it was just
it kind of reminds you of a mohawk in a
way instead of like a pineapple I don't
know that's just my opinion I actually
like the way it looks
um when you first put it on but it was
just like too much I felt like the
ponytail was wearing me so I kind of put
my own twist to it and this way it
really looks like kind of like a
pineapple ponytail it looks like I had
like a button going on and then some
head coming out so this is the final
look you guys tell me what you think I
actually really like this like I said if
you're interested I'll go ahead and
leave the links in the description box
so I'm just gonna put one side ear ring
so y'all can get like the whole you know
effect and I'm definitely starting to
get into Aarons you guys I used to
actually be a big jury person where like
I loved Joey but then I kind of like
stopped when Joey and I still don't
really with too much jury but I'm
bringing back all my old earrings you
guys so if you see me in a brings more
often that's why but okay so this is
what it looks like okay so moving on to
the next look now this one is called
Sophie I'm in Sophie softie and I have
it in the color number two so this is
what it looks like so let's see I'm
excited because I'm ready actually like
the first one alright now they offer a
lot of styles but I just picked these
two but yeah these two was the two that
I liked the most out of all the styles
they had I think they might have like
five styles I don't know you guys
but yes sorry I was thinking and I
already
this is what it looks like this is the
curl pattern for this one and it kind of
looks like flexi rods anyway I don't
know we'll see but it's very fluffy and
soft and for the first one of course I
had to receive any tangle in just
because I didn't like brushed oil or
anything like that and I had to receive
and he shut it upon taking it out the
pack and stuff like that so yeah and
also if you have more hair than me I
feel like I feel like they give you
enough room to stuff all your hair
inside these little compartment things
right here to put over your bun so yeah
I'm just going to cut this off
you
this is what it looks like straight one
and to me it's just like kind of like a
little mohawk anyway like I'm not
getting I'm not getting pine that whole
like if you put your hand up on it I'm
not getting those type of vibes I don't
know maybe it's just me but this is a
lot going on and it just looks like it's
sitting on my head literally so I'm
gonna go ahead and speed this up and
show you how I styled this one which is
gonna be probably the same exact way I
did the other one so yeah let me just
show you guys what this looks like
you
okay so I don't know you guys tell me
which one you like better I can't choose
because the curls on both of them just
give you kind of like a different look
even though it's the same type of like
style yes honey this is a look if you
have not tried these out go try them out
I'll go ahead and leave the links in the
description box and I'll keep these
videos coming because I find like the
trouble II like these videos so yes this
is definitely a nice quick easy style so
guys that's it for this video I hope you

description box just in case any of you
