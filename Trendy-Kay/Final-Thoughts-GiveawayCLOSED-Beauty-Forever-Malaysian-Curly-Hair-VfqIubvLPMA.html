like my videos just monotonous and away
so yeah I'm going to set up with my

it's K and I'm April's in another video
so this is gonna be my update my final
update on the video so I've been hair
cuz I know a lot of you has been waiting
on my final update so it's hair um my
summer web series is still going on but
I had it kind of like squeezes in the
middle of it because I needed to get
this video out so yeah the sum of all
days will continue after I put out this
video I'm always so inconsistent but I
promise you guys I'm going to work on my
consistency so let's get into this video
it's not going to be really long only
because it's not really much to talk
about another thing is this is also
going to be a giveaway video for videos
that I want to give you some hair to win
from the LA Express site so all the
details will be
in the end of the video if you're
interested in entering the giveaway so
onto this hair okay moving along to my
final thoughts on his hair actually gosh
I really really love this hair I have
enjoyed when it had the curls are just
amazing I feel like the curls every time
you wet the tail or condition it or wash
it the curls just belts mesh to life so
I definitely love that the curls are
still intact okay I will say the curls
on a closure to me I feel like all the
time have loosened a little bit but it's
not really a worry for me because I feel
like it still blends in with the bundled
hair but yeah I also like to fix it it
looks like a lot of hair which it is a
lot of hair but it's not hot and yeah I
feel like you can still get away with
when this curly hair and the heat and
it's not killing you so that's also a
plus when it comes to the test it's very
lightweight for the amount of hair you
know that it is well show y'all my lips
are so dry and I'm still excited so if
you watched my previous video I talked
about the closure everything like that
so that is one of the things that I also
really like about this hair is the
closure is one point I then go ahead and
bleach my nozzle on this closure and the
closure has been really right you guys I
feel like the closure has been holding
up pretty good for it to be bleached I
just feel like the clothes that I feel
like the closure to me just looks really
really natural and I just feel like when
I put this wave on this is money in a
way I can tell me otherwise that's how I
feel when I sent to sleep on so yeah I
feel like I just turned into a whole
different person when I had this hair on
it's just like popping huh
even my son thinks okay and it's only
one thing that I don't like about to
tell you guys and that is the freaking
shave the shut-in to me is just like a
no-go even though it doesn't shed light
throughout the day like it doesn't
like you won't find hell anything around
like when you fool anything but when I
do wash this hair is shed so much when I
say like like a shed yeah I don't know
how else to put it but it shed and this
thing you can't really tell that the
hair it's a lot of hair that's missing
from the tap to me I don't know if I'm
being like over in Jamaica or anything
like that but I'm pretty sure that
because I'm not like over your man
person so this is like the truth it
receives free skin and and I don't
know I don't really understand it like
am I being like too rough on the hair
when I'm detailing on it when I'm deep
tangling the hair and of course I use my
Aussie conditioner to detangle it so i
just let it let my conditioner sit on
the head and then i'm so to detangle I
do brush from like the bottom on up to
the top yes I am as I would do with my
natural hair so I mean honestly at me I
still love this hair I still would
recommend a pet I still would buy this
hair cuz like I said it's not like a on
one thing and started to shed in like it
doesn't shed throughout the deal
anything like that but I do want you to
be a will when you go to detangle this
hair like all the time I feel like yeah
all the time
the hair is still full it's still big
like you can't tell that the hair shed I
feel like the hair is still the same
density as when I got it and when I made
the way originally but overall you guys
I just feel like the tannin definitely
exceeded my expectations I mean I didn't
think that I will really feel this way
about his hair like when I
I really love this hair I love this hair
