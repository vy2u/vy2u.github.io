hey guys come back with another video
and this is going to be a update video
on the levee hair um wig that I did like
a month ago so yeah this is basically
going to be a month I meant a mush this
is basically going to be a one month
update on the hair so if you didn't see
that video I'm going to link it below so
that video was basically my initial
thoughts on her hair and how the hair
held up after I bleached it and now I'm
back to give you the full breakdown on
how the head held up after a month how
that a month as the bleaching it so yeah
like I said I will leave that link in
the description box just in case you
guys want to go check out the first
video and just in case you didn't check
out that video basically this is a lace
front wig I'm looking down because I
forgot myself so this is a lace frontal
wig it's a hundred and eighty percent
density this is Peruvian silky straight
I have it in the color 1b and I have it
in the cap size medium and a length that
I have is 22 inches also the head did
not come like this I did bleach this
hair and put this color over the top of
the bleach so yeah it did come as a
straight-up
1b color so you would have to so you
would have to color the hair if you
trying to achieve this look and a mile a
video on this week I also mentioned what
colors are you just in case you want to
achieve this look so now that I have
your brain all refreshed let's get into
this video and let me tell you guys how
this hair has been treating me as it's
been a process and you should everything
like that so yet basically I did go
ahead and wash the hair so basically
after I washed the head this is how the
hair turned out and I just let it air
dry and dry
- like this you very very loose wave
pattern which I really really like is
definitely it's given me all sorts of
beachy vibe which I really really love
so yeah and it was like the color I feel
like the color with deeper difference in
my first video I did want to tweak so I
definitely think that I definitely think
that the color this is it and once I
went ahead and washed it and also I do
not have this glue down to my head I
only had my stress adjusted and it fits
my head really good and snug and I also
putted it on the side because I did I
was wearing in the middle but I wanted
to wait inside because I got tired of
the shot part so yeah I wanted to wear
it in its natural state and I felt like
it would look better on the sides and in
the middle so I definitely liked it and
I did cut baby hairs in this lid and I'm
just using the baby hairs none of my
hair is out and I also added consuela
not consider like I stated I am also
edit finishing powder into my parts so
my part is late and slate okay honey my
part is everything to me right now you
what this looks like it's coming out of
myself look I'm not even I like okay so
basically I have this new way of laying
my baby hairs on my wig so um I don't
know if somebody has done it already
I'm pretty sure it's on my head but yeah
basically if while the head is when
still one the mannequins head what i do
is i already i basically mold the baby
hairs how I want them to be I just feel
like it's much easier during the baby
hairs on the mannequin here and just
letting it set because we try to put on
makeup after it or just like trying to
do your baby hairs with makeup when your
face and then it just coming off and
stuff it can be really messy so yeah I
just felt that to be so much more easier
so yeah easy breezy baby so um that's a
quick tip just in case any of you guys
- tried it and I did not hold my hair my
baby has won while the weight was on my
head I did it on the mannequin and then
I just let it dry and a heart and like
this and when I put it on my head it
just really really really perfectly so
I'm definitely digging that this hair
has been shedding it doesn't shed really
bad but it sheds more than I wanted to
when I watch it as I watch it like all
the shedding mrs. Dunham said but I
feeling like all the head Shanon down my
face you know so yeah and before the
hair was bleached like the pea was
totally fine so the fact that the hair
is shedding is it solely because of the
bleaching like of course your head being
processed and all those chemicals has
been you know processed in the hair so
the hair will get damaged if you don't
take care of it so um and it all ended
hair also is a little dry you can't like
sit which you can definitely feel it so
in order to help that you can always go
in in deep condition the hair which I
did and it made this hair come alive you
guys like it definitely made like the
360 so yeah definitely if you're
struggling with shuttin su XT you bleach
gel wigs and you wanted to stop oils but
like it's really dry definitely deep
conditioner hair now I don't really know
know like legit these conditioning packs
that you can use I know they I'm sorry
I'm sweating I know they have like a
argan oil one um that I've used before
and it was pretty good I think it's like
red and yellows and like a real yellow
pack if you know what I'm talking about
again what I did to decondition this
hair is I use my ulti a shampoo and just
saturated the hair and all the
conditioner I say champagne all Z
conditioner and I'll put it in a
big and after supply see big in the
microwave and it put it on five minutes
and I like the bank took okay
and I just let the head go the moisture
and when I read that out it was nice
so as I did that the dryness really like
went away and it feels so soft and
bouncy and as far as like the shedding
this hair does like snag and still sheds
but it was not anything it doesn't share
anything like it was when I watched his
head so yeah it definitely is much
better than it was before
but again it was bleach so if the hair
has been through some chemical changes
which it's okay but the hair is still
intact and it's still belong and can we
just look at that put one more time and
I'm sorry off for all this sweat and I
version sweating a lot in all my videos
it's been hot I'm sorry
so yeah yeah it's been like really hot
and my body is just not you so only the
T try now so the sweat is just helping
my body adjust to the heat so yeah I
just made it up but I'm sure mix it um
so yeah I really don't have anything to
say this is just a one month update on
the LED the hair that I review so yeah I
hope you guys enjoy this video so it's
pretty quick but I just wanted to be
like straight to the point
and yes how you got a real so um I will

first video about the pair and my
