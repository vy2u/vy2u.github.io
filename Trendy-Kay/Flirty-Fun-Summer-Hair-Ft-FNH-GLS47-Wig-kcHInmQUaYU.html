do that
hey guys it's Kate of course and I'm
back with another video and this week
that I'm going to be showing you guys
it's from a Friday night hair and I have
it in a GLS 47 and I have it in the
color 3 T 3 3 2 so I feel like I have
not done a video on Friday night head in
a hot minute and y'all this week I love
this freaking wig it reminds me of a wig
I did a while back on Friday night head
and it was similar to this I feel like
it was a little bit longer and it was
also in a 1 being and I kind of like did
the same style but I feel like wigs that
look like that I just gravitate more
towards this style because it's quick
it's easy and I know that it's going to
turn out right
let me clean my old 50 ever idiot REO so
the whole time I wasn't even recording
but this is what it looks like with the
earrings and like I said before like you
could put this to the side and wet like
that kind of fix up the edges I didn't
fix up the edges because you know it was
covered but look how this looks
oh my gosh that's a look um I do get
like tingling like snakes
it is like snakes and stuff so keep that
in mind and this doesn't shed a bit so
yeah keep that in mind as well I don't
know if this from the color or what the
case is but I felt like the other wig
that I did this style in from them the
quality was much better but nonetheless
I still love this wig I definitely love
the curls on it I love what you can do
to this week this part is going to ever
take me so I'm going to go cut that off
and I might just add some edges on the
side and then I'll come back and show
okay guys so I'm back and this is what
it looks like
I definitely love this week I went ahead
and took my got some igloo gel and just
like swooped some edges I didn't cut it
or anything I just literally swooped
that part and y'all look how it looks um
this week is on a small size so if you
do have a bigger size head you might not
want to adjust your stripes I feel like
you would still fit it but it's gonna be
on the snug side as far as if you have a
smaller size head you'll fit this wig
great I mean you can always adjust your
straps to adjust it to your head sides
so yeah this is what it looks like I'm
living for this color you guys I also
have another wig that I want to show you
in this color but this color is such a
good color for the spring and summer
seasons look at that
so yeah it's not really much to say
about this week and as far as how to
style it it's pretty simple and easy and
I feel like these are one of the wigs
that this is a wig that you can wear
daily and just put it on and go
especially when you already styled it so
yeah so yeah that's it for this video if
you guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in my comment section down
below
and again let me know what you think
about this wait this color yes honey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
