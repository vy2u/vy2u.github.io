get him going to city with you here you
will our covering how to get to you can
you know our go get it Oh pl-please walk
butterfly above it in an L having no
knowledge shorty hey guys so I'm back
with a another with review and this
video is going to be a giveaway so stay
tuned at the end for the giveaway
details but for now let's talk about
this week this week was sent to me a
from the same Beauty so I make sure I
leave all exams Beauty links in the
description box links in the description
box and also links to the community
education run through purchasing now
this is the brown sugar and this is in a
style
BSM Oh to the supreme and I have it in a
color number two so I'm pretty sure many
people probably overlook this physical
weighs only because it's or in the model
is gray and I'm sure if you don't have
gray hair now I paid too much attention
to this wig but actually when I thought
I was like the head I was cute like the
gray is even nice but I can't do great
right now you'll especially in like a
short style like this because it really
looked like some eyes grandmother but um
but the style the style is like one
point the cut I really like it so yes
this is the wig and this is not like a
lace wig or anything like that this is a
full on full cap unit so it comes with
no lace or nothing it's just strictly
for cat and it doesn't come with clothes
unfortunately so if you like combs and
you might have to take some bobby pins
to secure it or just stay away from this
week if you don't like homes or you can
even throw in your own homes and combs
is not that like the wig home you can
get in a pack full party like three four
dollars so it's not that hard to so in
comes to your weight if you feel like
you need
in there and I feel like the way cat
starts it's very good I don't feel like
it's too tight but I don't feel like
it's too big for my head either so if
you do have like a regular size too big
a head you can still get away with this
week I do have my stretch suggest I do
have my stress adjusted so I felt extra
secure it with my shrimp I just this is
a synthetic wig and I do not believe
that this is Caroline I'm safe now they
don't have a variety of colors in this
week which sucks because I wish is it
has more on colors to choose from but
the colors they do have available in
this wig is a 1:1 b234 which is a green
color 44 which is a great color 51 which
is a great color s1b 30 which is like a
one being mixed with like a dark blonde
color and then it has mineral grains
which of course it is another great
color
so yeah they only have like your natural
colors and then they had the one be 30
so I do feel like it is this week is
definitely - in a natural color so if
you do want to enter the giveaway you
know what it might be some older people
out there that watch my video - and he
had gray hair
anyway gritty gray waves you can
definitely get yourself a gray wing
because this week do not tangle or shed
on me and of course this is a shorter
unit so of course you don't really have
to worry about shedding or tangling oh
really
tangling because it's short but I do so
like shorter wait still do tangle I mean
I think well sure we do
shed but I haven't got any shut in from
this week y'all know I love my shorter
ways you I just feel like they make me
look so super sexy I swear they really
do and like people like they can't get
enough of me when I wear short hair I'm
trying to tell you like I don't know
what it is but it's like it's a magnet
and sometimes you know it gets
overwhelming that's why I don't really
try to unleash the short hair like that
because it just does
he's like men and women they go freaking
crazy and I'm like oh my god like oh
yeah I'm only one person I ignite and
nothing to go around so hey it's getting
animal friends ain't got another friend
so yes sir anyway enough about this I'm
just saying like shortly thank you
I don't know what it is right and the
trend of 19 or anything so when you
first get this week out of the pic it
does come I don't know if you guys have
ever brought a wig and it kind of like
has a heart coating on it or kind of
like a waxy type of coating but once you
like comb it out is fluffed out and it's
good that's what it was like the curls
were separated and it just looks like
hard like somebody spritz to head she's
a style I don't know I'm explaining it
right but y'all know what I'm talking
about I mean so complicated what I
explained stuff but the other ones have
alright so it was like that but the way
it was style
it was kind of like cylinder like
Christy side and then when I took my
vent brush and brushed it out it was
nice and fluffy looks like some curls
now when it comes to try out the peg I
feel like it looks more like this than
this and this is what I was looking at
because you will have to play with this
I'm not even a lot so if you're not
really big on wigs like that and you
really don't know what you're doing is
cause like we're acting is shortly I
will probably stay away from this week
because you do Conda is that too hard
but you will have to play parts to make
her your own so I will tell you that and
also it is this week is really thick
sedessa t is really thick up in the top
area and like really full and just like
it's a lot of he'll one this week so
keep that in mind as well and sorry I
didn't show you guys you know what I did
because I was of course rushing like
always but yes
it is really a nice week I would say is
too huh you just gotta fix like the
front how you want it and like rush out
and unless you like like the heart look
for you rush out and like kind of frame
your face like I always say all my short
wig reviews I always say like the same
exact thing and of course make sure you
have your hair bridges down really play
it because when your hair is not late
under your wing it looks really fake and
just humpy and not flat in people can
tell you have run away so yeah um but
this right here your oh my gosh like I'm
so enough
