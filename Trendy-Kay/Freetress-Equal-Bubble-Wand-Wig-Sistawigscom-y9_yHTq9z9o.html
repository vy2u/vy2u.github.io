review and most of you guys probably
already know what wig I'm wearing but if
you know this is the one curl collection
and the sounding is level one and I have
inner color number two
sister wigs was kind enough to send me
this week so I will leave the
information and my description box okay
so this wig is cute yo I'm I don't love
it but it is nice is a lot of hair and
it is pretty hot like when you receive
this unit the curls will be more defined
so I just want to hit and pluck them all
out and this is what it looks like but
it does get really frizzy when you pluck
it out so if you do decide to pluck out
um the curls on this unit I would
suggest doing anything else to this unit
after you pluck out the curls because it
probably wouldn't last as long it gets
really really really really frizzy when
you start to mess with it I also cut on
in the front because it was a little
longer it was like really overpowering
my face so yeah cuz this is big I'm
pretty sure this can get way bigger than
what it already is but this really looks
like some natural hair if you're into
like really natural type of wigs like
this that mimics like your real hair
like this for sure
looks like somebody's hair this would
definitely be the wig for you this week
has two combs and the front and
in the bag yeah and it also has a comb
in the bag with adjustable straps
now this wig fits snug so yeah just be
careful if you have a bigger size hit
this thing probably be suffocating you
here because I tried to adjust the
straps and who my head cannot breathe
like I felt like I was about to die so
now the part is really really slim and I
didn't want to pluck the part because I
felt like if I would have plucked apart
the hair it would have just been really
frizzy right here so I didn't want to do
that so basically all I did was edit my
my finishing powder to my part and I
feel like the part can be a little bit
more wider but this week it's starting
to grow on me at first when I put it on
I was like oh my goodness but it does
really look really really natural um so
yeah I don't really have much to say
about this unit it is really cute if
you're interested I'll leave all the
links in the description box but yeah
this is what it looks like I wouldn't
suggest you put heat on this I don't
even think that you can put heat on this
because the way it feels it feels like
that Kanekalon type of texture or have
you said but yet I still feel that it
gives me like it's like Kanekalon hair
oh look at that that's so cute um I
would say that if you do decide to get
this week make sure you pull out
something yeah I just because the way
that this part is like set up I don't
know I feel like it's bulky up in this
pot so you might want to put some of
your hair or leave some of your hair out
it's cute I feel like I look dry and
this wig though like it's not popping
enough for me like yes of course the
curls are like cute and stuff like that
but I don't know okay so I'm back really
quickly and um this is how
I'm going to away this week I ended up
switching it to a middle part and I
liking it way better as a middle part
like when I say I liked it way better
I'm like deeply in love with this wig
right now because it just looks so
freakin natural like y'all I definitely
definitely fell in love when I switch it
over to a middle part so if you were
curious to see how this way it looks in
the middle this is how it looks and yet
apart just looks like this and I do have
some of my edges out I'm telling you you
will need to leave to some of your edges
out but this is the end results and this
is what it looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
