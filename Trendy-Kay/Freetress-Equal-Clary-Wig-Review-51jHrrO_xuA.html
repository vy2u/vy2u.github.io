recording the video and I'm not so okay
that's hello um I have a another wig
review for you guys today and this will
be my last video for today so I saved
the ugly one for less so let's get into
this unit this is free trust equal
invisible el part wig and the style name
is Clary and the color is ot blue black
which is OTP lbk um so yeah the reason
that you can't see the lace part is
because I didn't do anything to it this
is exactly how the wig um come straight
out of the package and yeah um I
purchased this from way types calm and I
thought that the unit was going to look
like this because um the unit just looks
better on on the model then what it
looks like now so this week looks
nothing like how the UM how to unit
looks in the picture with the model
wearing it I just feel like it's so big
it is like a Yankee texture it's just
not for me that's the reason why I
didn't um pluck out the hairs to the
part because I'm not even one away this
week so there's no point of me putting
um work into this way when I'm not even
going to wear it um I feel like it's so
big right here and then it just looks
crazy you guys on me I don't know if I
mentioned but it is like really soft so
I mean it's probably some people that
really
like this wig yeah it looks really
natural because again it is like a yucky
texture um yeah I just don't like it you
guys so and I had this unit for a minute
now and I kept on putting it on just to
see if it will grow on me or if I would
like it and I just don't it's something
about like this side right here that
kills me like this side is not even that
bad but this side it's like come on that
was so thick and bulky like I do not
like that at all
so yes this is the unit I have not got
any she won't hold up I just got some
shedding right here so yeah that was one
strand but this unit doesn't really shed
or tangle it doesn't take it all I
haven't got any tangles out of this unit
um also it did not come with lace light
surrounding the edges it only came with
the part so I didn't have to cut off any
lace um yeah and also it does come with
two combs in the front and a comb in the
back with the adjustable straps so yeah
I'm pretty sure to be somebody out there
that um likes this way because I know
it's people out there that's really like
into that like Yankee natural like
really natural look like this looks like
really natural like somebody's hair
I like the texture and everything and
it's really soft I just don't like um
the style like the style is what's
bothering me especially like on this
side it just seems like really puffy oh
yeah this is what it looks like this is
what it looks like on the side
this is what it looks like in the bag
inside
so yes I've been like trying to work
with this unit you guys and it's just
not doing nothing for me um in my
opinion so yeah this wig is around like
16 inches and this unit is like a
blue-black color but you can't even
really see it hold but it's like streaks
of blue and you can definitely see the
texture of this unit it's nice I just do
not like the style or like how this part
is just like really bothering me but I
do like the color and it's really
natural especially because you're going
to have to do something to this part so
what I would do is pluck it out but
again I'm not going to pluck the pot out
because I don't plan on when this unit
may be out way I don't know but I don't
want to just waste my money like that
because that's it so if you guys are
interested in this unit this is a free
trust equals Clary and I have it in AO t
believe black color and you can purchase
this from Wiig types com I believe I
paid 17 or 21 dollars for this unit I
definitely will list um the price and
everything in the description box so I
hope you guys enjoy this wig review and
I will talk to you guys later
is what it looks like in the middle and
I definitely um I actually like this in
the middle and I think once I plug them
okay okay you guys so change your heart
yeah okay alright see so I never put
this on I actually never put this way
going as a middle part I don't know why
I was normally I don't know I think when
I just like initially put it on I was
like ill like this is ugly and I didn't
even really give it a chance
um but for some reason why did I never
put it as a middle part because I've
been trying on this week for so long to
see if it was gonna grow on me and it
never dawned on me to put the part in
the middle Tom okay so this is what it
looks like in the middle and I
definitely definitely like it now as a
middle part so yeah I definitely will
pluck this out so it could look really
natural like the heads coming out of my
scalp um yeah you guys so okay hmm all
right you know I'm a geek I cannot
believe I did not never see how this
week looks like in the middle like
that's ridiculous it looks really really
natural okay so I'm loving it you guys
so I guess it wouldn't be ugly I mean to
me it's still ugly on the side so I
would have to wear this as a middle part
I would not dare to wear this on the
side but I mean some of you might like
how the wig wig looks on the side oh
yeah okay buddy god
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
