and this wig was sent to me from shaking
go so yeah I'll leave their link and
everything in the description box this
wig is what is this is by free trust
equal is the premium deluxe least front
wig and the style is Evelyn and I had
the color TS crunch so yeah I really
really liked this week because y'all
know that I liked em and love and
obsessed with my middle part um I just
feel like some hairstyles just most most
hairstyles it works best for me the
middle part just works best
so yeah this wig is a middle part wig is
not like no side part you guys switch it
over to a middle part no it is on the
Yankee side so I definitely liked that
about it as well when I have no
complaints about this week at all um
this wig is just like a perfect everyday
sleek wig if you're looking I mean some
people don't like hair really this long
this is like 20 inches long but I mean
it's a simple straight middle part type
of hairstyle you really cannot go wrong
with this wig at all as far as tangling
and shedding I have not received any
tangling from this unit yet I'm as far
as shedding I did receive a little bit
of shedding which is probably from me
cutting off the lace but nothing like
excessive or anything like that I
haven't had any problems with this
weight and as far as like the density
the density in this weight is really
good it's not too thick not too thin but
um it is more on the thicker side and
thinner side I don't know um it is a
nice density I will give this week that
I am the color is like the color in this
unit is like where like right here is
like all like too
new types of blonde and then it's like
when you get to the back it's like mixed
with the brown like black or whatever I
don't know but I'm not really a fan of
that like the color is kind of like
weird how to mix these colors together
um yeah I'm just not a fan of that I
think this is duck root all the way
through yeah this is dog root all the
way through it did come with a lace
front and you had to cut off the lace
and they do give you a loan lace part in
the middle and the pardon I think it's
really really nice so this is what the
wave looks like and I'm really really
filming this week you guys so yes if
you're interested in this wig I will
leave the link everything in the
description box if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in the
comment section down below but her name
your name your new already your new what
a week this was like don't play so if
you're looking for like some straight
hair with a middle point this way is the
