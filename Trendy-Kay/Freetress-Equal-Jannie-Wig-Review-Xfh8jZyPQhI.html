gorgeous wig that I'm rocking on my head
right now and this is by free trust
equal is the lace deep invisible L part
wig and the style name is Jani on Janey
and I had this in a color purple black
so this is what the wig looks like on
the model and I did purchase this wig
from Wiig types calm and I believe this
wig was nineteen dollars and I think it
was no more than twenty two dollars but
you know I'm always bad with my prices
so if I'm wrong I'll definitely listed
in the description box down below
also you guys this camera is really not
picking up the purple that's in this wig
so if you would like to see the true
color of this unit then if you follow me
on instagram you can definitely check
out my Instagram and I do have a picture
that I posted up of this exact same go
ahead this week for a while now but I do
not wear often because this unit is
really really hot um I do believe I got
this a unit when it first came out and I
only wore it probably around like three
times so four times because this is my
fourth time wearing it now but yes as
you can see this unit is really really
thick so if you're not a fan of really
thick hair and that course that cost
texture then this wig might not be for
you because it's a lot of hair you got
really a fan of the overly Yankee um
hair textures and the really really
thick hair on my head it's pretty thick
but my hair does not look like this when
I flat on my hair my
err looks like this more when I blow-dry
my hair out so that's what kind of feel
is giving me like as if I was to
blow-dry my natural hair out this is how
big it is and it's so soft I haven't got
any shedding from this wig yet mmm I'm
line I did get shut in from this week
but only because I cut off the lace and
that's the only shedding that I got out
of this week but other than that this
wig does not shed at all
take hi youtube I don't have any of my
hair out but this is what the hairline
looks like and the parting space is
really good I did pluck out my part a
little bit I didn't do as much pluck I
didn't add any concealer or powder to my
part this week does has two combs in the
top area it's one comb on one side of
the part and it's another comb on the
other side of the part and it has a comb
in the back as always an adjustable
strengthing I will say is that the wig
is really really really thick and it
doesn't remind me of flat on head like
it reminds me of like as if you will
blow-dry your hair
I mean every everybody here is different
so I mean it's people out there that has
really thick hair and their hair
probably does look like this when it's
led on but for me this looks more like
my hair blow-dry absolutely love this
week so I'm going to show you guys how
it looks as a side part because I am
winning as a middle part and it does not
come as a middle part but if you do like
middle parts / side parts you can always
twist the wig and place the part in the
middle what the wig looks like on the
side so it definitely it's definitely
optional if you want to have your part
on the side or in the middle whatever
works for you
I like this wig more towards the middle
but you know everybody has their
different ways of wearing a wig so just
go with whatever works best please what
the wig looks like in the front and I
will say that this wig is around like 14
inches 14 or 12 it does has layers like
cut in the front area and I did not cut
layers in it it came like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
