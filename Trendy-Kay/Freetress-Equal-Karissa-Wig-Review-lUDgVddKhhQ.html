do and this is going to be the wig that
I will be reviewing so yeah this is my
free trust equal and it's the lace front
lace deep invisible part and the style
name is Karissa so yeah I have it in a
one being and this is what the way it
looks like on the model hey guys so
before I begin yeah I know I've been
away for a while but it's not my fault
you guys it's because I'm my internet is
not working right now
so I'm not only like film videos I can't
like upload them to YouTube because I
don't have internet connection and I
can't upload them on my phone so yeah so
this video is probably not even going to
be up until my Internet is working again
but yeah I figured I'll just film videos
until I can upload them so you guys yeah
I'm very sorry for that but I will have
lots of videos coming just to make up
for my ex a so I know this week is
pretty new but um it's a couple reviews
already out on this unit
like I said I would have gotten this
review out to you sooner but yeah I
can't upload the video so yeah I got
this um I purchased this weight from wig
types first off and I believe this wig
was 24 around like $24 so I will leave
everything in my description box because
I can't really remember the exact price
so um yeah so yeah so when I saw this
unit I was like oh my gosh I really love
this unit I hope it looks like the model
because you know how the way to be
looking on the model where they look
jacked up but this actually looks pretty
good
out of light and the hair will look
exactly like this when you get it so
yeah the wig is a nice info like I
cannot complain about this unit at all
I'm as far as shutting like this week
does shed a little bit but I mean that's
with any synthetic unit it's not like
shedding like a lot but I guess is from
when I cut the lace off the front um but
yet it does shed so keep that in mind
and as far as tangling I haven't
received any tangling yet but again I'm
pretty sure it will tangle because this
is kind of like a longer unit and I
would say this unit is around like 20 to
22 inches so again when I took it out
the package like it looked exactly like
how the picture look um the curls were a
little tighter up in this area and I
just finger comb did like this and this
is how the wig turned out so this is how
the wig turned out I didn't brush it or
anything like that so yeah and as far as
like the thickness of this unit this is
a pretty thick unit I don't think you're
going to be disappointed at all um
yeah cuz it has a lot of hair it's
really full and nice and the curls like
how the curls flip on both sides it's
perfect lines like flippy things in the
front is one point and that's something
that I look for in a unit I feel like
the curls have to be like I don't know
if that's where we're not comment down
below if you look at stuff like that
like I have to make sure like the curls
on both side because you know you have a
jacked-up side and the curls won't fall
right so I like for my unit to like fall
right on both sides because I like to
wear my part and the
I think this so let me show you what the
Parden looks like and this is what the
parting area looks like and I think the
pardon area is really really good and I
did pluck my part so yeah I didn't add
any concealer or powder I never really
do to my part unless they look like
extra fake but usually I'm okay with how
the part looks I think um I just like
the way the part looks sometimes I'll
put like concealer and powder into my
part and then it looks just like extra
fake and then I'm a it because I messed
up the part so yeah I try to leave it
alone and let it be because I feel like
when I do extra to the part um except
for plucking it
yeah it looks extra fake to me so I
think my parts look um more natural when
I just pluck them and that's it far as
the cap sides
um the cap could be tighter and I have
the strips to its tightest so if you
have like a smaller head it still fits
good with though you don't feel like
it's about to fall off your head so yeah
but um me personally I um prefer my way
to be just a little more tight but you
can definitely get away with this wig if
your head is on a smaller side like me
but if you have like a normal to a
larger size head then this will fit you
really really good and as far as the cap
construction like it is a comb in the
bag two combs on the side and it does
have the adjustable straps and it was
lace um throughout the hairline and the
lace part right here so I'm just going
to do like a quick 360 so you guys can
see what it looks like all the way
around
so I'm definitely loving this wig I'm
trying to think what wig this reminds me
of um but yeah all these wigs that's
coming out pretty much it's like exactly
the same to me
it's just it some are thicker than
others so um yeah but this is this is
definitely a nice nice unit you guys and
it comes in multiple colors it does come
in a purple color that I thought was
really nice but you know me I like my 1b
so yeah I just figured I'll get a one
because I purchased this when he didn't
have the wigs on the model so I didn't
really know which color look best or
that I would like so I just stick to
what I knew and that's a 1b and you
cannot go wrong with a one because when
I'm picking out colors I like to and
let's already know the number but when
I'm picking out colors like I like to
make sure they look realistic and not
fake so yeah this is what the unit looks
like and the curls are so like bouncy
and they just fall so perfectly you guys
like so I know some of you guys are
curious to see with this unit looks like
as a middle part and I will show you
what this wig looks like as the middle
part but the only reason I don't have it
in the middle is because I feel like up
in this area it's like a little bulky so
when I shift it to the side you can't
really see the bulkiness of this unit so
in order for me to wear this unit in the
middle I'm definitely going to take my
flat iron so this is like a low side
note um if any of you was unaware or
never tried it before but yeah basically
when the wig is like bulky in this area
I usually take my flat irons if the wig
if you can heat the way up like if you
can put heat to this week
and you can put heat to this week so
what I like to do is take my flat ons
and just flatten this part if you give
them saying like I just sit it right
here and kind of smooth it down like
right here take the flat on it and
smooth it down and just it makes
everything just lay flatter so yeah
that's something that's a little tip you
know you're having a hard time which wig
and you want it to lay right so that's
basically what I do when my wig is
looking real bulky but anyway let me
show you guys what it looks like in the
make a so this is what the unit looks
like in the middle and like I said I
love my middle parts but to me it just
looks like it could be laid down a
little flatter like it's really bulky um
right here it doesn't look too bad but
like I could just tell like it just
looks bulky so until I do that I will be
laying this wig on a side but like it's
optional you can wait to the middle just
shift it or you can wear it to the side
so yeah this is what it looks like on
the side which I still think is really
pretty but I don't like the bulkiness
that's gonna irritate me so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
