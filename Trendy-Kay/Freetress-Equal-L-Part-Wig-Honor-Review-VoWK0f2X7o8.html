long is probably it comes to my hips so
I meant like right here like my belly
button is right here so it comes past
that I must say this is like 28 inches
um but yeah I really like this wig this
is what she looks like
um I did have to pluck the part because
um it basically wasn't a part there so I
did have to pluck the part
and if I was the way this in real life
like go out with this wig I would
definitely pull out some of my hair in
the front to blend in the part so but
yeah this is what she looks like in the
back but yes I love this wig is so
pretty
um I haven't wore it so I wouldn't know
if this is like my first time really win

shut it but now I can tell you that I
had this for a couple months now and
it's been in its packaging um the ends
are kind of like a little frazzled yeah
so and um this I'm getting a little bit
of tangle in but no shouting yet but
just - hang a line and like I said
that's with any hair even synthetic hey

sometimes but um I really love her you
