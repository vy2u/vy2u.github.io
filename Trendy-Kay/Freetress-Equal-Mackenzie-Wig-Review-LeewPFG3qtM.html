another weight review and I know I've
been in my egg for not that long but
longer than usual but yeah I'm back you
guys so I'm reviewing this week that I
had on my head and this is free trust
equal lace front deep in this cool part
wig and the style name is McKenzie so
yes that's what McKenzie looks like on
the model and I have a old T turquoise I
did post a picture of this on my I G if
you haven't seen it already check it out
so this is what the wig looks like and
please excuse my face because I don't
know what's going on but yeah definitely
breaking out but don't mind it we all go
through our days but this is what the
part looks like which I am really in
love with the part so this unit is about
maybe 18 to 20 inches long and you guys
I really really love this week I did
purchase this week from wig types
now calm and it was I can't even
remember how much was but I'm Alyssa in
the description box for all you guys
that are interested this unit is like a
yekke unit is not silky at all and it's
definitely not shiny so yeah it's
perfect and it is a thick unit it's not
thin head on and you guys they have so
many colors in this unit like it's crazy
like they have purples with the dark
root like lavender purple like a whole
bunch of colors so if you interested in
this wig I definitely suggest that you
go and check out this unit and
hop on it or get it because you know how
we type weeks or when they popular they
released I'll out fast and it takes them
but ever just to restock awake so yes
okay you guys so the only thing that I
don't like about this unit is the fact
that like it's always one side of the
week that the curls fall right and then
it's the other side of the wig where the
curls do not act right and this is one
of those units where one side is always
like this side I had to really work with
this side so I don't know how it will be
for your units because I feel like every
unit is different so I don't know maybe
you guys gonna have trouble with one
side of the wig not been like the other
side I don't know but yeah I definitely
had to work with this side because this
side is not really curled like this side
this side just fall fall of soul perfect
and this I had to take my vent brush and
like make it fall like this side
basically so yeah that's one thing to
watch out for the only thing about this
unit and it's really really really
annoying I did forget to mention that it
does has two combs in the front area and
one come in the back with adjustable
straps my straps are to its tightest and
I feel like it's pretty secure on my
head so if you have a smaller head this
will probably fit you nice I wouldn't
say to smells but like it affects you
nice way you won't have to worry about
if you wake it's gonna falling off it
was not to secure this unit comes as a
middle part so y'all know I was pumped
when I when I saw this unit and I was
like okay it's a middle put because I
love my middle putts but I'm pretty sure
if you're not
a person you can definitely shift the
wig to the side to make it a side part
so yeah and vice versa because when I
get units in their side parts
I normally switch it to the middle so if
anybody was like curious to know what
the curious to see I guess what the part
looks like on its side this is what it
looks like and I definitely went be
wearing this wig both ways because I
think it looks so good on the side as
well and the curls don't really like
this I hate the side but this is what
the part looks like on the side and it's
really pretty on the side and actually
when I changed it to a side part if it's
it's fitting tighter than wood it was
when I had it in the middle that seems
weird but it is um yes it's so tight
okay so yes this is what the wigs
uh this is what the way it looks like on
the side and the side part so you guys
know I'm not really a fan of the tightly
curled hair so I think this is really
gorgeous but I'm more I like more the
loose curls so eventually I think that I
will take my flat iron and run through
it just to make the curls a little bit
loose um the only reason I have it is
because this side is like row flicked it
and I don't know how how it's really
going to turn out when I put heat to it
so I know this I will turn out right but
the curls are just so jacked up on
inside that I'm scared to do it so I
really don't know I think once the wig
starts to get older than what it is then
I will take my flat arms just to see but
yeah
so that is it for this review I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I promise I
won't be gone for too long I think I am
going to put out on a lot of videos
today and just film multiple videos
