we're there and if you see like all
these videos they're posted with me when
the same shirt I'm just trying to get
these videos out feel because I'm like
so backed up it's crazy but anyway I did
change my lip y'all so y'all forgetting
day but anyway this week was sent to me
from shake and go so I'll make sure I'll
leave the links to everything in the
description box I'm just gonna get
straight into it now this is the free
twist equal premium deluxe lift is the
style of spring and I have hide the
color one being and this is what the
picture looks like and it's just like
most poor colors that you can choose
from have two combs in the front of comb
in a bag and adjustable straps this wig
also comes with the least part now let
me show you guys what the lace part
looks like and the part is like really
really good I really really like the how
the part is and it's optional if you
want to pluck the hair I'm out of the
pot all night I did not my hair out
of the pot because I never when I'm
being lazy and number two I felt like
all I needed to do is add a little bit
of powder in my pot and I was good to go
and actually it looks pretty good now
this does not come with any lace to cut
off so of all you who don't like cuttin
off lace yes no lace um so that was
something that I liked because sometimes
I would just be tired of cutting off the
lace um they did give you like a little
slither of baby hair
it was just like whether it was right
him and all I did was swoop out it and
cut it or nothing I just swooped it um
now this week also the curls on this
week actually looks like how the motto
is and um I'm not too sure about those
curls like
I didn't really like the curls I felt
like the hair look really thin when the
curls are like that um another thing is
the part is made to be in the middle
this is a middle part wig but it just
looks so funky in the middle that I just
could not get what for you guys
so I shifted it to the side and I
brushed out the curls to try to make the
wig a pair thicker which it appeared
thicker but I just feel like I still
feel like it's kind of like skimpy a
little bit you can't really tell because
it definitely is like brushed out I took
my brush and just like really started
brushing I noticed that when I did stop
brushing the the wig starts to get more
tangling as I keep like playing with it
and brushing it so it is on the tingly
side and it also sheds a little bit I
don't know I'm just not really a fan of
this week I feel like if you do not want
to put in a lot of work on trying to fix
this wig up then this is not the way for
you because you cannot put this wig on
and go it's just unless you like the
curls like that and that's your type of
style but for me it was just too much
work and even still it's just like okay
and the hair is a bit one the Yankee
side just a little bit like a slight
Yankee feel to it
so guys this is it for my video I will
see you in my next video so yeah if you
have any questions feel free to leave it
in the comment section down below and
yeah I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
