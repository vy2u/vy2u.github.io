wig review and today I have Sammy which
is on my head right now and this is by
free trust equal um it's the lace deep
invisible L part and this is what the
picture looks like and I have her and
Opie 27 so basically that's like a ombre
color
it's the dope route and then it has the
honey blondes at the end or throughout
the his only top route on the top as you
can see at the root sorry
so yes it came in this package right
here and I don't even think I remember
how much this week was but I think I
paid $25 for it but if I'm wrong I will
list everything in the description box
but yes so let's talk about this get
more into this wig so like I said this
is a opie 27 color and it's a short fun
flirty wig so yeah this is basically
what the wig looks like the color is on
point you guys like when I say the color
looks so realistic like a really the
thing that I like most about this week
is it has dug throughout the wig like
it's it's dark root all over like I know
how I know you guys know how some wigs
come and it's just like the dark root
only right here and like if the wind
blow back or anything like you can see
you can see all of that like so
basically it's the wind flying back and
you
you don't want people to know that it's
fake are you trying to present something
real to somebody like this is definitely
a week for you because it looks so
realistic like I just love the fact that
it has the duct root everywhere so this
is what the wig looks like in the front
the side the back and it's basically um
it's basically kind of like a short bob
cut um so yeah it's like loose wavy
curls type of thing is like a real messy
look but still flirty and cute at the
same time so I'm really feeling this wig
you guys this is wrong this is really
cute okay so um the part is pretty good
it's a pretty good part um I did have to
pluck out the part because you really
couldn't see the part and that's what
happens with most of the wigs that I
purchased the part is a little it it's
no part basically so you really have to
pluck out the part I didn't put any
powder on the comb in the back I believe
is two combs
right here at your temples and it does
has adjustable straps um
the wig fits pretty good I think for a
regular to any size head I want to say a
large head a small head I have a small
head and I just adjusted my straps and
it fits securely and nice so I think
that it will fit everybody's head I
guess I mean yeah it's not uncomfortable
or anything it fits very well so um yeah
I
got any tangling or shutting from this
week I don't know if it's because it's a
shorter way or not but I'll definitely
update you guys on this week because I
will be when is quite often bins though
I love it so much and the color is 1.4
on the summer time so yes you guys if
you have any questions about this wig or
just anything in general feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
below like I said if I missed anything
um about this wig I'll definitely put it
in the description box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
