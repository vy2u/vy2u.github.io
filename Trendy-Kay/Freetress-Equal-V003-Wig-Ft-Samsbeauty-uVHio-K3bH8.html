next time that you will egg stop with
that Mel smarts and they hit hard and
while me that bag Archie out but that
make hey guys it's Kate of course and
I'm back with another video so this
video is going to be my last video I'm
posting the date okay you guys so again
this week was sent to me from Sam's
Beauty and I'll go ahead and leave all
Sam's Beauty links in the description
box just in case and if you guys are
interested so the wig I'm wearing is by
free trust equal and it's the V shape
deluxe lace front I have it in style V
zero zero three and I have it in the
color SOP twenty three or four fifteen
so this is what the star cut looks like
so I actually purchased this week a
while ago and a blonde color which is
which is right here so I'm gonna you
know show you guys the construction
actually I bought this when this style
first came out because looking at the
stock card I thought that it was like
looking at the stock car I thought that
this week was gonna be like bomb it and
when I got it and tried to do I actually
didn't like it as much as I did when I
saw it online so yeah it's been sitting
in my closet for god knows how long and
I actually forgot that I had it so when
I looked at the when I looked at it
again online I was like okay Sam's
beauty sent me this wig and then
something clicked like look because I
think that your head this week already
and I actually did so I'm kind of mad
that I picked it this week I want to
share with you guys because I didn't
really like it that much but whatever so
this is what the week looks like and I
have it in SOP 23 for 15 and that's
basically like a coppery orange color
which I love love love the color I'm so
here for this color you guys and the way
it's just like set up like how the duct
root just gradually goes into this like
hyper e orange color I absolutely love
as far as the construction of the
this week Fitz so big so if you do have
a bigger size head I feel like this
would be a great fit for you so I'm just
gonna go ahead and take this out so I
can show you guys the construction so
when you get it of course it's going to
be a reps in this so this is the pardon
the pardon is decent I feel like you
don't need to add any I mean I feel like
you don't need to pluck the part I did
go ahead and pluck the part just right
here by the hand line because it was
close and just a little bit but as far
as everything else I did not pluck it
all's I did was and my finishing powder
and to the part and this is what it
looks like I definitely definitely think
that this part looks really realistic
I'm definitely in love with the part so
anyway this comes with the soft lace
this gives you two combs in the front a
comb and a bag and adjustable straps
also the part is a left side part so if
you're a left side part type of person
you'll definitely love this week and
I've been finding a lot more weeks
that's been coming as a left part which
I know a lot of you are happy about but
yeah and if you don't like left puss and
you like a right pugs I'm pretty sure
you can slide this one to the right side
and it would give you the same type of
look so yeah and if you wanted to wear
this in the middle you could you know
shift the wig to the middle and you
should be fine
so this is how the week looks straight
out of the pack and this is what I was
going through my blind faith so of
course I bought a full on color so yeah
this is what the wig looks like a
straight out of the pet and yeah it's
really not much that you have to do to
this wig it already comes like this as
you
seen already um so yeah I don't have
like any baby hairs out or anything like
that like I said I'll only pluck the
part right here and then I edit my
finishing powder now as far as tangling
and shedding I do get a lot of tangling
on the bottom of this wig
shedding I don't really get too much
shut-in but the tangling for me on this
week is definitely a problem I really
don't like how much it tangles also this
is a Yankee texture it's more so like a
light Yankee texture and this week is
not too full it's kind of on the thin
side but it doesn't look thin
but it kind of like fills then if you go
to the same the only thing that I don't
like is of course the tangling that I
get and I don't like how it's cut up in
this top part so that's what's probably
turning me off from this wig it's just
like these pieces that's like not like
this I don't know I'm kind of picky when
it comes to weeks they look like this so
yeah overall this week is OK for me I'm
really not a fan I don't know I feel
like I don't like the way that the curls
are in front like right here and then I
just feel like the week itself is just
really big on my head but overall like I
said it's a-okay we
and as you can see the part is where
Hugh
so yeah it's straight out I feel like it
lays really flat I feel like it would
lay even flatter if the weak fit my head
but like I said it is a bit big but this
color is absolutely gorgeous I freaking
love this color I actually think I like
this week
better than the other color I don't know
let me know what you think I'm this
blond color is just too dark for so yeah
this is what it looks like straight out
the package in like I said you really
don't have to do much to this week and
I'm really not getting much shedding but
like I said it does tangle up on the
bottom because it is such a long way so
I'm gonna turn it around
okay guys so this is it for this video
if you're interested in this wig I'll go
ahead and leave all the links in my
description box just in case you guys
want to purchase it and that's it for
this video I hope you guys enjoy I'll
