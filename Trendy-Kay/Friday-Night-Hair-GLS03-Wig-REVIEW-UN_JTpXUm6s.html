review and this hair is from Friday
night hair and it is the unit that I'm
laying on my head right now so I figured
since I'm on a roll today I might as
well get another wig review up for you
guys while I had the time so this is by
Friday night hair and this is the GLS oh
three and a color 1b and this is this is
what the picture looks like and yeah um
for those of you who don't know or are
not familiar with Friday night hair it
does come with tape just in case you
would like to take down the lace but
usually I don't use the tape I just
adjust my straps to the tightest and put
it on my head like that but yeah it does
come with Tim like deeply deeply in love
and I say this all the time but every
Friday night head unit that I have
gotten from them have been really really
nice actually by accident because I
meant to order the GLS 35 I don't know
how I got these two mixed up and I was
so mad when I look back and I was like
oh my goodness I put up you know 0-3
instead of 35 but in this step 0-3 yes
0-3 instead of 35 but I absolutely like
it these curls remind me of wand curls
like if he was too long curl your hair
that's basically what it looks like so
basically um this unit comes with two
combs in the front and it comes with a
comb in the back and adjustable straps
they do give you around two inches worth
of Pardons base more towards like up in
the
Aria they give you more less than on the
side so the pardon is longer than this
part but I put my part slightly on the
side so that's why um the part the part
is shorter than you parting it in the
middle and it'd be and it being longer
so yes let me show you what the parting
looks like in the middle I don't try
mess up this week because I got it where
I want it but I don't know if you guys
can see that but that's what the party
looks like but I did pluck my part just
a little bit like I plucked out a few
hairs just to make it stay where I
wanted to make the part stay where I
want it to stay this wig is around like
30 inches it's like really really long
like it's super like tonight brush these
curls out this is how the curls come
when I took it out the package I didn't
finger comb them or anything but this is
just going to be like a quick weight
review because I just want to show you
guys just in case you're um thinking
about purchasing a unit from Friday
night hair this might be an option for
you is really long so if you do not like
long hair you probably won't like this
one unless you cut it so as far as
tangling and shedding I have not really
got a lot of shedding out of this week
but I did get a few tangles and I guess
that's because it is a curly unit but I
don't plan on like brushing it or
running my fingers through it because it
is currently I just want the weight to
be the way that it is so I just leave it
alone
but this wig is so gorgeous you guys I'm
glad I picked the wrong wig because I
was like really thinking the whole time
like
I'm not going to like this week but I
love it
if you have any questions or anything
feel free to leave it in a comment
section down below and I do respond to
everybody's messages if I can but just
leave it in a comment section down below
and I'll get back to you and I'll talk
to you later you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
