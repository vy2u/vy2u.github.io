Friday night hair and a lot of people
were waiting on this um review for me to
review this unit so yeah this is the
hair that I was weighing in one of my
pitches and a lot of people were curious
as to what hair that was so yeah this is
this hair right here um yeah I just do
this on my head so to me it does look a
little Wiggy up in the front area
because yeah I just put it on um mainly
because I already did a review on this
hair and what took me so long is because
some of my files like some of my clips
to the first review I'm got deleted or
whatever the case may be so yeah I had
to basically do this review all over
again so that's why I'm doing it now and
I'm basically just like over it yeah I
did really just not want to put this wig
back one um because it's not even what
y'all think okay this unit is from a
Friday night hair and it is the GLS oh
six so this is like a older unit and I
have this in the color you 27 so
basically what that is it's basically
it's like a 1b right here and then
underneath it's blonde I really don't
know how to feel about this blonde
streak right here and it's like not even
a lot like I'm pretty sure you can cut
it off because it's just like this much
hair like the like is not a lot of hair
also um so like I could cut it off if I
wanted I really do not care for this
little patch thing in the back so yeah
if you do like the style of this unit
donate do have this if you do like the
style of this unit though they do have
just a straight up one be without the
blonde part in the back but I mean if
you like the blonde part in the back
then you know that's cool too but I'm
just really not a fan of it I'm not a
fan of this week period I'm the wave
pattern and all of that like the way
these way legs are are pretty but um I'm
turned off because like this wig sheds
and tangles a lot like the shedding is
okay but the way that this unit tangles
up on me is like it turns me off so bad
and like I just don't want to deal with
it and this is the first time this has
ever happened to me because I had
nothing I have nothing but like great
experiences with Friday night hair and
this is the first week that I just like
literally hate like I hate this unit so
much um
it is like shedding a little bit crazy
but um I don't know you guys like I'm
just I'm just not really a fan of this
unit like I can't do nothing with it
because it tangles on me so much and
it's just like what like if it didn't
shed before like it shut it down like
this just this is crazy
I feel like this style you have to like
wear on the side this is the only way I
really like this unit if it's on the
side um and yeah so let me back up so
you guys can like really get the full
effect because I'm all up in your face
like in the camera but um see it's like
I cannot do like I can't do anything to
this unit it
tangles so bad like I swear y'all I know
y'all was accent about this unit but it
took me a while to redo this unit
because I just did not want to review
and waste my time on this sheet doing a
video on this unit once again like like
I'm sorry I love Friday night hair but
this wig sucks big time like it's so
freakin tingly um this is the part in
space huh
but yeah y'all know they give you this
much corn in space but yes so for all
you guys that were waiting on this
review yeah this is it right here umm I
mean if you want to purchase this unit
you can find it at Friday night head
comm so good luck maybe it's not all
maybe it's just me maybe it's just a bad
batch or maybe it's just the unit that I
have but I can definitely tell you that
this thing sheds and tangles like
nobody's business like it's just turning
me all the way off light no but this is
how long it is it's a pretty nice length
it's about 22 inches so yeah I'm going
to end this video right here because
it's really not much to talk about so
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
