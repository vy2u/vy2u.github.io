communicating good outdoors need ok guys
come back with a another week review and
I would sit this week from a Friday
night hair so I'll make sure I leave all
the Friday night hair links in the
description box just in case you like
this wig and when a purchase it so I am
wearing the style GLS 118 and the color
1b so this is a synthetic lace front
unit they also give you two combs in the
front a comb in the bank what's
adjustable shred it does have like a
nice kind of stretch to it and isn't it
wasn't that tight or anything like that
in my head and I do have my strength
adjusted and the way it fits
not so tight tight but it's comfortable
tight where after like it's not going to
fall off my head you didn't plan this is
the reminiscent of the GLS 15 it just is
it it kind of almost looks like in the
fact that I cut it shorter messages kind
of look exactly like year less 15 but I
love wigs like this they are currently
like this and has this type of curl
pattern it just looks so so natural like
this way it's pop in you guys and the
fact that you really don't have to pluck
out the curls when I really don't have
much to say I want to make this video as
quick as possible
so yeah I'm as far as tangling and
shedding I have not received any tangle
and of course because I'm not running my
fingers through but this is a curly unit
so I'm sure that this wig will tangle on
you but like I always say from our curly
units you really don't have to brush it
or really run your fingers through I
mean you can do like that but you really
don't have to like rip through this week
and shove it I did receive a little
shedding from here so but it's probably
from me cutting off the lace so yes your
look
yeah I'm just going to insert a clip of
how I got this look which I really
didn't do much I only like Plus out some
of the curls but you you'll so this is
basically how the wig will come the only
thing I did do off-camera is cut it down
a little make sure that it came like
literally right here and I kind of cut
it up to here so I only cut like this
much off the bottom and I just kind of
like frame my face a little bit because
it just was one left going straight down
to right here so yeah I had to frame my
face just so it can give the wig some
definitions and now I want to I'm
debating whether I should pluck these
out all night I really don't want to
and then
basically my head underneath is braided
in cornrows I probably had like eight or
nine cornrows going straight back so
they're pretty that they're not big or
anything like that and I also had my
black stocking camp underneath and yeah
and I also just brushed all of my baby
heads out and of course I don't have
nothing else out but if you want to get
a little more natural of course you will
leave just a little tad bit of your hair
out in the front me I'm okay with this
because I'm just like I don't want to
show you guys like the potential of this
wave so yeah and also there is the
potted space
but again I do have a black stocking cap
on the day and let me know if you think
this looks like a GLS 50 or is it me am
I just tripping you guys but I would
love to hear what you think in the
comment section so yeah let me know but
I definitely and think that this is like
GLS is twin
I meant GLS ISM GLS 1528 oh but yeah I
will see you in my next video guys and I
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
