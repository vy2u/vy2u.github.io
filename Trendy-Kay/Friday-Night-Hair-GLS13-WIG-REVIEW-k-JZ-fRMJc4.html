review and this is the way that I'm
currently wearing now so yes let's get
into this video because I'm trying to
like squeeze a lot of videos in for you
guys because I haven't been around so
yes this is Friday night hair and this
is the GLS 13 and I had this in a 1b
so yeah this is what the car looks like
and it also comes with tape just in case
you want to take the lace down but yeah
I don't do any um of that tape and stuff
I just put it on my headlight and it's
secure how it is and I don't use the
combs the only thing that I do use is
the adjustable straps so okay this is
not how I'm gonna wear the wig even
though even though I really like um the
curl pattern and everything but it's
kind of thin um like this so I do want
to brush it out but I wanted you guys to
see how it looked before I brush it out
because I know some people appreciate
you know me showing y'all how it looked
before I do what I do to it so yes this
is the way the curls are and I think
they are gorgeous you can definitely
wear it like this or you can brush them
out so yes this is about 18 inches long
and it's very soft I haven't got any
shedding um or tangling yet even though
I didn't really run my fingers door but
yeah it's going to be a little tangling
because this is a curly type of unit but
as far as shedding I have not received
any shedding at all so that's good but
I'm pretty sure this is going to shed
and it will tangle up on you so yeah let
me show you guys what the part in space
is looking like which I can appreciate
eight departing space because they I
mean it's the lace for it's not like
it's a lace part or anything like this
that I met anything like that so they do
give you like a little bit of you know
room to work with when it comes to
pardon but yeah I mean is at least is
not like skimpy like this like a little
part can't deal with it but I mean I can
definitely work with this part in space
so this is not a long unit at all it's
definitely a every day way you can
definitely wear this every day and I
love the length because normally I get
the longer units I only got a few units
that were on a short side but I do
appreciate the shorter left the shorter
left units because you can definitely
wear them every day so yeah so I'm going
to be right back I'm going to brush this
out with my vent brush and show you the
end results okay so I'm back and this is
what the unit looks like brushed out I
just use my vent brush and I just brush
the curls out um one thing that I can
say about this unit is when you brush it
out it does become more tingly I mean
it's not like really like tingly where
you can't deal with it but it definitely
got a little tingly but I can definitely
definitely appreciate this unit more
that it's plucked out I love it is so
much more plucked out it just looks
really really natural like some good
hair like no shine it's just perfect
like what come on
so I don't think I mentioned this but
this does has two combs in the front
area and it has a combing bag with the
adjustable straps um this unit does fit
very snug on my head so and I do have my
strips adjusted to as tight and so if
you have a small head then you probably
love this unit because it fits very very
good I mean if you have like a normal to
larger sized head I'm pretty sure you
don't adjust the straps it will be just
fine and fit just fine so yeah I am like
I'm really feeling this like the length
and everything it's like really really
really cute so yeah and this lace does
go from ear to ear and I already showed
you the pardon so yeah but look at that
like what this is amazing I really like
this unit y'all so yes I will leave all
the links on in my description box down
below so you can check out this unit if
you have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
below so I'm going to do a quick 360 so
you guys can see what the unit looks
like all the way around so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
