ever since I had filmed a video but yes
I'm back and I'm here to stay you guys
so yeah the reason that I have not been
filming videos is just because like it's
no really no reason to why I haven't
really felt videos because I had the
time it's just that I just didn't feel
like it um I just you know I sometimes
you're just not in the mood so yeah I
just have not been in like a good mood
to film videos I haven't even really
been posting on my Instagram page so
yeah um and I just feel like um like my
luck has not been very good I'm over the
past week or two so yeah but today I
feel much better
I definitely have a lot of videos that I
need to get out and that I want to get
out so yeah um you should be saying um a
lot more of me you guys so yeah let's
get into this video by the way um
because I know a lot of people are
always curious about what I'm wearing on
my lips so before we get started I had
one colour-pop cosmetics I don't know if
you're familiar with colour-pop but most
of you guys should be I'm but I'll leave
it there our website and a link in my
description box but yeah this is that
matte liquid lipstick and it's in the
color limbo so I'm starting off with my
head like this my head is not rated
normally if I'm lazy it would just be
like this cuz this is how I'm wearing my
hair regularly without awake this is
just how I with my hair so yeah I had my
head in a ponytail and yeah
I would like to do like some natural
hair type of videos and stuff because I
am natural and stuff like that but I
don't know I mean so
disappointed with my hand sometimes but
I feel like lately I've been really
loving my real hair so I haven't been
like when weights like I normally do
because you know my head is like winging
you're just a little bit and I'm kind of
proud of the length of my hair down so
yeah I've been trying to like wear my
hair but when I do with my hair only
within a ponytail so anyway okay I
didn't tell Cho to Jeff but yes I'm just
kind of like happy to be talking to
y'all and happy to be filming a video um
just because I just missed you guys and
I like you guys feedback and stuff like
that and when you guys ask me stuff and
yeah I just like you know my subscribers
and welcome to all my new subscribers
and yeah welcome so you guys will be
getting more videos so yeah okay I feel
like I'm just gonna be talking for
forever and this video is like will be
super long but yeah so yeah okay anyway
this is um I'm going to be doing a
weight review um on the wig what am I
talking about
I'm gonna be doing a wig review on this
unit right here from Friday night hair
so yeah if I can get out of the packet
if you package if you're not familiar
with Friday night hair
yeah it's a bomb company I love them
they do um lace fronts you lace front
units as well as like um like human hair
units and stuff like that but they're
not really known for that they're known
for their synthetic lace fronts so yeah
um this is what it comes in and then
also they have it wrapped in the little
net and yet I have like the stuff in the
inside so I don't think I ever like show
you guys what this looks like when I do
on the Friday night hat think I just
come straight on the video and like I
have it
already so we're just gonna see how it
is turn out well yeah I want to tell you
guys like it's nothing really special
about me putting on these units because
I don't really do nothing like I brush
my baby hair out and put it on so yeah
anyway I had the GLS 20 and I have it in
at 4 3 2 7 so this is what it looks like
and it's a really long unit it does not
have any dark roots but we want to see
what that looks like but I do like like
the brown colors and I figured like
spring is approaching oak like spring is
here basically whoa no not basically
like spring is here so you know even
though I like lighter colors whenever it
really don't matter I don't go by rules
or anything like that I just wear
whatever I feel like I want to wear but
yeah this is definitely a good color for
the spring light it doesn't have the
dull fruits but you can add up roots to
your wig and I did do a video where I
show you guys how to apply to Dell fruit
to week so I will leave that link in the
description box as well but yes so let
me cut off the lace because I mean I
could cut the lace off in front of the
camera but it would just be extra hard
like anyway so this wig has two combs on
the side I guess this will be like by a
temple area and then it has a comb in
debate with the adjustable straps so
yeah I'm going to put this unit on and
then I'm going to come back and show you
guys what it looks like ok guys so this
is what the unit looks like I did not do
anything to this unit this unit is
pretty long I would say it's around 24
inches 24 to 20
six let me schoolbag so you guys can see
exactly where it comes so yeah
I'll probably say like 24 inches um your
let me time my baby has have not been on
fleek
I feel like this might be just me
because this is just how I feel like my
units come off more realistic but yeah I
like to leave my baby hair out and not
not like I don't leave know how just
like I had my baby hits late but lately
like they just have not been known but I
mean it's cool
this unit is tight I do have it like
strip across like this so it is really
really tight um but yeah this so I mean
if you have like a larger size hey I'm
pretty sure that you can still get away
with when this week just don't adjust
your straps and you should be fine but
yeah I absolutely love the color of this
unit um the lace is from ear to ear
so if you want it to like pull it up
into a pony or however you know 20 weeks
but yeah um this week it's absolutely
gorgeous like I love this wig I love the
color um and they do offer this wig and
a 1b as well just in case you don't want
to UM wear color you can um go with the
1b so this is what it looks like in the
middle um I'll probably have to fix it
someone but it's not really bad in the
middle but I definitely love um
this hair on the side better for me it
just like works better so even though I
love my middle point sure I did not
brush this unit out or anything like
that this is how the waves come
originally
so so as far as like tingling and shut
it is concerned with this unit like this
unit does tangle um because it is a long
gait unit but I feel like you shouldn't
have to like brush out like these are
like these waves are so loose that I
feel like um you shouldn't have to do no
type of Russian to anything like that so
yeah so as far as tangling like it does
tango
I'm it is a longer unit so be aware that
I'm pretty sure that this week will
start tangling as far as shedding I have
not gotten any shut-in from this unit
all pretty sure this week is well I mean
it's synthetic so what do you expect but
it's not like nothing too crazy that
would make me like not love this wig or
like this wig at all
that's it for my video if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in a
comment section down below yeah um if I
love how anything I'll definitely leave
it in the description box I also leave
on Friday night hit in the description
box their website and yeah so I'm this
is the usual yeah I will see you in my
next video you guys so high</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
