patiently waiting for me to do this
review and the reason it took me so long
to do this review for this hair is
because I recorded it but you ready it
was a lot of distractions going on and I
didn't feel like I should put that up so
that's why it took so long for me to
post this video because like I have to
do it over so this is me after weeks
doing this review over for you guys I
just hate when I have to when I already
record a video and then I have to do it
over so it's just like I'm just like
dreading to do this video but anyway I
absolutely love this hair and that that
done this is Friday night hair GLS 41 so
if you guys are interested in purchasing
this unit I will leave the links to this
wig down below in my description box but
yes honey like this hair is everything
um yeah and you can see it still holding
up one thing that I don't like about
this hair as it gets a little bit
tangley I guess from a being curly so um
this week did not come like this the
curls were a bit more defined and I just
took my I can't remember I took my REM
brush or I took my fingers it's probably
not big brush and try to brush out the
curls but it started to get a little bit
tangley but this was the end results and
again I've been um rocking this weight
on and off I don't really wear my wigs
consistently I normally like when put
them up and then wear it again like I
don't like really really like weighing
like that unless I have like a favorite
which you all know what my favorite wig
is um but yeah and it's holding up
pretty good
so like beware of the tangling when you
try to pluck this unit out it will
tangle but again like Bierzo this is a
curly unit you won't have to do much of
anything after you are pluck it out and
the
the more it gets like older the better
and more natural um it becomes like it
looks like really really good it's just
like some diva big like hair the color
is on point I think this is a 430 if I'm
not mistaken so this week comes in a 1b
and it also comes in a 430 and you look
at my previous videos I was telling you
how Friday night head came out with some
new units um and I did a review or two
of their newer units well this is
another one of their newer units that
they posted on their website so yes go
check it out um this wig is around 18
inches long 16 when it's not stretched
um it is a lot of hair is a good
thickness um it is not hot or heavy on
your head because you know it is getting
what is hot outside down so I know a lot
of people don't really like all the hair
but I mean I've won it out in the heat
and I don't know um I mean it's a tad
bit hot but it doesn't really bother me
that much but like overall um this way
is Bob you got I mean it's cool I
enjoyed this with a lot I love this wig
I really don't have any complaints um as
far as shedding this wig does not shed I
like have not received any shedding from
this unit what else um the construction
is two combs in the front two combs in a
bag and adjustable strips if you're not
familiar with the friday-night hair um
what else
it is um I would say it's big hair
friendly I do have my straps adjust it
tight so if you do have like a bigger
hit I think that this wig will fit you
just fine and I think that that's it and
again it does has lace from ear to ear
and they give you two inches worth of
parting space of course I'm that's for
those of you who are not familiar with
the friday-night hair but again I will
the linka everything in my description
box if you have any questions about this
unit or anything feel free to leave it
in my comment section down below
but yes your like this wig is giving me
so much life and here we go again with
the distractions like a nice stigma how
can we think you steak oh my take the
case you want your wife oh go get it
from downstairs you catch a snake can't
close the door yeah that was my
distractions in my last video so known
that I film my videos when he's napping
but just like has not been working out
for me because he's getting to that
point where like the nets are like I
don't know they're not really working or
it's just his schedule it's really
changing up on me but yeah y'all know I
love my Friday night hair and if you
don't have this week you need to go get
it because Bo this is cute
Oh another thing I did I meant I did
what was about to say oh yeah
another thing the as far as like this
bang part it already like the wig
already comes and layers so you don't
have to worry about cutting it I think I
did did snip like a little piece off
right here but as far as like the layers
and how this is short right here like
this bang it already comes cut like that
so you don't really have to do too much
cut in to this wig and yeah I think that
this color just complements my skin tone
so freakin well like I love for 30s like
yo ah but this is a nice brown color I
feel like if you have like a darker skin
tone this will look so pretty on you I'm
not even going to laugh Mike I feel like
it just set it off like it would be
poppin on a darker skin and I don't know
but yeah I'm sorry this is gonna be like
a quick video I always say that
I start editing my videos they're longer
than what I thought but yeah I will see
you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
