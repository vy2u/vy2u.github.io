wave review and this week is going to be
from Friday night hair so this is the
wig on my head and I am like really
feeling this week you guys like this
week has given me so much life like when
I took this out the package I was like e
eyes well when I did what I did to it I
was like yes but when I first took out
the package I was like yeah I don't know
about those but anyway so this is from
Friday night hair and it is the GLS 29
and a 1b
I don't know if you can see it but that
is what it looks like
so yes you guys let's get into this
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous wig this is a
lace front wig so if you're not a fan of
lace front wigs then this video is not
going to be for you but um it does give
you a good amount of Parden space and I
think it gives you like two inches I'm
not even sure hold on but yes I don't
know if you guys can see it but that's
what it looks like so yes I feel like um
the side I feel like with the head once
you decide it just works better with
this type of style because it is so big
I feel like when it's in the middle like
it's like you can't really see my face
like it's overpowering my face so I do
have the head swoop to the side and as
you can see it's just the overall
gorgeous gorgeous weight like the curl
one point you're like it's so nice and
long so um this week does have a comb
right here it's like close to your
temple area and it has a comb on the
other side by your temple area and it
also has the comb in the back and it has
a adjustable strand I will say though
that the cat size does fit a little big
because my other um Friday night hair
that I had my unit it was it fit my head
like really good and snug this one I
have it like tight like two is tightest
and it's still a little bit loose like
I'm comfortable with weighing it but I
just would like it to be a little bit
tighter and um as far as the combs I
don't get down with the combs yo cuz I'm
telling y'all now I don't know I can't
speak for everybody because I know some
people be like oh now I got had combs
but I'm telling you like these combs and
these wigs will um Boutin your hair out
and alone like I'm trying to tell you
like you won't see it like right then
and there but as time goes on like yeah
and we'll be going you'll look back at
me like I could have sworn yesterday I
had had no like it tears your hair out
so acting my hand started like sitting
in the front I'm sorry oh no these combs
gotta go so I am leaving with the cones
like that job and this is gonna be like
a pretty quick video because there's
some fact that I'm about to run out
somewhere but I just had to get this out
here y'all because y'all need to hop on
this wig like seriously like this wig is
so cute but on anyway this week is a
long unit and it's about to my arm is
these hips y'all I don't know but they
come right here so whatever that is um
so it's probably around like 26 to 28
inches
I will say though they only like the
longest part is kind of thin because all
of my hair is put in the front end it's
just this part like you see oh it's just
thin right here so I was thinking about
cutting it but yeah and then the rest so
I would probably say like 24 really
because they only give you this much
hair that's longer than the rest but um
but yeah so I'm going to give you guys a
quick 360
I took it out of the park and
immediately I like the wig but I really
didn't like the curl patterning that it
was given to me so um this is brushed
out this is not how the curls come
originally or like the curl pattern
where the lace is is different from
where the the tracks are like when I got
it the wave pattern is like it is now
like for the top but the bottom part it
was like really like the fun and it was
tight and I wanted it to match the top
part so I just figured me brushing it
out with my paddle brush I don't have it
in here but it's just like your basic
paddle brush I brushed it out I started
from the bottom and I worked my way up
to the top and this is the look that I
got which I love so much so yes and as
far as Shannon when I was brushing it
out it did shed a little bit but it
wasn't too bad
and this week does get um it gets tingly
but I'm not really worried about it
because I don't feel like I should have
to brush it any more over on my fingers
through it because it is a like a wavy
curly type of unit so I just leave it
how it is so um yeah this is basically
what it looks like and I just weigh it
to the side because I feel like it just
works for me better because it's such
like so much hair it's a lot of hair so
if you don't like a lot of hair yeah you
probably will not like this because um
the more you brush it the bigger it
again because it wasn't it was big when
I got it but I don't think it was this
big so
that's what it looks like the headline
is like really really realistic but yeah
I just swoop some of my baby heads out
um and that was it like I don't even
have any of my hair out at least I don't
think I think a little bit right here
but but look at this you're like the
curl pattern it's like I love it so so
if you guys are curious to see how this
wig looks and I'm at how the part looks
in the middle I will feel free to show
you that but it's just like oops sorry
it's just like a lot of hair
oh and to all my new subscribers like
thank you and welcome yeah you're being
like a geek today like I'm just feeling
his hair so much like it got me on cloud
nine I guys so I really hope that you
enjoyed this um
wait review and I'm really happy with
this wig um I love it so you guys tell
me what you think but if you're
definitely looking for like a long wavy
type of curly weight that you can just
don't want and look glamorous and
gorgeous like this is definitely the wig
for you um yes again I got this from
Friday night head calm it was like
around fifty dot well you might say it
was fifty dollars um but yeah so I don't
know I feel like I'm forgetting
something but if I am and I didn't say
it I will leave it in the description
box and if you guys have any questions
about this unit um you definitely can
feel free to ask me anything and I will
write back or respond back but yes bye
you guys and I love you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
