review so yeah this is the week that I'm
going to be revealing and this is by
Friday night hair and it is the GLS GLS
37 so yeah I wanted to try something
short because I stay with the long hair
and it's starting to get like a little
warm outside and sometimes you know you
just don't be feeling like dealing with
all of that long hair and stuff like
that so yeah I was like oh let me try
short a week because Friday night hair
do have some might shorter tight wigs
and I was kind of feeling this one one
their website so alright got this one
okay so um most of you should be
familiar with the Friday night hair I'm
sold this does have two combs in the
front - come in - comes in the front
McComb innovate with the adjustable
straps it is lace from ear to ear
this is a synthetic way cuz I know some
people be confused on whether it's
synthetic ant or human ham normally
assuming that I mentioned that it's
human hair but if I don't mention if
it's human hair or synthetic most likely
it's that it's synthetic hair so yeah
this is a synthetic unit um okay
so this week is a little iffy to me like
I like it but then I don't like it like
I don't know y'all like I love the
length of this unit and I love the curls
but the curls are like funny acting to
me like like y'all know how I don't like
uneven curls like one side flips this
way and then the other side flips this
way so yeah it's like I can't wait apart
in the middle I will have to wait on the
side because this is the way the curl is
fall so I just put this side behind my
ears even though I wouldn't want to
part in the middle anyway because with
units like this that's like not really
like tightly Carrollton units and that's
more on a straight side I felt like the
part should be longer because it don't
really look right when you have this
little part I don't know it's something
that I had that I just it bothers me so
yeah I put I just flipped on here over
to the side because the part when the
part with this type of style and it
being like two inches long or
one-and-a-half inches because you know
Friday night hair only gives you a like
a little amount of lace space to punch
apart or whatever so I feel like it
looks a little fake to me so yeah I just
bought it over to the side um and yeah I
mean I like this side like this side is
like so bomb but then when you get to
this side it's just like real crazy I
don't know it don't look really bad but
I don't know I just wish like both the
sides was even and then if this had like
a longer part in it like this wig would
be everything yeah overall I still like
I just prefer win it like this I feel
like I can't really wait in a lot of
styles only to the side because of the
whole partner situation and how to curls
is set up but yeah this is what it looks
like it is a tad bit one the shiny side
I feel like you can go both ways like
you can leave it like this because it
don't look like like overly shiny way it
looks fake but I know some people just
don't like shine to do units at all so
you could put a little bit of like dry
shampoo or baby powder however yeah I
really like the length this length is
probably at where I'm like 14 inches
yeah 14 inches long um yeah I did get
this from a Friday night hair so I will
leave the links and the price and
everything
in my description box so yeah if you
have any questions about this unit feel
free to leave it in my comment section
down below
but yeah let me spend over I wanna show
you how to bag
so as far as like the thickness of this
unit it's not I'm really really thick
but it's not then it's like in the
middle like it gives you like a more
natural feel um and this unit it's very
very stuff I haven't received any
tangling or shot in from this unit so
that is a good thing yes so I do um I do
like this wig so yeah if you're looking
for like a shorter type of unit because
you don't want all that long hair um
this could be an option for some of you
girls out there I think it is really
pretty you just have to UM
you just have to work with it and if
you're not willing to do or put any
effort or to working on a unit to make
it look better then this probably it
would not be for you so yeah I
definitely um like it though I just
don't like the fact that the curls is
not like really matching up but I mean
that's fine I just take my pictures on
this side um yeah I'm not going really
sure we ought apart because yeah it just
gives you like this much party space
it's not that much um what else there
might be it I felt like I had to say
something else but then I lost my train
of thought because I'm trying to like
get everything out there that I need to
get out yes this is what the unit looks
like um the hairline is okay I mean yeah
it's okay I just normally with these
wigs I just leave my baby hands out so
yeah um this is what the unit looks like
so I will see you guys in my next video
um I love you guys and yeah talk to you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
