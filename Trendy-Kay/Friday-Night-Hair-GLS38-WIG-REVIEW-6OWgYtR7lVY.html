review and this is the wit that I'm
currently rocking on my head now and
this is from a Friday night hair dot-com
and you guys know that I'm a huge fan of
this company so yeah this is from Friday
night hair and I have the style GLS 30a
this is what the unit looks like and
this is really glamorous and just like
good for the holiday this is what the
unit looks like and basically it's just
like really curly now when I first took
this unit out of the package it was
definitely more curled in the font and
the curls were actually pretty cute but
I felt like it was on the thin side so I
did take and finger comb the curls out
and this is what it turned out to be and
it looks much thicker so if you do end
up purchasing this unit just be aware
that you might have to finger comb it or
brush the curls out to make the wig look
fuller
and it did get a lot fuller so yeah I'm
definitely loving this unit you guys it
is pretty lonely if you don't like the
length you can always cut it down to
make it how ever long you want to live
to be but I mean it's not really the
limp doesn't bother me I think it is a
good length for this type of style so
I'm definitely in love with this I'm the
only thing that I will have to say about
this unit will be that it shits and it
tangles so usually it's either/or but
this time it is both so I try to keep my
hands
out of it I don't think that this will
be a everyday unit just because of how
it tangles and you wouldn't be able to
really run your fingers or anything
through it because you'll probably be
annoyed with the shedding and the
tangling but if you would like to go out
then this is definitely the hair for you
so yeah that's the only thing I don't
know if most of the shedding is coming
from it's coming from when I cut the
lace off because it's not really
shedding anymore but watch out for
tangling yeah cuz these curls get really
tangled but I love this unit is so much
it just so if you're not familiar with
Friday night hair basically it is a lace
front so it doesn't give you that lace
part effect it has about two inches
worth of lace part in space and let me
show you what it looks like and that's
how much part of space you get so yeah I
haven't really tried this week in the
middle why they try it in the middle but
the curls flipped towards this way so it
looks better to me on the side so this
is how I'm gonna wear this week I'm just
gonna wear it on the side because I
don't want to deal with heck I'm heading
to blend in the curls and all of that to
a middle cause so um so yeah I'm pretty
happy with how the hair looks on the
side so I'll definitely leave it as a
side part so again this is what the hair
looks like and I did get this from a
Friday night hair dye calm and I'll make
sure I leave all the links in the
description box yes so yeah so let me do
a quick 360 so you guys can see what
this looks like on reverse
hope you enjoy this quick week review so
yes if you have any questions about this
hair or anything feel free to leave it
