review you're okay you're know like I
don't know it's something about these
blondes that just be like what thank you
this is by Friday night hair and this is
the GLS 41 now y'all know I love my
Friday night hair and I've been waiting
on them to come out with some new units
like which way when like come out with
the yeah and they came through your they
came through for your girl and when I
saw this I was like oh my goodness like
I need that in my life and y'all know
that I'm not really a fan of straight
hair and the way that the potting space
is set up because you know Friday night
Haley do you like one and a half to two
inches worth of pot in space but I was
like I don't care I can make it work I
need that wig in my life like and I
don't regret it at all like I really
really really really love this unit um
of course blowing is not for everybody
but they do also have this unit if you
like the style I'm they have it in a 1b
as well um and this isn't a TT 27 so
they also have it in a 1b in a TT 27 so
yeah but the blonde I feel like the
blonde makes this wig like um let me
breathe a little bit first like I hate
my lighting though because it's so like
dim in here because it's like nasty
outside but anyway so I'm not really
getting a correct lighting that I want
to get but anyway so this has the same
type of construction if you are familiar
with Friday night hair has the two combs
in the front
come in the back with the adjustable
straps they do give you one and a half
to two inches worth of punting space and
I will show you what that looks like so
that's what that looks like and um okay
so the lace also my whatever um so yeah
that's what the parting space looks like
and the lace is from ear to ear um yeah
I really don't have any complaints about
this unit like the way that this cut is
set up like how it just like Falls and
even if I was like to put the hair on
this side it still falls exactly the
same on this unit is like 22 inches and
yeah this I really really love this unit
so this is basically how I would wear
the unit um I always say unit should I
say wait I don't know unit should sound
more sophisticated um but yeah this is
how I wear the wig so as far as tingling
and shedding now I do get some shut in
here and there it's not bad as far as
tangling is concerned
um I don't get tangling yet like it oh I
haven't came through with a snake a
tango or nothing um but it is synthetic
and keep that in mind and it's also
straight hair so keep that in mind the
longer you wear this um I think that it
will start to tangle up on you so yet
that's why normally like people always
ask how long do do my wigs last and they
last for a very long time because um I
always switch out my units I never like
wear one unit consistently and less like
I really really love a unit but even
still I don't wait consistently only
because I want it to last longer I also
don't wear my ways to sleep I suggest
that you don't please don't sleep in
your units and like put them back into
like the original
or whatever wherever you store your
units but that's just my opinion and my
like how I do things or whatever but um
I love this unit now as far as the
thickness um this unit is very thick um
yeah it is is a nice thickness it's a
really nice thickness I'm not
complaining on how thick this unit is
because it's not on the thin side at all
now I'm going to say oh yeah
now as far as the shine on this unit um
I didn't do anything as far as a shine
but this is it is a bit one the shiny
side I mean it's not like real like
shiny way it looks like fake but I know
a lot of people don't like really shine
to their units so you can add like your
dry shampoo or your baby powder to apply
to this unit um it don't really bother
me but then again I probably will add
like some dry shampoo to this unit just
to doll it out a little bit because to
me it is a bit shiny so yeah but other
than the shine factor of this unit like
this wig is so born I love how they cut
it I love everything about it is so soft
like the color is on point as far as the
roots the dark roots the dopers is only
towards the front and then we get to the
back it's just like one color um but I'm
fine with that that really doesn't
bother me and yeah
so that's it for this weight review if
you have any questions feel free to
leave it in my comment section down
below but yet if you guys are interested
in this unit I'm definitely check out
Friday night hair comb
I will leave their links in the
description box um and the link to this
unit and yeah they have a lot of good
affordable wigs on the website um it
definitely is worth it to me um so yeah
and check out the new hair that they
have in stock because they do have some
new arrivals and um yeah so make sure
you check them out and I will see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
