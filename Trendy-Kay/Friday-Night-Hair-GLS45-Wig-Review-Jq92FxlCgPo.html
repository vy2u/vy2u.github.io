looks like this is a pretty natural
curly type looking wig and it's really
short so yeah we'll see what this looks
like I did get this in a color one day
and the style is GLS 45 so yeah this is
what it looks like if you are not
familiar I know most of you should be
familiar with a Friday night have but if
you're not as far as the way
construction is concerned they give you
two combs in the front which is right
there which will land like right here
they also give you a comb in the back
with adjustable straps they give you
lace because this is a lace front and
this is a synthetic wig it's not human
hair from those of you who don't know
so yeah they give you like a two inches
worth of pun space maybe one in the head
I don't know if you guys can see but
yeah you know you're a typical Friday
night hair week so let me put this on so
you guys can see what it looks like and
I'm just gonna leave everything on
because I just want you guys to see what
it looks like
you know it takes me forever to put a
dig in a week when I don't understand
okay this is what the wig looks like
looks like one this is definitely short
I mean if you into a short currently
units here you go
it feels so good I didn't get any
shedding yet and of course I'm not
really I'm pretty sure this week will
tangle because you can't even hardly run
your fingers through it because the way
it's so curly but I'm gonna cut the lace
off and come back okay guys so this is
what the wig looks like with the lace
cut off and yeah I'm just gonna let you
know right now that I really am not
feeling this week I don't feel like it
looks right on me I even had to change
my lipstick up because I'm like well
maybe I'm not lipstick it's just my papa
most this week but no I'm just not
popping with this week
hey um it's just the problem that I'm
having is that the back part is like way
too short for me I feel like it's like a
real-life fro like I feel like it needs
a little bit more length to look right
on me but right now it's just I don't
really like this that like fro look
right like I can't explain it but it
needs at least like to come to the
bottom of my neck this is just not gonna
work for me I'm but overall it is a cute
wig you're into this type of look then
this is like a really cute everyday type
of wig that you wouldn't have to do any
type of styling to you just throw this
on and like go um you could easily wear
this on the side you could wear it in
the middle you can wait towards your
face it really does
better yeah as far as shutting I did get
a little bit of shouting I didn't get a
little bit of shutting from this week
and tangling of course you try to comb
through this you're gonna get tangling
because it's Carly I feel like you don't
even need to comb through this unit but
yeah I don't know you guys like it
definitely is really nice like look at
that look at the curls I just wish that
the back like the front is not even an
issue I just wish that the back was like
longer in my face because I already have
like a long face so the bush stopping
right here is just not gonna work for me
because it just makes my face look extra
long and I don't know like somebody just
did the big chop in the head is like
finally starting to grow like this is
the stage right here well you just don't
know what to do but you have this
definitely looks much better so if I was
to wear this unit I would definitely
wear this wig like this I will
definitely cut some more of this lace
off because I did leave a little release
on so you can kind of tell and then I
will pull some of my hair out and the so
it is a lot of things that you can do to
this week to you know spice it up a bit
if you have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section and down
below
