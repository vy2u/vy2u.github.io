this is going to be the last video of
the day because I didn't did a lot of
videos y'all um but this is another
Friday night hair wig and if you didn't
see my last video one Friday night head
go check it out I'll leave the lit the
link down below in my description box
but Friday night had been one that ish
okay y'all because they came out with
some new units and so I'm rocking
another one of their new units that they
came out with which I'm like really in
love with these new units they came out
with like they did okay like what
so this is the GLS 56 and I have it in
the color TRB 35 now if you're not a fan
of red they also have this unit in a
color 1b but you know I had to try to
read because the rate was just poppin so
yeah this is the unit and um it has the
regular construction with the two combs
in the front a comb in the back with the
adjustable straps um
this wig fits good to my head I mean
it's not tight or anything like that so
if you do have a larger size head this
way will fit you really really good um
what else like the way to have this
these layers like what like the cut when
this thing is so nice like y'all just
did your thing it still has the
one-and-a-half to two inches worth of
parting space I mean it doesn't really
bother me that much because the wig is
just so full and just like it takes away
from the part in space so I'm not really
tripping with that but like the curls
work both ways like you know how
take care of you little things to flip
back like that and both sides flip the
way you wanted to so I like that as well
um yeah I really don't have much to say
about this unit I just wanted to share
this with you guys and let you all know
that Friday night head do you have some
newer units added to their website but
I'm like really in love with this unit I
had to change my shirt because I didn't
want to do to red shirt with this red
hair because it just didn't look right
so um so yeah this is what the unit
looks like I have not received any
tangle in nor did I receive shedding
from this unit yet but like I said all
my videos this is a synthetic unit and
over time it will start to shed and
tangle up on you so you just have to
really know what you're doing and take
care of your units and stuff like that
but anyway um yeah so far I had not
received any tangle in any shedding this
unit is like 18 inches long yeah this
unit is 18 inches long now this arm unit
is not shiny at all it has like a slight
shine to it but I don't think that you
need to add like baby powder or or like
dry shampoo by me it's all up to you if
you feel like the wig is too shiny then
do so but the other unit that I just
reviewed from Friday no head that was a
little one a shiny side this is not
shiny at all like it looks really
natural and it is really full and thick
so that thinks the density on this unit
is like really nice it's not like overly
full but it's not thin at all but
overall like I really really love this
unit this is probably going to be like a
fast video cuz I just want to draw to
see what this unit look like look at
this unit like what like
like this hair is bomb you're like look
how it's cut I did nothing to this unit
at all and I didn't even brush it I
finger comb this unit and it just fell
into place like Tommy this unit is not
everything y'all tell me it's not like
it is it is it really is like your
coccyx official okay
overall like I have really no complete I
missed one crucial crucial crucial
well not like it is not going I don't
think it would stop people from a by the
unit I mean only for the people who
don't really want to put extra work but
okay so let's talk about this duck root
now the roots are only duck right here
like when you get to the side like
where's the dope route it and like so if
you want it to like where a side part
you couldn't do that unless unless you
dug it the roots yourself so that's not
the only thing about this unit that I'm
really not a fan of but it's fixable so
I'm not really complaining about it but
I did want to let you guys know that the
Doug Fir is only basically on the top
part of the wig so yeah but if you guys
have any questions about this wait feel
free to leave it in a comment section
down below I will link the website in my
description box as well as the link to
this wave so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and your I really like this
wait going look at that cut know what I
will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
