and this video is from a Friday night
hair and this is the GLS 69 and the
color one bingo if you're interested in
this unit I will leave the link down
below
insert clips of how the we came
originally before I cut off the lace but
basically this is how the wig will come
I did not do anything to this week I did
not brush it at the in coma
I didn't finger comb it I did nothing
the curl pattern is exactly like this
which are really like it's like really
nice it really looks natural there is no
shine to this one it is very lightweight
um and it's a good amount of hair it's
not too thick and not too then it does
look like a lot of hair but it is mostly
like lightweight I didn't do anything I
don't have any of my hair and a front if
you want to of course you know you can
bring a little bit of your hair out in
the front to make it blend and better if
you're not familiar with Friday night
hair okay so if you're not familiar with
Friday night hair they give you two
combs in the front I'll comb in a bank
with adjustable straps they also give
you two inches worth of lace so woah
pardon space lace however you want to
say
this is where the wig stops on me and
it's like 18 inches mom it's a bug in
Hana just give me but you know how like
you just happen to look somewhere and
you just see something like it be a mind
saying like turn around and I turned
around and it was a freaking stink but
like why are they even here like wow so
this video is going to be a really quick
because it's really nothing to say about
this unit the tangle in and shut in I
did not receive one strand of hair as
far as shedding and tangling like no
tangles this hair goes straight through
I'm pretty sure as time go on that this
week will start to tangle um you might
get a couple strands hand there but like
for now like this head is just like bomb
just look at this y'all look at it like
this is my hat on alone no I'm just
going to turn around so you guys can see
the back and where it comes
so this is it for my video if you have
any questions feel free to leave it in
my comment section and I will definitely
leave links to Friday night hair um in
my description box so make sure you guys
check that out and I will talk to you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
