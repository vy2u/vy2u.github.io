review and excuse my hair I know I'm
looking crazy is I don't know what right
now the way that I want to share with
you today is by Friday night hair and
this is my first time trying out Friday
night hair and I have to tell you guys
that I absolutely love it
so this is what um this is what the
little tag looks like and I guess it's
just like information on the inside and
yeah so it will come wrapped and this
little thing and it will also have this
inside of it so um the style that I have
is the GLS 15 and OH
color 1b this is the wig right here and
this is not what it looks like fresh out
of the package because I have been
wearing this wig for a while now so this
is what it looks like and it's a really
pretty curl and it has two combs like on
the side right here and it has a comb in
the back I don't know if you guys can
see that with adjustable strips and this
is not like your um out part least week
that I normally do reviews on this is
just a straight-up lace front week so
they do give you
okay amount of lace right here but if
you want that longer part then these
wigs probably aren't for you because
they do give you about one and a half to
two inches worth of parting space let me
put this on but before I do put this on
for you guys I just want to show you how
my hair is and basically I just put some
of my hair in the front I this is my
curl pattern to my head and I figure it
will blend in good with this wig so yeah
I just have some of my hair out in the
front and swept some of my baby hair
this is what the weight looks like and
it absolutely looks so gorgeous you guys
it's like a really curly but natural
kind of wig and I am like absolutely and
love with this week Friday night hat
they got some nice stuff on inside your
head to go check it out but yes this is
the wig that I picked which is the GLS
15 and the color one being so basically
this is what the wig looks like yeah
this is what the wig looks like on and
it is big hair um when I first got it
out of the package and when I started to
wear it I did not pluck out the curls
these are basically how the curls will
come when you get the wig I felt like I
like the curl pattern on this unit so I
didn't feel the need to pluck it out and
um I feel like most curly units don't
really last as long as you want them to
when you pluck out the curls so in order
to like have to wear the wig longer I
would suggest that you just really don't
really mess with the curls if you like
how the curls are now I had some units
that work early and I plucked out the
curls because I didn't like how the
curls were so I definitely love how the
curls already came and it just keeps
getting better as I keep wearing it so I
have what this unit in the middle and on
the side as well um this week is about
I'm gonna say 18 inches long it comes um
where I just showed you to like the
bottom of my boobs um so yes this is
what it looks like in the front or the
side and in the back on ovl to see their
home I did receive this wig pretty fast
I think I received it in like three
three days so that was so good I wasn't
expecting to UM get the wig as soon as I
got it but I did get it pretty quick um
all that wigs is basically like $49.99
95 basically like fifty dollars I think
that it's definitely worth the money um
I am going to start I think I will start
wearing more Friday night hair wigs but
um I definitely do still like my lace
part units and I will never stop wind so
this is my hair blend in with ah the
unit and it looks really natural this is
how the lace looks so that's basically
how the lace looks
it's very hot though I will say that
it's really hot because there is a lot
of hair and one thing that I'm not going
to say I hate but it this wig is
definitely a fuller around this part but
then when you get to like this the top
part of the wig it is then once you feel
it but you can't see that it's thin up
in that part but everything everywhere
else is um it's for I just didn't
understand why this part up here was a
little thin but if you was to look at it
you wouldn't think it was thin at all so
yes this is definitely a lot of hair the
more you play with it um I think the
bigger it will get so yes I'm like
sweating because it's so high so let me
show you guys what this wig looks like
as a side part so you can definitely
wear it to either side but this is just
what the wig looks like on the side and
I think that is so pretty and I did not
cut any layers or anything into this
week um this is exactly how it comes I
don't think that I want to cut any
layers into this wig
I like it just as it is so that's what
it looks like on the side and it's
absolutely gorgeous like I really love
this way you guys
so yeah it kind of looks like my head um
my curly head but uh my head is I don't
have this much hair so yeah this is like
really pretty so yes you guys this is
definitely what it looks like on the
side and if you have any questions about
this unit um feel free to leave it in
the comment section down below and I
will answer any questions that you guys
have for me again this is the GE LS 15
and I got this from UM Friday night hair
comb so go check them out because they
wigs are still affordable um and they're
actually good quality wigs for the price
because y'all know I'm full you know
cheap I like affordable stuff so yes um
so I'll see you in my next video you
guys um see you later bye
