night hair review so this is the unit
that I'm wearing on my head and this is
the geela G this is the GLS 36 and I
have n 1b this wig is OK for me I'm not
in love with it
I definitely rock it first off let me
start by saying that this way this wig
has two combs like by the temple area
and then it has a comb in the back and
it has the adjustable straps um it's
kinda like as if you were to braid your
hair and then when you take the braids
out and give you like that crinkly look
that's how this wig is I think it's cute
it's growing on me but when I first took
it out the package I was like because I
don't know if you can tell but this part
is always like where the lace is the
hair texture is different from like back
here see how it's so tight back here and
then like when you get up right here
it's a little bit more straighter so I
just wish like the top part was maybe
like the bottom part or vice-versa but
but you can definitely play around with
this week this is like you got into some
water and then when you came back out
the water like this is what it looks
like that's what it reminds me of um
hair is definitely soft I have not
received any shedding yet um as far as
tangling it does tangle just a little
bit but it's not like really bad and I'm
sure I'm not really going to run my
fingers through it like that but yes
they do give you they do give you a
decent amount of party space I mean it's
not like a lot lighter part of space but
it's definitely a nice amount and this
is what it looks like in the middle
which surprisingly I think it looks
better um on the side to me yo so I just
been rocking it on the side but yeah um
this wig is around like 22 inches and it
does has layers like cut throughout the
unit so it's not just one length like
you got some layers cut up here and then
once you get to the bottom that's where
your longest layer is but I don't know
this week is actually growing on me the
more I keep on playing with it and like
looking at it it's definitely some big
hair but it's like extra soft like this
hair is super soft just wanted to show
you guys or share this unit with you
guys just in case anybody wanted to see
what it looked like or was thinking
about purchasing this unit I definitely
think it is a really cute unit like I
said at first I wasn't I wasn't really a
fan of it because I just didn't like the
way the style was I don't know but it's
definitely growing on me they do give
you lace from ear to ear so you
definitely
like wear this back if you want it to
like it's really cute yeah it's a lot of
things that you can do with this um this
unit you guys it's fun hair like this is
cute it definitely looks natural though
I'll give them that
yeah cuz it looks like a braid out so
yeah I'm not trying to shock nobody this
is what it looks like in the front on
the side and the back
when I opposites up and in the front so
yes um thank you for watching this
review and I love you guys I just want
to say thank you for all my new
subscribers there will be lots more
videos to look forward to and I will
catch you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
