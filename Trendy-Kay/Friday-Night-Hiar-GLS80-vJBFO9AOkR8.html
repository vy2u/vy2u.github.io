landlady get be Fingaz office and Rory's
time you can bet on me tough hey
guys I'm back with a another wave review
and of course this is gonna be a review
one this week that I'm wearing and I was
bit this week from a Friday night here
so they sent me the GLS I can indict
they sent me the GLS 80 and I have it in
a color one being so yeah this is what
the card looks like and if you guys are
familiar with Friday night here they
need to know that usually their cart
doesn't come like this I think it's like
a pink color or what I 100% financed
instead of care so I got the distance
that a kid is supposed to be better
quality in there other ways so I don't
know I believe that this is a newer unit
so maybe they're maybe they are you know
switching their units over to more
higher quality here so I can definitely
tell the difference in the quality and I
can also tell the difference in the
construction of the wigs so basically
your standard Friday night head cap
usually comes with two combs and the
front of cream in the back and an
adjustable strap it also has hard late
now this week right here comes with soft
lace and it has three combs and a front
of comb innovate and adjustable shrimp
and this one does not come with tape I
don't remember a coming with tape of the
day I might have loved it but I'm sure
that it didn't come tape also some of
you guys know that Friday night hair
only gives you around like two inches
versus parting space but now they're
giving you three inches maybe three
Britain head it is a good amount of
parting of course that will give you
more cutlery towards the middle and it
you going sighs it's less room to part
the hair so I do have this unit one
inside and this is around the how much
participate they give you what's the
audit unit so yeah but once you come to
the middle I'll just let you guys see
it's definitely a nice safe step in a
game of y'all I don't know y'all can see
that but it's definitely a nice amount
of lace also this wig comes with baby
hair so if you like they here on your
wigs then this would be a really good
and the baby hairs I feel like looks
really natural now familiar this cat is
a lot bigger than Friday night hair
known cats I don't know that's because
the lace is more sauce now and it's not
hard because as you know Friday night
hair units come with they're hard very
hard lace that's kind of like so hard
that it's uncomfortable I would suggest
that you gluing down I would suggest
that you glue this down if you could all
find a way to super character like this
is a lot of hair it doesn't you know how
to make you know how some ways come with
a appear like it's a lot of hair but
then when you feel it you can tell that
it's really not a lot of hair just looks
like that no this is actually a lot of
hair um and as you can see it is like a
natural texture it kind of looks like if
you was to braid your hair and then take
it out but the curl pattern is not very
consistent and a root is kind of like
that crinkly texture and then when you
get to the bottom which is kind of on a
street side so I did not do anything to
this wig whatsoever only thing I did was
put it one side I did a little bit of my
finishing powder into the part just so
you can see it and that's basically it I
don't even feel like you need to plumps
apart or anything the part is pretty
natural and I just
brushed out the wig baby hairs this is
not my baby head this is the wig and
that's basically it
this is a very thick it's a lot of hair
this is all the hair to the front which
I actually like this style if you're
into more natural looking styles like
this then I feel like you would really
love this wig because it's nice I will
say it's very hot so um and it's just a
lot of have me personally I'm not really
a fan of the tail on it because it's
just too much for me okay this wig is
around 18 inches long and yeah I really
don't have much to say about this wig oh
I did try to put heat on it I forget the
pieces like lost in the sauce and wet
but I definitely put heat on it just to
test it out to see if you could put heat
on it to life if anybody was curious
just in case this was too much handful
and you want it to like tone it down
this is a really pretty unit though it's
just not for me but I really do like it
and I definitely see on Friday night
hair listening to their customers and
really taken in the feedback that you
guys give them because I know a lot of
people complain about the heartless and
I also know a lot of people complain
about about not having enough parking
space so you are they getting better
baby steps but bedrolls this is a nice
wig now as far as tangling and shut it
up for that
now this wig this week does do a little
bit of shedding I haven't it's not like
no crazy shedding or nothing like that
and it could be because our cut off the
lace but it doesn't um it doesn't change
that bed I guess is normal and as far as
the like tangling the hair when they say
finest quality I can tell because I have
got any tangles from this wig yet like
at all this wig it's just like your
hands go straight through so I haven't
had any issues with that and then so
it's a thicker big hair I'm surprised
that I haven't got any tangles in I can
like move my hands through the tables
out any hesitation so I want you guys
this is a light hair but it definitely
looks so natural when I say there is no
shine at all like this actually looks
like somebody's hair it's not shiny like
it it so it's a really good wig I feel
like it's constructed good I do feel
like this wig cap is more when the
biggest style I'm just going to do a
quick turn around so you guys just can
see the fullness of this unit all the
way around so
so this is this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it um yeah so check this wig out
if you're interested if this is your
type of style I'm pretty sure you would
love this unit because it definitely is
a beautiful unit and the quality is
really really good so yeah I'll leave
all friday-night links in my description
box just in case anybody is interested
and purchasing this unit so yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
