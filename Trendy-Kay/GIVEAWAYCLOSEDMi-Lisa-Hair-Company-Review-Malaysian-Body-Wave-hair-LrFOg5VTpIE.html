review or no this is a review on a
vendor from Aliexpress so they were kind
enough to send me this beautiful head
that I'm wearing now so this is going to
be like a review on his head / giveaway
so yeah stay tuned at the end for the
giveaway the vendor name is me Lisa hair
company so i think i'm saying right i'll
post something right here or it is just
be in the description so yes this is the
malaysian body wave hair and i have the
inches 20 i have five bundles and a
closure in total and i dare use all five
bundles of the hair and i have 3 26 inch
bundles and 2 24 inch bundles with a 20
inch closure so yeah I'm trying to be
quick because my battery is going dead
but we step back so you guys can see how
long the hair is the hair is really long
so yeah this is all the hair I'm like
absolutely loving this hair and this
head is very affordable so I just threw
this on my head you guys but this is
what the part looks like and the part
looks really natural and i just made a
weight out of this hair so this is not
how the wig originally i mean this is
not how the hair came originally I did
straight in this hair but it does have
like a body wave texture to the hair
which i will insert a clip right now
so like I said this head is really
affordable and I'll leave all the links
to everything to this hair in my
description box as far as shedding
entangling um I do not get any tingling
from this hair but i do get shut in here
and there I don't know if it's because I
cut my wife's or what the case may be
like now I'm getting some shut in so it
does shed but it doesn't shed um a lot
but keep in mind that this hair does
 so if you wind up like making a you
know anything make sure you seal your
wife's or just don't cut the web SAT all
I love the fact that it's just like so
full and like soft and bouncy like I'm
so in love with this hair and it's so
long you guys like so this is where the
hair comes to me I don't know you guys
can see that but yeah it is its pretty
long another thing that I like about
this head is the fact that it's not then
on the ends at all so it has the same
density from top to bottom which I
really really like so it doesn't look
like thin or skimpy or anything like
that so yes you guys this is the hair
sorry this video was kind of quick but
like I said my battery is going dead so
yeah I do want to wear this in its
natural state but I just wanted to see
how it flat on and it's it really good
it took heat really good and it flat on
really well and it's stayed straight so
this hair has been
straight for I mean you can see some of
like a wave but not really but this has
stayed straight for about I want to say
four days maybe I think this is for a
day old hair I'm not too sure but yeah
it straight it straightens very well it
also holds a curl really really well so
