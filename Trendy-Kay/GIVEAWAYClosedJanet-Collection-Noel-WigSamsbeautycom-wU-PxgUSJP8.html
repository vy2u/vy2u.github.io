day look done to me
I got fake people showing fake love to
me straight up to my page straight up to
my face
I've been down slow rolling like I got
fake show
hey guys so I'm back with another wig
review and this week was sent to me from
Sam's Beauty so I'll make sure I leave
Sam's Beauty links in the description
box so yeah the wig they sent me is the
jana collection SuperFlow deep part lace
wig and i have it in a style Noel and I
have it in a color
Oh et 1b 30 so this is what the picture
looks like and before I get started this
is going to be a giveaway bought to you
by Sam's Beauty so yes stay tuned at the
end so you guys can hear all the detail
ok so this is a synthetic unit it's not
here to help anything like that
this is synthetic and it is a lace part
unit which means it does come with a
lace part and it also comes with lace
around the perimeter so you would have
to cut off the lace now with the lace
part this they only give you around like
a inch worth of lace and then after that
it's like a skin top right here but it
has the lace over it so yeah I don't
know I don't really know if you guys can
tell but you kind of can see the
difference in color um idea at my
finishing powder and my wig is slightly
behind my hairline so yeah that's what
the part looks like so the texture of
this wig is really really thick this is
a lot of hair and it's really thick and
is really long so I would have to say
this week is around 22 inches long
I love the thickness of this week
everything so I'm not complaining but I
just don't remember it being this thick
if you have this week comment down below
if your wig is this thick or not I would
really love to know this I just really
really love this way like this wig is on
point and it's very tamable you know how
sometimes that you have like like Nisha
this is this reminds me of Nisha
just like tamed so well because Nisha on
me I wasn't really a fan because it was
so big but this hair is really pretty
and I forgot to mention but this is not
a side part I meant this is not a middle
part it's actually meant to be on the
side but I liked it in the middle better
but it looks cute both ways but you all
know me I love my middle parts and I
felt like I haven't really been wearing
my hair too much in the middle so I was
missing you know my little middle point
so so as far as the construction on this
week I feel like this week is big-headed
front um so if you do have a bigger
sized head I feel like this week will
fit you great because on me I have my
straps adjusted and the wig still fits
really big I had like five bobby pins
holding this week down oh I'm not even
lying
so yeah this wig is really big I feel
like after I plucked in my part that's
when I got most of my shedding but I
guess that's normal
um so yeah and I feel like if I run my
hands through it like I'll get like a
strand so it might come it might be
coming from when I pluck my part and it
also could be coming from when I cut the
lace off the wig but it's not shedding
like really crazy like crazy crazy but
when I do like this
I do get like one or two strands
basically the curls everything already
comes like this I'm straight out the
package I did take my vent brush
you're don't try to come for me with my
little pant brush all right
I couldn't find my bigger one so I had
to use this and it did the job I feel
like it's a little bit too small for all
this thick hair but I needed to brush it
out cuz I feel like if you try to you
finger comb this wing to style it it's
just not gonna it's not going to do
anything it's I feel like it's just not
gonna so I felt like your best results
would probably be brushing the wig out
with a vet brush or paddle brush
whatever you call it so yeah and that's
basically what I did was just brush the
curls out and it just lays in full so
pretty
you
