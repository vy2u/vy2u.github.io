Tony nobody that's where I was out of my
god I want to do out of my password you
don't need nobody out of my guys
something with another video of course
and this video is going to be or this
week yeah so I've been with supposed to
put this video I'll see you guys but I
just never got around to doing it
because this week just frustrates me and
y'all know how it is when you just don't
like away if you just but I actually
love this week man you guys so yeah this
week is from Friday at night hair and
this is the GLS 106 and I have it in a
color 1b
I'm not sure if this comes in other
colors but I think they only comes
anyone be I'm not too sure but I'll
leave it in my description box it
becomes in another color this has the
heart late it also comes with two combs
in a front of home in a bank and
adjustable straps they give you about
one and a half to two inches worth of
hardened space which it's okay but it's
real tiny and little this way looks
amazing right now you guys it looks like
some freaking human hair for sure it's
not too long it's just like a really
perfect length so yeah I basically
struggled I struggle I did not like the
curls on this wig at all you guys and
I'm so mad at myself that I didn't even
show you how it look I had this week for
probably over a month or so so I'm
warning you if you try to get this look
and you like the way these curls are and
how they look I did go ahead and brush
out the curls with my vent brush and
then I left it on a mannequin
I literally lesson1 a man
can for about maybe two which you guys
and I will say the older that this way
gets the better it looks
it is really dull is not shiny at all
it's very soft this week does shed quite
a bit it's not real like OD or nothing
like that but it definitely shed on this
farce Pangolin I have gotten a little
tangle in when I was brown away I left
off and sorry but I didn't hit any more
spacing on camera but I think I was
talking about tangling and shedding so
yeah this wig yeah this week did tangled
a little bit as I was brushing it out
but after I finished brushing out the
curls I can run my fingers straight
through the hair so that's a good thing
when I try one this week instantly I was
just like growth it looks it just did
not look right so I just lined up Cohen
everything out with my friend brush I
wanted up combing all the curls out with
my bit brush and I just let it sit I
didn't even try on the wig after I brush
the curls out I just set it on my wig
head and that was about two weeks ago
and I finally picked the wig back up to
show you guys the wig and this is what
it looks like I did go back in and brush
it again and I brushed it it definitely
looks it definitely looks more full once
you brush it out and over time I don't
know it just looks better over time so
these are what the curls look like
brushed out and if you go on the site
the wig on a site is how it looks when
you get it out to pack that's exactly
how the curls are so if you interested
in seeing how the week looks originally
just go and click on a link in the
description box and it will take you to
how this week looks and how the curls
look but yeah overall I freaking
love this wig it really looks like some
human hair well the hairline is not too
black bad but it didn't look natural to
me I felt like I needed to either leave
my hair out in the front which I wasn't
about to hear so basically I just cut
some hair in the front to create my own
baby hairs and I definitely love how the
hair lay down and to achieve this baby
hair although there was edit all that it
was molded my baby hairs with the got to
be glued and that just sets the baby
hair right in place and I think that it
just looks really really really natural
and really pretty you guys this is
definitely great for the summer because
even though it appears full it's very
very lightweight and it's just like
really Airy is not heavy but it still
looks like a good amount of hair without
it being too heavy doing saying like I
wouldn't suggest getting this week if
you don't want to put in the work
because like I said when you first get
it is you you're not going to like it
I'm sure that you won't like this week
when you first get it but just brush it
out and keep on playing with it we'll
just leave it in for a little minute and
then come back - and that's it for this
video if you have any questions on a
task feel free to leave it in my comment
section down below and I'll see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
