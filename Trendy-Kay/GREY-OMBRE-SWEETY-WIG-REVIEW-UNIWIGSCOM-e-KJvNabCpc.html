and this is the width I'm resuming
wishes on my head right now so yes is
basically gray ombre wig so this week is
from a uni weeks and this is what the
packaging looks like it comes in a
really nice box and yeah it just looks
like this and the wig was wrapped nicely
in this box and it did come with a brush
which I'm really not a fan of this type
of brush because I mean I don't know it
looks like this like it's not your
typical event brush but I don't know I'm
just not really a fan these type of
brushes and it did come with a weight
camp and it's like nude and it came with
the care instructions card yeah and it
also came with a weak hygiene guard
places on your hair before on wigs so as
you always are eligible for check okay
so yeah it just comes with one of these
things just in case you try you wiggle
on but you don't like it and you want to
send it back just for like sanitary
reasons and then the way it was in here
and it had this little thing wrapped
around it so yeah it's really nice
packaging and they do send you some
little goodies to go with your wig which
i think is really neat I don't like the
Sun um so yes that's what the packaging
looks like so this is the amount of
pardoned space that they give you which
is not really a lot of party space and
I'm not really a fan of straight hair
winning straight hair and it been this
short of a potted space because I don't
think it looks really natural uh if I
have like a lace front
I stick more to curly units only because
yeah I don't know but um so yeah this is
the lens so it does have two combs on
the side and it also has a comb on the
top with adjustable straps this time is
really killing me it's messing up my
lighting so I don't really know what I
was thinking because I've like really
wanted to try a different color and you
know like the great ombre it's kind of
still in so I wanted to try the gray
ombre because I haven't and that's like
the only color that um I haven't really
tried yet so I was like okay I'll just
get the great ombre wig and try it out
so I don't like this week okay not like
the week itself but I don't like this
week for me um I don't really think
great it's for me you guys also if you
have a small head this weight will be so
huge on your hair because it's it's like
really huge on my head I don't know if
y'all can see that like little hump
right there but that's actually
like the weak sticking up because it's
just like buckle II underneath in his
head because it's too big and I adjusted
my strips it's just not fitting right
the lace was not um the heart lease that
you normally would get it is the soft
lace which I'm not really a fan of
because I don't feel like it really
blends in oh it looks natural like hot
least about it because it lays down more
flat and also and also this week is like
a super thick which is a really good
thing but it sheds like nobody's
business like I just can't do with um
the shutting of this wig it like it
sheds so bad like not okay not so bad
but it sheds a lot like more than
most of my other units it really like
sheds when I took it out the package I
was like what is going on like I don't
understand so what else can I tell you
about this week like I said you can
purchase this week from younits.com is a
pretty good quality wigs they have a lot
of wigs that's really good quality um
this week is pretty thick the only thing
that I don't like is the Parden space
and overall this is a nice week but the
color is just not for me like this color
is like gross on me huh like whoever
said that I can pull off any color lied
because I can't this wig is just not my
color like I look like storm like it's
just like - like Halloweenish for me
like this would be a perfect way if I
was like dressing up as storm for
Halloween maybe I will be heard
but that's who I mean that's what this
week reminds me of so I'm pretty sure
it's a lot of people out there that like
great hombre weeds and it's looking for
one so yeah and another thing to keep in
mind is that you might like okay this
week did not come like this I did
recently post a picture of me when this
unit and it was more like kind of bent
at the ends ahead like a little like
been it ends which if you want to see
how the week originally comes out
straight out of the packaging then you
can check out my Instagram and I do have
a picture posted of this same week but
yes so I took my flat on and I just
straightened it all out so yeah this is
the way it straightened all out and um
yeah I almost burnt the out of this
hey okay like don't put your flat ons to
a high setting like have it on like
maybe like 250 to 300 but nothing above
that because this wig will melt so it
might tell you one of instructions when
he said it you should use if you wanted
to apply heat to this week but as far as
this like ombre like it's really really
nice it also it does tangle a little bit
but it doesn't really tangle a lot on me
I'm just like the shedding was what got
me yeah it's still shedding like um yeah
it's a lot but this week will tangle
because it is synthetic in a
a longer unit so thus to be expected
so yeah you guys I wanted to make this a
pretty quick video but yeah if you
interested in like a hombre tight weeks
and you like this because I'm pretty
sure some people will like this week but
I mean some people might it's not for
everybody and it's definitely not a week
for me so yeah I'm really not a fan of
this week but the company is really good
and the quality of the wig is really
nice and it is like very very thick and
as far as like the construction of the
cap and all of that besides it shedding
because I don't really like well always
share but it's just like more shedding
than what it should be but um yeah oh
yeah and like as far as the construction
of the cap and everything it's really
nice like I said it does come with
softly so if you're not really a fan of
the soft lace like me then this weight
probably will not be for you and also if
you have a smaller head this wig does
fit really big so keep that in mind I'm
not sure if you go on a website they you
can pick like petite cat a petite
appetit know a petite cat sides or
average or a large so I don't really
know if this is like average or a large
it might be average but yeah so this is
the wig and I hope you enjoy and I'll
leave everything in the description box
and if you have any questions feel free
to let me know you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
