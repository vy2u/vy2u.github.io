hey guys it's Kay and I'm back with
another video so basically this is gonna
be a get ready with me hair edition and
the wig I'm gonna be using is this wig
that was sent to me from OMG Queen hair
and they sent me their natural curly 360
lace wig the left is 20 inches the hair
density is 180 percent the cap size is a
medium this weight did come with baby
hairs as you can see in the beginning of
the video the hairline is also pre
plucked now I did go in and bleach the
knots I did not go back in and pluck the
hairline because I felt like the
hairline looks pretty good but I really
did a good job on bleaching tonight so I
feel like it looks so natural and the
camera is really not giving this
hairline any justice I don't think so
but in person oh my goodness this wig
it's freaking a slain y'all so basically
now this is the hair blowdried and I did
actually wash his hair of course because
I bleached the knots but after it was
washed I didn't really get a clip of
showing you like the natural state of
the curls but they were so beautiful so
don't be alone when you first get this
way because the curls won't look like
that and the first clip that I showed
you of this wig that's actually how the
curls came to me but they won't look
like that after you wash it the curls
are way more defined and they actually
look really good
when I washed his hair I did get some
Shannon that Shannon was not bad at all
but this week definitely shed I haven't
received any Tanglin yet so yeah this
week is really really nice and it
definitely straightens really good I
didn't I couldn't get it really really
straight but this is the straightest
that I could get it
if anybody is curious on the
straightness I'm using they are from a
company called El FINA and basically you
can purchase these on Amazon they do
have an Amazon store so I'll go ahead
and leave all the links in the
description box
I actually really like these these are
their steam hair straighteners so now
I'm basically section off the hair and
I'm just sectioning off the top part
kind of like a half up half down but not
like the whole front of my head that
makes any sense because I still want the
sides to be like out or whatever so the
style that I'm creating I don't really
know the name of it but I will be using
like some elastic rubber bands and just
connecting them it's kind of like a 90s
vibe for sure I don't know the hairstyle
I guess it's like rubberband ponytails
that you connect y'all know what I'm
talking about
but yeah I don't know like the exact
name maybe when this video goes up I'll
have the exact name maybe in the title
or description but yeah that's basically
what I'm doing so this is the part that
I will be styling and the rest I'm just
going to put back into a ponytail just
to get it out of the way so yeah if you
try to achieve this look you are going
to need some rubber bands
you can get these from your local beauty
supply store so at first I would just
want to do one section but I felt like
the section was just way too big so I
decided to part it into two so I'm gonna
do one section on camera for you guys
and then I'm gonna come back with the
other side already done
now I'm going to go ahead and take these
gold breakups and I'm just gonna place
them over with the rubber bands on so
you can't see the rubber bands I think
this is like so freaking cute you guys I
start feeling myself after a while
because it really turned out so good
these gold cuffs definitely make this
hairstyle just pop so much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
