beauty forever and they sent me four
bundles in a frontal I liked the
Malaysian curly hair from them so I
decided to try out some more of their
hair and I have it in inches 18 16 14 12
and a 12 inch frontal so this is what
the wig looks like after well this is
the hair after I made a tweak and I
washed it and everything and this is how
it looks in its natural state I did go
ahead and plus the front tool and I also
bleached a nuts which bleach so well I
definitely love the way this week turned
out I will say I definitely over plucked
my hairline for sure you kinda can tell
that I over plucked it but it don't look
too bad so I'm not really worried about
it so yeah anyway and when my brownish
stocking cap underneath because I just
think that it makes the part looks
really natural so now I'm just pinning
the hair back so I can get ready to
secure the lace down and of course I'm
using the guide to be glued holding
spray and I prefer using this over the
gel and sorry you guys if you can hear
my bear in the background but he's just
not trying let me live tonight anyway
this holding spray holds so well and it
dries so fast you guys so you're not
gonna be like really waiting for this
stuff to dry because as soon as you put
a blow-dryer to that lease it dries
instantly oh yeah and as far as tingling
and shutting goals for this hair I have
got a little bit of shut-in but that was
only one time and that was after I wash
the hair and most of the shutting came
from the frontal and that's from when I
plucked it but besides that I have not
received any shut in from the tail
whatsoever and I also have not received
any tangles yet tangled snakes
none it
so now that I had this wig all nice and
laid and this is what it's looking like
and it's just so soft and bouncy but
anyway I'm going to go in and just curl
the hair and I'm gonna be using my
straightener just to put a little bit of
curls in it I don't want them too tight
I'm just gonna like do a slight Bend so
yeah I will say it was difficult trying
to get this hair straight only because I
did call back after this ensuring the
hair which you guys are going to see but
I think from me curling the hair and
then trying to straighten it over it
just was more difficult for me to
straighten it but eventually it did
straighten to how I wanted it to be
so now I'm just gonna go in and cut the
front
y'all don't laugh at my scissors but
this was one hand so I'm cutting the
front just so I can give it a little bit
more you know um and that's basically
yeah after that I'm going with my eco
styler gel and just fix my edges just a
little bit it's not gonna be you know
too much it's just gonna be something
slight you feel me because I want overdo
it
oh yeah also let me know if you like
these type of videos and you want me to
do more I will definitely try my best to
do more get ready with me here addition
type videos like this but yeah that's it
for this video and I will see you in my
next video and time fly by change
right now feeling like I need space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
