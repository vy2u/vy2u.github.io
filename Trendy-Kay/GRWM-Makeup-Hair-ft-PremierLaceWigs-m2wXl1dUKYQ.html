flippy get him going to be with you yeah
you will always come bring origin to you
can you know get it already lg4
butterfly bothered in them hey guys now
I'm starting off with my eyes and I
already have my eyebrows done and I did
set my eyes with the benign banana
powder just in case you guys didn't see
it so yeah I want to here and took
transition from my violet Voss palette
and now I'm taking a hashtag to darken
the crease up just a little bit and add
some color which is kind of like a
subtle color but um you know it do you
can't really see it
I'm taking Morocco and this is from the
juiciest place I think I'm saying it
right I don't know everything real
estate in my description box so it's
just like a deeper burnt orange color
and I'm taking it in placing it in my
crease because the other colors are just
blending in too much with my skin tone
and you just want to blend blend blend
blend blend you guys
now I'm taking that color maple and I'm
adding that to my crease area as well
and this is from my lorac Bella you guys
I think it's like a limited edition so
yeah I'm just taking that as well and
just building the color up so now I'm
going in with this olive color this
Allah this olive color and I'm placing
it on my lid and this is also from the
same palette and yeah I'm just putting
that on my lid and then I'm going to
blend it on up to make it all blend in
with the transition colors so yeah
that's basically what I'm doing is
blending
now moving along to the face I'm taking
my Lancome liquid foundation and I am
using my Beauty Blender was not really
beautiful in it but inside Real
Techniques and yet to start off I
already primed my face and I had put
some of that la girl like orange
corrector stuff to cover up some
blemishes
now I'm going in with my heart concealer
and I'm just going to highlight under my
eyes the bridge of my nose my forehead
and a little bit on my chin and I
actually really loved this concealer it
took me a while to get used to it but
overall like I really really like it and
it's very blendable and I'm just
blending it and with my Real Techniques
sponge and yeah I love this freaking
sponge you guys I mean it's not no
Beauty Blender but it gets the job done
and now I'm taking my same Beauty
Blender and I just dipped it in my Ben
Nye banana powder and I'm going to set
my under eyes the bridge of my nose and
my forehead and chin and a little bit
above my lip as well
also I did put my lashes on off-camera
because it was just way too hard for me
to do it on camera so you know baby
steps but next I'm going to end with
this color Egypt which is a nice green
color should be called money oh my gosh
is so pretty but yeah I just took that
edited to my lid as well because I felt
like that other color was just not
popping enough for me and I'm also
adding it to the bottom lash line and
now I'm taking this rose gold color but
I'm and that into my inner tear ducts
and I just think it'd make it pop more
so now I'm just calling for my face a
little bit and I'm taking my black opal
stick and hazelnut I think yeah I think
that's the color hazelnut and I'm just
blending it out with my armor Beauty
sponge or Beauty fake Beauty Blender
whatever you want to call it so yeah I'm
just contour on my forehead as well and
yes blend blend blend honey
so this is basically all that I do to my
Z and now we just want to set it with my
Smashbox I'm finishing powder in the
color medium
and see this powder right here this just
makes everything just blend all in
together
so now I'm going to go Anna with this
great lash by Maybelline I think inside
and I'm just going to coat my bottom
lashes
now I'm going to go in with my elf blush
palette and I'm using it first color on
the top to your left and I'm just
putting a little bit on my cheeks and I
love the blushes they head
are you on out on to the hair this week
listen to me from premier lace wigs and
they sent me their 360 least wig and I
have it in 18 inches and this is just
everything that comes in a box which you
get your pants lit your wig cap and you
also get an adjustable band that you can
add to the wig I have this wig and a
straight texture and I believe this is
Indian Remi so yeah this is what it's
looking like the hairline looks really
nice I love the baby hairs on the head
line this wig also comes with three
combs in the front a comb in the back
and it gives you a just Abul strips and
this is just a tag that comes on the wig
and it just basically lists all the
details about the wig so now I'm just
going to go ahead and try this week on
just to see how it fits my head and
everything like that I don't know I just
always do that before I cut off the lace
just to see what I'm working with so
yeah I'm just trying it and it fits snug
without the strips being adjusted so I
can tell that this week it's going to be
a bomb as far as sitting on my head
really nice so now I'm just going in and
cutting off the lace
okay so this is what the lace looks like
cut off and now I'm just going to cut
that tag off and basically I'm just
putting it back on my head to see how
it's fitting and everything like that
and I have to say this weeks it's so
good
as far as tingling and shedding I have
not received any tingling or shutting
from this unit even after I cut off the
least I still have not received any
shedding so that's a good thing this
week is like extra soft and just really
nice so now I'll just put it down the
middle and I'm going to take my flat
iron just to flatten it out I'm because
you know I love doing it it just really
makes a difference as far as the wig
laying down really flat and as far as my
braid pattern
my head's braided for a side plot not a
middle part so we bought the Freak this
real quick y'all because I don't know if
y'all can see but it's really humpy and
I am using my combs I don't know what
made me use my combs but this weight
construction I really love because if
it's my hair really nice so if you have
a small hair like me this one is for you
baby
yes site so now I'm just going through
my straightness and I'm just
straightening the hair then I'm going to
go ahead and use my Smashbox finishing
powder in the color medium and I'm just
going to add that to my part I'm not
going to plug my paw anything like that
because I feel like it's wide enough and
it looks really good
so I just added that powder in and it
made a difference okay that part came
alive and for the finishing touch I'm
just going to add my little headband
turban looking thing and this just adds
life to this hair so yeah I hope you
guys enjoy
t4
