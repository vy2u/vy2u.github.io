you can be you know the life is a choice
you may
you can't give for you can change
yeah so I'm back with another video for
you guys I know you love me I love you
too so y'all let's just take a moment to
embrace this way because honey so first
off I received this week from elevate
styles so this is the Bella Bella
collection and I've been liking these
wigs this brand whoever this is because
this is my second time reviewing their
wigs by this brain so anyway this is a
villain Bella wig and the style name is
Alexis and I have it in the color number
2 I don't know if this is a no unit or
not um but yeah I'm pretty sure it's
probably like uh older unit or whatever
but first off did I meant I already say
first off but the most important thing
is that this weight did not come like
this so I'm sorry you guys but the wig
still looks bomb a fresh off the peg and
I'll insert a clip right now so you guys
can see sorry comes it already comes
bomb out the peg you guys want to see
that um but basically I cut it of course
because you guys know that I'm like this
is a happy and I go scissor crazy and
just want to cut up everything I don't
know most is because I like making wigs
into my own and I just like to I don't
know I like to make them look like me so
yeah but let me insert this clip so you
guys can see what the way it looks like
a fresh out of the package and then I'll
get more into the specifics of this way
this is what the way it looks like fresh
out the pack and it is wearable you can
wear the
wig like this is nothing wrong with it
but you guys know that this is like not
my style so yeah I'm going to switch it
up but basically now I'm just moving a
head to the opposite side showing you
that this wig has a lot of versatility
and you can switch it up and wear it on
either side now I'm just taking my craft
scissors which if you have any hair
scissors that will do too but if not you
can be you know a little ratchet like me
and cut the head with some craft
scissors and now I'm just styling it and
showing you that once you cut it you can
still style it and wear it how you
please it really doesn't matter in so
many ways that you can wear this hair
and of course I'm going to keep on
cutting on it because that's just what I
like to do and I'm just trying to find a
style that fits me the best so I guess I
will just continue to keep cutting into
I find a style that fits me so yeah it's
easy I didn't really cut that much off
but I think you guys get the point and
now I'm just playing with it and saying
you know what I like shots okay so of
course and let me just want you guys my
bird has been really crazy my film so if
you get that like alarming town in the
background search so I apologize for
that I'm so sorry
but this is the only place that I can
only film right now but anyway let's
move on sorry if you don't like it just
click out the video so yeah first off
this is a synthetic unit so this is a
synthetic unit it's not human hair
whatsoever and it's also not a lace wig
at all it is a full cap unit which means
it doesn't
at least know part nothing is just a
full cap of hair
usually with whole cat units they don't
really give you home so it doesn't have
combs on the sides or anything just a
comb in the back
the combing is the comb in the back is
all I use so I was real pumped and
excited about that so yeah it also comes
with adjustable straps I'm sure you can
adjust it to fit your head sides I
definitely feel like this week is big
headed search so if you have a bigger
sized head you're gonna steal it the wig
it's going to look one more you it's
going to fit you perfect if you have a
smaller head like me you can still get
away with the idea adjust my straps and
the it's not bulging and a big either I
think I was suggesting my strips wrong
you know I'm slow I'm like where we
taught it so don't want that but like
you can like latch the strip's together
and it won't but you and it won't bunch
up but yeah so if you have a smaller
size head girl you can fix it so and I
don't feel like the way it's going to go
anyway I feel like it's very secure so
you know if y'all don't have this week
like I said elevate styles I will leave
the link down below and I will leave a
direct link where you can go purchase
this week from it's so cheap it's only
like 16 dollars but of course I had not
received any shedding or tingling from
this week because it is a shorter unit
so this week is going to last you a good
little minute I say that all the time
but shouldn't units just last you a long
time you don't have to worry about
tangling or shedding sometimes should
shut up wait do like it be having a
little short hair but this one has not
Shantz so far and I'm just really loving
it it's really not much to say like I
said I will leave the links to
everything in my description box and you
guys come in what you think about this
we have obviously been with a LaBella
like I just want to know
have you guys purchased any wigs from
this brand before let me know and if you
did how dare you because you didn't even
tell me that it was a such thing as
Vella Vella like when I've been but
anyway um yeah so if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below and I love
you guys and I will see you in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
