review and this is the way that I will
be reviewing so this week is from G
Jenny matrix so yes this is what the box
looks like the Box did come to me like
this because I guess it was it was rough
with it so yeah but this is what the box
look like I'm pretty sure most of you
guys have heard about this company I
said before this is the box that it
comes in like this hopefully if you
ordered your head from here your box
won't look like this but I mean the hair
was fun but yeah you here will come in a
standard plastic bag like all the wigs
do and um they did send me some combs to
put in the wig and she sent me a wig cap
and yeah so let me give you the rundown
of this unit this unit is Peruvian deep
wave for lace wig
24 inches in the color jet leg I feel
like this is not jet black though I feel
like it's like oh one beam yes so the
hair is 24 inches um yeah this actually
is one big I don't know why I got jet
lag up there but yeah it is a one being
um the cat's eyes is a medium and the
lace color is medium brown the hair
density is it says um 110 percent
through 130 I feel like this is probably
like 130 and yeah that's about it
so I'll leave everything in my
description box as far as the links to
this unit okay so this is what the unit
looks like and I really love this unit
because I have a hard time with like
kerley units and things like that so
basically this is all the hair to the
front and this is where the head comes
on me so let me show you the Parden area
and I did not do anything to the part
this is how the part comes so yeah I
didn't do anything to the part the only
thing that I have to say about this wig
so if you're ordering you might want to
be careful and just to know what you're
ordering because like the cap
construction of these wigs is a little
bit different I don't think that they're
foolish units comes with any cones or
adjustable straps so you will have to
tell them if you order a full lace unit
that you want combs and adjustable
straps add it into your unit or would
just come without anything and yeah it
looks kind of crazy I think the only
thing that really comes with adjustable
straps and combs are the lace fronts and
this is a foolish unit so you can part
this whatever you want to the unit look
really crazy on my head because it just
didn't hit like it didn't fit so let me
show you guys what I did in the inside
just in case like you were curious to
know how this wig is stand on my head
and don't laugh y'all because we'll just
take it off in front of cat in front of
the camera but um yes so this is what my
head looks like underneath but I
edit one of those elastic bands to it
see how you can see like no um it's no
combs or adjustable straps in here so I
would have preferred to have a black
strap but white was all ahead in my
house so I just used this white elastic
van and you can get these from anywhere
like Walmart you can get them from
Michael's you can get them from Joann
Fabric you can get them like anywhere
I'm pretty sure Target got them to like
you can get them anywhere but basically
what I did was I just sold it right
there so yeah and this is how you can
tell my head is so small because I know
y'all probably thinking like okay why is
it that little it's that little because
my head is like ro Yong Yong I'm try as
like the tangling and shedding um
I don't get much tangling out of this
unit but no I don't get much shedding
out of this unit but I do get um
tangling I guess from it being like kind
of curly I do get like tingling towards
the back but it's pretty easy to
detangle all you need to do is like add
some water and conditioner to a bottle
spray in it and it like bounces back to
normal and it detangles the hair so yeah
this is how the curls came originally
all's I did was wash the unit and it
looks exactly the same it's kind of like
more of like a hard curl when you get it
like it still looks like this but the
hair is like a little hard so I just
washed it and this is how it turned out
so
restiveness unit I'll make sure I leave
everything in my description box if you
have any questions or comments feel free
to leave them in a comment section down
below and yeah that's the end of my
video you guys I will talk to you later
