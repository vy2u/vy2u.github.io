another video and this video is going to
be a little different because it's it's
ready unit y'all y'all know my
experience have not been real good with
the dreaded units for sure so we just
wanna try this again but I think that
I'm pleased with this week so first off
this week is definitely not new to the
YouTube world so I'm pretty sure if
you're into units like this thing you've
already came across this week or maybe
you've already purchased it already but
if you haven't this is what I'm here for
so this is the sister wigs and it's the
yellow wavy like wavy faux locs and I
have it in the color too so yeah this is
what the card looks like okay so before
I tell you my thoughts on this week
let's happen to the construction of
course now it should typical
construction two combs and a front a
comb in the back and adjustable strips
this wig fits me snug so I don't really
know if it will be big hay friendly it's
kind of stretchy so maybe if you have a
bigger size head you can still fit into
it this week but I did Jeff's my strict
once your dress I just my strips the wig
fit me like really good nice and tight
so if you have a smaller head like me
you can definitely get away with when
this wig if you have a normal to larger
size head I still think that you could
fit this wig just don't adjust your
straps or adjust it to your head sides
this week also comes with a lace part
and it did come with fleece that you
have to cut off and the lace was like a
soft lace the part is on the right side
most of these wigs come with a part on
the right side is red that she'll get a
part on the left side so yeah the part
comes
a right side part and I did kind of
shift it over just a little bit more
because these weeks be coming with the
part like almost as a middle part and
it's supposed to be a side part so yeah
I just shifted the wig over just a
little bit more to make the part a
little deeper I did not pluck the part
the pot already comes pre plucked and
all I did was add my finishing powder
into the part I also brushed out some of
my baby heads and I used got to be gel
to move my baby heads and this is just
what it's looking like and I'm really
really surprised now I know I'm gonna
get this question about the wig heaven
filling heads and yes this week still
has filler hairs throughout the wig but
you cannot see the filler heads
whatsoever like they definitely
constructed this wig really well to the
point where it definitely looks niche
especially from coming from that first
dreaded wig that I did because it was
like soon as I turned around like you
can see all the short hairs
I also had another shredded wig that I
purchased on my own and it was like
spiral curl dreads but I didn't really
like that but it was cute but I just was
not feeling it
so I sold that one in my wig cell but
when I saw this one I was like let me
just go ahead and try because I'm just
itching to try a braid it was reddit
unit and I just had a good feeling about
this week and my feeling was right like
oh my gosh I really really loved this
wig like it looks so natural you guys so
I was about to get the burgundy it was
like a reddish burgundy it didn't have
no dog food so nothing but I wasn't
really sure how this was gonna turn out
so I'm like let me just stick to the
natural colors first before I go before
I jump out there but I definitely wish I
would have got this in a burgundy color
that burgundy reddish color just
I feel like it would have been lit for
rue but this is really nice like if
you're looking for a dreaded type unit
definitely check this out it's not long
ago nothing but I definitely love the
limp they need to make a longer unit
like this exactly like this cuz this is
nice it is it's not heavy it is
lightweight I don't feel like it's heavy
to me it's definitely lightweight yeah
it's really really nice yeah
so for me what I did was I went ahead
and went to my local beauty supply store
and you can find these little jewel
piece things at your beauty supply store
and I just put them on here just to give
it that world type of feel because you
know how people be wearing these on that
transpeople we can wear these when it
breaks but I was like just to dress it
up a little bit so it won't be too plain
and I definitely love the way this
turned out you guys and this is it
straight out the package like you really
don't have to do nothing oh and it did
come off like a string to keep all the
dress together that was hooked on it but
I cooked that thing off and when of
course I don't receive any shedding oh
it's Hangul in because you're just not
this week I feel like it's going to last
you a really really really long time
like you can definitely with this week
for a long time and I feel like the end
should be gay I don't feel like they
would unravel because they have like
like they burnt and no something like
it's hard at the end like they still did
all so I don't know if you have this
weakening unraveled let me know cuz I
would really like to know but I feel
like they went I'm ready now have you as
to cut it I feel like you shouldn't cut
it like some pieces up in here like
right here is longer and I felt like I
wanted to cut it but then I was like oh
let me not cut it and just leave it
alone
I wasn't sure but even if I cut it I can
always go and burn the ends and I'm
pretty sure it would stay so yeah never
mind you I'm pretty sure you can cut
this and didn't just burn the ends if
you wanted to but for now I'm just gonna
leave it alone
because no it's just so cute
I just think I'm more so shocked than
anything almost the outcome of this week
because y'all like this week is so cute
on media like I definitely love it I
love everything about it
but yet let me turn around so y'all can
see what it looks like and as you can
see it's so full like of course they do
have filler pieces I don't know if ever
see that but they do have like the
filler pieces but yeah you cannot see
that at all so to me that's not really
nothing to worry about ok that's what
it's looking like so that's it for this
video if you guys have any questions
feel free to leave it in the comment
section down below and I will see y'all
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
