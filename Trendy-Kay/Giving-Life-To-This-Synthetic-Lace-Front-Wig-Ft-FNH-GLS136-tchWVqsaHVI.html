video so this video is gonna be on this
head then we're now and this week listen
to me from a Friday night hair and this
is the GLS 136 and I have it in a color
tt-33 - so here's the card sorry y'all
you're not gonna be able to see it I
tried to do it in a little clip where I
was stopping this week but it didn't
work either but yeah that's the style of
this week if you're not familiar Friday
night head they also give you the tape
and it's hook point to the little card
thing and that's just in case you want
to take down your hair me I just I don't
even feel like I need to use tape or
glue or gel to glue the lace down
because Friday night I'm here at least
normally lays flat so I don't have to
really worry about the lace coming up or
not stand down so yeah so if you're not
familiar with the construction of Friday
night hey wait basically this is a
synthetic wig of course and it is a
lace-front synthetic weed and it comes
with two combs and in front a comb in
the back with adjustable straps now I
will say that this cap size is a little
bit snug I felt like before I even
adjusted the straps it was a little bit
like fit in my head and I do have a
smaller sized head so if you have a big
head keep that in mind I did go in and
adjust my straps in this wig fits me to
a team so I definitely love the way
Friday night hair wigs fit my head they
fit it really nice so if you do have a
small to hit like me definitely check
out their wigs cuz their wigs fit
smaller heads very well also they give
you a round one and a half inches worth
of lace and that's just where you can
part the wig
so most of the laces towards the middle
part and then when you start going down
on the sides of course it's less lace to
work with but not all the construction
of these units are the same some have
more lay space than others and the card
is actually different I think they're
cards that has more lay spaces like a
gold type of card if I'm not mistaken
but yeah those are the wigs that comes
with more lay space so keep that in mind
so I'm just gonna go ahead and show you
how much lay space they give you and I
don't even know if you guys can see that
but that's the amount of space that you
can get so if you wanted to part this
wig in the middle you definitely can do
that it's not gonna be a long photo in
part but you definitely can put it in
the middle me with these type of with
the wigs that don't have really that
much lay space I just like to do to flip
over my fit and that's basically just
flipping all the hair to one side so
yeah I just flipped all the hair to one
side and I like it like this because it
looks more natural versus that little
part but I'm yeah so this is how I style
the wig and a Friday night hair the
Friday night wigs their hair line
normally isn't that natural so what I
like to do is I like to cut baby hairs
into the wig just to make the wig a pair
more natural so that's what it's looking
like
and and the clips you can see me cut in
it because when I first received it and
first got it out the package like it was
really long like the bug didn't
gradually go together I noticed that
about their wigs when they had like bubs
the front part just be extra long and
then the back it's like above and then
the front is extra long I'm really not a
fan of that so I just cut it to even it
out a little bit it still is going into
like the angle where it's short and then
goes long
but before this wave was like really
long it was like two different
hairstyles like the front was a ramp and
then the back was a boat I don't know
but yeah this is what it turned out to
be I did get a little bit of tangling
when I was brushing out this hair when I
first got it out the PEC but I did play
around with this wig off camera so that
could have been what the tangling was
coming from but after I brush it out it
wasn't too bad and it wasn't really
tangling it was more of like snakes so
yeah also I did not get any shudder from
this wig even if I cut off the lace I
did not get any shot in this week is I
didn't know I don't know if I mentioned
but the lace on this wig is heartless
just in case any of you guys wanted to
know so my previous video for Friday
night hair I did a bob I mean I did a
video on a week that was the same exact
color except for it was like a more
messy type of curly bug which I really
loved
so this one is along the lines of that
except for is straights but yeah also
this is a duck routed Bob but the only
thing about the duck root is it's only
where the dopplers is only where the
lace is so I find that it's more
difficult to try to conceal like the
sides where the track is because in the
back is all one solid color is not like
two-tone like the top is so if you did
want to wear this wig like flip over I
felt like you have to go in with like
some black hand spray or maybe like a
marker or something just to give it a
little bit of dark roots and that's what
I did right here I did it off camera you
can't really I don't know if you can
tell I don't even know if I did a room I
don't even know if I really did a good
job on it but when you flip it over like
you can clearly tell you know it just
didn't look right so you would
definitely have to add the dunk roots
right here so it can just kind of
disguise it and make it look more
natural so yeah this way it's also a
stew
these textures so if you don't like if
you're not if you don't like a silky
texture wigs you might not like this one
is not yaki whatsoever and the density
is pretty good for above I feel like
it's not too thin but I feel like it's
not too thick Eva it's like a give me
I'm it's like right in the middle with
it's just like the perfect density for a
ball
I definitely love this little hairstyle
after I fixed it up so this is not like
a week that you can just put on and wait
and wear straight out of the package I
feel like you definitely have to put
some work into this week and order for
it to look bright but um yeah if you're
willing to put the work into this wig it
will definitely look bomb I definitely
definitely love love love the color so
yeah if you're interested in this wig
definitely check out my description box
I'll leave all the links to Friday night
hair in my description box and if you

that's it for this video I don't want
this to be too long I felt like I had
something else to say but it slipped my
mind anyway if you see me in the same
outfit it's only because I'm filming
multiple videos because I'm trying to
get like all of these videos out for you
