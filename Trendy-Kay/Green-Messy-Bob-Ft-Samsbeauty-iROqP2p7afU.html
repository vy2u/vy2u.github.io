back with another video so I'm just
coming in and like redoing my intro real
quick like sorta kinda but I just want
you to know that clip evidence I'm gonna
look a bit washed out because my camera
setting was off and I just no noticed it
but I already had filmed the whole video
and this is my second time filming this
video so I wasn't about to film in a
third time
so yeah just be where I am a little
washed out not anymore but in the clips
that you're about to see yeah it's a bit
light on the light side so yeah I hope
you enjoyed this video
yes yes I'm looking like somebody's
leprechaun hey guys it's Kate of course
and I'm back with another video so this
video is gonna be on at this head that
I'm wearing and your I was supposed to
come out with this video for your last
week but I was having some complication
not really complications but I just did
not like the way that the week turned
out on me so now I'm back and I'm better
and we're just going to try this again
this time all green everything okay
including the watch so before I get
started let's talk about this watch okay
honey these type of watches is not new
to my channel I do have like a burgundy
one and they just sent me a new one for
the holidays so this is more on the
brown side and then the face is green
and is crafted so nicely so I do need to
go in and
besides like getting one of the links
took it over because it is a big a bit
big but yeah they are hosting a giveaway
giving you a $180 credit towards any
watch that you want and I'm going to go
ahead and leave all the links in my
description box just in case you guys
want to go ahead into the giveaway
okay guys so moving on to this hair like
I said this is my second time filming
this video on this hair I definitely
loved it much better this way than how
it was before but yeah our answer clips
of what the way it looked like
originally
you
I don't have the paper cause like I said
I meant the little stock card because it
just up and disappear like I said I had
this week for a while now and I can't
even remember what I did with the stock
card but the brand of this wig is the
stylist I've never did a video on this
type of brand wig before so yeah the
company is called the stylist and the
wig name is called curly bulb and I
forget the color but it's something ot I
don't know but I'll insert like the
picture and everything of the stock card
on the side of me and so right here I'm
going to insert what the wig looked like
and all of that good stuff before I did
what I did to you know achieve this look
so yeah also this week wasn't to me from
Sam's Beauty so just in case you're
interested in this week or other weights
that they have in general on the website
I will definitely leave all the links in
my description box oh yeah onto this wig
this is like a silk base type of wig not
really a silk base but what I mean by
that is basically they give you an it's
a four by four so they give you it's
like a closure so it's not like one set
part but you can part this wig anywhere
from like here to here and like going
back this way so yeah it's not a set
part so just in case you like parting
your hair on the side you can definitely
put the hair on the side over you like
middle parts it gives you the option to
part it in the middle which I like about
these type wigs now what they mean by
silk base is basically it's a piece of
fabric underneath the lace making it to
like your skin tone but if you're
lighter I feel like you would just need
to go ahead and add your concealer or
powder because the soap part that they
put underneath it's like a brownish
color so if you're lighter than a
brownish color of course it's not gonna
match your scalp so yeah that's fixable
of course you can always go in and edge
your concealer or finishing powder them
and
fix for me I didn't really use the part
in space because when I tried it in the
middle I just didn't like it so of
course my Old Faithful I just flipped
the head over to one side and it just
looks much better like this and this
side was the side that I was liking
originally so I just wind up flipping
all the head over to that side and I
definitely love this side now I know
y'all probably like this looks so
different because this part looks Carole
I didn't curl it or anything like that
I literally just took my event brush and
like brush the curls under to make this
little effect because if you look at my
previous clips that I'm gonna insert the
wig was like flipping I mean not the
weight but the hair was kind of like
flipping up doing its own thing in the
back and I didn't really care for that
too much so yeah I just you know brushed
it under so it kind of looks like it's
curl under but it's just brushed like
that and the curls just form like this I
do believe this wig has two combs and a
front of home in a bag with the
adjustable straps now I do feel like
this week is big hair friendly so if you
do have any bigger sized head I feel
like this will definitely fit you great
now if your head is on a smaller side
like mine all you have to do is adjust
your straps and I feel like you'll be
fine now as far as how these baby hands
it's just flowing these are not my baby
heads I just went ahead and created some
baby heads books and the wig so I just
cut some hair and mold it with my guys
to be glued Joe and this is what it's
looking like the middle part that I had
before I felt like the thickness of the
hair was just too much for that type of
style especially if you wanted to wear
in the Middle Ages to me it looked bulky
so in my opinion I think that this wig
looks better as a sidecar or flipped
over on the side I feel like if you do
have a bigger head maybe it will look
better because the wig your head is
gonna fill in the wig but me because I
already have a small hair and I had
it's some extra room in its weight
already it just looked big and buff like
big and bulky on my head so I don't know
I just didn't like it the wig is not
thin by far it is a sari thick wig and
tangling and shedding I did not receive
any tingling from this wig still now I
don't receive tingling from this week
but shedding as soon as I got it out the
pic I did get a little shudder from this
week it wasn't no crazy type shedding
but it did I'm not really gonna
make this video too long because like I
said I've already made this video before
but like I said overall I liked it I
hate this week as part of in the middle
but as far as like flipping it over to a
stoplight and all that good stuff I
definitely didn't love the way this week
turned out like this
so yeah if you're interested I'll go
ahead and leave all the links in the
description box just in case you know
you want to check out this wig
