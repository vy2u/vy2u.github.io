eyelashes like eyelashes is just like my
thing like I just love eyelashes I love
anything that has to do with hair that I
can wear I don't know I feel like I've
been told like I don't really wear
eyeshadow like that like eyelashes for
me it sets off my look so yeah so we're
gonna get it started with eyelashes
because so many of you have been asking
where I get my lashes from it what
lashes am I wearing
so yeah okay the first place I'm going
to talk about is Koko lashes only place
I think that you can purchase these
lashes from is Lady moz.com
so again I will leave all like the
information to where I bought these
lashes from any links to the websites in
my description box yeah I'm not really
into buying $30 lashes make lashes
that's just not what I'm doing
yeah I'm just I refused to pay $30 on
some lashes so yeah I mean if you can't
afford to pay $30 for some lashes like
by all means
do your thing go go but no I'm not you
know I'm not doing it the first pair I
got from there are the Stella and this
is what they look like the next one I
got is goddess the next pair I got is
Misha I really like Misha I have two
pairs of Misha so I bought two pairs of
Misha even though the ones I'm wearing
look exactly like Misha but they're just
a lot thicker and I only got one pair of
the ones that I went which are called
the risky lashes and I wish that I would
have got 2 pairs of these instead
phase of the mission because I just like
the way these look better I will insert
a clip of how these lashes look as well
and the last pair lashes that I got from
Koko lashes are Ariel and this is what
these look like the next company that I
ordered lashes from our house of lashes
I buy lashes from them all the time I
really love their lashes and they are
affordable in the first lashes I got the
sovereign lashes which I really like
lashes that look like this for some
reason it has like the little gaps in
between them they just fit my eye
really Wow the next lashes I have is
smokey mousse I'm the next lashes are
iconic but these are door fairy black
it's just I did pick up this little cute
looking lash case and it holds 3 pairs
of lenses another this is like another
eyelash case and it holds three as well
and I just like how it's like so gold
the next company that I ordered lashes
from from lashes XO so yes I'm really in
love with this company out of all of the
lashes that I'm going to show you this
by far is my favorite company because
they are so affordable and so the first
pair I have is Lexie Lux and this is
what it looks like the next pair I got
our lucky Lola and a lot of people were
asking me what lashes was I wearing and
one of my videos it was a couple of my
videos um I'm trying to think
the the NACHA grandma with that video I
was wearing these along with the Friday
night hair was the blonde on the bottom
I can't remember what the video is
called
but yeah if you watch my videos like
that then you'll know what I'm talking
about
but yes everybody who was asking me
about the lashes that I was wearing I
was when these lashes right here and
they're called the lucky Lola lashes and
I absolutely love these lashes like
these are my favorite lashes they look
so good
so mean so I like them so much I did
purchase
I purchased a pack of three these are
the ones that I didn't wear and I'm
using and these are the ones that I had
been wearing to see how I was falling
off but yeah I bought three of those on
the next lash is a door which I think
these are so cute
the next one is Jezebel princess the
next one is would be Whoopi wispy Sheik
then I have Venus vibe which I really
like these and then I have angel or more
now you're probably thinking like that's
the same lash but actually it is pretty
much the same lanch but I didn't know
that until I received them but yeah the
only difference between these two lashes
is that one is like a brown and black
color and one
the black color so the angel more is
more on the brown side and the Venus
vibe is more on the black side so yeah
just be careful when if you do decide to
order yeah you don't have to really
order both unless you want to so yeah
that was all that I got from Blanche XO
the next place that I bought it from is
called social eyes and they are a
portable alleged company as well so the
first lash that is it a mate 2.0 and
that's what they look like I really
really love these because these look
like so I'm sure enough make lashes and
none of these measures are actually like
real make the next one I got our siren
and that's what it looks like sorry
about the glare these are the vixen
lashes which you probably can tell
they're like I'm so in love with flashes
they look like this then I have
glamorous and these are more on like the
natural side and then I have ravishing
which I really really like these and
then the last pair of lashes that I got
from them are called dolly and Oh dolly
yeah this is my first pair of bottom
lashes that I ever bought but yet
usually I just wear top lashes and I
just put miss mascara on my bottom
lashes because I feel like my bottom
lashes are already pretty long so I
don't feel like I need to wear fake
lashes on my bottom lash even though my
top lashes are pretty long too but I
just like you know fake lashes so that's
it for social what is it social eyes the
next place that I ordered lashes from
our crown loyalty I think
how you pronounce it so yeah I only
ordered three lashes so the first pair
of lashes that I ordered no problem
these are wood winked so these are what
these look like the next pair I got are
cahoots mess with these look like and
then the last lashes I got I had to look
one look on the back to see what these
are called because for some reason the
names don't want to bantha these but
it's not gonna make it this one so let
me see so twist these are called twigs
okay so the next place I ordered lashes
from is eBay now my normal like go-to
lashes are the demi wispies and they
aren't really affordable they're only
three dollars and some change but this
is what the demi wispies look like and I
always keep I always I normally always
keep the demi wispies on hand only
because like these are my all-time
favorite lashes and it's just my go-to
lash so yeah most of the time I am when
the demi wispies lashes so yeah the only
thing about eBay is you have to wait for
forever to get your things
but surprisingly it did not take long at
all for me to receive my items I would
say like honestly like less than it took
like less than a few weeks
to get these lunches and I'm so happy
that I received them so this is what it
looks like in like they're not like
thick and all they have like a clear
band and as you can see I did purchase a
lot I even gave my sister a peck and
these were only a dollar and for a
dollar and you get five pair like you
can't beat that like so I will list the
link to where I got these from just in
case you like well you know top $12
still is a lot to pay for some lashes by
all means do you think bow and get your
lashes even cheaper at eBay so yeah so
then I just started going crazy so I
pretty much think that these are like
these are the same I also ordered more I
think I got these from another vendor
but also I got these from eBay as well
and these are what they look like and
they look exactly like the other ones
last set of lashes that are ordered from
eBay or these are make lashes they're
supposed to be 100% make hair but
honestly I really don't even think that
that they are a hundred percent make
hair I think I spent like no more than
two dollars one these and I got four I
actually got five but I gave my sister a
pack was at the mention that I did get
this I think I got this from lash pack
zone and it's just um some some freaking
what do you call this lash glue yeah I
use lash grip adhesive glue whatever you
want to call it that's what I used to
apply my lashes so yeah I wanted to try
this though so yeah so you guys that is
it for the lashes
would and again I will leave everything
in the description box and all the links
to these lashes this just in case you're
interested in buying lashes so yes sorry
that was a lot of lashes you guys but
I'm obsessed with lashes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
