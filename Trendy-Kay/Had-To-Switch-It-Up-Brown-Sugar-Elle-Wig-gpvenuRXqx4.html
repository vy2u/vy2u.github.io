review and this wig was sent to me from
elevate style so I make sure I leave
their links in the description box if
anybody is interested in this week so
yes let's get one - this hair which
looks nothing like how it came and I
didn't film it so I'm sorry you guys but
just leaving a comment if you want me to
do a video on how I transform this week
yes so I was just experimenting and this
is just how it turned out so yes the
week they sent me is the brown sugar
signature part lace front wig and I have
it in a style BSS to o2l and I have it
in the color sr1 beet galaxy now the
color I really really love the color the
color is really pretty and basically
it's like a mix between like a purplish
burgundy color and yeah it looks really
nice and then on a bottom layer you just
have like it looks like a color number
two I'm and you also had like the duck
root going into this purplish burgundy
type color
yeah the color is really nice now they
didn't have a lot of colors available
when I picked out this unit so that's
the reason I got this color but I am
happy with this color so yeah I feel
like this wig would have looked so much
better if I had gotten it in this color
but yeah this is actually bit the way it
looks like or what the way it looked
like when I first received it and as you
can see it looks nothing like how it
looked when a model for me I just didn't
like the way this was style
it just wasn't popping enough for me I
don't know it was kind of weird I just
wanted
a little different because it was just I
don't know it was regular that's why I
said I rather have it in a blonde color
because I feel like with this style a
blonde color would just make the weight
pop so much more but yeah so this weight
also comes with tape just in case she
wants to take down your lace because
this this wig does come with soft lace
and you have to be careful when plucking
apart because the and you do have to be
careful when plucking your part because
the lace is extra soft I'm and that's
one thing that I'm mad about is because
when I was plucking apart
I had plucked so many holes in this wig
yeah so this week is synthetic it also
comes in a Yankee texture now I did run
my straightness through it so when you
do put heat on this week the Yankee
texture car that disappears a little bit
you can still tell it's Yankee but it's
not as Jackie as it was before I flat on
this hair so this week comes with three
combs in total one on each side of the
parts and one in the back with
adjustable straps now this is a
right-side part because the part does
come on a side it doesn't come in the
middle so this is a right sided part and
you have a comb right here and right
here when it shifted to the side now
this wig fits me pretty okay I feel like
I do have I feel like I do have a lot of
room and this week but I don't feel like
it's too too big so if you do have a
larger size head you definitely can get
away with this wig and if you have a
smaller size head like me you always can
use your adjustable straps with which
I'm using now and if you like you can
use your combs as well I really don't
mess with the combs but I do have my
comb placed in the back just to give me
an extra a little extra security this is
not my first time filming at this video
for this hair I actually filmed this
video I actually covered this video
probably about a month ago and I didn't
like the way it turned out because I
didn't like the style of this hair was
just I don't know it was something about
that was just like I wasn't feeling so
now I'm back and better with this
gorgeous hairstyle I really love the way
this turned out but yeah I do like this
so I just took my straightness and I
just straightened the hair because when
you receive the wig it does come with a
bin so I just you know straightened it
so it can be straight so I also went in
and just cut it into a short bob or like
a shoulder left Bob so yeah I didn't cut
that much off but bins though I shifted
and I shifted the part to a middle part
I had to even the hair all the way
around so I just so this is what it came
out to be like a bob but yeah you do
have like I'll just show you this side
is a little bit shorter right here
versus this side because when it was on
the side they do give you like that
little baby parts so yeah this is why
this is so short but I didn't want to
cut the hair all the way up to here so
that's why it's tucked behind my ears
but yeah I think that this looks so
pretty I don't know if it's even in the
back but I'll show you guys what the
back looks like before I show you what
the bags look with the back of this wig
looks like this week does not do any
shuttin I have not received any shouting
or Tanglin from this wig even when I
plucked out the part I still have not
received any shedding from this wig so
tangling it and shedding with this wig
is very very good I love the fact that
this week leaves so flat and even though
it's a snap bit big on my head you can't
really tell that it's big on my head
because how flat it lays and I do have
my head in for cornrows going straight
back so yeah make sure you have your
head flat flat flat because that has a
lot to do with you
looking natural always have your hair
flat under your wigs so yeah this is
what it looks like and I'm just going to
turn around for you guys to see
so guys this is to this video if you
guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
