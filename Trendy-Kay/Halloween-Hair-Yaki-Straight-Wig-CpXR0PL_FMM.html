again I think that this is gonna be my
last review for today but yeah I'm going
to be doing a review on this beautiful
hair right here and yes as you can see
it's straight yeah yeah yeah so I was
sent this week from auto weeks online
this is their repeat purchases were mean
hair 100% human hair lease weeks and it
just has their email and everything in a
website and stuff like that and then on
the back of the box it gives you
instructions but I am going to insert a
clip of what the hair looked like when I
received it and everything this is
pretty much how the hair looks um so
yeah and I'll make sure I leave all on
the links to this website in my
description box so this is how the
package and look and this is what the
way it comes in and they sent me some
lashes two packs of weight caps a pack
of cones and a cash back card and now
this is what the wig looks like straight
out of the packaging okay guys so I have
been seriously even going through it
with this wig this is the kinky straight
hair it is a lace front unit which means
it's not like fully swell you have at
least bump all the way throughout the
wig it's only lace up in the front so
this is how much parting space it's an
okay amount of parting space I do
believe this wig it's 22 inches long it
stops above right above my belly button
so yeah
this head is pretty soft now I know you
guys probably like okay like some
shrieks so I think this color is a 427
yeah this color is a 427 so basically is
in
before throughout the hair and then the
streaks or highlights and the wig is a
color 27 which they look really they
look like a 613 if you ask me basically
I've been going through this phase where
I want like burgundy British hair I have
like this vision in my mind but it's
just not working out the way I wanted to
work out so I felt like that color is
just like so full
it sounds like okay let me pick out this
wig so it'd be easier for me so I
wouldn't have to bleach the hair
basically I wanted to skip the step with
bleach your hair just because I I'm lazy
and I just don't feel like doing all
that so I figured okay I'll get a number
four because when I put the Box color I
didn't want to bleach it basically so I
was just gonna put a box color over the
top so me thinking a number four is like
the lightest color when it comes to
brown basically if that makes any sense
it would just be easier to live so I got
the four because I thought it would be
easier to live and the color would show
up and then how I wanted it you know how
I wanted to color throughout the hair I
felt like me getting the blond
highlights throughout the him that it
would give me that dimension that I was
looking for I'm going to insert clips of
how the wig looks like and inside and
you know the construction of the wig and
everything like that so basically how
they constructed the wig was like they
only put the highlights where the lace
front was so where the lace is is only
with the highlights is which is the 27
color um but in the back of the wig like
it's no highlights throughout which I
thought that the highlights will would
be throughout the way instead of them
adding the hair into the lace and then
like coloring the hair once it's added
to the lace no they didn't do that they
just like edit the color number 27 so
basically it's like
you can see where they inserted the hair
like it's just like little circles of
bomb pieces throughout the lace if you
guys get what I'm saying
it's very tanky I'm not really a fan of
that so yeah I was like what the heck is
this so anyway I bought a box color I
think I don't even know the brand but it
was like a burgundy color so I began to
just color the back and I say and as you
can see the wig did not take like it
looks exactly the same now ever when I'm
in like dead
sunlight you can see a hint of the color
but besides that like the coloring
process was a fail so I didn't want to
do it over anything like that sounds
just like a forget it I'm just gonna
rock the wig with these streaks now this
is not something that I would typically
typically wear or pick out I'm
definitely not a fan of these this
highlights
I don't know um it's just not for me but
as far as the wig is concerned the
weight is absolutely gorgeous it looks
and feels just like real hair like that
Yankee texture like and it's so thick
that's another thing that I love about
this week the density is like really
good it's just it feels like some
healthy hair I have not had an issue
with tangling I have not had an issue
but no I have had an issue with tangling
and I have not had an issue with
shedding I first received the wig like
it was like butter it was like no snags
no tangles or anything and then after I
like put that box color in there um it
was just like I don't get like a few
snags if you guys are interested in this
week I will make sure I leave their
links and everything and the description
box so you can check out this week for
yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
