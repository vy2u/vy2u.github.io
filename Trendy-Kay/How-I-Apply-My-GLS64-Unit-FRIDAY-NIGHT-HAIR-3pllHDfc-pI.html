review and I told you I will be filming
multiple videos today so yeah I'm just
trying to get like videos out for this
time you know time that I missed now
putting videos out the reason that I'm
starting this video off with my wig cap
on is because a lot of people have been
asking me to show them how I apply my
wigs which is really no kind of special
way normally most of the time I never
had any of my hair out to blend in with
the unit's because I feel like um it
looks natural the only thing that I'll
have out is my baby hair so yeah I just
and my head's not even braided um when
I'm lazy and I don't feel like braids in
my hair I normally just have it back
into a ponytail which this is how my
hair always is when I don't wear wigs
it's just like a part in the middle and
just slip back into a ponytail so that's
basically how my hair is underneath and
yeah it's a big hump back there but who
cares
um cuz I'm pretty sure you're not going
to baby be able to see it underneath up
then it's no special way that I put my
units on but you guys wanted to see how
I apply my unit and I will show you but
it's just regular Hey it really is you
guys it's so simple so basically um I
don't have my hair braided I have it in
a ponytail slicked back and I had to
wear caps on um normally I would wear
one way cap if my head it's braided but
it's not so I need my bun in the back to
be a little more flatter so I put two
wee caps on
um dependent on the wig and how natural
I want my way to look if it doesn't look
natural already is when I will pull out
my own hair but the ways that I've
normally I've been recently wearing have
been pretty natural looking and I feel
like all I needed to do was um bring out
my baby hairs so that's basically what I
do so let's get into the video you guys
this will be a review on the Friday
night hair my favorite um this is Friday
night head calm this is where you can
get this unit from and this is style GLS
64 um yeah and I have it in the color 1b
so let me show you guys what it looks
like and be aware that um this wig is a
shorter wig you guys because I just
wanted to trash room to me so yes I'm a
state on camera this is kind of hard um
well benefit I'm going to show you the
inside of the cap it has a comb right
here and a comb right here in the front
I guess they like on the sides and it
has a don't have a comb in the back yeah
it has a comb in the back and it has the
adjustable straps as you can see my
adjustable straps is like almost to the
last loop but yeah so this is the amount
of lace that they give you and yeah this
is what it looks like
I just wanted something natural but when
I received it I was like dang like
that's real short like it's the length
of my head already so yeah so I'm just
going to put this one really quick and
if you hear anything in the
Brown that's my cat so don't mind him
okay you guys like this is really hard
but I'm going to try to do it alright so
I normally just put the unit on like
this and I line everything up to make
sure the wig is on correctly and I just
place it behind my baby hair that I have
out so this lace is ear to ear so I'm
just placing it right there again I
place my wig um behind my baby as that's
left out
so this is the unit and okay you guys so
I did throw one some earrings because I
feel like this is like really short and
probably pointless to me because my
hands already this limp so I don't know
but it is really cute um so if anybody
is like interested in shorter units and
you're not really a fan of the longer
units this will be a unit that you can
go for again this is a lace-front unit
so it gives you about two inches of
parting space which is right here and
you can put this anywhere so it's
basically like a loose kind of wavy type
of film and this has to be like 10 of 12
inches so this is what it looks like
anybody likes the shorter
natural-looking units this is definitely
one for you
it is um just a little bit uh tangley
but i have one it's already before so
it's probably why but um it's not bad at
all because it is like curly wavy type
of feel going on so yes this is what it
looks like
I don't get much shedding from this unit
I'm just tangulls here and here and
there um and that's about it so this is
definitely optional you can toss this
wig over to the side we'll toss this
hair over to the side and make it a side
part which I really really love this on
the side it just adds so much more to
this unit than it being in the middle I
guess because of its lip so um yeah the
first time I would is I want um in a
minute why I didn't even try it as a
side part but I'm actually liking the
side much better than what it looks like
um in the middle so yeah you can wear
this in the middle on the side it
doesn't matter which side you weight on
I typically wear my part one this side
so yeah you guys I'm actually going to
leave it like this because I really love
this um wig with the part on the side so
yes if you are interested in this unit
you can pick this up it Friday night
hair comb and I will leave the price in
my description box along with the link
and everything else so so yeah I don't
really think that um a 360 is really
necessary for this short week but I'm
just going to do it anyway
just in case somebody was curious to see
what it looks like in all angles so yeah
this is what it looks like in the front
area I'm in the front area this is what
it looks like in the front
so yeah this is the end of my video I
hope you guys enjoy this review and I
will see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
