hey guys is KN I'm back with another
video and I'm gonna make this really
quick I don't know if I'm gonna add this
like this intro in the beginning of the
video or like after you see me applying
the wig but whatever the case may be I
just want to let you guys know the specs
honestly just in case any of you guys
are interested so this week listen to me
from Wow evany and I will hit and leave
the links in the description box just in
case any of you guys are interested in
this week this week do come pre bleached
alright which which I love which that
are become pre bleached because it just
allows me to do my thing and you know
customize the week to my liking with
whatever color I want to put over the
top of the bleach so if you're like me
and you like pre pre bleached wigs
always that's already pre bleach
definitely check out this week this week
is Yankee also so that's another thing
that I liked about this week but anyway
this is the starting reading on my phone
but this is the Yankee straight glue
this release from Peruvian version hair
ombre brown wig uh-hum and it's in the
lymph 18 inches the density is 150
percent the cap size is the medium so
yeah like I said I'll leave all the
links in the description box real quick
I just wanted to let you guys know that
when I receive the wig I don't have a
clip of what it looked like originally
like the color I don't know why I didn't
film it but it slipped my mind
but like I said the links will be in the
description box and the picture is
exactly how the way it looks when you
receive the week so if you're curious
about what color it is definitely check
out the link also it says 18 inches I
don't feel like this week
eighteen inches but I did cut like this
much off because I felt like the length
was just too awkward for me um so I did
cut a little bit off like that much off
because it's kind of like in a book and
the front was just way too long to just
look awkward
I also plucked the hair line which you
can't really see the hair line is pretty
thick I feel like I could go back and
pluck it some more but for now it's fine
if you plan on wearing this part in the
middle cuz when I receive the wig I
received apart
I received the wait with the part in the
middle and if you wear a middle part
it's already like pre plucked and like
bleached but only on the part so I'm
trying to even talk fast cuz my battery
is one day and I don't know when it's
gonna cut off on me but this is the end
results I am gonna put clips because
this is the second day I'm recording
this video because yesterday I didn't
really like how my head turned out I was
just off I did I did scoop my wig back
to because I felt like it was a little
bit too far on my forehead but this is
still the same application how I applied
my wigs but today I just schooled it my
wig back a little bit and I curl
yesterday I curled my wait I curled this
head with the flat irons oh the
straightness and today I curled it with
this this is by Revlon this was only
like 20 bucks
the only thing about curling it with
this versus my flat lines is that this
one doesn't relieve like the hair is not
holding a curl but when I curl it with
my flat lines and holds a curl better so
yeah but I like the curls that I get
with this versus the flattop but it
might just be because these are new you
know how you got it like break them in
so maybe that's why I cuz I just bought
them today like this morning literally
so I can curl this hair over so yeah
that's what I curled the hair with
and this is what it's looking like even
though it's falling already I did usual
I didn't use my Aussie hair spray to
like hold the curls but that crap still
in work either so yeah this is what it's
looking like I really love the color so
I used adorn Asian spice and I also use
the adore paprika and then I just mix
these two bottles together and this is
the color that it came out to be kind of
like a burnt orange type color which I'm
definitely feeling because if you follow
me on my social media you know that I've
been really into trying to get this
orange synthetic week and I was like
shoot I'm honestly just making my own
Orange wig so that's what I did I still
want that wig you guys um I haven't gave
up on trying to find it but for now I'm
definitely loving this look for sure so
yeah if you're interested in this wig
like I say I got this from wow evany and
I'll go ahead and leave all the links in
my description box and that's it for
this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below and I love
you guys I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
