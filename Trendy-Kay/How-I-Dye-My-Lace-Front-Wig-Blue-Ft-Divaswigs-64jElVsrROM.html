video
so the way I'll be working with is from
diva wigs and they sent me this week and
the name is stock great Indian version
lace front human hair Bob with dark
roots that's such a long name but for
short is LF 0:08 and i have it in the
color gray of course with dark roots
which I don't really get gray out of
this wig and it's more of like a ash
blonde purplish type of color you'll see
it when I take it out the pack but yeah
this is everything that it comes with
so yeah the hair type is Indian version
hair the hair density is 150 percent the
hair line is pre plucked
which the hair line is okay but I feel
like if you want it to be more natural
you can go back in and pluck it the lace
color is light brown the cap
construction is glueless lace front cap
and the cap size is a petite size which
I have a smaller size head and this wig
fits me so great so as you can see how
the color is it's like a brownish type
color this go around because this is not
my first time receiving a wig from
deeper wigs this color is just not it
you guys I didn't want to wear it in its
natural state like the color that I
thought it was gonna be but actually it
just was a mess to me so I decided to
put a color over it but the previous
week that I got from them it was like
blowing color with dark roots and that
one was beautiful but anyway this is
what I'll be using the diverse hair and
I'm using the adorn color and I have it
in sky-blue and I also have it in baby
blue only has one bottle of baby
blue and three bottles of sky-blue and I
didn't use all four bottles I only use
two of the sky-blue bottles and one of
the baby blue bottles but as you can see
I'm just mixing it and I don't have any
gloves I do recommend is it still
recording I think it's still recording
anyway I do recommend you wearing gloves
because this can get pretty messy but
all I'm doing is just applying the color
on with my color brush I guess you call
it okay moving on let's talk about this
color you guys because I thought that
this color was gonna come out much more
lighter
well not lighter but a more pen style
type of color um that was what I was
looking for so yeah it didn't come out
like I wanted it to but it still
actually came out pretty nice but yeah
this is definitely not the color that I
was going for but yeah I'm still you
know and the color on to the hand you
want to make sure you get all the
strands because you don't want any blond
or brown pieces left behind and I wish
that they added like a little bit of
duct work instead of the duct root that
they provided I don't know it's just too
much dark root for me with this short
hair I prefer a more less I mean I
prefer a less of a darker root you get
what I'm saying and the brown color I
don't know I'm just really not a fan of
this coloring that they did this go
around but like I said the previous week
that they sent to me was absolutely
gorgeous like I didn't have no issues
with the way to color look whatsoever
so I only left the color in for about 10
minutes you guys because I hate wait and
so I rinsed it out and I didn't shampoo
it out only edit conditioner to it I
didn't get any tingling whatsoever I did
get a couple of strands of hair like too
literally but no major shedding
whatsoever and still after I blow dried
the hair I still have not received any
tingling or shedding as well I didn't
show the process of me blow-drying the
hair but this is what the hair look like
throw dried and now I'm just gonna take
my wand curler and just curl this hair I
don't really have like a set with I'm
doing things I'm just adding curls to it
they can be a little big some are small
it just doesn't matter I'm just putting
some curls in it cuz I feel like I want
this week to be curly
okay moving along so I know you guys are
probably wondering like okay you changed
up the hairstyle you switched it up on
it but when I had cut this hair in the
front
I cut it while it was curly so it was
just itching me to see how bad I cut the
hair in the front so yeah in order to
save the wig I had to basically cut a
bang into it so it could be wearable
because I didn't hacked it when I was
when it was in its curly state basically
and I also wanted you guys to see the
cut because the only thing I cut was the
bang area but the rest as far as like
how the bulb is cutting everything like
that that came like that originally
which I really think they did a good job
when I cut the cut was absolutely
gorgeous and it just slayed my whole
life um so yeah I didn't have to like
even out the bulb or anything like that
which was really good and saved a lot of
time
okay guys so if you're interested in
this week again this is from Diva wigs
and I'll make sure I leave all the links
in my description box just in case any

know some of you guys like purchasing
