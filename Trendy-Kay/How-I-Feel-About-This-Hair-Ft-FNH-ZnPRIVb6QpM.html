hey guys it's K of course and I'm back
with another video and this video is
gonna be on this hair and this hair was
sent to me from a Friday night hair and
it is the GLS 115 and the color of this
is B a 60 and basically that's like a
navy blue type of color with some like
pale baby blue highlights going on so if
you're not familiar with Friday night
head like I always say they mostly so
synthetic Elise front units they do so
human hair as well this is a lace front
synthetic wig as far as the lace is
concerned they give you about one and a
half to two inches of lys party room
this week also comes with two cones and
a front of home in a bag and adjustable
strap I feel like this is a big hit for
Lee wigs so keep in mind if you do have
a smaller size here you can always go
here and adjust the straps that they
provide you with this wig so yeah me I
have a smaller size head so I just
adjust my straps the wig fits pretty
good with the strips adjusted so yeah
I'm we just want to get into this wig so
this is one of the Friday night hand
newer units that they came out with this
week did not come like this I did go
ahead and cut this way down that's
really the only thing I did besides cut
some baby hair into the wig so yeah this
is what the way to look like originally
and as you can see it's nice like it
looks nice long I really love how the
way it look long the reason behind why I
cut this week short is because they had
short pieces on the side and I couldn't
figure out why they had the short pieces
by a temple area on each side the wig
was like short right there like the hair
was really short and then the rest of
the hair was long so yeah that's just me
showing you where the hair
is short and it's kind of backwards to
me because I feel like they should have
made like if they was trying to layer
the hair or whatever the case may be
they should have laid the Hat on the top
and not the sides I don't know but that
just threw the whole style of this week
weight off yeah and I just wasn't
feeling the way it look so I just went
ahead and cut the wig and this is how it
ended up and I have to say like I'm not
really a fan of this week I feel like
they just need to remake this week and
figure out that cut in situation so I'm
really not gonna make this a long video
I'm just going to get straight to point
so when I first took this wig out the
package it did tangle up just a little
bit I have not received anything tangle
comment not tangling I have not received
any shedding from this wig still yet I
have not received any shut-in
but the tangle and of course because
this is synthetic and then the wig came
is so long it did tangle up on me when I
took it out the pack but yeah now that I
cut it it's not doing any tangle in or
any shudder so do keep in mind if you do
decide to keep the left of this wig
you might have a little tingling going
on I'm just not a fan of this week
overall I'm how I started I just I don't
know I feel like I feel like I don't
know maybe that's because I'm just not
feeling this week overall the style is
cute this is like if you haven't noticed
my Old Faithful
whenever I don't know which to do with a
wig I always know that this will turn
out right so I just like cut it up and
put put it to the side like I don't know
it just always works but you guys tell
me what you think do you like this week
do you like it longer like I don't know
but besides being sure it really
frustrated me I felt like
was like really disrespectful I don't
understand
it is a thick weed like I said I don't
know if I was in the middle of saying it
but this week does have shine so if you
have like some dry shampoo or baby
powder you can add that to the head to
door down and shine man this hair is
definitely on a shiny side what else
yeah I definitely love this Navy color I
felt like they could identify the
highlighted part but I mean it's fine it
also has dark roots so it does come with
Dockers of course the dark roots is only
way the lace is and then when you go to
the back whether what the head where the
wefted hair is um it's just one that one
color blue so this is what it looks like
and I don't know if I really cut it even
this side is like pretty cute but then
when you get to this side like I had to
make it a really deep side part just
because for some reason it wasn't
looking like I mean it wasn't looking
right I don't know if I'm if it's
because I'm already turned off by this
week it does like taking a picture in
this week it's bomb but besides that
like I'm a hack them I don't know I know
somebody out there would like it I
definitely love that blue color but yet
this week how it was like constructed
and cut I just didn't like that I wish I
could have kept it long because I
definitely love the curls on it long but
the stylist was just messing me up you
guys yeah so this is gonna be it for my
video if you guys have any questions
feel free to leave them down in my
comment section and I love you guys I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
