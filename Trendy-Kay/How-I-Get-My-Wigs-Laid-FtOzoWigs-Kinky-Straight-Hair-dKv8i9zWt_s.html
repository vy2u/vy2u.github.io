and basically as you can see by the
title this is going to be how I apply my
unit um to make it look to make my
basically to make my wigs look more
realistic so I've been getting this
question a lot about what do I do
as far as making my weight look more
realistic and I also get questions on um
how is my hair underneath my wigs like
as far as my braids hair and stuff like
that so before we get into me applying
this week I am going to be wearing this
unit right here by Oso wigs and I did
post a picture recently of me wearing
this unit on my Instagram page so yeah
it might be like the last picture that I
posted um and a few people were also
asking about this week so yeah I was
sent this wig and this is the this is
the human hair can't be straight lace
front wig again it's from Oso wigs I
will leave the links and everything in
my description box so basically this is
not a full um a full lace wig it's only
I'm a lace front but they do give you a
good amount of lay space and when you
see me putting it on Josi um they do
give you three combs in the front
um and a comb in the back with
adjustable straps I did cut off the comb
that was in the middle because they give
you like a comb right here a comb right
here and a comb in the middle I really
don't really deal with the comb in the
middle I just feel like it's pointless
in a way um so yeah what else this is a
1b which is off black is 24 inches it is
version human hair the cap size is a 1
and
cap construction is a cat3 glueless lace
cap and the lace color is medium brown
and the hand texture is not as silky it
says knowing Yankee but we know that's
not true because it's Yankee hair um and
yeah and it just tell you what you get
here so the box looks like this as far
as like shedding and tangling like I
don't get any shedding from this unit at
all no tangling like this weight is so
soft it feels like butter like it smells
so good like no complaints whatsoever so
if you guys are interested in this unit
I will leave all the links in the
description box so let's get started on
how I apply my units ok so right now
okay let me explain myself
hey okay you guys so right now I just
have to well you might as well say three
bridge on each side so a total of six
braids normally I really don't break my
hair down because I'm so lazy and I just
never feel like braiding my hair down so
it might be like in two french braids
but I wanted um my units elite really
flat because um I wanted to wear my uh
my hair behind my ears so yeah I don't
know I just I just felt like I wanted to
be my hair underneath to be really flat
so again I left my edges out and then I
just I swerved my baby heads and like I
pulled some extra help to um like on the
sides right here because the way I had
like the way that I styled this unit
like behind my ears I just wanted some
head of your pick I don't know it's
probably stupid but I like how it looks
and then makes any kind of sense so
that's why I had my edges like this and
then when it stuck behind my is it just
looks
or realistic so yeah I don't know you
guys
but okay so first what I do is sometimes
River is it sometimes I put away cap on
and then sometimes I don't so feel free
to put away cap on if you want to but um
I'm not really going to do that because
I feel like I want the lace to be like
on my scalp where you can see like my
scope I don't know I'm so hot it's so
hot explaining stuff you'll okay so yeah
so this is optional you can put on a you
can put on a wig cap and you don't have
to put on a wig cap it's not like
mandatory I would just make sure that
you have your hair braided down really
flat if you want your legs to look
natural please make sure you braid your
hair down really really flat because
when your hair is like puffy underneath
like the wig you can just tell that it's
a wig so yeah so I already did this
because again I did on where this unit
but normally what I would do at all
times it's flyways taking about a poor
area or it's just not lent as flat as I
would want it to so in this case what I
would do is I will go ahead in I don't
know if you guys can see this this is
like running hood okay so in this case
what I would do is I would take my flat
irons and put them put this the wig in
between my flat irons and I would just
let it sit and then I would slide it
just so it won't be as puffy and then I
will take the other side and I will
clamp it and then do the same it just
makes it lay more flat to your head so
yeah
um depending on your head size you might
want to adjust your shrimps or whatever
you have to do to make the wig fit
securely on to your head so yeah I have
my straps adjusted basically like this I
don't know just all going in the middle
part so yeah so now I'm going to put on
my unit and if I'm looking this way is
because I'm looking in my mirror so yeah
and I'm making sure that the part on the
wig is lined up with the part I'm in my
hair
so once I do that I'm going to put my
cones in here even though y'all know
that I'm really not a fan of cones but I
just need the combs in there with this
um hairstyle so once you put your wig on
it should look like this and as you can
see like my wig is extra flat a lot of
people think that I do like some extra
nuts to apply on these wigs but I really
don't like I just make sure my hair is
really flat and I make sure my wig um
it's like extra tight on my head so once
that's on like that it will look like
this and I'm not going to flat on it
because it's already flat aren't and I
will just stand up so I can show you
guys um show you guys what the unit
looks like okay so this is what the unit
looks like and this is how long the unit
is which is pretty a pretty long left
and it's like so natural looking you
guys like it's not too long and not too
short at the same time I mean what am I
talking about and it's like not too
thick but not too thin now if you wear
this unit in its natural state
it is much thicker and it does get a
little thinner when you flip on it but
it's not then at all like it's a very
very natural density to this unit so
yeah okay
back to I'm me styling this unit now so
I'm just going to put the hairs um
behind my ear
like this and
yeah and then I'm going to bring this
and put it behind my ear as well like
this
and that's what it looks like and then
hold on I'm going to take my flat on and
just like press this out cuz it's
starting to get curly again so yeah
so most of the time I like never add
powder or concealer into my units so if
you don't want to walk around with
nothing in your part and you feel like
it still looks fake to you then you can
take any type of powder or concealer if
that's what you use um I use the Studio
Fix what is this
I think it's Studio Fix the powder so
yeah this is an NC 45 you can see I love
this stuff because it's almost gone and
then I'll just take my little brush that
looks like this and I'll just sweep some
into my part y'all cannot see it all
like oh hold on I got a member enniaa so
then I'll just sweep some in my part
so this is the end result and yeah this
is just like so easy you just plop it on
your head and go and that's basically
how I have been wearing my head lately
so I hope this video was helpful to you
guys in any kind of way I'm sorry if it
wasn't um I'm kind of bad explaining
stuff but I mean it's pretty simple um
so yeah I really really really love this
unit you guys like when I say this wig
looks natural and it really doesn't
bother me that is up it's only a lace
front because look how much part in
space they give you so um if you're
interested in this unit I will make sure
I leave the link to this you come to
this unit in my description box um as
well as just like a link to their
website because they have a lot of good
stuff like I said this is one of my
favorite hair companies um so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
