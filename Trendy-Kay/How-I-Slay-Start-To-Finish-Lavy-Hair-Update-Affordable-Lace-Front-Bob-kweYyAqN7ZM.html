you and this is gonna be an update video
on the levee hair bob that I uh did a
review on probably like two weeks ago so
this is going to be my two week update
or this hair I will leave links to a
levee hair company and my description
box as well as the link to my previous
review one this week you guys this week
is the bomb so I wanted to really sit
down and show you guys how I styled this
unit so in the next clip is just going
to be basically me showing you guys how
I apply my unit what I do with my hair
underneath the unit in order to achieve
this look right here so if you're
interested stay tuned
okay so this is the end result when I
say I did not receive any tingling
nor did I receive any inch any inch of
shedding at all like when you turn
around so you guys can see the back and
hopefully he the back is on point
I'll come up a bit because I don't have
a member to look but yes this is what
the back looks like hopefully I didn't
like miss any caramels or anything like
that and again if you wanted to add your
concealer or powder into your pot you
definitely can do that but as you can
see I don't really need any to any
powder or anything into my part
I'm just absolutely in love like yo so
as far as the update is concerned I mean
the wig speaks for itself I really don't
have to do too much talking or anything
like that because this way is just the
bomb you guys like if you haven't
already purchased this weight and still
watching my first video one is you're
crazy because you're definitely sleeping
on levy hair company and you're
definitely sleeping with this wig when I
tell you that this way it's the bomb
like y'all y'all look just like the look
look at the wig like tell me this wig is
it the bomb like seriously I'm like so
in love with this week it's really
nothing to say this is a bit I mean I
really don't have anything else to say
