to be a wave review it's a little bit
different
I've been getting some requests to UM
I've been getting requests to show you
guys how I style my daily wig so I've
been waiting to do this with video
because I did order a new wig because I
didn't want to style my old days away
because I wanted you guys to see how I
get the wig fresh out of the package and
then style it from there so this is the
deja wag that I ordered again and it is
in a dr 613 so if you're not familiar
with the Daisy wig and you didn't see my
review go check it out but let's get
started okay so this is what the wig
looks like fresh out of the pic I've
been with this color but I never tried
the wig before before I got my previous
wig so I wanted to go for a you know a
natural color I'm just to see if I like
it or not but I ended up liking the wig
so I figured I want to try a different
crop to put this fit wait boy yo cuz I
don't know what this wig is gonna look
like in my 10 is serious okay
so I don't um
adjust my stripes because I don't want
that bulging
so this is what the wig looks like fresh
out to pay so I don't really know how
you guys wigs will look when it comes
out of the pic because my darker wig um
that I got it was more finger wave image
okay you're I'm the heck somebody don't
want me to film this video today and
I've been trying y'all I believe in try
to get this video up for y'all but now
my camera just went off talking about
some insufficient memory first um make
sure that your wig is on your hairline
because you don't want it to be back and
you can see you have on and you don't
want it to be forward where I mean it
looks crazy so just make sure that it's
on your hairline and also make sure that
the tips are lined up to your temples so
okay let's get started
oh my gosh y'all I didn't think I was
recording this I was about to be like
what though
oh oh oh oh I'll reply our angles are
out and our outer Oklahoma forever will
come on up pillar bar a little rock
muscle I don't want okay
Wow Wow
I don't know
I have it to where I think that it looks
nice on my friends my face nice
so yeah this I'm sorry but this wig
wasn't like as wavy as like in finger
waves like my other weekend wig is still
very gorgeous I do like this color so
let me show you the back
and I don't really mess with the bank
because it's already like straight so
ah I love these short weeks you're like
I love Alma
okay so I'm going to take my paddle
brush and just brush out the wig and
start over from scratch
and I'm just placing the finger waves
back in with my hand I just find that
it's more easier and you can definitely
tell the difference between the first
week that I showed you in the second
week and this week now so if you want
these deep waves I would suggest that
you get the darker wigs versus the
lighter colors because the lighter ones
definitely do not look like the darker
ones so yeah I'm just taking um the
pieces in the front and I'm framing my
face just so I can get the desired look
that I want and that's basically what I
do you guys um I would have originally
put this video up but I didn't finish it
because I had got the new wig and I
thought it would be much easier to show
you guys from scratch but it was a fail
so I hope you enjoy by up this video if
you want to see more of a variety and my
channel because I've been thinking about
introducing more things to my channel
but I didn't know how you guys would
feel about it because most of you you
know like watch my channel because of
the weight reviews but I would like to
start introducing more things to my
channel um so yeah just thumbs this
video up if you're interested in seeing
more different videos from me you have
any questions about this hair or just
any anything you want to ask me um feel
free to leave it in the comment box down
below and I promise you I'll get back to
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
