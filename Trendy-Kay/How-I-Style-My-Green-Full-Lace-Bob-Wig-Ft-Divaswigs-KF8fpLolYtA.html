can't right now cuz I went I'm fly by a
change right now like I need space are
you so this is what the hair looks like
I've already won his head out insert
clip so you guys can see the beauty in
his hair I went out with it everything
you can follow me on snapchat then
you've already seen his head if not I'll
go ahead and search the clips because
honey I've been really slaying his hair
but anyway I had put this wig up for a
minute and now it's back out but I did
have it straight and I felt like now I
want to curl it so I'm gonna film me
curling this week just so y'all can see
it because I know I never do anything on
camera but yeah I've already put the wig
1 and I'm using got to be glued man got
to be glue your head like a love-hate
relationship sometimes it won't work
other times they don't won't work I feel
like today it wants to work so yeah this
is how the hair line is I'm also going
to go here and circlips of what the wig
looked like originally because it was
blond
so this week was blowing and I dyed it
to this color if I have um the color I
know I used a door I think it was
something mint mint green it might have
been mint green I was saving the bottles
for the longest time but I don't know if
they got thrown out or whatever the case
may be
but I'll make sure I leave it in a
screen if I don't have a picture of the
bottle but I use two bottles of that I
didn't mix it with conditioner I just
put it in the hair cuz you know how some
people mix it with conditioner or like
or like the volume stuff whatever it's
called to light in the hair I didn't do
none of that I just literally put this
one and this is the color that it turned
out to be but like I said this was blind
before I dyed it to this color so I'll
insert with the weed looked like
originally and all that good stuff but
so real quick I'm just gonna give you
the specs on this week this is the
custom ombre color short straight for
last week and the item code is SC zero
one five the hair type is a hundred
percent Indian version hair the left is
twelve inches the hair color is a dark
brown and a root which is a two and
then the rest of the hair is color 18
which is beige ash blonde the hair
density is 130 percent the hairline is
pre plucked you guys the lace color is
light brown the cap construction is a
cap 3 which is a glueless lace cap and
the cap size is Prateek which if you
have a smaller size hit this would fit
you great because it's definitely petite
so you know it's fit my hair real good
bow so anyway let me stop ramming them
off at the mouth but this is what I'm
using to protect the hair which is Chi I
use this on my real hair and I use it on
my fake hair I just put like a dime size
and then I just go throughout the hair
and especially because it's dyed you
want to use a heat protectant just sold
the hair you know won't be damaged and I
really like this hair if it was probably
any other hair probably putting kids to
be honest with you but I really like
this hair so yeah I'm debating on if I'm
gonna give it away or not like if I'm
gonna sell it I don't know y'all I
really like this hair and I really like
the color too so we'll see
so anyway after you know I said to rate
the hip when I said Sheree but you know
after I finish um put in that one I'm
gonna brush it just so I make sure it
gets all them strengths ahead I feel me
I look like a cartoon character right
now so yes honey yes y'all see that okay
so I'm using my flat ones to curl this
hair on my straightness to curl this
hair and I have it run 400 degrees so
yeah I think these is like hot tools go
to hide something like that but I had
these for a long time and they work so
good so now I'm probably gonna speed
this up just
I'm just taking like sections oh I'm
just taking sections and I'm just gonna
be curling my hair
like one under I don't know I never can
like I can't explain it but um oh yeah
so I'm gonna put this part back like
this
this is looking like I had to change my
location you guys um from the pink
background because it was looking to
make a a shout outs on my 88 girls but I
just it just looked crazy so I had to
move into my old background so yeah and
it looks much about it and you can
definitely see the life in this way okay
guys so this is the end results and
overall I'm definitely impressed with
this wig y'all like when I say I don't
feel like this head was even ever like
bleached or anything
I feel like this hair was never even
processed that's how good like the head
is holding up it definitely straightened
some really well and it definitely holds
a curl really well as you can see and
I'm just like in love with it in the
sole natural that had is so soft um I
don't know why I'm out of breath I've
been out of breath in the last two
videos y'all but I feel like this hair
is holding up so beautifully like I love
when this hair out it just it's like a
showstopper like it so this is what the
part looks like and like I said you can
put it all the way through if you stay
and hump right here it's only because my
hair is not graded for a side part it's
braided for a middle part but it's
laying still really flat it just looks
really really natural so guys that's it
for this video if you have any questions
feel free to leave it in my comment
section down below and I'll see you in
my next video
I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
