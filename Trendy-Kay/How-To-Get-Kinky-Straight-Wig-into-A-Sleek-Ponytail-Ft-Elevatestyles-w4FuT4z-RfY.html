on this video because you copy so that
all of their hand and thumbnail was
mined and how can she get all their hair
and see a sleek ponytail
well actually this is a way yo so
basically this week has been a treatment
burger to God because it's just so big
and too much hair to me I don't know
what could you live in now if you come
across this problem which I know if you
every city where it weighs like me then
you are bound to come across the problem
where you Riley and it just does not
look like when you put it on and instead
of wasting your money and talk to the
bitch in the trash you want to fix it up
because you want to get all your money's
worth and I know how that feels
so if you stumble upon this creditors
don't know what to do with your weight
anyway it's a similar to mine or if you
like this week and what accomplish the
same look as me then I will go ahead and
leave all the links down below to this
week or you can use a we officially a
laying around in a house it really
doesn't matter so I was gonna swing from
of 8,000 and I'll go ahead and leave a
link in description box just in case
anything that wasn't interesting with
budgetary fools what other ways we have
available in a site so the way that I
learn is the great Factory and that's
the brand of the way this is my first
time this is my first time trying out
this bread so the style is LG wavy and I
had it in a color TP 230 which basically
adult rooted wig and it depends the
doubler
which is the number two and then the 30
which is like some honey growing slow
so overall this week is a really good
way it doesn't share a little bit more
than I would like you to but other than
that this week it's good so I'm no
tangle in it doesn't share a little more
than I wanted to the Wheatley spat the
wiggly way the cart is natural I didn't
go in and pluck the part and I also
added my finishing powder
the hair is since it is a Yankee crush
it is not shiny at all what else I did
go in and cut the baby hand head my hair
braided really pretty clip so we plan on
putting one of their waste into a
ponytail I highly suggest that you braid
your hair really bracelet because the
new breathing not split the weight just
won't lay right in every multiply just
come an audience cup you guys ditchin
it's going to look see so keep that in
mind so yeah I got that overall is a
really nice wig if you're into these
type of wigs and the style that this
wave is giving you then by all means you
don't have to manipulate this wig any
kind of ways to put it in a ponytail so
yes guys that's it for this video if you
