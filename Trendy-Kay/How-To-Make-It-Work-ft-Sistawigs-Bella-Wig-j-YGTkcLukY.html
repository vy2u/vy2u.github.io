weight kept one and this was sent to me
by sister weeks and this is the Vanessa
collection Bella and I have it in a
color too so I know a lot of you guys
always ask me can I show you guys what
the wave looks like straight out the
pack and how I get to my ending result
so here you are so this is what the way
it looks like it has two prongs and in
front by the partner area has a comb in
the back with adjustable straps the lace
is soft and it is like a light brown
type of lace and this is how the wind
comes straight out of the package with
those float curls and stuff so now we're
just gonna try out on the week so you
guys can get an idea of what it looks
like when it's fresh out of the pack so
this is what the wing looks like and it
looks crazy you guys this wig is really
think it is a Yankee texture week and
the part it looks really really good I
really like the part in space so now I
just brushed some of my baby is out off
camera and I only did it on one side
where the part will be in the part is on
the right side most of these weights
come with the part on the right side I
always tell you guys that this week is
behave friendly so I'm taking my
adjustable straps and just crossing them
over when I crossing them over but just
linking them together I'm sold that we
can fit my head nice and secure so now
I'm just putting this week on my head so
act outfit sleep on I'm just gonna go
ahead and start finger combing the week
out just to see how I like it and just
styling the week
- you know how I want to wear it so yeah
that's basically what I'm doing at this
point so yeah I did get some tingling a
little bit towards the end but it wasn't
bad and I also did get some shedding and
I was combing out this hair but this is
a light hey you guys and it's definitely
thicker than what it looks like on the
stock card so keep that in mind it is
that it's really full if you like that
thick and full type of hair then you'll
definitely love this week but this was
just way too much hair for me and as you
can see I was trying to just figure out
how I wanted it to be so basically right
now
all I'm doing is just playing with the
hair trying to get it to just look right
because right now I'm just really not
feeling this week so yeah I'm just
playing around with it and seeing what I
can come up with
so I did create some baby heads and this
weight off camera so yeah I used my got
to be blue gel to mold down the baby
head and now I decided just to go ahead
and cut the wig because I just felt like
it was just way too much hair with this
type of style and the curls yeah I can
see that I'm her own pump so yeah I'm
just sniffing this off just giving this
week a whole different look and this wig
definitely gave me a whole different
vibe for sure I really really like this
wage and then it's been cut don't get me
wrong this way definitely looks good
long but for me I just feel like it was
overpowering my face just way too much
in length with this style just was not
for me so I like I said it doesn't look
bit long but I just wanted something
that I would be more comfortable wedges
that fit me and me cutting this wig
definitely suit me better than a bad mom
so yeah just do whatever works for you
you guys but I definitely love this wig
short like this
it's a popin so yeah now I'm just
styling it and just cutting off some of
the pieces that I think needs to be cut
off and that's basically it you guys
another thing that I did off camera was
cut the bank area a little bit because I
felt like it was a little bit too long
but you'll see that in the last clip or
whatever but now I'm gonna go in and add
my finishing powder and I don't know if
I said this but I did plump the part
off-camera everybody should know how to
pluck that part but I did pluck the part
and I feel like the part to me look
better
before I edit my finishing powder into
the parts but it doesn't look too bad
but I definitely like the before
than the actor so this is the end
results and I definitely love how this
wig came out this week actually reminds
me of or I didn't review did I do a
review a more I think I might've did it
I don't know I can't remember but I had
a or weight and I cut it exactly like
this like this length this is more the
curls are more tighter than the or week
but it's like the same texture and I
think the or weight was a little bit
longer than this week but all the no
they resemble each other and especially
when I cut it it definitely resembles or
this one is just a tad more fuller and
thicker than what or was but yeah I
definitely love this look so much more
because that way just made me feel
uncomfortable we're all the hair so yeah
I really don't have too much to say um
oh yeah I definitely love the part the
part is really really nice and yeah I
really don't have much to say because I
already said it in the beginning but yes
so um yes this is the end results if
you're interested in this wig I'll go
get it and leave all the links in the
description box just in case any of you
guys want to check the swag out and I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
