put your games your game put your game
Gucci game spread hey guys it's K of
course and I'm back with another video
and this video is going to be on this
hair that I'm wearing and this week was
sent to me from savings beauty's so I
don't leave always saving sweetie links
to this week in my description box just
in case any of you guys are interested i
i'm not sure the brand i think it's like
born free new born free the new born
free yeah i think it's about a new born
free collection and it's the magic lace
u-shaped lacewing and i have it in the
style ml u h100 and i have it in the
color too so this is what this week is
looking like and when I tell y'all this
week is lit and this week is long I just
recently did a video on a longer week by
the same company and I'm pretty sure you
guys want to know like what's the
difference between that way and this way
so basically the difference between this
wig and the other weight is basically
this one same sticker this is also more
longer than the other one and the other
one the ends were bit and these ends
came straight because if you watch my
previous video for the hair you'll know
that I did go ahead and straighten the
ends and with this one I didn't have to
literally you guys when I tell you that
this wig is bum straight out the pack
you don't really have to do anything to
it but cut off the least and I did go
ahead and cut some baby hands and a hand
line and you know cuz I got a and my
baby hair I just felt like it looks more
natural but that's everything I did now
you don't have to do this one I mean you
don't have to do this but I did I went
and took my warm color and just smooth
down where the part is just so it can
lay a little bit flat now the only thing
I'm going to say about this week is it's
not going to last you a long time so if
you're looking for week this long that's
going to last you a long time I'm not
sure about that because Ben's dough is
synthetic and it's so long it's really
not gonna let you know if it start to
get frizzy at the ends of course you can
add heat to this and in a snap right
back but I wouldn't suggest when this
week every day this is not a everyday
week you guys keep that in mind warned
anyone I should put a big warning sign
right here like warning no you cannot
way this week every day and expect it to
last it's just not gonna happen because
this week is like extra long first of
all and it's synthetic hair and it's so
super long so yeah don't think that when
you get this week this is like a week
for like the pull out on a special
occasion or when you're just trying to
be real lady like this is one of those
wigs where you just wanna stop in their
tracks like yeah it's like one of those
weeks but it's fun like making this at
every day week I don't think so unless
you plan on buying multiple weeks like
this and switching it up when it goes
okay I want to tangle in and Shedden
number one I have not received any
shedding from this week whatsoever no
shedding at all zip not and I did brush
this and I did brush this with my brush
I can't find it right now
and I still have not got
Shannon from this week so Shannon is a
no-no when it comes to this week we good
and then as far as tangling I did get
like a couple snags but like major
tangling no I have not got major tangle
in from this week yeah and the snags
were basically when I was brushing it
towards the end a little bit but it
wasn't like full-on tangles it was just
like a little snake but keep in mind as
this get older I'm pretty sure it's
gonna start to tangle up you can always
cut it up because it's so long you can
always you know chop some off when it
starts to get raggedy or like I said put
your heat to it but yeah overall I
really in love this week
I definitely love this wig more than the
other one that I showed you and sorry
I'm not saying a name because I really
don't know what the name is called but I
definitely love this wig better than the
other one that they have out there looks
like this year oh yeah and the thickness
is really freaking thick you guys it's
definitely a good density is not then
whatsoever and also it's not shiny it
looks very very natural making sure you
have underneath the wig it's flat
because that's what's gonna really make
your wig look natural and not Whiggish
is when your hair underneath is flat so
yeah if you're interested in this week I
will leave all the links in the
description box again this week is from
Sam's Beauty so yeah I hope you guys
enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
