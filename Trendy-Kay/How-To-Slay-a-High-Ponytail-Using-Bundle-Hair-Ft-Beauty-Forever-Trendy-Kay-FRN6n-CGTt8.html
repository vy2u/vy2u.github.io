back with another video and this video
is brought to you by beauty forever and
of course they're not new to my channel
so they sent me over three bundles ahead
right here this is only one bundle
because the other two I'll be using and
I washed those bundles but if you have
not heard of Beauty forever go check
them out I'll leave all the links in my
description box so yeah anyway this is
what the fresh bundle looks like
straight out the pack and I love it I
got a little bit of shedding but not
much
moving right along this is me and I just
have my hair and a little nasty ponytail
you can start off with clean hair or
dirty hair my hair is not clean at all
because it's just not I hate washing my
hair but yeah so I'm using my eco styler
gel the green one I forget what is it
olive oil
yes olive oil and I'm just taking that
and saturating my head with this stuff
now you guys if your hair is thicker
than mine I am natural but my hair is
not hard to manage so if you have more
thicker hair you might want to use
something that's going lay it down flat
for me eco styler gel works and only the
green one works so yeah now I'm just
putting it into a ponytail and yes y'all
don't come for me my head is very small
I keep telling y'all this is the reason
I do not wear high ponytails because my
head is so freakin miniature I feel like
when God was creating me he just forgot
to make the back of my head that's how
freaking small it is so now I'm just
praying this because I am gonna be
hooking the bundle hair to my braids to
make the ponytail appear more longer so
I'm not gonna be starting from the base
I'm gonna be starting from the end of
that braid but for right now I'm going
to move on to my baby hairs and get them
edges slicked the right so that's the
reason I left some hair
because I had to fix my baby hairs and I
like to do that after my ponytail is
complete well sometimes I do and
sometimes I don't it just depends on how
I feel but for this video I did them
last now I'm just spraying my holding
spray my got to be glue free spray and
this is just gonna make sure nothing
moves or it's like out of place because
I want everything a nice and slick and
tight so here is the bundles that I wash
and I'm gonna be using two bundles for
this style I'm depending on how long you
want your ponytail is how many bundles
you'll use for this hairstyle me I'm
only using two I did they didn't send me
over three but I decided not to make the
ponytail too long because I didn't want
to add any fake hair to my hair as far
as like the braids so now I'm just
wrapping this all around the ponytail
and this is basically what you're going
to do and you're going to pin it with
bobby pins to secure it so when you
start off to hook it on I don't know if
I showed you that but when I first
started off I hooked the bobby pin on
there and then I started wrapping so
that's basically what I'm gonna do and
I'm gonna keep on wrapping until I get
all the way to the end of this bundle
and then I'm gonna secure it with
another bobby pin and then when I get to
the next bundle I'll start and I'll
stick a bobby pin on that and then
continue to wrap it around so yeah
that's basically what I'm doing
Oh
now I'm gonna take my gold hair cuff you
can find this on Amazon I'll go ahead
and leave a link below just in case any
of you guys want to purchase it it did
come with a rubberband hook on it but I
decided to take it off because I didn't
feel like wrapping the rubberband around
all of this hair so I'm just using the
cuff part and I'm just trying to like
position it because it is a lot of hair
so you'll see me struggling trying to
figure out how to keep it up because the
ponytail was making the gold cuffs
leans so then I decided to stick some
bobby pins and I decided to stick some
bobby pins and the braid part you're
gonna see me doing it once I flip the
ponytail back over and that was just to
secure it so that wouldn't be aleena and
looking on crazy and once you stick two
bobby pins in the ponytail itself is so
big that it doesn't really matter like
it you can't see the bobby pins at all
so this works out really nice and I
really love this hairstyle and feel free
to let me know if you want to see more
videos like this because honey I'll keep
them coming but yeah this is the end
result so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I'll see you in my next video
like go get my
do me in the worst way
don't let me asleep
obviously sorry maybe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
