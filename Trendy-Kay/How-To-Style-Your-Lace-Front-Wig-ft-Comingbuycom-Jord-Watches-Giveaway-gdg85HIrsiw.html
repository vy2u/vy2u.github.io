many people walking around with wood
watches so yeah yes okay so in this
video I'm just going to be showing you
how I achieve this look just in case you
want to pull your lace front up into a
ponytail on just some style inspiration
for our lace front or our wig with
whatever you have on girl so yeah don't
mind the earring in my nose I'm trying
this new earring out I wanted something
like big and chunky and my nose so yeah
I put it in if you don't like it I'm so
sorry but I don't really know if I like
it either
but we just going back with it before I
show you guys how I achieve this bun
ponytail updo type of look um this week
or this lace front is from coming by
calm so I'll make sure I leave all the
links to this wig and my description box
and everything like that so basically
they sent me the the lace front body
waves way and 250 on consent density so
I will have to I will say that this wig
is really nice and full I really do not
have any complaints about this wig like
I'm like in love with this wig so yeah
I'm if I'm looking over here because I'm
trying to read off what it is and
basically it just tells you that the
that the tag can be bleached and died
and I believe it because when I was
bleaching a lot the nuts to the tear
like the roots died instantly so yeah
that's something that I was struggling
with but I'll get into that later so
yeah you can bleach this ham on the left
is 24 inches width which is it true like
24 inches and the
density is 250 like I said before the
hairline is pre plus yesterday I did
come pre pluck I don't believe I have
any pictures of what it looked like
before but if I do I was definitely
incertum but when I tell you that the
Hema it was it was plucked pretty good
but it was like a little empty like you
still would have to go behind and you
know clean it up a little bit and pluck
some more heads because it wasn't they
didn't suck a lot but you could told it
it was plucked and the hair color is the
medium brown I meant the lace color is a
medium brown so yeah also they did give
me a coupon code for you guys just in
case you are into my saying this week or
any other items from their website I'm
going to leave the coupon code right
here and it is TK 10 and that will save
you $10 off your purchase so yeah like I
said everything will be listed in my
description box if you're curious on how
I got my arm lace to lay down I use got
to be blue Jones so yeah that's
basically what I use so yeah we're just
going to go right into the video
I also bleached my nuts and I also
plucked some of the hair on what you see
in the video I like all the bleach tip
over plus my hairline it was just a
crazy mess but I think that the end
results turned out really nice but yeah
this is what I use to correct the over
bleach process like I didn't go back and
Dada head over I was too lazy and by a
point I was just like over it because I
said a lot of time you know trying to
kiss makeup anyways so yeah I just got
so yeah I just purchased this little
mascara stick and basically is to cover
up grades and I just used it to cover up
the blind spot sellers in the front so
yeah this is what it's called quick
cover and it's a root touch-up and I
think this is vark is colors just in
case you're interested
I think only feet like four dollars for
a local beauty supply store so yeah
honey yeah but y'all like I feel like
this is really cute
and the back is just bobby pin down
I didn't glue down I tried to glue it
down so yeah it's like white stuff all
over my neck from me trying to glue it
down and it didn't really work out so
basically how the back is laying down is
because I might be pinned it down and I
feel like it really it's okay um I feel
like nobody would be really staring at
me like that in a bit but you know if
they are then you don't have a life like
what are you doing so yeah if you feel
self-conscious or you like trying to
hide the bobby pins or something like
that which I think I did a good job at
disguising it but like you can take um
like you can take little pieces and you
can go in was like a razor like this and
just kind of like go in and cut them off
to make it look like little baby hairs
in the back I mean that's only if you
feel like you wanted to look more
natural but yeah I think I did a pretty
good job and I definitely think that it
looks really natural well this is what
the wig looks like after I plus my front
and I bleached the nuts and I was just
showing you the great cover-up sticks
that I used to cover up the blind spots
that was in the roots so now I'm just
showing you what the hair looks like
after I washed it and how thick and nice
it is and of course after you wash it
the curl pattern will be more defined
but I was combing out the curls so
that's why it looks like that
and yeah this is just what the hair
looks like and this is what the back
looks like and I really love this hair I
did get a few strands of hair like
shedding if I plus the part I mean if I
pluck the head line but that's normal so
yeah and a little bit of snakes but
there's nothing to make me not like this
week so this is where I messed up it was
trying to create my baby heads before I
put the ponytail in now if you're going
to use that cup great cover-up I would
suggest you put that in Esther you style
or se you lead your edges and everything
and then use it because I got black
stuff everywhere as you can see it's
like black stuff everywhere so I just
decided to go ahead and put my ponytail
up and then we're calling my edges but
yeah that's what I'm doing because I
don't know y'all I just was going
through it trying to get the ponytail in
this video up to you guys I was coming
um what am I talking about I was having
a lot of complications sorry for the
background noise but yeah so now Esther
I'm putting my ponytail in my hand
started lifting up so I had to go back
and glue that there will Jo that there
was the guys to be glue but for now I'm
just going to finish putting my ponytail
in and ask the I'll go back and glue my
sides down
but yes y'all I was just running into so
many complications so now I believe the
Seidel and I'm just fixing my fun and I
just twirled it intended oh and you know
fixed it to how I wanted it to look it's
not that way that you do this you just
fix you up on how you want to look so
now I'm messing with the edges and
laying my baby hairs Dale and I'm not
overdoing it or anything like that just
because that black stuff but yeah I just
you know fixed and now I'm covering up
they're both side and I fixed it so yes
sorry if I'm rushing but I'm just trying
to go with the video
and it's like really fast well yeah
that's how it looks afterwards and could
I stay tuned for the rest of the video
so you guys can see how I styled this
week in different hairstyles
