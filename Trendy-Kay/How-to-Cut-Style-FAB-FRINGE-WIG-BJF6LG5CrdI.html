this tutorial on how I style and cut my
fat fringe wig so as promised
I am I'm going to show you guys how I
achieve this look so if you're
interested in seeing this look and how I
got this look um then just keep watching
the video so this is it and this is not
the same wig you guys you definitely
will see that in the video I perch it I
purchased a whole new unit so you guys
can see it fresh out of the package and
what it looks like originally so yes
just um if any of you guys was curious
you'll definitely see that in the clip
that I'm about to show you guys okay you
guys so this is what the wig looks like
inside the packaging and now I'm just
taking the wig out of its original
packaging and showing you guys what it
looks like so right here it has a comb
in the back with the adjustable straps
and also it does not have any combs in
the front area so if you don't like
combs you don't have to worry about
combs banding your wake and right now
I'm just putting on a wig to show you
guys what the wig looks like straight
out of the packaging and this is a cute
style I just don't like how the style
fits my face it's really not for me so
this is when I start to cut on the wig
so you'll need your scissors any type of
scissors not how scissors or paper
scissors you'll need a comb this is
optional and you also need a flat iron
and now I'm starting and I'm just
picking up the hair where I want it to
be shorter so that's basically just the
front area and I'm taking my scissors
and
and cutting in a downward most motion
you don't want to cut straight across
because you just don't want that blunt
look so you do a downwards motion motion
so it won't give you that blunt look and
it'll give you more of like a layered
look so that's basically what I'm doing
to all the longer pieces in the front of
the wig did I say in the front in the
front of the wig if I didn't say that
sorry so ho yes so I'm just cutting away
until I get my desired look and yeah
we're almost there um so yeah you guys
you just cut however much you want to
cut um so after that this is how the wig
looks and I think I'm happy with how it
turns out and the length of this unit so
this is just basically what it looks
like so now I'm taking my flat irons
this optional you can have like one inch
flat irons or you can have like a barrel
curler um I just like curling my head
with flat irons better and this is I
think it's like a half a half of an inch
of flat iron and the sides I'm not
really sure I think it is though so now
I'm just picking pieces up it doesn't
really matter just random pieces I'm not
going to any type of order and I'm just
curling all the hair under so yeah
that's basically what I'm going to be
doing throughout my whole head and I'm
just speeding it up because it's really
not necessary to have such a long video
so I think you guys can get the hang of
what I'm doing I'm just curling all the
hair under and I'm just taking pieces
that I think are long enough or there
needs to be curl
and you can curl your wig however you
want guys so now after I finished
curling I'm basically going to style my
wig and frame my face so I'm just
playing around with it with my hands you
can use a comb if you like to but I like
to use my hands so I'm just framing my
face in you always can go back in with
your flat ons and curl the pieces that
you think needs to be curved okay guys
so I hope you enjoy this quick little
tutorial on how I cut and style my fed
fringe wig so yes if you haven't saw my
review on this unit go check it out but
this is basically how the way it looks
after it so this is what the way it
looks like
okay you guys so I hoped you enjoyed

below and I will see you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
