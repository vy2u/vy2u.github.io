21 like I say all this stuff is a small
so I'm healthy like to tell you that
it's mom so you'll be getting this as
well and it just like a frenzy at best
but it's like twice but it's just in my
clothes that I end up with so this is
basically a leather jacket
I forget where this is from but it has
like silver that's all about gold studs
my shoulder and show this for a panic
and this is really nice this very nice
but I just I'm gonna usually so you get
that as well
you'll also be getting the stress right
here and this is from Miss Kylie and
it's a mini dress and it is like I miss
that mesh detailing right here and then
it has like oh they're clapping inside
don't you guys can see that that well
but that's what looks like and then
you'll be getting these and these are
Pharma these are from obsession oppa and
I could not fit these to say my like
they can even go up my freakin butt at
all might be stuffing my gosh so it's
just hey that cutout detail in and then
here's a zipper in the back I really
really love these but you know they
could fit and then I have this jumpsuit
which is from misguided I love this so
much but it's too small for me but yeah
it's just like a pin jumpsuit and about
it's like skinny flake and then the top
dips down and it's really really low-cut
I really love this a majority office oh
man I'm not gonna fit
then you again this is from a patient
over and it's like a course that type of
dress but it stops like under your boob
this is also too small to me so yeah
that's what it looks like I'm gonna also
begin to this jumpsuit and so I don't
need to talk like a hole to like thing
and the bottoms are skinny but the back
the whole bangs are open it like goes
around your neck like this so I can
watch your facial but I'm trying to do
all this
the next item is these which are a size
small and um I really like this I had
like a whole outfit but that's more like
I never mind um so yeah this is what
these look like it's just some sequins
hi sequin high waisted pants and of
course I'm skinny at the bottom okay
then I have this equation I just
recently go to this because I was gonna
make this on my birthday you guys but
it's too freakin small so this just
looks like this okay now think about
this is my
trying to point the zipper kind of like
snip off so if you can like hook this up
okay oh you can take it to like your
cleanup like fix it because that's only
thing is wrong this but I was not gonna
sway it oh I was like somebody doesn't
use out of it can of course are skinny
but yeah I really really love it and
then the last thing but this month is
this jacket and it's just like a fern
type of thing what I like this is just
way too square for me in my section I
don't know who's just like Swedish oh
yeah so that is the chore you get and
this is what we call all things small so
you can insert some in this if you are a
size small okay so I'm moving on to the
next set of stuff and this one is gonna
be called all things girly so if you
were a size medium reckon stuff is a
size medium so you have a size medium
take your chances with this so I said
this is called other things
barely so the first thing you'll win is
this jumpsuits and this is from a
patient over like I say all the stuff is
a size medium so this is the jumpsuit in
like way the legs are it's like a split
elates and then it ties around the waist
this is what you just it just didn't
like me
um the next thing is this outfit now
only thing about this is the shirt is
the size a large um I did wear this not
really my video it was a video I had
pink hands like that pick him in a week
I want this shirt but like I say only
one in a video and it comes with the
bottoms no the top in the large and the
bottoms are a medium and I never go at
the bottoms so yeah it looks like but
doesn't say I got this from 521 the next
thing you'll get is this lace looking
dress and it just dip down it just dips
down in the front like this they're in a
bank account like is low and it just
crosses so yeah that's what that looks
like it's one acute and then the last
thing for this one is this velvet type
of trysil anything and it also ditch
them in the fries always making a bank
and then dips down and it's kind of like
it's like tie it kind of like crisscross
I can't mix me but this is what it looks
like anyways like a little open in on
the side so yeah that is everything that
mine so if your side theme you can enter
to win this stuff it wasn't next set of
things and I'm gonna call this one all
things trendy yeah so if you're talking
medium then you can intern time to win
this stuff so first you have this
jumpsuit and this video really nice
everything but the thing about this is I
had the paints version of this so I was
like it's kind of actually just make the
jumpsuit as well cuz i got hits already
and I want to paint more anyway and I
didn't feel like returning it to ya this
is like a jeff suit is kind of a v-neck
right here and sending up the legs
it just has it well open in these orange
she's getting at the bottom so like I
say all these are the size medium next I
have this denim dress and it is a lot
and it has a deep v in the front I can't
remember where I got this one
well yeah it is a miniskirt so yeah and
then I have this camera legs from y'all
but it's a very sexy dress the shoulders
right here are kind of like Petitte and
the V is like really deep just keep that
in mind this one below um I do I'm
person that really loves playing DP
stuff and then the last thing is these
pants and these are proficient over
these are a size seven but I think if
you wait a size medium thing make you
feel size seven so I'm not sure if I
give these something like the way they
fit me but these are how nice is their
distress and there's new jeans and it's
late so the next items are called all
things sexy so all of the stuff in the
size medium as well so the first thing I
mean with this so I did way this got me
once and I couldn't like I'm not going
to wait I had this was so long you guys
like this is my all-time favorite is
finger is dressed like it just looks so
sick and I was like I can't get like I'm
not that person but it's like really
stand out so to show this are paid as
well and then look at that detailing
like it's secure and then you'll get
this dress is like the bloomin that I
showed you in a hands like the pants
please like a pen shoulders and like I
say the V is a very very deep this is
really nice but these dresses this is
like really short with me and I don't
know five five you guys just kick
anybody when it's a reference anything
I'm five five and I will you like 130
235 pounds so yeah um and then the last
thing is gonna be this jumpsuit and I
got this from efficient okay I can fix
it so it's just like a deep V like that
and then it's just like the back well
the next thing is just go this this is
just called playing well 13 hands anyway
this black marker and this is the
business eyes large the only large that
I have but this is what it looks like I
forget where I come from as well but
it's long sleeve and then it tied right
here this is also a deep V and then it
shoots so I was like sure Robert but
this is so keep you guys I'm so glad new
movie TV it's the lace and I was just
hoping that with it but I couldn't so
yeah that's what this looks like so yeah
you can insert two lenses
so the next thing you can win is this
jacket and this jacket is in a size
medium like I'm going to say it's a size
small because this is like it was like
Asian website and if you're short I feel
like you would be a really good
candidate for this jacket because for me
like it fits me but is more for like a
short person because like a short and
like the body length like I thought so
it's just too long for the jacket so
this is called the leopard the leather
detail jacket I made the leopard detail
coat and like I said I'm going to be
synthesizing you but I'm super satisfied
small focus is what it looks like
and it just cinches the waist like in
sinchon it's really cute and it has
everything I really love it it also has
like the zippedy tables on the sleeve
and I know these packets know these
packet of Joe Joe I think these packets
are you know usable okay now we're gonna
move on to shoes this is gonna come with
stupid shoes and this is called all the
things there okay so on both these shoes
are from a fashion know well so the
first pair is gonna be these tie appeals
these different eye pills which are so
freakin cute you guys but they just tell
you okay then I think about this this is
a size 9 but it fits more like a size 8
for me I weigh on the size 8 but I gave
him our he'll six angles and a size
bigger and also they come from like
cheap shoes and only go up a size but
that's why I got sides that's why I got
sides 9 but they fit like a size 8 if
you don't and so if you had like a seven
and a half eight ish then use them so
that's okay and then the next pair are
these I don't know these guys when you
guys but they are denim knee high heels
and if they don't like this no this is
the size 10 but this shoe and the shoe
measures the same like they're the same
size so I got 19 and I was like okay
they're way too small so then I got size
10 I think was still too freakin small
like they but I just don't like my Hill
like I don't like my heel hanging off it
off so get it like I said it goes I sent
ahead to 8 even I don't know how you
gonna judge it
I really don't open this is what it
looks like and it looks so bad they feel
my leg really really good
but my heel was just hanging off and I
don't mean like that so the next thing
is these black fur platforms like so
definitely go black like homes nice and
little like this I really like you but I
wasn't over there sometime so these are
in a sock line but I feel like if you
mean like a seven and a half eight then
if you can fit this so the next thing
you can sit to win is this point
these are gonna be called the black
blues uphills I got these from JustFab
throw these outside at night and they
are actually true suicide 9 so this is
what it looks like never been one before
I just number one song do any way way
this is like the the way and they
already keeps you and they laced up
right here so yeah if you are the
sideline you get is it to win this year
so the next thing is going to be equal
to this and this is called brown buckle
platform heels so I got these for a
while and just never freaking wins you
guys cover so this is what it looks like
this Hill is so freakin tall like this
is hell this is
in height not these when I'm super freak
at all okay this is the size nine which
they fit true to size

keep shoots I think you look cute one
that's what they look like when you give
you in these I'm not gonna send up and
back plus this boxes come here so I can
