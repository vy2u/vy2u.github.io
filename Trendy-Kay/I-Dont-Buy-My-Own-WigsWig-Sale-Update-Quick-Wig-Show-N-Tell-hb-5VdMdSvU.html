ah
I need you now wanna be my
hey guys are back with a another week
review so if you follow me on snapchat
then you've already seen this hat and
this is why I'm currently doing this
review right now but you guys because I
was not low-key going to do this review
at all but I got a ton of requests this
week it's from first of all I purchased
this a long time ago I purchased this
from ebony lines and this is the body
boss or a wig now yes I purchased this
wig all by myself you guys because so
privately a lot of you guys don't think
that I buy my own wigs which is really
weird to me because why wouldn't I buy
my own wigs of course I do
get sent wigs all the time to review but
I buy more weeks than I get sent wigs if
that makes any sense
the reason that I don't review the week
that I purchase myself is because I'm so
busy doing other reviews to these
companies that I don't even have time to
review the week that I bought myself I
do spend my coins on my hair and that's
silly for you to think that I don't
purchase my own wig still because that
only limits me to the ways that the
companies will want me to review I just
want you all to know that I literally
had this week posted on my wig sale a
couple weeks ago and nobody wanted to
purchase it at all and mind you I'm just
like nobody purchased this week like
what is wrong with y'all I got John me
like more of a visual um then it just
happened because I only had the picture
on a website it only had this picture on
there so you always probably thinking
like oh I'm not too sure about that
because you don't know how it looks
going but in a description I kept one
like I was coming to a top so bad I was
like y'all this week is bomb but
originally I didn't want to sell it but
I felt like I needed to because I was
just trying to get my wigs in order and
it was just it was too too many wigs and
I needed to get rid of some of the
but then when nobody wanted to purchase
this one I hurried up and took it off
the sightings like forget it I'm going
to keep it myself so yeah that's how I
ended up vehicles this week and then I
wanted to do it today but I was like huh
this week would look so much better
shorter so I just decided to cut it in
this year it definitely looks much
better shorter so I really like that and
I got a lot of questions like I know a
lot of people were thinking this was the
perm Yankee eighteen unit which is not
but it does Bend so our cut it does
actually look like that but the perm
eighteen unit that's is because
sometimes it comes like in these
beautiful curls and then sometimes it
comes and it just looks like a bush so
you never know what you're going to get
so I would suggest that you purchase
this with you guys because it's
definitely worth it I would suggest you
purchase it from ebony lines because
right about now I don't really vein what
have any lines like that no more y'all
y'all telling me but I didn't want to
listen but yeah I don't purchase from
them anymore if anybody was curious yeah
but I think this is the only place that
has it is everything lies I mean you can
feel free to take your chances if you
want to because I know a lot of people
still purchase their wigs from there but
for me yeah I just decided not to
purchase my weights from there anymore I
don't know exactly when but I am going
to be posting more wigs to my website
because I've gotten a flood of emails
about that and I haven't been able to
email everybody back yet but just in
case you guys wanted to know within like
a week or two I'm going to be doing
another wig sale so yes they posted for
that oh stay tuned for that so yeah
there will be another wig so I don't
know the exact thing y'all know me I'm
long-winded with everything so I'm going
to put this back up so now y'all know
what it look like the wig looks exactly
like how it does on the model the curls
or form just like this when you get it I
mean it's even when both
I thought you wanted a even if you want
a middle part you could do that because
it just looks so good you guys now I did
go and and plus the part just a little
bit at least I think it doesn't look
really that wide I can't even remember
because like I said I had since week for
so long now that I can't even remember
but I know I came with like a soft lace
a little bit and I also know that it has
two combs in the frontal comb in the
back with adjustable straps now if you
have a bigger size head you definitely
can get away with this week because it
is a bit big on my head but I do have my
stress adjusted and it fits okay but if
you have a smaller size here I
definitely suggest using like some bobby
pins to secure it down a little bit more
um because like I said it's not too too
secure but it's secure enough so I
haven't received any shedding from this
wig this wig does really good when it
comes to shedding I don't really receive
any strands of hair or anything like
that so we're good with shutting now
tangle in this way this tangle towards
the bottom part and that was something
that I didn't like about this week so
yeah the hair was mainly like tangling
towards the empire's I was just like oh
this wig might look nice short um so I
just ended up cutting all of it off and
I actually like the way this turns out
and so a yeah you guys I really don't
have any complaints about this wig I
really really love it also this week is
a Yankee texture um it looks exactly
like somebody's hair the curls are
religious like so voluminous and bouncy
the curls look really really good and
this week is Yankee so if you like
Yankee units you'll definitely like this
one because it looks really really
natural like I said I did it something
in the part I can't remember if I plug
this part or not I think I did for you
this week is full
so that's it's a this video you down I
will leave all the links in my
description box just in case you want to
check out this wait if I find this week
on another site I'll make sure I'll
leave it in the description box um cuz I
know a lot of you guys don't really like
the purchase your weave off or emanating
lives so yeah I'll try to find your
another site makers this week and yeah
um or if you know where I can find this
particular unit um let me know in the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
