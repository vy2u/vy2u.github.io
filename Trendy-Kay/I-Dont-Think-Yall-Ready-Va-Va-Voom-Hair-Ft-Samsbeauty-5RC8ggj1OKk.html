everything so I appreciate everything I
do
I'd love to
hey guys it's Kate of course an event
with a another video so this video is
going to be one this hair and this hair
was sent to me in from the same sweetie
so if you're interested in the weekend
where I will hit and leave all the links
in the description box so y'all let's
just get one - this hair because I have
a lot to talk about open so the way they
sent me is by a new boyfriend is the
magic lace curve card lace front wig I
have it in a style
MLC 180 and I have it in the color dy x
rose gold so this is what the picture
looks like which is not a good picture
at all
um and unhide the wig looks Wiggy on me
this week looks huge in just this is
this is a lot of hey you guys so I
wouldn't recommend this week for like
everyday wear this is more like a photo
shoot like if you're having a photo
shoot or some special type of event
because this is like big in glamorous
you guys so first off this comes with
two cones and a front a common event and
adjustable straps I do believe that this
hit I meant that's it I do feel like
this week is big hit friendly so if you
do have a bigger sized head your head
will fit this great if you have a
smaller size head I would just suggest
you I would just suggest can't even get
it out I would just suggest adjusting
the straps and also adding some bobby
pins just to secure it because it is
pretty big also this king with hard lace
so be careful with the hot lace because
it tends to scratch you up in here but
it leads them very nice so it's not
Swiss lace is the harder lace also this
is a inside part wig but you guys from
this
we've been so thick and the texture is
yaki on his hair and it's a thick thick
yaki
and it's mostly really thick up towards
the face like where the curls are
towards the face the back is like a
normal yaki texture but the front is
just like overly thick and I don't
understand why it's like two different
type of Yankee textures I'm just not a
fan of that I wish that the front was
like the back but it's not so that's why
it looks so four and big which this is a
lot of hair I definitely like the curls
on it but it's just it's a lot yeah it's
really a lot going on the color the
color is amazing I definitely love the
color of this wig and it has the Doug
rich the dark roots aren't all the way
through I made this week as a middle
part I feel like the only way I will be
able to wear this me this week is in the
middle because on the side it's just way
too much hair and my face and it's just
it looks really really Wiggy so I do
overall like how this way it looks now
but I wouldn't wear this as an everyday
wig now if you are a fan of big hair and
that's what you wear then by all means
this is a gorgeous wig but it is a lot
of hair and summer time is approaching
and this wig is hot so keep that in mind
as well so yeah this is what it looks
like it's also really long it's about 20
inches long but yeah sure if y'all can
see y'all can clearly see that this is a
lot of hair but like I said it's a
beautiful color now what I did to this
like I said I moved it from the side to
the middle because it just trust me
doesn't really look right on the side
whoa to me because I have like it was
just overpowering my face it was too
much hair so I switched into the middle
I also plucked apart because like as you
can see on a stock heart the model looks
like she doesn't even have a part so
when you get it the part is
be pretty tight so you have to go in and
pluck it and I went in and plucked it
and I add some finishing powder to the
part I also cut some baby hairs in the
hairline and just you know fix them up
so it can look good
now I will say that when you get this
wig it does like the curls kind of come
formed if you wish to try to like brush
it and like form the curls to kind of
like it same this week that's when it
looks really really wigging
so I feel like it looks better like when
the curls are just wild and separated
versus when they're like form together
because the weight is too big for that
it just does not look great at all
so whew so I'm keep that in mind too
but it's up to you and your preference
on how you like to wear your hair but
for me I like it more like this and I
actually think this is so cute I'm
loving loving loving the color it's just
a lot y'all but a photo shoot you are
going to be working it and killing it
okay so yeah okay so as far as shine
there is not any shine to this week like
the color is very dull looking and it
really looks natural beside the band so
big um that's my only issue with this
wig it's like the thickness or this is
just like really really yucky crazy
thickness like it's beyond and only
right here like the back part and all
this is really Tang but this part right
here it's just really thick but I tried
to make it work you guys tell me what
you think do you like it so yeah but I
was also tangling and shutting this wig
does not really but it does tangle
and of course it's synthetic and it's a
the wig so yeah like towards the end is
where I get the most tingling but
besides that it's actually pretty cute
like the more I the more like I'm laying
it around I'm getting used to it but
when I first put this on and I was
alarmed okay and especially with the
part being on the side it just did not
work for me at all but I definitely love
this as a middle part and if I ever go
to a photo shoot best of belief this is
the first week that I'm gonna pick up
because that's how glamorous it looks is
just like it really is no denying that
this week it's really glamorous but yeah
that's pretty much it for this video if
you have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
below again this week was from Sam's V
I'll go ahead and leave all the details
in the description box just in case any
of you guys are interested and I will
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
