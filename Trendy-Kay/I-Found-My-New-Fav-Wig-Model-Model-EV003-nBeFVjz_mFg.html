this is gonna be really quick because
I'm trying to you know get out some
videos for you guys and I've been like
extra freaking slow with it but anyway
this is a wig I purchased and this is I
have to say if I fall one of my favorite
weights of 2018 or in general this week
they come out at the end of 2017 so I
wanted to go ahead and share with you
guys this wig because I feel like I'm
just like so in love with this wig or
whatever so anyway this is the model
model 7 star v-shaped a lace front and I
have it in a style Eevee 0:03
and I have it in a color one so this is
what the model looks like and when I
first seen this like before I even
purchased it I knew I was gonna freaking
love it
just because the hair looks exactly like
this is what you're getting it looks
really good and I was like oh my god
that's my style because I didn't want it
to be too straight I wanted it to have
some like body and all of that like some
Flowage and this way definitely has it
you guys yes who is it oh that's K now
y'all know I didn't pretty much touch
bases with so many freaking colors it's
ridiculous but I was thinking to myself
like dick I never even like did a color
number one wig on my channel didn't even
sound right so I was like let me go here
and try this week in a color one so
y'all when I put this week and tried it
on off the bed like this week was
freaking gorgeous like as you can see
this is a gorgeous wig yo when I put
this thing while I was feeling myself so
much so yeah I originally got it in a
actually I bought it in a color it's
like a orange copper color but I wanted
that from we do not want that from I
ordered it from Han sisters your when I
tell you the shipping takes forever so
I'm still itching for this wig so I'm
like let me just order this from another
site so I went ahead and ordered it from
Sam's Beauty I believe I'll go ahead and
leave links to where you can purchase
this week from down below so I ended up
ordering this wig and I ordered it in a
color a color one yeah just the color
one so after I ordered it in a color
wine I received it still didn't get my
orange color wig that looks like this I
still haven't received that well now I
received it but when I received this
week I still didn't get the orange color
way again so I tried this one I was like
oh my gosh I fell in love like this
hairstyle it just is it fits me like
this is me I love this type of style
it's just not too much and it's still
it's like doing something but it's not
going too much of you to understand me
honestly I feel like this way it's like
little key perfect so anyway after I
fell in love with this week I heard that
my order number two and I also ordered a
5:30 which is like a burgundy British
type of color which looks so good it's
your typical construction to Combs in
the front or comb in the back and
adjustable straps I will say this week
fits very snug on my head so if you do
have a larger sized head I feel like I
don't know it stretches a little bit but
I wouldn't say this is a wig for larger
sized heads so if your head is on the
bigger side I don't know if you're gonna
fit this but if you have a normal to
smaller sized head you'll definitely get
away with this week so anyway like I
said that's the construction to Combs in
a front combing a bit
adjustable shrimps now it does come as a
middle part of course if you want it to
wait on the side you could all you got
to do is shift the rig look all you have
to do is shift the weight to the side
and it becomes a middle part and I feel
like it looks good on a side but y'all
know I'm a middle part type of girl and
the fact that this already comes in the
middle like this wig it's just life so
anyway it comes with the pot in the
middle this is the part right here y'all
okay so let me tell you about this part
this part you don't have to freaking
plug I did not plug this put it oh I
didn't put like heat to the top cuz
don't you know how when you put on wigs
you have to light I meant don't you know
how when you like put on a wig but it's
still a little hoppy at the top not this
week when I put this on it lay flat and
I don't know what so this is the week
straight out the pack with no heat
applied to the top to make it flat no
plucking I didn't have to do to put it
this is how the part comes the only
thing I did was add powder into the part
so as far as the texture it is a Yankee
texture which I love and the texture is
like it's a nice thick yeah eNOS but
it's not like a yanking this way it's
too thick and it just looks so fake like
it looks like a type of yanking that's
where you have relaxed hair but your
hair is like thick that's the type of
fill I get from it so yeah it is a nice
Yankee texture the shine it's really no
shine it looks very very natural the cut
this came like this I didn't cut it and
y'all know how I like my stuff to be
even in the front it does that for me so
yeah so this week is probably around
like 20 22 inches along 22 to 24 yeah
probably like 24 I don't know I'm not
gonna say this week it's perfect perfect
but it's pretty perfect for synthetic
weight but this week does when I
got it out the pack it did as
combing it I'm not getting any shedding
yes I am I'm getting a couple of strands
of hair so like I said this week is
still shutting so it sheds and I don't
think that's from me cutting off the
lakes or anything like that it sheds a
little bit right now I'm not getting any
more shedding but who knows I'm pretty
sure it will start to you know shed
again oh you'll get like a couple
strands when you bring your finger
through it but it's not like really old
each other if you do them same as far as
tangling I did not receive any tangle in
this heads like butter it's just really
nice I love the style I just love
everything about this week this is
definitely gonna be a everyday week for
me I just the style just fits me when
they made this week they thought of okay
I'm not even lying like seriously I just
love hairstyles that look like this like
it really looks good I do feel like this
dump one color it's really becoming I am
definitely gonna get into my dark colors
like color one I think i'ma try in
another week as well I'd be so fixed on
all like the colors and the blondes and
stuff like that that I really had to
take a step back and try out this dark
color and I actually really really like
it so I'm definitely gonna get more into
darker colors if you're a person that
loves to wear the color number one I'm
definitely going to double dabble in
some more wigs with this color just to
see how I like it so yeah that's it for
