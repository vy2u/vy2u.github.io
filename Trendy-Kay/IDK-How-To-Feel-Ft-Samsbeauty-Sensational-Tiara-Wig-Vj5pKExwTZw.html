I'll call me
phone rings hey guys it's Kate of course
and I'm back with a another video so the
way that I'm going to be sharing is the
week that I'm wearing and I will sent
this from a Sam speedy so just in case
you're interested in this wig I'll go
ahead and leave all the links in the
description box so yeah the wig I'm
wearing is by sensational it is the
Empress at least wig leaves for an edge
and I have it in a style a tiara and I
have it in the color t1b
ma lavender which I absolutely love this
color and this week is not new to
YouTube at all I'm pretty sure you guys
have already heard about this week and
from the thousands of reviews that I've
seen on this week it tempt me to get
this and I can say that it looks nothing
like how everybody else's week look so
yeah I'm definitely not really feeling
it it's okay but not my favorite so as
far as the construction for this week it
does give you the soft lace and it also
comes as a middle part I don't think
that you can switch it like as a side
part because it's just made to be a
middle part because it's above so yeah
is a Yankee texture as well and they get
you texture it's like it's a light
Yankee but the density of this wig is
really full and thick also it gives you
two pumps and a front a comb and a back
with adjustable straps I do feel like
this week will fit big hits more hits
regular sized hit it doesn't matter just
go ahead and a gesture strap if you do
have a smaller sized head like me so
what I did is I adjusted my strap and
this wig fits me really nice and snug
yeah this week isn't going anywhere
so this is what it looks like another
thing that duct brute is all the way
through so if you're the type of person
that likes your dog through all the way
through your love this week this is what
the part looks like now I didn't go in
and really pluck the part I wanted
plucked it right here where the hair
line is and then the rest I just left
alone and
at my finishing powder to the park so
yeah this is what it looks like and this
is just a nice everyday type of wig if
you're looking for a bub week I mean
you're into both wigs this would be a
nice one now on the thing that I don't
really like about this wig is it reminds
me of the last book that I showed you
guys it's just something about the
length I'm not sure if I really like
bugs this length for me I think
Ljuba was actually this long and I
actually really really liked that way
but I don't know I think it's something
about the lips or the way it's curled
that just doesn't sit well with me so I
don't know tell me what you think I feel
like when I looked at everybody else's
review like this week was literally boom
on everybody and then when I got it I
had to look at the picture again like is
this the right week but yeah I don't
know the color is I love this color
because y'all know I've been trying to
keep my hands on this purple type color
so yeah I just decided to get it in this
week and I actually really really love
this color yeah so this is going to be
really quick not really much to say
about this week I haven't really
received any tank where I haven't
received any tangle in at all yet now I
did receive a little bit of shedding but
it wasn't bad and it was mostly from
when I took it out of the package and
ran my fingers through it but besides
that like even if there are cut the lace
off the front I still haven't had any
shot and after that also when I took it
out of the package it was kind of like
like I don't know if you can see it this
shine it's kind of wavy a little bit
it's not like straight which is fine
because it's just from the packaging so
yeah if you have this issues and just
easily take your straightener and run it
through just to get nice wavy patterns
out so guys I hoped you enjoyed that's
it for this video I'll see you in my
next video if you have any questions
feel free to leave it in the comment
section down below so yeah I'm going to
hurt I'm gonna
look I'm going to turn around so you can
see the week all the way around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
