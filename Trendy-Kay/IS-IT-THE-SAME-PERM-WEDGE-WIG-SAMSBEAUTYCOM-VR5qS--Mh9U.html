review and I'm going to be reviewing
this week that's on my head and this
week listen to me from Sam's Beauty so I
will leave their links and the link to
this week just in case you're interested
in my description bar okay so let's talk
about this week now first glance this
week is beautiful
um actually like it is really a nice wig
just not my favorite is some things that
I really don't care about when it comes
to this week but overall it's a okay wig
it's not like oh my gosh girl you've got
to get this week but it's definitely um
a really nice week so this is what the
wig looks like and this wig is the
Empress lace wig by sensational and it's
the stocking cap wig custom lace wig I
don't know what they'd be saying on here
anyway this is the perm a Yankee and I
Ament mean from you
this is the perm wedge wig and I have it
in a 1b oh yeah this is what the picture
looks like sorry
so of course I'm sure it's a lot of you
guys out here to already know about the
UM this specific wig um they came out
with this wig and it also came out with
a perm romance I believe it's Gucci
weeks these weeks actually remind me of
the sensational instant wig instant
fashion weight couture whatever that you
know what I'm saying
mainly nandana this week is just like a
upgrade from May Lane and then the perm
romance is like a upgrade from Anna as
exactly it's like the exact same week
but better like the part is better just
overall the control
is better um the density and the wig is
a little better it's not like a drastic
change but it's better um but the style
it still has like a Yankee texture it's
basically the same wig to me um I still
feel the same way I mean this is Mei
Ling but yeah I do have the perm romance
and that's absolutely life right there I
absolutely love that way but like I feel
about this way the same way I felt about
Maylene okay so let me tell you the
things that I do like like the way I
love the texture um this week is extra
long it comes above my belly buttons
probably like 22 inches long so if
you're not finish your hair you probably
won't like this because it really is
really really long but you can cut it so
I mean it shouldn't be a problem for you
just in case you don't like that much
left you can definitely cut it I'm
thinking I'm actually thinking about
cutting it too right here I'm not sure
yet so yeah I definitely love the style
of this week is okay I don't love it
it's okay the texture I definitely love
the texture I definitely love the Parden
space and I did not plug my parts um I
really don't have much of my hairs out I
just put it on my head
um but yeah if you wanted to look more
natural of course you can put it behind
your hairline and just like take some of
your hair out but yeah for the most part
this is what the part looks like I only
added um only edit powder into my part I
did not pluck it so the part is like
really deep and long I absolutely love
it and then when you get this wig they
only give you lace right here if you
don't really like taking the time to
really cut the lace off this will be a
good way for you because you really
don't have to
that much lace off and if you're lazy
and don't like plucking your part you're
like this week because you really don't
have to pluck the part the part comes
natural I'm as far as combs this wig has
two combs sitting right here I guess so
you can like believe put it right here
so it won't like move anywhere it also
has a comb in the back and it has
adjustable straps which you guys know I
don't use my combs I just use my
justit's not really snug on my head like
I would like it to be so if you have a
bigger size head
I think this way will probably be
perfect for you or you can fit it I
wouldn't say perfect
um but you could definitely get away
with wearing this for all my small head
ladies out here um it is a bit I mean
it's not like huge or anything like that
where you feel like it's gonna fall um
they do give you a side part so if
you're more of a middle part person you
can always just shift the way into the
middle and wait like that I tried it
both ways it looks it still looks good
in the middle you can win both ways in
the middle on the side okay so basically
the front area looks like you know drop
curls like just like curl and then the
back is straight like how Maylene is I'm
really not a fan of that because when
you first get this like they are tight
like I did take my finger and like to
loosen it up but it just looks like two
different wigs like in the back it looks
like a straight wing and then in the
front they got like two curls right I
was actually thinking about
straightening this side because this
side is so wet like I don't know what's
going on but it doesn't really it's kind
of like flat up in here I don't know it
don't really lay like I want it to lay I
don't really care
for how this wig is style but is like
really really cute though once you style
it everything like that but as far as
tangling and shedding now I do already
would is week two times and when I tell
you like it's holding up well so if
you're a person that likes to wear your
wigs all day
a in you know things like that on an
everyday basis this wig might actually
be good for you because this is my third
time way this week I haven't had any
problems with tangling I haven't had any
problems with shouting like we get in
that department this week is really good
when it comes to you know not shutting
and tangling so yeah this is what the
wait I haven't been doing really good
with um with like answering people's
questions let me try to do better but
yeah it's just like being overlord
you
so if you're interested in this weight I
will definitely leave all the links and
everything to this week in my
description box and I hope you guys like
