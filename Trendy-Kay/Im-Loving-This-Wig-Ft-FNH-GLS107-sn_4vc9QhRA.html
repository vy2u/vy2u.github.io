hey guys it's Kate and I'm back with
another video and this wig is gonna be
on Friday night hair so I was sent this
week from Friday night hair and they
sent me the GLS 107 and I have it in a
color 1b so y'all I'm just like so in
love with this head right now who just
give it up for this hair real real quick
like this hair legit looks like my hair
so before I start rambling on about how
much I love this hair let me just give
you all the specs you need to know about
this hair all so I'm gonna go here and
leave Friday night hair links in my
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested in this week so yeah
if you're not familiar with Friday night
hair of course this is a synthetic lace
front wig which they give you about 1
and 1/2 inches worth of lace space to
work lift like if you want to part the
hair you could of course when you move
to the side is less lay space to work
with but if you did want to put the hair
on the side you can always shift the way
to the side to make the lace like on the
side if you give them Sam but me
personally I don't really like to use
the lace base I just flip the hair to
either side so this week also comes with
two combs and a front a comb in the back
and adjustable shreds I'm out of breath
because I just ran all the way up the
steps and and get girl was out of shape
I don't even know where I left off but
yeah I think I was talking about the
construction so yeah like I said this
week comes with two combs in front of
home in the back and adjustable straps
this week also comes with hard lace now
all the wigs come with hot lace you guys
some or some of the lace on the wigs are
softer than others it just all depends
on what weight you get so yeah keep that
in mind
what else um this is how the hair comes
straight out the package this is a lot
of hair and it looks so natural and yeah
the end of the video there you go so if
you're interested like no but seriously
y'all this is the wig straight out the
package the only thing I did of course
was add my little baby hands to make it
more natural but I didn't brush this
hair out I did not finger comb this hair
no lies I did nothing to this wig and
it's the perfect length it's full it
doesn't have a shine to it at all I mean
it has like a subtle shine to it like a
natural type of shine but it doesn't
look very shiny like plasticy or fake
I know sometimes Friday night waves can
come off looking kind of shiny and
finish and you have to and stuff to get
it to like look dull or get the shine
out but this wig is absolutely beautiful
so this is what the wave pattern looks
like and basically as if you was to
braid your head and then take the braids
out it looks exactly like that the hair
is very soft I did get a few strands of
hair and this hand doesn't shed a little
bit and it was mostly when I cut off the
lace but besides that I haven't really
got any shot in I am getting like a few
strands but it's not bad at all yeah I
did get like a couple of strands but
it's not bad and I have not received any
tangle in from this week and even though
is this thick and curly like you still
can run your fingers through it without
any type of issues or anything so I do
really like this week I feel like if it
was longer it would probably just be too
much and it wouldn't really be a
everyday week but this because of the
length and it just really like you can
wear this every day and you could just
throw this on and like I said you
wouldn't have to do much to this at all
or if anything
you wouldn't have to do anything to this
week as far as the cap size if you do
have a smaller size head I feel like you
could get away with playing this week if
it's me and great
even before I just my shrinks it fit me
good I do have my strips adjusted just
for the extra security but if you have a
bigger size here I felt like it was
still fit you just don't adjust your
strips um I don't really know if you
have like a huge huge hit with this
probably wouldn't fit you if your head
is like beyond normal I don't know um
but you and me for all my small hair
girls you definitely definitely would
love this week because if it's really
good what else can I say you're like I'm
pumped over here like what this is my
handful room what girl this looked like
some vacation here some vacation here
this can be any type of hair you want it
to be y'all I'm just letting y'all know
like this I'm gonna trip him this this
next one
yo this hair just leave my life real
quick
I'm definitely check out this week
because you really don't have to do much
to this hand like this is straight out
the package put it on your hair and go
type of week you feel me
so I freaking love this hair I don't
know it was just something about it like
when I put it on my hair I was like yeah
my head like this is my head for real so
I don't know I feel like y'all wanna let
us hear um definitely check it out I
really don't have much to say I'm sorry
because this has just is it is just this
it's natural if you like that more
natural type of look you'll like this
hair but yeah overall I definitely like
ready this has to be one of my favorite
wigs from a Friday night hair I'm
definitely loving this head it doesn't
even matter if the pie-faces not even
all of that because like I said it looks
so good flipped over it still looks
natural
so yeah anyway I'll go ahead and leave
Friday night head links in the
description box and that's it for my
