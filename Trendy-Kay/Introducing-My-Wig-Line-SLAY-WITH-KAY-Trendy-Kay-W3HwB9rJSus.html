lip-locking on show got damaged by the
ball oh come with Tony for crossing our
bows alright because I call them um hey
guys it's Kate of course and I'm back
with another video and this video is
special to me because this is the video
for the launch of my wiggler so this
video is basically gonna be me showing
you what weeks are gonna be available so
if you follow me on Instagram or
snapchat then you've already kind of
like seen a sneak peek well you have
seen on the head that I will be a
feature in on my website so yeah this is
just basically gonna be a detailed video
of which you will be purchasing I'm Loki
is so excited because if you've been
following me then you know that this
took me forever and it's special to me
and I'm happy to be sharing it with you
guys I still have a long way to go and
I'm not saying that my wigs are perfect
because they are far from perfect but
they are way better than the wigs before
so yeah I'm kind of getting the hang of
things I still have a lot to learn so um
yeah let's just get started because I
don't want to ramble I just want to get
it straight to the point so basically
there will be two styles and of course
you gotta start somewhere
so I don't have like a lot of styles
available but it will be I'm in the
process of working or adding more styles
to my line but for now it's on these two
styles available so one of the styles
which is this one is available in two
colors which is a color number two which
is like a dark brown color and this
color which is a orange color
it does come with duck root both the
styles are middle part wigs but you will
be able to shift them a left or right if
you wanted to weigh him on the side also
these are Swiss the lace wigs and it is
lace in the front as well as the lace in
the part so I don't know why I'm so out
of breath and I didn't write anything
down like I'm really just going off the
top of my head with this you guys and so
first we're going to get into my
packaging which is one of my favorite
parts because I worked so hard on the
packaging so let's just hop straight
into what the packaging will look like
sorry if you heard that okay so
basically your wig will come in this
slave of K byee trendy k box when you
open it up this is what you'll be
getting it comes with the wig inside and
it also comes with a little mirror which
is just like a gift from me and this is
what the week looks like all the
packaging so yes it just has and thank
you right there with some tissue paper
so this is my card that you will receive
and on the back of the cart just have
all the weight details so the style for
this particular wig is k straight so the
style for this week that I'm wearing
it's K curl just because it's curl and
then the other style is K Street so I
felt like it will only be appropriate to
name the wig after me since it's like my
first week so yeah both wigs okay but
what is the street one and one is a
curly one so yeah the color of this is
orange which is the color then it just
has some details synthetic wig Swiss
lace middle part lace front wig 16
inches Yankee texture curling are safe
up to a hundred degrees which um this
might not be too accurate with the 100
degrees it might can go higher than that
but just be
very very very careful not to put it on
really high heat you guys you know um it
was too high of a heat so yeah
didn't even some right you'll know if
it's if the heat is too high so just be
very careful with that but this week is
heat friendly so yeah I'm not gonna
really open this I don't think because I
have my weights that I want to show you
even though I've been waiting I don't
know if you want to see it like straight
out of the package in which you probably
would I don't know how to do this video
yet but all of these wigs are literally
packed up and it took me for ever it's
just me by myself my sister actually
helped me but she was doing stuff so
wrong yo so yeah and shout-out to you
for helping me I love you now I'm just
gonna go ahead and show you the
construction of the wig and all my wigs
have the same construction so basically
like I said before it is a middle part
wig I will say that you really don't
have to pluck the part if you don't want
to i didn't pluck the part one this week
only edit powder into this week and the
pardon for me is actually really great
let me undo my straps because like i
said of course you gotta try out your
own product just to see how it wears and
everything like that so the wigs that
I'm showing you have been warned but I
will show you the wigs how they look
straight out the package but for right
now I'm going to show you the
construction so like I said it is a
middle part wig so this is the
construction you get two combs in the
front on each side you get you also get
least in the back it's a little bit of
lace I didn't even cut this off to me
that's not really necessary but yeah the
factory they decided to put least in the
back which I'm not really I mean it's
okay whatever
so yeah it also comes with a comb in the
back and it also comes with adjustable
straps
now I do feel like this week is um it
can be became friendly just don't adjust
your straps it might be a little snug if
your head is really really big but the
weight camp is very very stretchy so I
feel like if you do have a bigger sized
head you can get away with this week
this week also comes with baby heads I
don't know if you guys can see that but
of course you know I had to add baby
hairs to my wigs so yeah it does come
with baby heads as well and this is what
the curls look like now like I said this
week is also a Yankee texture and the
density is not too full and that's one
of the things that I want to work on is
making a density a little bit more
fuller but it is a natural density it's
not a thin wig whatsoever moving on to
the next week I just wanted to show you
guys this one but I am going to show you
what this way it looks like straight out
of the package the con foot this
straight wig is the packaging when the
factory sent the wigs to me I feel like
their packaging wasn't really how I
would want my wigs to be packaged so
that's another thing that I'm working on
but of course the straight wig did get
bent so when you take it straight out
the package I will say that you will
have to put heat so the way can go back
straight because it does have bends in
it but besides that I love the wig so
this week will not be like put it on and
you can go you definitely have to
straighten it before you wear it as far
as the curly texture ones like these
ones these ones are fine straight out
the pack because they all curl but as
far as the straight one you will have to
go in with some heat just to straighten
it a little bit and it's easy to do like
I said I will show you how it comes out
the pack originally just so you'll know
what you're buying but yeah that's the
only con of this wig right here but as
far as the construction is the exact
same
correction the length of this is 16
inches I know it's a lot of people out
there that don't really like the long
hair and you can definitely wear these
wigs on an everyday basis so yeah this
is the packaging you see how the factory
packaged this week which this cardboard
thing should have been a longer but you
know so it does come a hook so you kind
of have to like snatch it off or
whatever so this is what it looks like
fresh out of the package of course it
has the net it also has this I forgot to
mention because I might have just do
miles away so yeah and it also comes
with this just to keep you a nice and
fresh so yeah this is what the week
looks like fresh out of the package and
as you can see like I stated before um
it does have some bends in where you
would need to go and straighten the wig
but besides that I think that this week
is beautiful the duct root all my wigs
are not all the way through they are
halfway through so keep that in mind but
as far as the front if the wind blows
honey you're secure
so yeah the dumper is not all the way
through if you like you to if you like
your duct roots all the way through
you're not gonna get this from this week
so yeah it's not too bad but of course
I'm keeping it real so yeah this is how
it will come it has a little bin but
nothing that you cannot fix so yeah and
this is what the lace looks like Owen
let's move on to tingling and shut-in I
wish I could say that my wigs
listen
tingle and shed well I haven't really
got tingling out of these wigs but it's
fun shedding yes these wigs do share a
little bit some when I went through them
some chinch straight out the peg it's
not like OD shedding but I did receive
it some strands of hair and then the
more you wet
it does shed here and there but you
won't like fine hair all over the place
it's not like shedding like that but
just keep in mind the wig does shed so
you'll get like some strands I'm pretty
sure I'm not gonna get any strands now
but y'all know what I mean with
synthetic wigs and as far as tangling
now I've been win this week for a while
now I probably would have to say I've
been wearing this for about a little
over a week and it's still holding up
really nice it looks exactly how I look
when I got it out of the pack as far as
tangling now I will get a couple snacks
like a little bit right here but see but
as far as like serious tingling no you
will not get any tingling at least not
yet
but this wig is kind of like it has been
worn and I still feel like it's still
holding up really really good I'm just
going to turn around so you can see what
this wig looks like all the way through
and like I said this is the same exact
week as the darker one
so yeah that's pretty much it for this
video I hope that I covered everything
and really helped you out on which you
will be a purchasing if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in the
comment section down below and I will
definitely get to your question if I
have it already answered it as far as
the wig line the wig line will be
launching tomorrow which is April 5th at
12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
