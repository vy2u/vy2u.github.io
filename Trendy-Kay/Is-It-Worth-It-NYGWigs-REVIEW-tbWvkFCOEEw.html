review unless you started on this unit
that I'm wearing now
and this unit is by not your grandma's
wigs so they're basically like a fairly
new company they reached out to me for
me to do a review on one of their units
so yeah I picked this unit out okay so
when I received the unit's it came to me
in this box right here so this is what
your head will come in basically it's
like a closing box like when I read the
presence or something and yeah this is
what it is and it just has an ygw in the
stands for not sure where my wigs so
yeah I think I don't like the packaging
at all I think they could have did much
better when it comes to the packaging so
then this unit came inside of this
plastic bag and it was wrapped in the
net like it always is so yeah right here
it just has lace front wig 24 inches is
how long the wig is and then it says SS
but I'm not really sure what else means
okay guys so I'm having some technical
difficulties trying to find this site
and I'm just want to go off of my like
emails or whatever so basically I am
wearing um this is a human hand wig
don't ask me what kind of hair this is
because I don't know um let me see
I just had it I'm so sorry you guys like
I thought it was gonna be better because
I could just go to the site and read it
over there because I forget okay so
basically I picked out it's called the
straight blonde tip full lace wig and 22
inches and it's 150% in density so yeah
this is this wig so basically the style
is straight blowing tip full lace wig so
when I received this unit from the
company I was disappointed because I
explore a full lace unit and when I
received the unit it was not for lease
at all um to me I just think that it
looks really Wiggy so basically they
sent me a full lace sheet I meant not a
full each unit they sent me a lace front
when it comes to a Wayne Street hair I'm
not relieved I don't really like
straight hair on lace front units
because I like my part to be more longer
if my head is straight if that makes any
kind of sense but yeah so I was
disappointed about that so I reached out
to the company and I told them that they
sent me the wrong unit so yeah I said
that I would still review this wig even
though it was the wrong unit that they
sent me so the company told me that it
was a mistake and basically they said
something about and so many words
basically it was like what sending you
in this week for free so basically you
want to get the cheaper version of the
week which is the lace front and not the
whole lace unit which I feel like they
was just being cheap I'm just being
honest so if you guys even though I'm
doing this review for them but at the
same time that's just like if somebody
was to order a wig from them an ax for
foolish unit and then
send them a lace-front like that's crazy
to me so yeah I'm just keeping it real
so yeah I was not offended at I'm not
offended this way at all
I feel like it's too bulky it took me a
while just to get this slick and
straight this is the lace part and this
is how much part in space they give you
so as far as um as far as like the
weight construction arm it's three combs
and in front of comb in a bag with
adjustable straps now I feel like this
is really big because like as you can
see like it's not even stand down on my
head like up in the front area is really
really um it's really big so I just felt
like I'm just gonna tuck it behind my
ears I'm just like really disappointed
in this unity as far as the texture of
the head and how it's supposed to be
silky but this head is gets very tangley
and at the ends it's really dry and this
is where it gets teeny Li the most now
as far as the thickness I do like the
thickness throughout the unit but I just
don't like the thickness right here like
the density in the late spot right here
does not work well for me but throughout
the unit the thickness is good but I
just felt like this part right here is
like too thick it's just like the whole
wig itself just looks really Wiggy and
like I didn't pluck this I didn't put
any concealer and apart or anything like
that so I don't know if I mentioned but
this week does shed um it actually sheds
a lot like right now it's shedding um
this is sorry this is how long when it
comes
me
so yeah I'm just just I don't know I
don't I don't know like I'm just overall
I'm really disappointed in this company
and and their wig yeah so this is my
review on this unit so yeah I'll leave
I'll leave the website name and all that
in the description box and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
