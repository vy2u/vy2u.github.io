back with another video and this week
was sent to me from Friday night head of
course so I win the GLS 118 and I have
it in the color om 430 which is which is
basically a duck root color which is
like a number two on the top like in a
room area and then it gradually goes
into like a color 13 but he says 430 as
if like the roots are number 4 and the
ends of this blowing part is the number
30 whatever the case may be it could be
a number 4 I don't know but y'all get
the gist so let's start off with this
color I don't really think that I'm a
fan I do like the color 30 but I don't
think I like the color 30 when it's curl
only think I like it when it's straight
I don't know y'all tell me how y'all
feel about this color I don't know it's
making me fold or uncomfortable to be
honest with you but I definitely had to
switch up this way because it was just
way too much like the color and the
style was just too much for me you guys
and that's crazy coming from me because
I just go all out with the colors and
stuff but I don't know this week kind of
makes me feel uncomfortable I don't know
what it is but I don't know it is a nice
color I do like the style but I think I
should have got it in a 1b versus this
color I don't know it's kind of strange
but yeah overall is a nice week so
basically if you're not familiar with
Friday night constructions this is not
they're newer constructions you know
they do a construction on their wigs
they give you more part spacing it also
gives you soft lace but this one is the
old construction so it comes with the
heart lace and it also gives you like an
inch and a half of parting space to work
with
also the dock route is only way
the lease is it's not um it's not
throughout the head so be aware of that
but it really doesn't matter to me I
didn't put them here because I feel like
it's not really no room to cut the hair
so I just kind of like shift it over to
the side and y'all I know y'all probably
going to be upset with me but it really
don't be my foot I really be trying to
show you what the wig looks like before
you know my results or whatever but it
just seems like every time I'm filming
me fixing the wig or altering the wig in
any kind of way my camera always fails
on me so as I was cutting this week and
I was cutting it one camera showing you
guys I looked up and I wasn't even
recorded so yeah I think I got like part
of it I'll add a clip but I swear oh I
really wanted y'all to see what the wig
looks like what the way it looked like
before I cut it so yeah but I'm pretty
sure it's a lot of reviews on this wig
alright so this is my end results for
this week because like I said I was
really struggling because this week just
I don't know it makes me feel
uncomfortable it's starting to grow on
me little B I even had to switch my lips
up y'all because I was like what is
wrong with this wig I don't know what it
is but it's something off with this
color or something I don't know
you
this week comes with two combs in the
front a comb and a bag and it also has
adjustable straps I do feel like this
wig is became friendly so if you do have
a bigger size head this way will fit you
so great me my head is on the smaller
side so I did adjust my straps and with
the strap suggest that I do feel like
this wig fits my head pretty good for
the most part so yeah I did get some
shedding as I was combing out the hair
like brushing my hands through it
because I did finger comb this week and
as I was finger combing this week I did
get a I did get some shedding but
overall nothing like to worry about as
far as shedding because I don't feel
like you should be really brushing this
wig out oh and as far as tangling of
course this is curly hair curly
synthetic era so I'm pretty sure as you
like mess with the head the hair will
take you up but I'm pretty sure you
wouldn't have to like run your fingers
through it that much or anything so you
wouldn't have to really worry about the
tingling or the shearing for that matter
I feel like once you brush your finger
comb it the first time you really
shouldn't have to do it a second time
also I did go in and add some baby hair
and on this one it just takes a little
more work and gel to keep them laid down
but once they're laid down like they're
laid down and I did use they got to be
glue gel but I struggled trying to get
the baby heads that I created to lay
down but so if you're looking for a
curly wig definitely especially for the
Fall I definitely think that this is
some great full hair and the color is
good for the Fall
definitely check out Friday night hair
I'll leave all the links in the
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested but yeah so I'm not
even gonna lie on like as I
progressively start to film this video
and get into the video like this week
it's growing on me like I don't even
know what I was thinking at first I
actually I'm not I don't know it was
weird to me at first I don't know why
but it really made me feel uncomfortable
but now I'm kind of O'Keefe in on myself
okay y'all so that's it for this video
if you guys had oh yeah and as far as
shine this week is not shiny but so ever
it kind of has like it has a little
shine to it so if you wanted to go ahead
and add your dressing if you want to go
in add some powder or dry shampoo you
could but the shot is not OD when it
looks fake shiny so I mean that's up to
you if you wanted to is something for
less shine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
