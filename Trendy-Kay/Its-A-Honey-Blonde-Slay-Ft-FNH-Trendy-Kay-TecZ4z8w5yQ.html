so to you
licking a frickin baby we can confer
good McKittrick give me my baby
no please me I'm gonna win it you right
now
hey guys it's K of course and I'm back
with a another video in Europe you're
not gonna believe what week this is this
week was sent to me from a Friday night
ham did y'all think was a Friday night
hey wait this is a GLS a 59 and yes it
looks different if you are familiar with
that week so yeah I have it in a 3t 27
which I love this freaking color you
guys is so pretty up against my skin
tone this whole week I'm just definitely
feeling this weekly show up so basically
I'm gonna insert what the way to look
like straight out of the pen if you're
not familiar with Friday night hair
basically they are constructed as a lace
front wig and also this wig comes with
two combs in the front a comb in a bank
and adjustable straps it is hot ladies
as well this is like riding my head
typical construction tangle and Shannon
I did get tangling and shut in him from
this week it wasn't too bad like the
shedding was not bad at all detangling
it was a little snakey um
rue bad before I cut the ends off but
not like I wouldn't say real bad but it
definitely snake on and it still doesn't
exit I cut the hell off but that's
expected because this is a longer wig
and it's also synthetic air and it's
curly so so yeah but I don't really plan
on brushing it anymore and I did brush
out the curls once my vent brush I don't
really know where it's at right now but
yeah that's how I brush the curls out
with my fresh but if I was to wear this
again I would just finger comb and I
wouldn't even brush it out with my vent
brush anymore because I like the curls
how they are this week is pretty thick
in full it's really lightweight though
so it's not heavy because I know a lot
of people will have a problem with
playing this type of hair and it's
summertime but I'm not sweating and I
get hot quickly I feel like you don't
really need to add
any my dry shampoo or baby powder to go
to shop shine now it's up to you but I'm
not going to do that because I feel like
it's not really that shiny like up in
this but it's kind of more shiny than
this part this part is a little bit more
duller than this but I mean it doesn't
really bother me so yeah I'm not really
worried about it but I did it baby hands
because of course this way does not come
with any baby hair so of course you know
I gotta end my baby hair and yeah that's
basically all I did of course this is
hardly so I didn't like secure the lace
down with anything if it's perfect I
also feel like this week is a big head
friendly if you have a smaller size head
just go ahead and adjust your straps I
love the fact that the roots are not
black in their Brown and I was alright
this color to me is poppin y'all they
actually give you dog fruit all the way
through this week so if you like your
dump route all the way through yo this
is the one right I love this video this
week I wasn't expecting it like I
already knew how I wanted to
style this week but I wasn't expecting
it to really come out of this grief but
I like the curls you know I was
searching I really was searching for a
natural color in this week because I
didn't like the ends but something was
like yo just cut off the ends and you'll
be fine and just waiting like that the
color is actually really really gorgeous
I'm definitely a fan of myself with this
wig so yeah let me turn around real
quick to you guys to see what the bank
looks like
I don't know if y'all can see that but
the hairline is unbelievable it looks so
natural you guys so you don't have to
pluck it even though I really don't
pluck my synthetic wig hands I mean you
can but I'd be feeling like the hair it
just it's too much attention when I had
when you pluck it out but normally I
feel like their hand I know not all of
the hair like be on point but some of
their weeks be on point as far as like
the hairline this one is definitely on
point that's it for this video if you
