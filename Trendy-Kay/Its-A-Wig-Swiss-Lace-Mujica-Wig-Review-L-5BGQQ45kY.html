weight review and this is the unit that
I'm going to be reviewing which is
currently on my head that was just too
much this is no review that this is the
week that I will be reviewing so yeah I
purchased this from where did I
purchased this from I purchased this
from week type Stockholm so yeah this
unit that I'm wearing is the it's a wig
and that's the name of like the brand
it's it's a wig and it's the Swiss lace
front unit and the style name is
misleads mujika ojika mmm
i think that's how you pronounce it in
the color TT 30 so yeah here's the name
just in case you know I'm saying it
wrong so yeah I'm I absolutely loved
this week you guys this actually reminds
me of a wig that I already did a review
on but it was in color and I think it
was the mermaid it was about Isis
collection I'm not sure I think it was
like the mermaid - it might be don't
quote me on it but um yeah which ever
unit that was this like the same exact
unit I definitely love the style of this
this it's like a unit you can definitely
wear every day it is a little on the
longer side it's about like 20 inches
but it does have layers cut in it which
I really do love the only thing that I
did to this unit was I cut the bangs a
little bit more because they was a
little longer and
didn't really like them so I just took
like maybe like two inches two to three
inches off so yeah and I did also pluck
the part and put a little bit of powder
in it I normally don't put powder in my
in my parts but for some reason I pluck
the putt and everything and I feel like
it just like you can't really see the
part so I'm I have to play with the pot
a little bit more to get it how I like
it because I'm really feeling this unit
but yeah that's one thing that I don't
like about this unit is you wanna like
really have to pluck the part out
because like you can't really see it
even when I put like powder in it like
it's still like really thin and I don't
really like my parts like that probably
won't like this unit because you know
it's so fleece I'm not really a big fan
of soft lace I like the hardly smooth
because I think it just blends in better
or lazy I don't on your head I don't
know but um yeah I mean it really
doesn't bother me I haven't had that
issue with I know some people say that
the soft lace kind of rolls up on you I
haven't really had that issue yet on
when shanks mine would I don't know jinx
myself what yeah so yeah if you're not
really a fan of the soft lace I wouldn't
suggest this unit to you another thing
is if your head is on like the larger
side
you're not gonna baby yeah you're not
going to be able to fit this unit
because I'm telling you without the
straps adjust it just me putting the wig
on itself fit it fits snug so much
strips is adjusted because I like my
wigs to be a little more tighter so I
can just feel better about when the unit
but yes so and y'all know my head is
like real peanut ish so it's extra small
so if you have like a small head like
like my head is really petite so yeah if
you have like a smaller size hit then
this week is going to be perfect for you
because it definitely fits really snug
this week also comes with two combs in
the front in a common event in the
adjustable shrimps like always what else
can I say about this unit it's far oh
yeah another thing about the part like
when I was plucking you have to be
careful like if you pluck out the if you
pluck in hair from out of the part
because it is like a softer lace my
camera just cut off because I did not
have enough storage so ya headed Elise
and stuff but anyway I was saying that I
just went and I just cut like into the
hairline because I ripped it so you know
I just cut a little into the hairline
bin so the rip was like at the very
beginning of the parts so yes so I just
cut the rip out if you understand but
anyway yeah just be careful when you are
plucking out your hairs to the part
because the lace is very very soft and
it will rip on you um this week is
pretty full I mean it's not like really
look really like lusciously full but I
mean it is okay like it's like a normal
density I wouldn't say like it's really
thick but it's it's a good density I
like when my weights are like this even
though I do you like full of units but
this is okay because it's not really
like skimpy and thin and I can work with
it so yeah and also this hair is like a
Yankee texture and it does not have any
shot at all it really looks really
really realistic um I thought that it
had roots all the way do through but it
doesn't but it definitely looks really
realistic I definitely love the dark fur
and I
look how this color looks against my
skin um I don't know I think it'd just
be popping like your eyes but so yeah I
just like really love this unit I really
don't have no complaints about this unit
it's up for the part and area but that
is fixable I just need to go back and
like pluck it more but yes so um this is
what it looks like this is meant to be a
side part it just looks better that way
I don't know I just been lately like on
my side put ish but I don't know like I
do still like my middle class but yeah I
just like it on the side what we thought
of y'all so yeah um as far as tingling
and shedding I have not received any uh
I haven't received any tingling from
this unit at all like my hands go like
straight through um as far as shoving I
have received shedding but that was only
when I cut like I cut like the lace off
because I did have to cut into the hand
line but after like I'd like took my
heads and like went through it and
finger comb the week I had not received
any more shut in so yeah this is a bomb
a unit you guys I definitely love the
style I love everything about this unit
besides the part but that's fixable
so yeah if you have any questions feel
free to leave it in the comment section
down below again I did purchase this
from wave types at home you know I'm not
good with prices so I'll definitely
leave the price in the description box
and yes I don't think I have anything
else to say oh yes if you're wondering
what's on my lips I am wearing
colour-pop cosmetics is there liquid
matte lipstick and I have it in the
color limbo so yeah I will leave all the
links to everything like the wig my
lipstick and yeah everything in the
description box so I will see you guys
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
