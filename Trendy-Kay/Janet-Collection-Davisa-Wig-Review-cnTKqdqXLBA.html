guys and I just got finished filming a
review on the Brazilian street hair by
locs head company so if you have not
checked that out go and check it out
basically I wanted to do this weight
review on this hair because I felt like
if anybody was trying to get that
particular look that I did with the
virgin hand some people can't really
afford or they don't want to spend all
that money on virgin hair even though
it's affordable but some people just you
know wanna go to cheaper route so I
decided to review a wig that looks
exactly like the unit that I made so
this is the wig that I'm wearing with my
head right now and this is by the Janik
collection it's the super flow deep part
lace wig and the style name is the visa
let me check it out the package and I
have heart in a color one so this is
what it looks like on the model this is
a lace part unit and the Parden looks
very good when I purchased this week I
did have to pluck out my part to get it
to look like that but yeah this wig is
around 22 to 24 inches long and this
unit is
very thick you guys like this is a thick
unit it also has two combs in the front
and a comb in the back with adjustable
straps me and this unit has we had like
a love-hate kind of relationship I want
this unit a couple times I do have a
picture that I posted on my Instagram
awhile ago but you really couldn't see
the unit because I was wearing a hat so
yeah if you guys were wondering what had
that was that I was when it was this
soul yea-ah I like it I like this week
okay
the problem I have with this wig is that
when I got this week it was like hella
thick like it was so Yankee like I told
you like I'm not really a fan of that
overly Yankee texture and what I mean by
that
like I'm not saying like overly Yankee
wear it just looks Yankee like I like
Yankee textured hair but I don't like
Yankee texture text your hair that looks
fake like if you're gonna mimic Yankee
texture hair make sure you do it right
so I don't have a problem with Yankee
textured hair but I just like when
people get it right
like when I did my reviews on this week
before I purchased it everybody that I
saw when this unit what that I felt like
that wig was like silky and like movable
like you don't get this from that at all
like the camera is definitely making it
look silky and not overly Yankee now
what I mean by I don't like overly
Yankee units is when they do when they
try to mimic Yankee hair the thing that
pisses me off is like they'll make the
wig look like it has crimson it like
like crinkly like I don't know if you
guys can see that but it's just like
it's a lot of crimps in here I don't
know if you guys catching it but it's
just like real creepy and I feel like
really like I'm about to walk out the
house with some crimps you might as well
throw a French roll in it like really
come on man like no so what I did was I
took my flat iron and I tried to
straighten out the hair so it wouldn't
be so grumpy and it took it away a
little bit but I only went in like the
front area because I didn't feel like
flat on in the back but it still has
that thickness to it this wig is really
really really really really really thick
like it's so thick so yeah but besides
the crimps like like we back in the day
like no I don't I don't really like that
like nobody hair is that creepy like it
looked like you took like one of those
crimps and like crimped your hair like
no nobody had it scorpy like that like
Yankee hair is not crimpy like that that
pisses me off you guys but besides that
I think that this wig is extra cute and
I definitely like I definitely like the
thickness that this wig gives you and I
forgot to mention that I did purchase
this weight from weight types calm and I
think I paid 23 or 24 dollars I'm not
sure but I'll definitely leave like the
price and everything in the description
box
I forgot to mention that this unit it
does shed just a little like right now
it got one strand it doesn't like shed a
lot but it definitely sheds and as far
as tangling I haven't really had a
problem too much with tangling yet but I
might only wore this wig like three
times so and yeah I'm pretty sure I
can't remember but right now it's not
ankle but I mean in my detangle hearing
that but I don't think that it was
nothing really to worry about because
the wig still looks great but I'm pretty
sure you keep on wearing a wig bins
though it's so long it will start to
tangle up on you okay so as you guys
know these wigs normally come like as a
side part and I just wear my part
towards the middle I know some people
like wearing their wigs
I meant their parts in the middle and
some people like wearing their parts on
the side but yeah this is how the wig
originally comes with the part to the
side so if anybody was curious and
wanted to see how the way it looks as a
side part this is how it looks and it
looks really good as a side part I will
probably rock it either way so I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and I'll
review so I hope you guys enjoy this
review and I will catch you next time
bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
