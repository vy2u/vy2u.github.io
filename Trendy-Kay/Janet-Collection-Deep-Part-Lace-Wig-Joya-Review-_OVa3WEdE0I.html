it's probably my last video but today
but you know a girl gotta make up
because I've been gone for so long
um okay so if you wonder in what's on my
head I have oh yeah and if you watch all
my previous videos before this one if
you're wondering what's on my lips it's
by Mac it's called heroin and then I
have a wet and wild pencil lip pencil in
violet so that's what's on my lips
it's nice umm I have who is this this is
by the Janik collection natural super
flow deep partly swig um and it has the
invisible deep pot lace and she is
called
Julia and I have her in a color too and
this wasn't my first choice of color my
first choice was a 1b but they sent me a
two because that was my second choice so
yes that's what I had on I got this from
of course uh Wiig types calm and I can't
remember how much she was but I'll link
everything in the description box um I
love this wig um I like me more with
straight hair but you know you got to
switch it up sometimes and I'm really
feeling this I wore her once and she is
like big so if you like big hair of
course she doesn't come this big she
actually comes like how she looks on the
D'Amato
um so basically what I did was I finger
comb car out to make her bigger also
like the front part was like way too
long so basic
what I did was I just cut the front part
a little bit um she comes with a part
that looks pretty wet real I did not
pluck this part that's how I came I
can't remember my punches I don't think
I plucked this part but yes like she has
given me life like I love this wig yes I
wore her once and she looks so good like
come way off I love her like it's very
versatile like if you don't want to wear
where I put you could like you did just
like wait wow through
but yes I'll put this on my IG and
everybody liked it so yeah this is like
so cute I can't remember what side the
parts on that's I'm hiding this week um
yeah but tell me what you think this is
Julia I got her from wig types and I'm
like a failing heart I probably would
have to like cut this part because it's
like in my way but I can't room this
camera is so stupid I think I'm putting
it at this side I'm putting it to the
other side okay
yeah but this is her curly and big hair
so if you like curly big hair and I'm
pretty sure this we can get even bigger
than what it is so yeah everybody let me
show you the part again wait a second
hold up I know I was doing something
wrong
okay I'm back I think I had the part
when the opposite side and it wasn't no
part but yep and if I was to you know
wear this out I definitely would pull
out some of my hair in the front it
probably would blend in better - because
I'm natural so but yep that's the part
I really love this week you know I might
have to step out in this week today so
tell me what you guys think
ah why do I keep on doing that hold on
can you hit him in the back like really
come on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
