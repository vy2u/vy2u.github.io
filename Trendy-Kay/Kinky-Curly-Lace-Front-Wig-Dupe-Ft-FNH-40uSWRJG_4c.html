down down
hey times whatever Roenicke do
one driver
take out something with another video
and this video is going to be on this
hair of course
so before I start this video if you have
watched my previous video because this
one I asked you guys what you think was
different about this video and a lot of
you guys commented that you do it that I
had my lips done which I didn't so I
know my bottom lip is a little bit on a
big side and it's like nice and juicy
and my chocolate is okay it's a little
like and it's nice juicy at the bottom
but I feel like when I wear lip gloss it
just enhances my pocket so that I could
have been what head you're thinking that
you know I had my lips done so I'm not
saying I never would and maybe in the
future so I can get this top lip
Michener's bottomless but for now like
I'm okay with my lips and no I did not
get lip injection it none of y'all fools
got it right what I was talking about
was the quality in my video because I
was filming when a new camera and I
would have thought that so many of you
guys would have guessed it but your
didn't so I was just like damn like it's
the quality what I think it is like I
don't know so yeah I'm not so myopic
hammer today I'm actually some of my old
camera um I figured y'all wouldn't
really care anyway because you don't
even know what is clammy it's cool what
I thought yet that was what I was
talking about but judges took it to a
whole another level
so yeah yo and funny odor so I was just
equate from a Friday night hand so if
you're interested in this week that I'm
wearing or any hand they felt when they
look site in general I'll go ahead and
leave the link down below just keep it
easy guys go check them out please
the way they sent me is the glf 85 and I
have in a color one thing this is one of
the newer units and basically the new
unit is more like better quality and
basically just like resist so what's the
newer units is three colors in the front
one in the back in an adjustable strip
with the older units is only two combs
prior comb innovate and adjustable
stress also with the newer units they
have this softer lace with the older
units they had the Harley and I know a
lot of people don't like the hard lace
because like it can irritate your edges
or anything like that
also another thing that I noticed about
their new units is the head quality is a
little bit better they also give you
more late to work with so instead of
like one and a half to two inches with
lenses they giving you like three three
and a half so of course when you soak on
a hair like on the sides you get Leslie
but the more laid faces up in the front
so if you don't really like the links on
the side and you feel like it's not
enough you can always put the head in
the middle and you can just shift the
wig over to the side and normally when I
do that it really doesn't mess with the
limp sometimes it does but you can just
go in and even it out by cutting it or
anything like that just as we go as you
can see even was my party on the side
they still are giving you a good amount
of lace on the side and even if he was
the part in the middle
it will be even longer and they would be
giving you more links that you can play
around with so I definitely love that
about the in your ways that they're
coming out with this is also the case
early so if you have a bigger size here
you definitely can get away with
Awareness Week because it is became
funny now if you have a smaller size yet
you still can get away with planet I
just feel like you need to adjust your
stress because my strips are adjusted in
the wig fits really nice for me it's not
as snug as I wanted to be but it's good
enough to the point where so like it's
not going to fall off my head so if you
do have a moment here you definitely can
adjust those strips and you'll be fine
if you feel if you still feel like the
wig is not as secure as you want it to
be you take some bobby pins and like 10
M edges little area and you can also
take a few in my pins back and it really
works out for me so I'm sure it'll work
when we haven't had any issues with
penguin of course just by looking at it
you can already tell this week we can go
up as we try to brush it'll comb it or
even bring your fingers through and shut
in I have received shutters from this
hair it's not too bad but like when I do
this I was receiving shedding and now
that I do it I don't receive as much
shenna as I did before or any shut-in at
all but yet this week does so just
be expecting tangle in the shedding
because this is the human I mean this is
the human because this is a synthetic
wig and you know you're going to get
that but it's manageable and it's not
bad so obsessive detect it's no shine on
this week it mimics like natural hair to
a tee and the way it looks like how it's
a little frizzy now mind you the friends
came from me when I first received this
week the curls were more defined
nonetheless it still looks exactly why
wouldn't they look the same but I did
struggle with the top area trying to get
it to lay right but as far as like the
curls everything all I did was plug them
out and I just took like one curl
because this is how the weight comes
originally they just comes looking
informed and uniform
like these codes so I just took it and
pluck each curl like this now I didn't
really go in the wig and pluck each curl
but I plus enough where it gave me that
kind of frizzy natural type of look
because I really struggled with Stalin
this week so yet if you do decide to get
this win keep in mind that you're really
going to have to play with it
or maybe it was just me but I really had
a hard time to get in the front too late
right because at first I wanted this
front fully like all in my face I have a
big Bush but hey like coming towards my
face and for some reason it just didn't
look right to me and I will insert clips
of how the hair looks originally and how
I was like trying to style the hair and
that I just gave up and gave this hair
break because I noticed if I keep on
fooling us a hair like I just wanna
paint it so I have to like take a break
from the head and then come back and
usually it works out that way and this
is just how I decided to wear it was the
pump with the part on inside and I
really like it because the part really
looks natural this hair looks like it's
freaking coming out of myself so I
didn't select the part I just added my
finishing powder and this is what your
part looks like in the so natural I'm so
in love with the part and I will say
this week overall just looks like
somebody pairs really looks natural so
if you'd like you know curly hair
natural curly hair and this type of look
I would definitely look into this week
because it definitely gives you some
natural vibe for sure but yeah I'm not
going to really make this video too long
but yet again if you plan on purchasing
this wig just be a with just beware
because our really really struggle was
trying to solace hair so I'm kind of
like low-key over this hair it's not my
favorite at all you guys but it is a
curly wig just in case you guys want to
look into it or you were looking into
buying it I'm just giving you my
thoughts in what I think one week so
overall it's pretty I don't have any
trouble maintaining this little anything
like that it was just getting to this
point was the hardest part for me so I
don't really like to spend too much time
when trying to style hair and for me I
spent way too much time on trying to get
this week to look right so are you
looking for like some hair like this to
look like this straight out the back is
just not going to happen
so you probably don't even want to
purchase this wig but if you don't mind
putting them work into your wigs
definitely check out this week because
the end results are definitely it worth
it and if you like your wigs to look
natural
it's your own hair like definitely chat
