video off like this showing you the wig
and how it comes packaged and this week
was sent to me from a lady hair company
so the packaging is really cute if
you're not familiar with wavy hair
company and it just comes in this bag
and it also comes in a matte and it just
shows you the tag which is 22 inches
long and this is the machine made wig
and it is Brazilian kinky curly and I
don't know if I mentioned but I do have
this in 22 inches if I didn't say that
already I think I did but yeah this is
what the part looks like in this part I
don't know what it is but basically it's
not a so closure but it has fabric over
top of the lace and it's just really
weird to me but it has three combs and
the front top area then it has two combs
on the side or comb in the back and
adjustable straps and yeah this is what
the way it looks like and the curls are
pretty tight so I did go ahead and wash
it because I wanted to see how that part
in space was that fabric would do wet
and it turned out really good it didn't
mess up that part in space and I like
the curl patter and when this week is
wet so yeah that's what it looks like
then I really really love this week you
guys this is so cute after detangle in
the head this is all the hair that I've
received which i think is pretty good I
know y'all saw the part so probably the
part did good when I wash this unity
because I really wanted to see how the
part with that fabric would do with
water and it did really really really
well like it did not mess the wake up
was sold out like this wig is
constructed so nice the part just threw
me off because I'm like okay this is
clearly not so based closure so
what is it look really funny but
actually it turned out nice and I really
do like the part the part looks so
natural so that is what the part looks
like and I do have this wig behind my
head line my hair is right up in this
area right here and this is the week so
basically what I did was I only added
concealer right here
and yes I added concealer to my scope
so it kamesh the parts and basically
what I did when I cut the init is I just
cut it to frame my face so I cut it
downward you would think because this is
a kinky curly unit that it will be hard
to detangle and stuff like that girl
know when I wash this head the Tanglin
was so easy now I did get some shut-in
which I didn't add any product to this
hair this is just how it looks at this
wash and I co wash out in like wash it
with any shampoo or anything like that I
did wash it with my criminate sure it's
in like a white in orange bottle I
washed it with that conditioner and it
made this wig extra sauce okay I'm
definitely going to an update video but
I just wanted you to see what this week
looks like in person yes oh I absolutely
love this week if you're interested in
this unit I will leave everything in my
description box I forgot to tell me all
that this is what is this 300% density
not no 130 and I know 150 yeah it's 300%
density but it's not like OD full in to
the point where it's just like oh this
is too much hair but it's enough hair is
like perfect like it's the perfect
amount of hair for this hairstyle so
that's it for this video if you guys
have any questions about this unit feel
free to leave it in my comment section
