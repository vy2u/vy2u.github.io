video so this video is gonna be on this
head of course and this head was sent to
me from RPG hair and this is not my
first time trying out the hair actually
really like this company so first off
this is what the packaging looks like
and I'm just gonna of course I always
show you guys the packaging and this
just came with a wig cap and it also
came with the elastic band that you can
sew n and of course this wig was wrapped
inside of this thing and it does have
like the little net hanging off of it so
they sent me the kinky straight 360 lace
wig and and iam Remy and it was more
kinky in the net but I'll insert clips
of how the wig originally look but I did
straighten this wig just so it wouldn't
be as thick as it was and if you do not
know where 360 unleased wig is is
basically giving you lace all the way
around and then it's left it in the
middle so it gives you the option if you
want to pull your hair up into like a
high ponytail and it just makes it look
more natural so that is what a 360 lace
wig is basically and the style number is
LSW 30 the hair color is a natural color
the texture of this wig is kinky
straight the length is 18 inches which
is not 18 inches anymore because I just
cut it into a book the density is 150
percent density which I feel like it's
true to what it said it's 150 percent
this hair is really thick and full so if
you like really thick natural looking
hair you'll definitely love this week
for sure the cache size is a medium
which for me my head is on a smaller
side so this week is big but if you
can't
normal to larger sides here I think I
can't medium sides will fit you just
well I did not gel my lace down we've
got to be glued I just adjusted the
straps that's in a week
so on the sides it is coming up but I
figured can't nobody really see because
I'm wearing a putt in the middle so it
was really no need for me to go through
the most with gluing I meant not gluing
but China when I'm talking about
juggling that's way down so yeah um but
I did pluck the part a little bit and
like I said before I did straighten this
week because it comes in a kinky texture
and it's really big when it's in its
natural state so I'll go ahead and stir
the clip just so you guys can see what
I'm talking about
I really feel like he came out really
nice I didn't do so good on the cut but
that's always fixable so I'm not really
worried about it but you can't really
tell that my cutting so worried but this
is the end results from what I did I
didn't bleach my knot you guys I do have
one like a brownish stocking cat and I
didn't add any powder into the part
because I felt like it looks really
natural how it is that part looks really
really good I did go ahead and use some
of the week baby haze just to like lay
it down to give it a more natural type
of appearance and I really think is nice
now if you think that you're gonna get
this week really straight I don't think
it's possible it might be possible but
for me I could not really get this week
really straight as I wanted it to it
still has like some texture in there and
I guess it's nice because it's more
believable oh yeah overall I really love
this wig it feels so great I haven't got
any tangle and even it when it was in
its kinky state I didn't get any
tangling from this wig but I have gotten
shedding so yeah the shedding is not
obsessive or anything like that so I
don't think shedding is anything to
worry about the wig is really nice and
stuff I didn't wash it I just
straightened it um so yeah I didn't feel
like I needed to wash it so but yeah
this is what it's looking like
so yeah bow
damn okay I did that with the cut y'all
I'm not even going by let me teach my
little horn a little bit like this cut
it looks good don't it y'all
it look good so yeah this is the way
it's looking like well I'm gonna turn
around I hope I don't embarrass myself
and the back be red but you know if
it is I don't really care so yeah let me
just turn around
so underneath I just have my six braids
or cornrows one straight back so yeah if
y'all want a video on how I wear my head
underneath just leave it in a comment
section and yeah but it's nothing
serious I had these brazen for forever
and today I literally just did them over
one by one
I didn't even wash my hair or anything
like that which I probably should wash
my hair but I don't really wash my head
often and I feel like it does me fine
like my hair still grows and everything
so yeah I guess I'm a dirty bit shiny
for these wigs so guys that's it for
this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in the
comment section down below if you're not
subscribed well here and hit that
subscribe button and yeah I'll see you
in my next video I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
