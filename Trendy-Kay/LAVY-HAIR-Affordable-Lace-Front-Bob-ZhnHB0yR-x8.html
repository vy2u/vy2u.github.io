review and this is going to be pretty
quick because I lost track of time but
anyway this is um a levy head company
review I was sent this week from levy
head company basically this is a
lace-front unit so with lace front units
you can only put them in the front
um towards the middle part like right
here is where you will get the most lace
as you start going down on the sides
that's when you'll get less low as far
as the weight construction is concerned
if you're not familiar with their lace
front units and they do offer you three
combs and that is two combs on the side
so one right here one right here and
they offer and they give you a comb in
the middle which I actually hate the
comb in the middle so I always cut that
one out so if you're not really a fan of
combs or that like one stupid comb in
the middle then you can cut it out is
pretty easy just like cut the thread and
it'll like unravel and come out they
also give you a comb in the back as well
and they give you adjustable straps now
for some reason what this unit is really
big or my head and yeah I think my
problem is I don't want to adjust the
straps too tight because this is a bulb
unit and when you start adjusting your
straps really tight it kind of messes up
the bulb cut that you have in the back
so it looks uneven so I try to just
adjust my strips and put both hooks in
the middle if you get what I'm saying I
don't know because it doesn't mess up
the cut of the weight but if you do have
a normal to larger size head oh my
goodness when I say this wig will fit
you so good you will love the hair feels
so nice and soft I have not received any
nor did I receive any shedding yet I did
not wash this unit I only curled it um
for time purposes but as far as the
density this density is pretty normal to
light it's not thick so yeah this is
like a more natural look if you're
looking for that type of looking now as
far as the curls and this week I did
take my flat iron and curl this unit so
the curls I met this week did not come
like this it did come straight and just
like a regular ball blood as far as my
head underneath of this unit my head is
braided back into a full braids and I do
not have any of my hair out um so yeah
let me get closer so you guys can see
this part and this is how long the part
is right here the part is longer when
you get towards the middle the part
actually stops back here but if you're
putting your hair on the side the part
is a little shorter like I said you'll
get less lay space as you go down and
yeah this is actually baby hair from
this unit this unit does come baby hair
I'm not really a fan of the baby hairs
on units because I just use my own but I
just wanted to try to see what it would
look like in things of that nature
and it actually turned out pretty okay I
probably would still prefer to pull out
my own baby hair but I just didn't want
to be bothered so I just used the baby
hair that came with this unit and I
actually think this turned out pretty
good I know a couple people asked me
about like the knots the knots being
bleaching stuff like that you would have
to bleach the knot yourself because the
nuts does not come bleach so you will
have to bleach the knots yourself I hope
I'm not missing nothing my battery is
going in so I have to kind of rush
through this video but overall like of
course you guys know that
like levy hey company and like this week
is so good if you didn't want to spend
that much money on a human hair bald wig
this could be another alternative that
you can take as far as purchasing this
way that is not um as expensive as the
last week that I review more thing this
wig is silky is not like a yucky texture
or anything like that I hope that this
wasn't too rushed and I didn't forget
anything so again this week is from
lamby hair company I will leave the
links and everything to this wig in my
description box so definitely check them
out if you're looking for a photobooth
hearing hair so you guys I hoped you
enjoyed this video and I will talk to
you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
