with another video of course and did
this video is going to be on this
gorgeous gorgeous hair that I have been
so so in love with you guys so this week
versus me from Lady hair company of
course if you guys do not know I love
Lady hair company because I didn't feel
like the quality of their ways are
really good and they are extremely
affordable for the qualities and she get
so yeah if you are not familiar with
Lenihan company go in my description box
and check out their link so I'll leave
all the links in my description box just
in case you guys want to check them out
I don't really know offhand what this is
I think it's Caribbean straight sorry my
eyelash is really getting on my nerves
y'all okay so I think this is Caribbean
Strait that I'm going to insert a clip
so you guys can see with the way it
looked like in its original safe
I absolutely love this color
you guys like I'm really feeling myself
I think that this color suits me well so
I want to insert some clips of just how
I got to this point right here it's not
going to be no tutorial anything like
that but it is just going to be like how
I got the head lightened and what color
I use to achieve this so what colors are
what colors I use to achieve this look
so yeah it's pretty simple are you guys
know tutorial but it is pretty simple if
you do know highlights to bleach the air
so if you guys follow me on snapchat I
asked you guys what color you think I
should die this week so thank you for
everybody who suggested some colors to
me so yeah I ended up choosing this
color and I actually died this hair
twice so yeah I'll just list all the
colors in the description box I didn't
use quite a few colors to achieve this
look so and as far as the style I just
took my um it would be good to show you
guys pull okay so I took my hot tool
professional little thing I think this
is one-inch you guys and this was in
something I think I already showed you
guys things but my sister got B to me um
so yeah he's getting really hot they go
up to 4:30
let me explain how I curl this head so
for the bank pushing our curls with this
but I put it inside the clamp and just
did it like the regular curl away if you
want to cuddle up alright so I did like
the bottom layer like that and then
throughout the wig I took it as if this
was like a one curl a long curl up and I
just took the head and wrapped it around
the Burrow and then and then I took my
flat iron and I just curled the front
and I also cut layers in the front just
so it can frame my face a little bit I
didn't go crazy what this is is of
course this time you guys cuz y'all know
I can go crazy with themselves and this
is the look that it came out with and
I'm happy with the look because I didn't
want my curls to be too uniform like all
like just looking too perfect I mean
they still kind of a little bit uniform
but not really um so yeah I absolutely
love the color I love the whole look
this color is so long and this is its
true color this is exactly it's kind of
like a fiery orange and then in the
light you kind of have like a pinkish
pit in certain light in certain lighting
which I really really love and then it's
not all one color
I feel like it's like a fiery orange up
here and then when you get to like them
back
it's kind of like a subtle reddish
orange type of color I don't know but it
absolutely looked really really good and
I am so proud of myself y'all I've never
been this happy about color because at
first when I had first dyed hair blonde
I was like oh my god like I fell in love
with the blonde I was like maybe I
shouldn't put a color over the top of it
because I like to blow so much like
maybe I should just rock it with the
blonde
but then I was laying now I want some
colors and journal I love my color but
yeah I think I'm happy with my decision
but the way to blonde turned out it
turned out really good like it was a
brandy or anything like that so the
question everybody has been waiting for
the answer to everybody question yes you
can bleach levy hair company weeks so I
don't think I ever bleached the levy
hair company wig and I know a lot of
people always actual how does the hair
react when it's bleached over this land
and this hair reacted so well you gotta
took the bleach so well within minutes
the head started to lighten like it was
really really good if you were thinking
about purchasing a way from lady hair or
you already had purchase away from there
and you are not sure on bleaching it or
you don't think it's going to turn out
good
you definitely cannot bleach this tell
you that it's gone okay so about this
hair after it's been bleached okay so of
course before the hair was bleached
everything like that the tail was
amazing and like I said if I didn't
already insert Clips I'll go ahead
insert clips of how the hair looks
originally it was just gorgeous now
originally the hair straight out the peg
and did not shed it oh I hadn't received
any penguins I'm in anything less and
he's tangling or anything like that
and I did I think I did snap as hell and
if I have any risk on videos or pictures
of me went ahead before I died it you
know a little Colie insert that and
somewhere in there too but yeah I
definitely was rocking this week so I
even cut the lace off I just put my
little cat one and yeah I thought I was
so cute and I got a lot of compliments
that day I'm on the head so yet and
still no tingling or no shine the whole
time I want the hair okay if you had
anything to background sorry on okay so
when I bleach the hair I'm like I said
the hair like you know instantly within
minutes the hair like in and I do and I
did leave the bleach one for about maybe
30 minutes I'm not about that leaving
the bleach on for on the hair for a long
time I just be so scared the head and
putting in damage but um it was
lightning to my liking so I just decided
to it was to bleach out now as I thought
it washing to bleach out I didn't notice
that the hair was shedding more than it
was before I bleached it so I don't know
if that's on my behalf or what I mean
the shutting is not bad only when I wash
the hair and every now and again like
I'll get a string which I just got a
strand now so so I do receive a few
strands here and there but it's not bad
but I am letting you know that as I
bleach is have I know this shuttle and
before Bish's had that was absolutely no
shot in with whoever and also as far as
um how do we feel it feels amazing and
as far as tangling it does snag a bit
back here but I will say that the hair
is still in very good very good
condition it is very flowy and yeah and
also I did these conditions this hair
oh yeah my man but I would recommend
that you go ahead in deep condition your
hair after it's been processed and stuff
like that so yeah it would be wise to
deep condition the hair at this then
bleach and stuff like that so yeah I am
going to lube it in deep conditioner
hair but for the most part y'all this
hair isn't live and when I say this hair
is lips this hair is literally lit it's
fire like for real so yeah you guys I
hope that answered all your questions I
am going to do a update video on this
hand now as far as how I had my hair
under here I had in two braids on each
side washer back and I had two stocking
canned corn just so it can lay flat and
also I did go in and bleach my pot but I
did it very lightly I meant bleach my
legs but I did it very lightly like
lightly that is not even really
noticeable a little bit so what I did
was I took my finishing powder and I
just added it to the parts I've been
really needing honestly but I felt like
so I forgot how long this wig is but I
think it's 22 inches or 20 inches but
it's very long this way it can't be cut
or you can just get it in a shorter
length but I definitely love the lip on
this right now I definitely think this
is like someone sexy summer has for real
you guys so yeah but this is what the
hand looks like in this place stopped on
me and I am five five so let me just
so as s is this video guys I hope to
enjoy and like I say I will do an update
video in about a month just to keep you
updated with how this hair is reaction
to the bleach and thing like that
