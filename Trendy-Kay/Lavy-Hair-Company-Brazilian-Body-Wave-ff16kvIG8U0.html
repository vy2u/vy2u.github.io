review so yeah I just got film uh uh I
just got finished filming another video
so that's why I have on the same shirt
you'll probably be saying is shirt a lot
because I wanted to film a lot of videos
today but I did change my lips because I
was just missing this color too much
like I love this color with me so anyway
I will be I'm reviewing this hair by a
lady had company I was sent this unit to
review so yeah I'm you already know that
I'm a fan of let me hey come paneer on
because they're just like so affordable
and the hair is good quality for the
price that you are paying yes this
company will be good for someone who is
like a beginner at when unison you don't
really want to spend a lot of money on a
unit they also offer you foolish units
as well as as well as lace-front units
given so this unit that I have one it is
um okay so if you're not familiar with
levee hair company your unit will come
in this like silk bag and I thought it
was so neat so yeah it will come in this
like so thick and the hand will be in
this and it will also be wrecked in the
net and it just says levee hair 100%
virgin hair and this is boomer this is
Brazilian version hair so I do have this
in Brazilian and it is the body wave
hair and I will insert a clip or pitches
of just what it looks like um when I
first received it
I did wash this unit and when I watched
it I'm the waves wasn't like it was when
I first received it they got a little
loose but I like I like the wave pattern
more it kind of remind you of this but I
did take my flat on and do this I'm type
of style to this unit but yeah it also
comes with two wig caps in the color
black so yeah I believe this unit is 20
all right I'm gonna say 22 inches
I think this unit is 22 inches I'm not
sure but I will leave all the details
about this unit in my description box as
well as links to their website and links
to this wig but I'm definitely feeling
this week so far I have not had any
issues with this unit and this is the
party space
I did not add any concealer or powder to
my part in space and you can impart this
anywhere you want to so yeah um oh the
only thing is I feel like and y'all know
my head is like extra miniature so for
this to be fit in like a little snug
it's kind of crazy to me
like I don't know how I would fit I
don't know if it's no because my straps
is adjusted when I didn't adjust my
straps it was big on my head but then
like when I just did my shrimps I don't
know if it's like still big or or like I
don't know it's kind of weird I don't
really know if this week it's fit my
head was not I mean it's on though but I
don't know it's just something about the
sides and that I'm just it doesn't feel
like my other unit but it's probably
just me y'all cause y'all know I'm a
little dreary but I love this unit so
much
not tangled on me like it has had a few
snags in there but like no like tangling
where you can't brush to it or comb
through it and again I did um I did wash
this unit and like it's doing good so
yeah now it does hold a curl very very
very very nice like I had these curls in
for at least a week and it still looks
the same so it do hold a curl I did then
I straighten it I did I also streamed if
I can when I straightened it is
straightened very nice and yeah I love
it straight but I think I love it with
these loose ways weeps and they're much
better because I feel like all my units
are like straight like I need them you
know start curling them and stuff like
that so that's why I did this to this
unit and I'm really really feeling it so
this is what it comes on me and I do
believe this is 22 inches but like I
said I will leave everything in the
description box
now else far as shedding um for this I
have not received any shedding and I
don't know if you familiar with my last
review I didn't want let me hand company
but I had like a kinky curly unit and
that one showed a little bit but only
because I think it's like it was that
like really curly type of texture this
one I have not received like any
shedding whatsoever from this unit so
that's always a good thing but yeah this
is all the hair to the back
this unit is like the density is it's
like a normal density where it's not too
thin but it's not like really really
thick so yeah overall I really really
love this hair
like what so yeah if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in the
comment section down below and I will
answer your questions and yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
