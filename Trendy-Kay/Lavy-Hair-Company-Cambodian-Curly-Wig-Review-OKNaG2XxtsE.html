for you guys and this is why the company
levy hair company and it is a hundred
percent version human hair so this is
what the packaging looks like and I did
post a picture on my Instagram page of
me when this hair probably a week or two
ago so yeah if you were curious to know
what hair that was it's this unit right
here so yeah let's get into this unit
okay so this company reached out to me
and let me tell you it was like heaven
like I was like oh my gosh when I went
on that site like their units are so
affordable it's crazy and the quality
that you're getting for the price that
you pay is unbelievable so let me start
off with how it was packaged and this is
what the wig came inside which i think
is really really nice and this is so
silky in soft so yeah the weight will
come inside of this little bag and it
will be wrapped up it will be wrapped up
and this big as well so yeah what I have
in my hair is the Cambodian virgin hair
and this is in 22 inches so this is what
it looks like and this is a full lace
unit and it has combs on each side and
it has a comb in the bag with the
adjustable straps now the good thing I
like about this company is that they
they offer the same type of hair but if
you want a lace front which is much whoa
which is much cheaper than the full lace
unit so they offer
you a for least unit any of you lace
front in the same exact unit so if you
don't want to pay more for a foolish
unit you can go to the lace front units
and it will be cheaper but it will be
the same hair same style everything just
if you don't want to pay as much for the
full lace so you can do like a step down
and again the foolish units are not
expensive at all they are very very very
affordable and I'm so happy that they
reached out to me because I probably
wouldn't never known about this site if
they didn't so when I received this unit
the Carol's were definitely more defined
and stuff like that so I am going to
insert a clip so you can see what the
wig looked like when I took it out of
the packaging so yeah I didn't really
like how those curls were it was just
way too tight for me so what I did was I
washed the unit and once I washed the
unit it looked like this um it was a bit
more settled and not as big but I did
take my vent brush and brush it out just
to make it a bit bigger as far as
tingling and shedding I do get shedding
from this unit but this is a pretty
curly curly unit so I can't expect
shedding from this unit but it doesn't
like shed really bad or anything like
that and as far as tingling like this
unit before I brush it out I can run my
fingers through it right now I really I
mean I can still run my fingers through
it but it's some snags or whatever but
for curly unit tingling is not bad at
all
I all
so cut a few layers in the front area
because I felt like it was just over
power in my face so yeah I definitely
cut some layers and I think I want to
cut some more layers in it but I don't
know I think I should just leave it
alone cuz I like it like this and again
this is a full lace unit so you can part
it any way you want to right now I have
my part in the middle I have water pot
on the side as well and it looks
absolutely it looks absolutely beautiful
both ways
any way you want to part it so yeah they
do give you lace from ear to ear of
course because this is a full cap unit
so this is what everything is looking
like and this is what the curl looks
like and it's absolutely gorgeous you
guys like it looks so natural the pardon
and everything like it looks like it's
coming out my freaking scalp
like that's how realistic this unit
looks so yeah I'm pretty pretty pleased
with this unit um I really don't have no
complaints so if you guys are interested
in this unit and purchasing this unit I
will definitely leave everything in my
description box and links to this hair
as well as the website and if you have
any questions about this unit feel free
to leave it in my comment section and
