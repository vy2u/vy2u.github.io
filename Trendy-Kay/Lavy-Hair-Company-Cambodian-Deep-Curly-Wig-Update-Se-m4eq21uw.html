levee hair company um hair this is the
what is this this is the deep curly um
Cambodian hair it is a full lace unit so
I'll make sure I put all the specs in my
description box as well as links to the
website and also I'll put a link to my
video on my review I did on this unit as
well so usually I don't really do
updates on my units but I felt this dog
was a need for me to do an update on
this unit only because um I really think
that that they are affordable and I also
just like want you guys to see that this
is some really good hair and I don't
really wear my wigs that often but I
have one this wig around five times
total so yeah I think that I could give
you a you know good update now actually
this video is going to be pretty quick
because I feel like I don't really have
any complaints about this unit the only
thing I would say um is that this unit
 it doesn't like really bad but
it does shed but I think that's with any
type of hair that you get of course
you're going to get shedding as well as
your own natural hair shed so and
especially when it comes to curly units
like this they are bound to shed so yeah
you're going to get shuttered so I have
got shedding from this unit I have not
received tangles this is a curly unit
but as you can see like I can my fingers
go through this unit with no type of
resistance or anything it just it just
glides through the hair which I really
really like that now this unit does
get bigger so if you do like big curly
hair um if you finger comb or just brush
this unit out it does get really big um
I like it the size that it is now
because it fits my face um when I first
originally did a review on this unit I
did have a middle part but I switched it
up and moved it to a side part because I
felt like it looked better so this is
what the parting space looks like and
like I said you can part this anywhere
because it is a four inch unit now as
far as maintenance is concerned I'm the
only thing that I do to this unit is I
take water and I put it in a spray
bottle and I also mix it with
conditioner and I just spray it all on
ahead and let it dry sometimes if I
wanted to dry faster I use my diffuser
or blow dryer but besides that that's
all I do and it basically like manages
the hair um and yeah it just makes it
soft and it just basically revives the
hair so that's what I do I don't put any
extra product and a hair I just use
water and I use conditioner and that's
it if you want to know what conditioner
I use I use the Aussie conditioner I
think it's like Ozzy moist it comes in
like a purple bottle so yeah I use that
for this hair so I know you guys are
curious to see if this hair can um can
straighten because I know some people
like to straighten their curly units me
I'm not really a fan of straightening my
curly units but I know people as a lot
of people out there that do because they
want that versatility so I am going to
insert a clip and show you how this hair
takes heat and see if the hair
straightens and see if the hair reverts
back to its natural state otherwise our
fowleri oven okay okay
so often
our uncle stroke hello uncle ferrus
don't know sir
hello about sophomore class
all right
often laugh a lot
I love a person so here is the hair and
it went right back to its natural state
so just in case just in case like you
want to straighten this unit you
definitely can do so and when you wet it
it will go back to the way it originally
so I'm sorry this is quick but I really
really really love this unit I really
like I said I don't have any complaints
about this unit but if it's something I
left out be sure to leave it in the
comment section and I will try to answer
your questions about this unit so yeah
let me step up closer you guys can see
the curl pattern and it's just like
overall a really really really like
gorgeous unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
