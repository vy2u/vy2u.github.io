I'm the man no no like letter speak I
mean where have you been hey guys I'm
back with another video I missed you
guys so much
so yet anyway this wig was into me from
sista week so I'm a Charlie all Sicilies
links in the description box just in
case any of you guys are interested in
this week and for any of you who are
interested in my lip color I'll leave it
in the description box because I don't
know off the top of my head so anyway
they sent me the outre quickly so this
is the half a wig and it's in a style
penny 26 and I have in a dr 30 okay so
basically penny is so popular here on
YouTube so everybody just by looking at
it should know that this is penny
because the curls on this one you can
just tell her curls be copying if you're
not familiar with the penny wait okay
they came out with just a straight-up
half wit named penny and basically it's
just a shorter version of this and that
was sold out in the other 30 like these
wig always sell out really quick in this
specific color so if you do like this
week you better have won it so yeah both
of them look identical they look exactly
the same like I said one is just shorter
and that one is called penny and this
one is penny 26 so they just made it
longer now by looking at it it doesn't
look like 26 inches dug because it's
curly but actually if you stretch it it
is really long like if you were to
straighten this week it will be super
long so it definitely is 26 inches
stretched and I'm five five and this is
where the wig stops on me and also this
is curling
I think so if you did want to put heat
on this way you could but fool want to
put a heat on this gorgeous gorgeous
weight so yeah so with the Hathaways
you're basically just leaving some of
your hair out in the front it depends
you can leave a little bit of your hair
like I did or you can leave a lot it's
up to you
nothing okay okay so this week comes
with just a comb in the front it's like
a long comb in the front and it comes
with a comb in the bag and it also comes
with adjustable strength now as far as
how the weeks it's if it's good but I
feel like if you have a bigger size head
or a smaller size head it really doesn't
matter it all depends on how much hair
you want to leave out if you wanted to
wait as a full cap unit you probably
wouldn't be able to do that but then I
have a smaller size here it's easier for
me to it as a full cap unit even though
I'm not win it as a full cap unit but it
is big enough for me to you know pull it
up more if I wanted to win like that but
because oh these curls are a little bit
loose and you can see the band I
definitely would prefer you leaving some
of your hair out just to blend it so
yeah this is what the curls was like and
this is what the way it looked like when
I first got it out it and do anything to
it I wanted it to be a little bit fuller
in the root area so I just took my hand
and like singer comb the root area but
that was basically it
this color is like really really pretty
I definitely love this look for the
summer so this is all the hair too
this is all the hair to the front and it
is a full it is um it is kind of full I
feel like up and like the root in the
back right here it could be a little bit
fuller but you can't see any tricks or
anything so I'm not complaining but like
the bottom part where the curls are of
really full and is lightweight so it's
not that hot but I wouldn't wear this
one like a really hot day because I'm
pretty sure this will be just too much
and for really hot day but look at that
y'all so I did cut on some hair in the
front just so it wouldn't be like in my
eyes I cover my eyes I do feel like I
need to go back and cut some more off
because I wanted like towards my face
but I don't want it to be like covering
my eyes of the difference and so I
always usually just cut a little bit off
so I can feel more comfortable but yeah
I would recommend when this wig starts
to get old and kind of like reading on
the bottom you can always cut it and you
can always cut some of the is all just
for like a different look and I think
that the wig will last even longer once
you do that so yeah it's kind of hard
Linda and your hair with half wig when
it's not you text your hair so yeah my
hair is struggling trying to blend with
this because my hair is curly isn't it
it's kind of close to it but not really
I had more of a curl and if my head is
more look like the bottom and the top is
kind of like a loose curl and then the
bottom is more curly in this car as you
doing saying and it's far as the dump
route on hair the dumper is actually all
the way through so I know most of you
guys are going to appreciate that
because I definitely can appreciate when
they put the duct root all the way
through the head it just makes it look
more realistic especially if you want it
to pin this so I'm going to turn around
real quick so you guys can see you know
to wake all the way around
there's a lot of things that you can do
and a lot of sounds that you can achieve
with this wig but I love it like this
like this wig is so gorgeous now I'm
this is a Conda kind of like a little
bit reminds me of Dominican curly
halfway but the it's not as full like
I'm pretty sure if it was if they add
more trick to like the middle part like
right here it will be just as full as
Dominican curly but it's like it's close
its neck and neck but not really if you
give them ten so if you like Dominican
curly but there was too much hand to you
definitely try this one so again guys
this is penny from us
sister wigs and I will link all the
links in my description box just in case
and if you guys are interested in this
week also um I thought I was going to
say escape but I did it but um yeah if
you have any questions feel free to
leave it in my comment section down
below I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
