hey guys it's Kay and I'm back with
another video and this video is going to
be on this way so I received this week
from Deva trust and I wish all the
information and the description box just
in case any of you guys are interested
in this week so the week that I'm when
is by Bobby bus and it's in the style
Juba and I have it in the color 4 so
this is what the picture it looks like
okay so I got this week in a color
number two which I'm wearing right now
and I also got it in the color and I
mean I and the blue so yeah I'm going to
show you the construction of the blue
one just because I don't feel like
taking off this wig and it's just right
here so I can show you guys what it
looks like fresh out the pack and I did
not do anything to the wig that I have
my hair the only thing I did to the way
it was plus apart so this is the way the
wig looks when you first get it and it
is a Yankee texture it's also big hit
friendly alright I would suggest you it
and bobby pins to the side and adjust to
the size of the week and adjusting your
stripes if you have a smaller size head
so yeah but um yeah so it does come with
this with lace and this is the part and
it's optional if you want to go in and
pluck the part or you can just add some
concealer or finishing powder but I did
pluck my part just to give it a more
natural feel but you don't have to if
you don't want to so the way it comes
with wait a minute I actually thought
that this way it came with home and it
didn't because I was low-key made
because I normally use the comb in a
bank but I don't use the combs and a
front so I just assumed that it just
didn't have a comb in the back and a
head comes in the front but actually
this wig does not have any combs so if
you are a fan of coins I don't know what
to tell you you can always use bobby
pins and it
security week down but it definitely
does not have any combs and it is the
material right here is very soft so I
guess it would be like soft when your
edges so yeah but this is what the
inside looks like
I promise you guys I have not been
sleeping on this week as soon as I saw
the picture for this week like when a
stock car I knew that I had to have this
week because for some reason like am I
so I just knew that this week was gonna
be bombed and then I just started seeing
a lot of reviews on this week and I'm
like oh my gosh I was just itching even
more to head this week but the wig is
always sold out
in the natural colors like the one 1b
and twos so this is a number four I
don't know why I nobody likes the number
four but honestly the number four to me
kind of looks like a number two just a
tad bit lighter but it looks really good
so I just ended up going with the number
four I was praying that it wouldn't be
like a really light brown which is
actually not it's more of a dump Brown
which I really love
so yeah and I wanted this big in color
of course cause y'all know I do my color
so I decided to get it and blue because
I felt like it just looked really bummed
when a mannequin I meant one time on a
girl one uh wanna call it but actually
this blue it looks it looks lights like
in the camera but actually it's more
subtle than what it's showing so I guess
in a light it would be this right but
like if you was just and like a normal
setting I feel like it's I feel like the
blue is settled it's not really like out
there and like she was to go in like
some kind of sunlight or something like
that but I definitely love the texture
on his head is not too Yankee wears just
like overly Yankee way
can't stand it and it's not a silky
either it's just like the right amount
of Yankee nuts and also they give you a
lot of head they was not extended with
this head whatsoever
so yeah this head is pretty thick and is
a little bit on the hot side so
depending on where you live it was still
a little hot in your area that I
wouldn't suggest when this week I don't
know it it don't really bother me
they're bad but I can feel like if I was
in heat I would probably be bothered
because it is a little high you doing
same but you know fall is approaching
and this would be a good wig for the
fall you guys this wig is late I really
really like this video I'm not even
gonna lie but um yeah I definitely feel
like this is gonna be my little too weak
for sure yes I'm really loving this week
though for the blue one is not really
shiny as well it's coming up shiny on
the camera but actually it's not really
shiny is more of a natural shine and
that's the same thing as far as this wig
goes to it's more of a natural shine
than anything but this wig is not shiny
whatsoever so this week does have light
shedding is not bad at all
it doesn't like continuously shed but
after I cut off the least it did shed a
bit and as I was combing it and kind of
sheds like when I combed my hands
through a little bit but for the most
part I think all the shedding is pretty
much done so I don't know I feel like
it's light shedding but it's not bad at
all and as far as like tingling no
tingling we get in at the park and the
wig gets older I feel like you're gonna
have to worry about the stiffness like
right now I feel like it's a lot of body
within this wig but y'all know how I
want a wig starts to get all it starts
to get made stiff like it like it
doesn't move um so I feel like that's
the only thing that you might have to
worry about when the wave starts to get
old but I do feel like this week we'll
lash
you a long time and even like if the end
stuck getting crazy you always can cut
it up to a shorter book now this week is
the middle cut if you wanted it to wait
on the side I do not think it will look
great as a side part because of course
one side is going to be long and other
side is going to be short but I mean if
you really want to wear this week on the
side you can always cut it to make it
even but I feel like you should just
leave it alone especially for my boos
that love the view quiet you would
definitely love love love this week
because y'all know I love my middle
parts so gotta know I'm all for the
bulbs and like I have to Dibble and
dabble and try different kinds of bugs
and I feel like this book is just ship
hopping like this book is the issue so
like I said I'm gonna stop talking you
guys to death but if you are interested
in this week make sure to check my
description box so you can get the links
to this wig if you want to purchase it
and if you have not already instant my
giveaway it's the last video I posted
before this video go into the giveaway
and I just want to say that I love you
welcome to all my new subscribers and
for all my old boos they've been
sticking around with me I love you so
much and I just want you to know that
charges to keep me motivated and I've
been checking y'all on Instagram and I
have not come across one ugly person I'm
proud of me to say that but everybody is
just so beautiful like I be low-key
stalking me off her like tonight points
this person I gotta see this person and
y'all are freaking gorgeous like
everything one of y'all is just like
it's okay but I love you guys and I will
see you in my next video if you wonder
around what's on my lips it is chilly
ciao of course I've been really loving
this lip color and especially for the
fall I think this is gonna be like my
go-to lip color and I also I'm painted
with a brown lip liner and that's just
making it a little bit more darker so I
definitely love this combo but if you
guys are looking for this color I think
they discontinued it from colour-pop if
you guys can find it let me know because
I'm running low but if they discontinued
it I'm literally gonna cry because this
has to be like my favorite color right
now so yeah if you know let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
