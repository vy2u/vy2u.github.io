with another video yes
so this week was sent to me from
Missouri Hollywood and they sent me
their sister wig sassy lively spirit I
guess that's like the collection so I
have it in a style a sassy H Mimi and I
have it in the color or Oh Twilight and
this is what the picture looks like so
yeah this is not like a new week that
just came out but it is fairly new like
I haven't been out that long so yeah
this is what it looks like and I'm not
sure what color tomorrow is when it
doesn't say let's see oh the model in
this picture is when some artsy blush
which is like a pink color which I
really like this color so yeah this is
what this is what the week looks like so
before I get into my thoughts on this
week let me just break down a
construction so basically this is just a
lace part it doesn't give you any lace
to cut off so if you're a person that
doesn't like to cut off the lace here
you go sis so you don't have to cut off
any lace it just gives you the lace part
in space which I'm not really a fan of
the lace pardon so most of you guys know
that I'm not a fan of the lace part in
like I like my wigs come with lace to
cut off just because this part wrong
side just because this part like up in
the front is more flatter so so yeah
when a part does not come with lace the
cut off it is a little bit thick up in a
hair line like right here and a
beginning
so yeah just keep in mind that it is
it's not as flat as you cutting off the
lace if that makes any sense
but yeah it comes with a lace
which isn't too bad the part is on the
left-hand side which I'm used to the
part being on the right-hand side but
then again this part didn't even come
y'all I'm trippin okay so the part does
come in a middle but I shifted it over
to the left side now if you like your
parts on the side you can even ship it
to the left side or you can or you can
ship it to the right side me I like the
weight and look on the left so that's
why I shift the part this way I did not
like the way this week look in the
middle I don't know what something about
it that was just throwing me off but
anyway this week does come with two
combs one right here and another right
here it also comes with a comb and a bed
and it comes with adjustable straps
now this wig is became friendly so if
you have a bigger size head you'll
definitely love this week because it is
really nice and roomy if you have a
smaller sized head like me just go ahead
and adjust your straps and you should be
fine but yeah like I said this is the
whole Twilight color and I love the
color you're the color is really really
nice now as far as the texture I feel
like it's more on the silky side then
being Yankee it could be like a light
like light Yankee but I feel like it's
more on the soupy side than anything as
far as China is just at a bit shiny but
if you don't want to do nothing to dull
down or shine you really don't have to
because it's not necessary it's like
it's not overly shiny or anything like
that now I will say I love the curls the
curls look like kind of like Roller set
type of curls which I really do love
this wig was very hard to work with not
because I don't know like the curls are
in sync or whatever they they they the
curls are nice when they come out and
basically all I did to achieve this look
was just brush it with my vent brush but
I had to play with it I was playing with
this wig for such
a long time and I also feel like the
curls when you style it they kind of
like four they don't state how you want
it to be so yeah that was another thing
so I did go ahead and spray this week
with spritz just to make the style
stayed like how I want it and then it
was fine so yeah keep that in mind you
guys but yeah this is what the color
looks like and it's this nice purplish
blue type of color so yeah also tingling
shudder I have not received any tingling
nor that I received any shedding from
this week so that's a good thing and
it's a pretty sure week so I'm sure that
this week will last you longer versus
having a longer wig but um oh and
another thing I did I keep on thinking
the parts on the side I'm I did go in
and pluck the part a little bit in the
front so yeah that's what it looks like
and I just edit my finishing powder to
the part I didn't pluck the part going
all the way back BIC I just plucked it
like right here just to open it up a
little bit
so yeah that's pretty much it for this
way you guys this is a pretty quick
every day type of week and it does come
in a variety of colors just in case
you're into like colors they have a wide
range of colors to select from so yeah
and even still I think that this would
look bomb in a natural color but this is
definitely not my favorite it's the okay
week but it's definitely not my favorite
I just feel like you have to really work
with this we can order food so look
right or maybe it was just me um I don't
feel like anything was wrong with the
curls I just felt like the style maybe
it was the lip
I don't know cuz I actually like wigs
that's like this and left but I don't
know maybe I was just having it off the
hay but I don't know it's just something
about this wig that throws me off but as
far as the color and everything like
that like I definitely love this color
for sure so yeah this is what the wig
looks like if you are interested in
purchasing this wig I'll go ahead and
leave all the links in the description
box just in case the interview guys are
