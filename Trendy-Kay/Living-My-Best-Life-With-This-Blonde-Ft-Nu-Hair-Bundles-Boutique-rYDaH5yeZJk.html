get the couple drop that fresh I need a
cop-caller something we do up on the
pattern us panel Doc's planning letting
go by me and fussing like a
Megan about it another video so my
background is different it's kind of
like heck my old background has my new
background yeah I didn't feel like being
booked with the background day but it's
like push to the side a little bit so
don't even mind it so yeah anyway I'm
back with another video sorry I do have
kids downstairs so I apologize if you
hear any noise but we must continue so
yeah this video is gonna bring on some
bundle hair I was saying fry my new hair
bundle boutique and I'll go ahead and
leave all the links in the description
box just in case anybody is interested
okay so let's just hop straight into the
video so they said me dude I mean okay
so they send me three bundles in a
frontal the bundles were 24 22 20 with a
20 or 18 inch frontal I'm not sure but
all the details will be in the
description box so so basically this is
their six thirteen body wave I'm not
sure the origin but like I said
everything will be in my description box
so yeah this was a body wave of course I
went away straight actually after I
washed everything the wave pattern when
it was really a nice which is just like
much looser than a body wave is just
like a loose wave which I think all body
hair all body wave hair when you wash it
it turns into like a loose wave so yeah
that's basically what it looked like and
I will insert what it looked like
compared to straights and you know the
natural texture
okay so before I get started if you
follow me on Instagram then you've seen
a wig that looks similar to this the
color is like basically the same only
difference is with this wig I added duck
root I felt like I wanted something the
same as that way because I miss it so
much
but yeah I did wind up something that
way shipping was actually pretty quick I
believe I can't really remember the
exact like time it took to get to me but
it didn't take really long also the
pathogen like the shipping bag was
really really cute
I definitely love how the like how each
individual bundle was packaged I think
that it was packaged really Wow and just
like nice and sturdy so I do appreciate
that and so when I first received the
head of course I ran my fingers soon and
everything like that I didn't receive
any shut-in from out of the bundles but
I know one particular bundle I didn't
receive some snags it wasn't like major
tangle in but it was just a little snag
Lea if that's even a word but I just
made it up so yeah it was a little snag
Lea so yeah I went ahead and decided to
make my wig so I made my week first
using a mesh like not mesh dome kit but
like it has like adjustable straps on it
I use it for all my wig making so yeah
um I basically use that I wanna head
made the wig turn it it up so I didn't
make the wig first before I call it the
hair I know some people like to color
the hair and then make the wig but I did
the opposite so yeah let me get
the colors I use and I wouldn't say that
I like colored this hair I mean I did
color
I basically toned it and then call it
dyed the roots so okay so the color I
used to the brand in the color I use to
tone this hair is the weather by color
charm and it's basically a toner it
looks like this I don't know if you can
really see it that well but I have it in
the color t18 now I did use T 14 which
is a more like a sheer blind is almost
like a great color like if you leave it
on long enough and a turn ahead gray so
yeah I mixed the T 14 and the T 18 why
didn't mix them together I just put them
on like different layers of the hair
kind of because I wanted the hair to be
like two-toned I didn't really wanted to
be flattened to coat like one color even
though I mean in camera it looks like
one color but in person actually you can
kind of see the different tones so yeah
this is what I use to tone the hair and
you just want to leave the tone or until
you get the desired color that you want
and then for the roots now the roots was
difficult for me you guys it's not my
first time at dye roots but if this is
your first time dying roots like a
darker color
be very careful not to get it on the
lace and stuff is really tedious
so yeah just be extra careful when
you're
adendorff roots to your wig because you
do not want that died to get released it
will ruin it so I did use the Clara
professional and this is in medium
neutral blood and in seven in 87 and
whatever that is but I imagine you can I
see this but yeah so this is what I use
I don't have the other box of the t14
because I made a mistake and threw it in
the trash so yeah that's basically
what I did to achieve at this color and
I did dye the head before I I did tone
the head before I had it the duct root
so yeah and this is what it looks like
and I didn't like put DUP root on the
whole wig I just did it on my frontal
and I actually feel like it could have
been I actually feel like it could have
blended better like I could have like
blended the top better but it's not
really noticeable you can't really said
that well but yeah overall I think I did
a pretty good job
once I washed her hair and stuff like
that I did receive some shut him it
wasn't like OD shedding of course and I
didn't get tangles out of the hair so I
was a little worried because I did get a
few snakes I don't want bundle but
actually I didn't receive any tingling
or anything like that
after I toned the hair and washed it and
everything like that so yeah I gotta say
I did get a free strands of shedding but
it wasn't nothing like Masia or to worry
about and yeah that's basically it now
we're in a week I do still get a little
bit of shedding but it's not bad but it
does and I also get like tangling
up in the nape area a little bit which
is not a big deal to me because I feel
like most wigs or hair I'm so out of
breath I feel like the most hair or
weights tingle like in the nape area I
feel like it's inevitable like it's just
that's just the way it is it's just
gonna be like that I don't know it was
because like your neck I don't know or
like your clothes or something I don't
know so yeah I'm just going to show you
I'm just going to show you all the hair
towards the front like I said this is 24
inches and this is where 24 inches stops
me see that again
that's where 24 inches stops on me I
just want you to know like I'm living my
best life with this hill okay like this
hair it's freaking every day and that's
why I had to film standing up because I
wanna join a CD like all of this
goodness just coming your way coming
yeah guys I really don't have too much
to say about this hair I actually really
loved this hat if I'm looking on the
side this is the only place like I can
really look to see myself so yeah if I
