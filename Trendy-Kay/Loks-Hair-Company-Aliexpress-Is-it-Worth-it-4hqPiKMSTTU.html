and this time it's gonna be a little
different because this is not like my
normal synthetic wig review this is
basically gonna be like a hair review on
human you know this is the version
Brazilian straight hair I received this
hair from a company called locs hair
company and basically they just have
different kinds of virgin hair you can
purchase their hair off of Aliexpress
and they also do have a website if you
guys cuz I know some of you guys don't
really like Aliexpress in ordering
things off of there so they do provide
you another website where you can go and
purchase your head through there if you
don't want to purchase your hair through
Aliexpress so yes you guys I was sent
this hair but that does not mean that
I'm not going to give you my honest
opinion on this hair the lengths for
this hair company definitely will be in
my description by interested in this
hair then feel free to look in the
description box and I'll have all the
information listed below so I definitely
know that it's some girls out there or
guys who do not really like synthetic
hair so this video is definitely for you
and I know it's a lot of people out
there
where's the version hair so this video
is for you I am going to start
introducing more things to my channel
and human hair version had been one of
them so yeah but still at a affordable
price because I just like bargains and I
feel like I just want to find you guys
something that's affordable
so this hair is definitely affordable
and I'm gonna tell you all the specs on
this hair so I'm gonna definitely keep
you guys in the loop as far as what
companies are good and affordable so if
you are interested in seeing this wig
and this hair then stay tuned okay so I
am wearing three bundles and a closure
the bundle lamps are twenty two twenty
two twenty and I do have a sixteen inch
lace closure and I'm going to insert a
clip right now of me show you how the
hair was when I took it out the package
Oh
okay you guys so so far so good with
this hair I have absolutely no
complaints when it comes to this well
one complaint the only complaint I have
is that the ends are a little thin for
my liking and no to complaints that you
probably I mean my wig is semi full is
not to its fullest I think if I had four
bundles in a closure it would definitely
be more thicker and nice but this is
like a natural thickness it's not too
thin and it's not too thick so you
definitely you definitely can get away
with wearing three bundles but um four
bundles would definitely give you the
thickness if you like really thick full
hair yeah like I was saying so far so
good you guys I've been wearing this
hair for round two days straight now
yesterday I installed this hair and I'm
wearing it today yesterday I did with
his hair literally all day I went to the
playground with my son like I was
sweating and all I ran errands like I
did a whole bunch of stuff with this
hair in a 90 degree weather and this
hair has not tangled
yet like I get no tangles with this head
at all and it haven't even shut it and I
did shut it and haven't even shed and I
did cut my wife's so I have not received
any type of Shannon Shannon I have not
received any type of shedding or
tangling from this unit yet it's only
been two days you guys so I would
definitely keep you updated with this
hair but if you are looking for virgin
hair I think this is definitely some
affordable hair so yeah like I said I
will be introducing more human hair to
my channel and I do have some other
companies I want to share with you but
for the price for this hair I definitely
definitely think it's worth it right as
of right now I really think it's worth
it it has a nice shine to this unit and
I did make a wig out of this hair so if
you guys um want to see how I make my
units just thumbs up this video or leave
a comment down below and yeah if you
guys have any questions or want anything
feel free to leave it in the comment box
down below but let me just give you a
quick look at this hair and again this
is the Brazilian straight hair and I
have it in 22 22 20 and a 16 inch
closure I did not cut this week at all
um yeah I'm pretty sure you're curious
to know how this head curls and it curls
amazingly it keeps a curl yeah so this
is what this is what my closure looks
like and I think it's late pretty good
and I just want to show you the length
on this bad boy
I should have wore a different color
shirt but
it's definitely 22 inches it's as far as
the lymph assign is definitely accurate
okay you guys so for my synthetic girls
out there and guys don't for a split
second think that I'm not gonna be doing
a synthetic wig reviews anymore that's
not the case you guys all know that
synthetic wigs is like my first love
so that will never change I'm just you
know I just want to put more of a
variety on my channel so yeah but there
will be lots more synthetic units and
wig reviews and all that type of stuff
coming up I am gonna start doing makeup
tutorials for you guys out there so just
be patient with me because I'm kind of
slow when it comes to things like that
so yeah but I did not forget about you
because I know I've been getting a lot
of requests for me to show you guys how
I do my makeup and yeah I'm gonna have
just a lot more of varieties on my
channel if you guys have any suggestions
just leave it in the comment box down
below but um I hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will talk to you guys
soon bye okay and if you guys are
wondering what's on my lips you guys if
I don't respond to the comments that you
leave about asking me what's on my lips
it's probably because I either forgot
and normally I try to put it in my
description box but I always forget but
I mix my lipsticks up so much that I
don't even sometimes remember what's on
my lips because I never really use a
just one color of lipstick I normally
like use a lip pencil as lipsticks or
just mixed colors up until I find
a color that I like so yeah maybe I
should just start telling you guys
what's on my lips in the video so it
could be much easier but yeah um so yeah
if you're interested in the color on my
lips this is the wet mouth lip pencil
and it's in the color violet purple so
yeah this is what it looks like right
here and I have this on my lips all over
my lips with a brown dark brown lip
pencil again all over my lips and then I
really didn't like the color that much
it was too purplish for me and I wanted
to go a little bit darker so what I did
was I put this lipstick all over my lips
and it is a matte lipstick by Absolut
New York so yeah this is what it looks
like and I'm not even sure that they
have the color one here let me see
it's called Bulgarian rose so yeah this
is what it looks like yeah it was kind
of hard trying to find it what was the
name of it but yeah it's just like a red
color like a deep red color and I just
put it all over my lips and that's what
it looks like so yeah you guys I just
felt like people wanted to know so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
