back with another video
do I sound excited because you're I'm so
pumped for this week so this is the week
that I'm gonna be talking about or
whatever so yet this week was sent to me
from of course
Zuri Hollywood and they sent me the sis
sister wig in a style Ivan and I haven't
intercept in a color song party fiesta
y'all I'm so freaking pumped like this
color is legit it yo I love this color
oMG like look at look at this look at it
their colors never let me down I'm sorry
it first before I even start off of
course this color is not gonna be for
everybody everybody is just not into
color the way I'm into color but some
people are so if you are and you like
this color go and purchase it because
you won't love it and if not just look
past the color and look at the style
because they do offer this week and
natural colors so yeah the style of this
is just beautiful I love everything
about this freaking week I love the
thickness I love the length I love the
style I love the colors even down to the
color selections choosing from different
colors they offer you a range of colors
which I absolutely love this is what it
looks like so I actually think that this
hair looks exactly like the model which
I even purchased this week on my own
before they even sent me the wig so yeah
most of the ways that
sinem er already have but it's no biggie
I actually purchased this in two colors
before they sent it to me which was this
color right here because I hate your
know I love my color so I had to try
this color out and I also got natural
color because I felt like it would just
look good in a color number two so this
is what the week will come in and this
is the same color this is the Fiesta
color so I'm going to go ahead and try
it on so you guys can see what it looks
like it's straight out of the pack but
before I get into that let me talk about
construction and I'll just show you what
this looks like but can we just talk
about this color like what I tell you
that this company is really on point
with the color system I don't know what
they would have been talking to but it's
definitely the bomb oh I'm taking it out
already so this is what sorry this is
what this looks like in this country and
this color is really good so basically
the roots is like a range red type of
color it actually matches my nails so
yeah it's kind of like it's not like
it's red but it has like a French tint
to it and then it gradually goes into
this nice peach color which is so
vibrant like it's really nice
so anyway of course it comes with all
the stuff that comes inside of it this
week
it's also big head friendly so keep that
in mind just in case you have a bigger
size here it is stretchable this is what
the party looks like and it's a pretty
natural it is a pretty natural cut I
didn't have to do too much plucking with
this power only plucked it in the front
area and then I left the rest alone and
just add it my finishing powder but you
can go in and pluck it if you want to if
not just add your concealer we'll
finishing powder to it and you should be
fine so it also comes with two combs by
your temple area one right here
right here it comes with a comb in the
back and it also comes with adjustable
straps and these are what the current
 I'm sorry and these are what
the curls look like which are so nice
job look at that and this is a Yankee
texture the wig is nice and full it's
not then it all is very thick hair and
it's very soulful fancy not really only
when a shiny side is dull looking which
makes it look so much more natural so
yeah that's what the wig looks like now
as far as tangling and Shannon I have
gotten a lot of shedding from this hair
but actually when I ran my fingers
through this one I haven't got as much
shut it out of this one then I have with
this one so it might just all depends on
the week that you have but yeah I
haven't got a lot of out of this
one I have got some shutting but it's
not as much as I have with this one as
far as tinglin I do not get any tingling
out of this hair and this wig is pretty
short so I feel like you're not really
gonna have to worry about too much
tingling now it is full and thick hair
so I'm pretty sure as I get older it
will start to tangle just a little bit
but I'm pretty sure like this wig will
last you some time it is a round I'm
gonna say like 10 inches yeah it's
definitely like 10 inches it's not long
whatsoever so I'm gonna go ahead and try
the natural color which I have it in the
color too
imma try that color one enough just
because I'm pretty sure y'all don't want
to see me try to have a color one
because
the same color as this so I'm going to
show you guys what it looks like in the
darker color and how it looks on when
you first get it out of the pack clear
and a construction is the exactly the
same so I don't have to show you all
today but just take this off
you
all right sorry definitely wasn't
recorded when I was brushing it out but
yeah this is one side brushed and then I
just take my vent brush and literally I
just freaking brush it and then I kind
of like finger comb the rest and if I
have to I'll take it and like brush it a
little bit just so you can equate in
your and this is exactly what I did to
the other one but yeah this is
definitely like everyday type of week
especially with this color so that's it
for this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below
I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
