another wig review and I'm going to be
reviewing this week that I have on my
head which actually I really do love so
I purchased this wig from hair stop and
shop hair stop and shop I think that's
what it's called
that's my first time ordering from them
but yeah I really wanted this wig and
that was the only place that headed at a
reasonable price so yeah I had the
mermaid too and it's by Isis the red
carpet premiere collection and I had
this in a OM till so I did want this
color but I don't think they had it
because I really wanted to try a blue
because I think I tried like I had a wig
that was this color why I still have it
but um yeah it was a little more it was
turquoise and this one is to that I felt
like they kind of like the same color if
you ask me but so on to this way you
guys okay so this week has two combs in
the front and a comb in the back with
the adjustable straps now this week fits
really good if it's perfect I have the
shrimp's adjust it to as tightest this
way it is not going anywhere at all this
is a Yankee texture unit which I really
love it's not like over-the-top Yankee
but it's just like it gives you that
real hair type of feeling I hate this
later like come on
everything is on point about this week
like the ombre is on point and it just
gives you like a duck over up here into
this tail color into this like grey type
of faded teal color
this unit does
come with a lace pardon in the lace in
the front from ear to ear
now this lace part is not good like
that's the only con that I have about
this unit it's the fact that when you
receive the unit it's no part at all
like you have to really pluck a lot of
hair out in order to get the part of how
you want it now I did pluck some hair
out I'm not done I just today I'm just
not in the mood to be plucking out
nobody's part so yeah eventually I will
pluck out the part but I tried in yeah I
didn't feel like doing it anymore so
yeah this is my part right now how it's
looking it's not perfect the way I want
it to be but definitely I'm going to go
back and put out some more hairs but so
as far as the shedding entangling I'm in
this unit I do not get any tingling at
all not right now I'm pretty sure this
wig will start to tangle but right now I
don't get any tangles I get a few
strands here and there like right now
but I really honestly think that's from
cutting the lace off the front but I'm
like so in love with this unit I didn't
think that how the ombre is I didn't
think it was gonna be like that I
thought it was just gonna be kind of
like don't you know how they stick you
with that one color underneath and they
don't give you like an ombre effect but
this actually gives you an arm graphic
all the way through which I really
really appreciate that because I don't
like when it's just the one color
underneath it looks fake to me so I
would say this unit is probably around
18 inches yeah yeah this wig is not
shiny at all like when I say this wig is
not shiny this week is not shiny so yeah
definitely it uh it definitely
reminds me of real hair for sure so
overall I really really really love this
wig oh and actually I want to get like a
1b because the style of this unit is so
pretty so yeah overall I think this is a
really pretty pretty unit I just feel
like the part it sucks so you gonna have
to do some short enough plucking when it
comes to the pot area but I mean it's
almost there so I'm not really worried
about that because you just let me pluck
it and it'll be fine
sorry about my shirt because you really
can't see the hair and this is what the
color looks like so if you guys are
curious to see what the wig looks like
as a side part this is what it looks
like as a side part and this is actually
how the way comes yeah this is how the
way it comes Sol yeah yeah I actually
really like it one aside I didn't try it
on the side yet um but yeah I absolutely
loved it on the side so yeah this is
what it looks like so if you guys are
interested in this unit I'm going to
definitely leave everything in my
description box as far as links and I
can't really remember how much the price
was but I'll definitely leave it in my
description box I know it was probably
like around $40 so yeah I'll leave
everything in my description box if you
guys have any questions about this unit
feel free to leave it in my comment
section down below and yeah you guys
like I'm really feeling this way
like so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
