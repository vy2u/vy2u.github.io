and yes I had this radius hoodie on for
the second time most of my videos are
like that where it's a repeated outfit
but it's only because I'm filming
multiple videos and one day so let's get
one to this unit right here that I'm
wearing and no I'm not going to wear it
like this but you definitely can
so yes this is model model they're deep
invisible diagonal lace fronts and this
style is Darlene and I have it in a
color Oh F 2:03 so this is what the
picture looks like and yeah you guys I'm
really filming this week because I know
how this wig is going to turn out like I
see the potential in this wig um now
don't get me wrong it's few like this
and I probably would definitely wait
like this like if you want your week to
last longer don't pluck out the curls
like if you're fine with curls that look
like this um you can definitely get away
with win it like this um but yeah I just
feel like I want some on to this unit so
I'm definitely going to slay this wig
really quick for you guys but before I
do that I just wanted to show you guys
what the wig looks like before I do my
alterations to this unit um but yeah
this week has two homes in the front
right here and it has a comb in the back
and a heads adjustable shrimp this week
is big-headed friendly so if you do have
a larger size head look at the show I
think it's from me cutting the leaves
off I mean so yeah if you do have a
larger head this week would fit you
really good um it is a bit loose on me
but I don't really have my assurance
adjusted to its tightest but um yeah I
think this way it will be
fit for any size head so yes it just
depends on if you adjust your straps or
not so I did purchase this wig from wig
types calm and like always I will leave
all the links to this unit as well as
the price in the description box so yeah
I haven't got any shut it out of this
wig except for the curl that just
dropped out and that was only because I
did cut the lace kind of crazy
um and I went into the hairline so yeah
but as far as tingling I'm pretty sure
that this weight will tangle but I
really don't know because I just put it
on and yeah um so as far as the part
goes I have not said anything to the
part this is how the part comes which i
think is really good if you was to throw
some concealer and powder want it
because it's not a part that you can't
see so yes the part definitely
definitely looks good um on the fact
that I haven't did anything to it but
okay you guys enough talking I know you
guys want to see um the finished product
of this unit so I will be right back
okay guys so I'm back with the finished
results and I must say I'm absolutely in
love with this unit you guys in the
color again it's just like BAM
what this color is just so amazing and
it literally makes the bush like I'm so
serious so um basically what I did to
achieve this look is I took my VIP brush
and you cannot comb is no way you can
comb through these curls because they
are so tight and you just it you can't
brush through them so basically I was
attempting to try to brush them and it
just basically
made the bush bigger and I mean some
curls are still defined but yeah I just
took my brush and was like
and then it just started to get bigger
and some curls started you know to
become less defined and I love it like
this I'm pretty sure about kept on
brushing it would have gotten even
bigger but I wanted to keep some of the
curls because I do love these curls um
and then I didn't use the least part
because I felt like I kind of wanted it
towards my face so what I did was I just
um
cuz the part is on this side so I just
took some hair and from this side
basically and just bought it um to the
front and yes it was a little long so I
did trim some off to make a bang so this
is how it turned out and I really can
appreciate this way and you can you can
make it however you want to make a unit
to fit you um but yeah like I'm really
feeling this unit I mean if you don't
really want it in your face you can um
go it to the side and this is what it
looks like with the parts um
right here so let me show you guys what
it looks like and it still looks amazing
I might as well just keep it like this
you guys oh my god
ah and I see UPS so that means I have
more wigs coming for you guys so yes
this is great
so um yes if you have any questions
about this unit feel free to leave it in
my comment box down below and I will get
back to you and yeah I did purchase this
week from way types com um the unit name
is Darlene by model model I will leave
all of that in my description box and I
will see you in my next video you guys
