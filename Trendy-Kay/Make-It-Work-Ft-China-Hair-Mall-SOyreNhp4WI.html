food yeah this is going to be a hair
review on China ham oh and let's just
talk about this packaging because it is
absolutely so pretty so yeah my video
this video is going to be pretty quick
and straight to the point
only because I just need to catch up on
my videos and yeah so I hope you guys
don't mind but yes this hair is lives
no but seriously this hair is the bomb
so if you are interested in this hair
then just keep on watching
so this is what the way it looks like
after I washed it and let me tell you
it's so soft and where I did straighten
I can't remember which side but I think
it was this it reverted back to its
natural this is what the week looks like
after I washed it and let it edge right
and I did not run my fingers through the
curls or anything like that because I
just wanted you guys to see what it
looks like after I washed it and yeah I
didn't even do anything shoot apart this
is what the part looks like untouched
I'm not going to go in and pluck my part
I'm just going to UM add some powder in
my part because I'm kind of like a tide
of the curly half and like I've been
reviewing curly hair back the back or at
least that's how I feel but yeah I'm
just ready for something new so like I
do love this hair but I'm just not
feeling the curly hair right now but
this heads absolutely gorgeous so I'm
just gonna show you how I'm going to
wear it so basically I'm going to apply
I forget what what this is it's so old
like I think the packaging for this is
different now I think it's the
mineralized skinfinish powder by Mick um
I have it in the color dark but I'm just
about the edges to my parts so yeah if
I'm looking this way it's because my
mirror is really because I really can't
see you I can see it
dag on line
you
so yeah that's what the part looks like
with my powder added and I don't have
like none of my hair out I do have it
behind my head line slightly but this is
just how it's gonna be now yeah so then
I'm going to just throw this on because
I don't want to cut this week and it's
not really a style it just looks like
just like bluff so yeah I'm just going
to add this or not edit like put it one
just so my hair can look like something
because right now it just looks so dry
and just like not popping
so this is what the way it looks like
with this okay this is what the way it
looks like with this hit piece on and I
think it's really cute you know it just
makes it look the way it looked much
better when you just don't know what to
do a few wigs you can always add like a
cute little hat or in my case like a
headband or something like that to just
spice it up a bit especially if your wig
is just like has no cut to it whatsoever
I don't know it just gives it it just
gives the wig a little bit of life which
I like doing this when my wigs is just
like I don't know what to do with it so
yeah I think that this is really cute
this is a really cute look I definitely
really like this week I keep on saying
really a lot I always say really a lot
yeah Shannon is not bad at all like
literally I got a couple strands of hair
when I was washing his head and that's
it um now I will say when I was washing
his hair it was kind of like dirty it
was like like the shampoo was not white
it was like like a grayish color I don't
know how to explain it but yeah so I
just kept on washing away until the
shampoo was white so yeah I don't really
know what that was I mean the weight
didn't have like a smell or anything I
don't know if it was dyed like if they
dyed this hair or whatever buddy still
looks the same color so yeah that was
the only thing I was like what the heck
but other than that I really loved this
week the tangle in I have not received
any tangles from this wig like my hands
glide straight through it this week is
balm so if y'all looking for a curly
unit get this one right here
so China Hamill yes I love it love it
love it so yeah I think that this is it
for my video
