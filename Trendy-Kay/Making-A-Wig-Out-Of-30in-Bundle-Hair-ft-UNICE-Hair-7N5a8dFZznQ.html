this head was sent to me from a units
hair and they sent me four bundles any
frontal so the bundles I have all thirty
inches and the frontal is twenty inches
so I'm going to be making a wig out of
his hair and these are all the things
that you need to know I make you little
big or whatever so starting off I just
pimp my frontal onto my foam on wig head
and I'm just measuring it and you want
to kind of place it over the cap just a
little bit so that's basically what I'm
showing you guys and I'm showing you how
I had that all pent down and ready to be
sewn and you want to pick the like the
hair into a ponytail because if you
don't it is just it's just gonna be all
over the place so yeah that's basically
what I did and now I'm just gonna go and
sew on the frontal to my cap and I am
using like a matte we're not a mesh but
it's like an edit stretch kit and I find
that this works better for what I'm
making wigs versus the dome caps so yeah
if you haven't tried this you should
really try this kit because I like it
and it also comes with adjustable straps
so basically while I'm sewing this on
I'm just gonna talk a little bit about
the hair and you guys could just watch
and see you know what I'm doing anyway
so when I got when I received this hair
I didn't get any type of shingle
shingling I didn't get any type of a
tangling or shedding from this hair I
did receive a little bit of shedding
after I washed the head like after I
made the wig and wash the head and all
of that good stuff but as far as like
tingling and shedding I don't get that
from his hair so now as you can see I've
completed sewing on my frontal to my wig
cap and now I'm just measuring out
where I want the tracks to go on the
bottom and basically I double up the
tracks towards the bottom and I also cut
my web sometimes I don't cut them and
sometimes I do it just all depends on
how I feel so basically now that's just
what I'm doing and I'm just going in and
so in the tracks to the way camp I want
y'all to know it's no special type of
way that I sold these tracks on I just
make sure this looks good okay like
it's no type of special way that I'm
sewing this I'm not like a professional
stylist or whatever you want to call it
so yeah I do what works best for me and
basically how I'm doing it now works
best for me and I feel like when it's
all said and done my little wigs be
turning out good and maybe slayed okay
honey so yeah do what works best for you
as you can see I switched from having my
foam head on a little mannequin stand to
putting it in between my legs for me
putting the wig in between I'm at the
wig head in between my legs just worked
best for me I feel more comfortable like
I have more control over sewing these
tracks onto this wig cap so yeah that's
basically what I'm doing I had to switch
it out real quick but I'm still
continuing the same method and that's
just doubling the tracks or West and
just saw in the morning
okay so as I get closer to sewing the
tracks I'm close to the what is it front
to I want to say closure but like
frontal you have to start placing your
tracks in the same direction as the
frontal is gone if that makes any kind
of sense and I really can't explain this
guys but the only thing I can do is tell
you to watch but I'm starting to like
change the position of where my way I'm
sewing my tracks down if that makes any
kind of sense because you're gonna want
it to meet equally when you get when you
start showing that last track on so yeah
also make sure you space out your tracks
really well because you don't want some
spots to be thicker and than the other
and you also want to make sure you're
sewing on the same amount of hair as the
front row is if that makes any sense
like it has to be the same density
because if you're sewing too many tracks
on to your wig cap and it's not like the
same density as the frontal is gonna
look weird so you have to make sure
you're sewing the right amount of hair
on so it can all blend in together
because you don't want the back part to
be all full and thick and stuff and then
the Front's were all you know then so
anyway back to this hair I definitely
love this hair y'all know I had to hop
on a bandwagon because I was saying a
lot of you know videos on this company
and when they reached out to me and
asked me did I want to try some of their
hey I was like yeah send some bundles my
way I would definitely like to try your
bundle hair so yeah that's basically
what I did and I actually really like
this hair so yeah it's definitely been
holding up good the length for me is
just like amazing you guys like I'm
definitely feeling myself with all this
goodness okay oh yeah and before I
forget I also went ahead and bleach my
nuts on the frontal and I also
what did I do I bleach my nights and I
pluck the hair line just a little bit
slightly because I have a problem with
over plucking the hair line
okay so now that I'm closer to the front
room I'm gonna start to add the wax to
the hair or sold the weft to the hair
but I'm not doubling I'm not doubling
the wefts up anymore I'm just sewing on
a single left because you don't want the
hair to be too thick where it just is
big and bulky right there you want it to
lay as flat as possible so that's
basically what I'm doing and I'm also
hooking this last track on to the
frontal just to make it more secure so
yeah that's basically what I'm doing and
I guess you guys can just watch this
point too
and right here I still have some space
left over so I'm just gonna squeeze
another track right there and I'm also
gonna sold that track like connected on
to the frontal so now that I'm all done
this is what it looks like
so once you're finished this is what
your week should look like and you'll
have this extra fabric just hanging on
and you just want to cut that off and
then you have your wig so this is how
long it is and I just want you to see
they sure like it comes all the way down
to my treasure chest like this it's like
insane this is what the hair looks like
after I made a wig out of the bundle
head and I have to say that I'm
definitely loving this head you guys
okay it's definitely some good hair so
go check out this company and I'll leave
all the links in my description box I'm
not gonna make this video all along your
