review and this week was sent to me from
Friday night hair so yeah this is the
GLS 67 and this is what this wig looks
like I've been when this week for a
while now I even would for my birthday I
didn't wait like this for my birthday I
just had it I didn't have much like to
the side and I also did like kind of
snippet just so it wouldn't be covering
up my eyes tonight of course when you
first get this wing in the mail I meant
when you first received this week it
will like the current will be more
defined um keep in mind that the curls
and the back are more tighter than what
sounds are in the front so I don't know
if you can really see the difference
but yeah so when I first received this
week like I didn't do anything - I
might've liked to like this a little bit
and that was it but over time it will
just eventually start looking like this
which I like when it starts to look like
this because it looks more natural it
really it looks really nice now what is
suggest you like brushing this hair out
or like running your fingers through it
as the you brush it out the first time
because this week will start to tangle
on you like it's curly hair like right
now I would not be able to run my
fingers through it but I don't plan on
running my fingers to it anyway but yeah
it's you can't run your fingers through
it because it's just not going to work
as far as sharing that received
initiative which is really good so I
don't have any of my hair out and
basically what I did was I just pulled
some hair over to the side to give it
like a deep side part even though
there's really no part right there so
this week comes with two combs and
front Acoma to back with adjustable
straps and I do have my strips adjusted
tight or adjust it yeah I do have my
straps adjusted I feel like if your head
is on the bigger side you can get away
with when this wig
you just don't adjust your straps
because I feel like it's still a good
amount of room in here
but for me since my hand is on the
smaller side I just adjust my straps to
make the weight more secure means I
don't use the combs so yeah I will say
that this is a lot of hair um also this
weight is not shiny it is definitely
like a more natural shine of anything
you
so I think this is it for this video if
you guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in my comment section and again
this is from Friday night hair and I
will leave Friday night hair and links
in my description box as well as links
to this wig if you want to go ahead and
purchase it because y'all

hi hi baby what are you doing and for
anybody who wants to know what kind of
birth this is he is an African Grey and

dancing for you guys
