and this wig was sent to me from Sam's
Beauty so yes they sent me the magic
lace curved part lace front and this is
the MLC
175 um in the color dy x4 613 so yeah um
let's shop okay guys so I am a way that
I do have hair on my shirt but don't
think that this wig sheds crazy or
anything like that I did cut into the
hairline and when I was finger combing
through the wig some hair was shedding
but I didn't get a chance to wipe it off
my shirt obviously so yeah don't mind
that
let's just get straight into this video
because I'm really really liking this
week okay so there are two combs and the
front like it's a comb on each side of
the part and then you have a comb in the
back as well as adjustable straps I
would say that this um this week fits a
little snug so I do have my stripes
adjusted to its tightest but it's like
really tight like tight like suffocating
my head and it's yeah if you have a
bigger head you probably I don't know it
probably would fit but it's probably
going to be really tight without
adjusting the strips so yeah keep that
in mind I have received minimum shedding
from this unit I did cut into the
hairline so it probably has a lot to do
with the shedding as far as tangling I
have not received any tangling from this
week yet I'm pretty sure it will tangle
I love how it's like that messy type of
bob I definitely love the color but I
wish I would have got it in a darker
color but then if I probably got in a
darker color I would have been like I
needed in a color color it's just
basically like a messy tight wavy look
and hour
really like it this hair is a bit one
the shiny side to me um so I would like
take like some baby powder or dry
shampoo just to take away the shine
because yet um to me it is coming off a
bit shiny this week is also very
lightweight it's not too thin and it's
not like overly thick but is definitely
a nice amount of hair and it comes to
the texture of this unit this unit is on
the more silky side I feel like I can't
tell I mean it doesn't feel Yankee ish
to me like anything it's not like overly
silky but it's definitely on a silky
side this is what the part in space
looks like which I think it's really
nice melt I don't feel like um I don't
feel like the part was that bad waiting
to be plucked I do feel like if you
don't really want to pluck your part you
can't get away with just adding a little
bit of powder in it and it'd be good
because it wasn't one of those parts
that was like really tight but I did
still go ahead and pluck um a few hairs
out it wasn't a lot and I also added a
little bit of powder the only thing that
I don't like about the part is that it
kind of looks like wrinkly like I don't
know I can't explain it but it just
looks like like you got ridges in it
like the lace is like stretched out of
place like if that even makes sense I
don't know if y'all can see it but it's
not like flat it's like buckle II if you
give them saying I don't know I can't
explain it I probably sound real crazy
right now
but that's how the lace is is not like
Flint lace like that happened to me
before
it's not really a big deal but I just
don't really like it so yeah that's the
only thing yo I just need y'all to like
breathe in the goodness of this week
like look how this thing looks like this
is really ready pretty
I love this hairstyle like it's giving
me so much life yeah so overall this way
is the bone you're like look at this
like let me turn around so you guys can
see the cut that's it for this video if
you have any questions feel free to
leave it in the comment section down
