hey guys so I back again with another I
want to say wig review but it's not this
is another try on haul from am our club
where any club where I see a in my club
where some of you might call it any club
where but yet am I play way is what I
call it y'all so yeah this is going to
be like a mini try on haul so yeah I
would sent these clothes and I think it
you guys like me doing these type of try
on haul school why not just give y'all
which I want so yeah all the links to
these items will be listed in my
description box just in case you see
something that you would like to
purchase and I wanted to say something
else also I'm looking the same and like
all my videos because I'm trying to get
these try on hoes I'll see you guys so
yeah I'm just like filming basically the
intro and outro so yeah that's why was
the same but yeah if you are interested
in my hair I don't know if I was going
to already have this video up to the
tail or if I'm going to put it up after
this video I don't know if it's up
before I put up this video I'll leave
the link in the description box so also
if you're not familiar with Amaya club
whether they're just basically a
portable website themselves women
clothing and they sell like costumes
they sell swimsuits they sell clubs
where of course they sell shoes
accessories
you know clothes shirts everything that
you can imagine they sell and they sell
all their clothes and affordable price
and they have tens and thousands of
items on their website you'll be
literally on one page for forever you
okay so let's get started because I
don't want this video to be like extra
along or anything like that okay so the
first item is this jumpsuit type of
thing don't have it in the right okay so
it's just I love jumpsuit I got this in
a size small and this is just what it
looks like basically you can style this
jumpsuit how whichever
when it gives you the freedom to
basically style the top part however you
want to you just tie it however you
wanted to go basically and so I just
have to warn you this fabric is very
very see-through so it shows like all
your imperfections so I don't know if
you want to like put like some Spanx on
underneath the hair or whatever but it
definitely shows everything honey so
yeah be aware of that but as far as like
how it is it's really cute and the
bottoms are really long on five five and
they fit really good like they go all
the way to my ankle and it gives me they
scrunch and ankles so yeah they are long
okay so this next one is just like
another jumpsuit and it looks like this
and of course it's like the other one
where give you the freedom to tie it
however you want to and this is cut this
is a romper and it is short does not
address it is short and I really really
like this but then it's like the more I
look at it the more it looks like an
apron so I'm not really sure about it
but I mean it was cute I mean it's still
cute or whatever y'all don't mind me I'd
be going through the moves but it's okay
we all do right the next item is going
to be this two-piece set and I think
this is so cute so basically these are
the bottoms this is what the bottom look
like and they're just high-waisted
shorts and the movement is like really
flowy almost like you have on a dress
and it kind of distant like this like in
the crotch area with which I'm really
not a fan of but this is just what the
top looks like and I definitely love how
the top stitch you guys I really don't
know how this is working out right now
but I'll just insert with the top looks
like because I don't have time to be
fooling with trying to unravel this top
but yet and I love the colors the colors
are like um like a turquoise blue
and toepick type color which I really
really like and then the top kind of
like ties around your waist so yeah okay
the next item I got is another jumpsuit
and this jumpsuit is really really hot
when I saw it I was like oh I gotta have
it
I'm also the last item was I don't even
know the size but all the sizes will be
linked in my description box but yeah
this next one is all black jumpsuit and
basically it just has them mesh like
it's kind of like a bodysuit type of
thing yeah I just love the way this
looks the only thing about this is I
wish that the the bottom of the pants
were kind of like hugging my leg it kind
of is like it's not tight on my leg if
you do in the same but that's fixable
because I absolutely love how this fits
on my body and yeah I really really love
this and I got this in a size small I
believe you know I got this in a size
medium so yeah and it fits me really
good Oh another thing is serious camel
toe so I will advise you not to like
like to wear some underwear under this
if you're not a person I don't wear
underwear move it once to the next item
and this item is also a black jumpsuit
and when I saw this I was like it's
absolutely gorgeous now the material is
okay to me so yeah but this is basically
what it looks like a head like the deep
V and then it like it's all out in the
back and these are like flare pants
which I absolutely love
and this is in a size large which I
actually it was like the legs one and I
just had a head it so bad but um I feel
like it would have fit me so much better
as it was in a size medium so yeah it's
not hugging me like I wanted to hug me
but nonetheless it still is a really
cute jumpsuit and all this next one is
another wrong
it's like long sleeves so this is really
good for now like the spring and I
already had like when I saw this already
had our outfit already plant in my head
you ever just see something and already
like automatically have outfit plan for
it so yeah I absolutely love this and
basically it's like a deep v-neck and
then it just ties right here and these
are shorts and then they have like the
little ruffles on it and I definitely
love this color when I've seen it in
person I'm like oh I really really like
that it's kind of like a mustard a brown
color and then it's like an off-white
color and in navy blue as well and I
just really really really like this now
on the site I thought that this brownish
color with an orange color but it's
actually not but I still love it and I
love the way it fits and it just looks
really nice and comfy but still cute at
the same time I don't know I just really
really really really like this piece
okay guys so I have two more items left
and the next item will technically three
but not really so the next item is this
long maxi dress and I thought in love
with this when I seen it it is like a
cream color it's not really white it's
like an off-white color and it just
laces up in the front and then it's kind
of like cut out in the back and I
freaking love this dress now that I'm
looking at it I feel like if I wanted to
turn it around like if I want the way it
is dressed like the back as the front I
could do that and it gives me like that
deep feeling what do you guys think I
think that would be so cute and sexy now
I got this in a larger only because I
didn't know how long the dresses going
to be I wanted to trust to be long
actually me getting a large it didn't as
far as the less like the lip it's still
too short
like in so yeah yeah and then it's kind
of big like on the sides like I should
have got a medium but I didn't want to
get a medium because I felt like the
medium it wasn't really going to be as
long as I wanted to be which I was right
but what I probably do with this dress
and also has a split in it which I love
but overall I really do love this dress
I wish that it just fit me properly so
yeah what so what I'm going to do is I
might just cut off the skirt part and
where as like a body suit because
essentially that's what it is basically
is there's a body suit and then it just
has the fabric as the dress part if
you're doing the same so yeah I still
think this is really cute and I think it
would look even better as a bodysuit
next is a rubber type thing and let's
just say I really don't like the
material now as far as like the style
and how it is I feel like it's so girly
and cute but the material just looks too
cheesy for me but like the back is open
and it is like this champagne new dish
type of color and I think it's so cute I
just wish that the material was a little
different and the material is really
really really really shiny so yeah and I
got this in a size large as well I don't
say but I know that this is the size
large and the last item is these and I
didn't pick these out they actually sent
these to me on their own which these are
the size medium but these look like some
Jean drawers like where am I going with
this okay I mean thank you guys for
sending me these but I couldn't even I
tried to try them one just to see how
they would look on me and I couldn't
even fit these you guys so yeah and then
it came with this like tie in the front
so guys that's it for this video I hope
you guys enjoyed and
I love making these type of videos I'm
definitely going to get into giving you
guys more of these videos if you want
them so yeah like always I will see you
in my next video and I love you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
