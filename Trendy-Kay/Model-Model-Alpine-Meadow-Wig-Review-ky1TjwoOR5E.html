review for you guys and she's on my head
and this is alpine meadow by model model
and this is what it looks like um
this wig is definitely very popular on
YouTube so I'm pretty sure you can find
thousands of videos on um alpine meadow
this wig does remind me of the Danity
wig so they're very very very similar so
if you interested in this wig and they
don't have this one in stock I'm pretty
sure you can get the Danity wig and it
will look exactly the same so um oh wait
a minute I do have her in an om 9 9 J so
this is what she looks like
I absolutely love this week you guys
like and it's not too long and it's just
like I love this wig now I purchased
this wig from wig type stuff on weight
types comb of course and the wig I think
I paid 26 yeah I think I paid $26 but
now if you go and wait types they do
have 25% off it used to be 22 now they
moved it up to 25% off so I think this
week is around like $24 so yes I
absolutely love this week I've been win
this week for two weeks now and like
it's still in very very good condition I
love the fact that um how the front
leaves I love how to Front Lee
I love the color I just love everything
about this week you guys like it just
Falls and place so nicely so um I think
this week is about I want to say 20
inches but I think this wig is around 20
inches um it has two combs in the front
it has a comb in the back and it has the
adjustable straps yes you guys you guys
tell me what you think this way it's
like so gorgeous look at that color like
look how it just falls like into place
so um before I go you guys I just wanted
to show you um I wanted to show you guys
how this wave looks on inside because
originally this wig is a side part it
doesn't um is not meant to be in the
middle you can shift the wig to make the
part in the middle I usually wear my
parts more in the middle because it fits
my face but the middle part just suits
my face better so if you guys um
want to see how the part looks to decide
how it's originally supposed to be then
I'll show you that my way this week I
think I am going to UM wait on the side
but this is what the wig looks like one
the side homie pulls from here in the
front you just fix it cuz it feels funny
but yeah actually this wig is very
pretty on the side I think um I will
wear to sleep on the side I don't know
for some reason I just love how middle
parts look on me um back in the day I
used to wear my head one I met my part
on the side all the time like that was
my and like as I got older I don't
know for some reason I just like the
middle parts um but yes alright it's
starting to tango like a lot now that I
shift it over but y'all get the idea
this is um this is how the wig
originally um originally comes and
that's how to model is wearing it over
here so yes this is what it looks like
one aside if anybody was curious because
I forgot that this is not even you know
when the part in the middle was not even
hot away it goes but um yeah so this is
what it looks like as a side part and
it's actually pretty pretty nice I
actually do like it so yeah I might have
to try the side part out but for some
reason like I don't know if you guys can
see that but it looks uneven like this I
love sweet longer maybe I have put on
I don't know it is same kind of cricket
to me
alright bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
