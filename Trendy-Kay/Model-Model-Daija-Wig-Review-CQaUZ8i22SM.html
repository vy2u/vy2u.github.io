today and this week is the wig that I'm
wearing now and if you can tell I'm like
so in love with this wig so this is the
model model wig deep invisible part
lace front wig and it's Dasia so you
can't tell I'm like in love with these
Dasia wigs I don't know what's going on
every week that I get with the name deja
I freaking love so yeah this is what the
packaging looks like and yes this is
called deja it's just spelled different
from the previous wig that I did a
review one the shorter way Dasia yeah if
you haven't seen that one go check it
out because that's a really nice wig so
yes back to this way this is what it
looks like and I have the color SOP 35
no 350 30 and that's basically the color
that the model is wearing and then on
the back it shows you other colors that
this weight comes in and let me tell you
guys I was like so confused because
first of all I love the way because them
sad part wigs like they'll have like the
little swoop bang on one side and then
the other side they'll have like a
little piece of hair there swoops and
I'm like can I just find a week that's a
side pub with one side swoop and not the
other side so when I came across this
wig I was like yes like one sided
straight how I like it and then
has a little school so yes and then I'm
like wish what color should I get like I
don't know what color I should get
because I'm like them all so I was
really feeling the color that the mind
was when so I was like I'll just start
with this color and you know if I like
the weight like I think I'm gonna like
it which I do then I'll just order more
colors so yes I love this wig okay so
let's get into this week like I'm so
excited to do a review on this week
because I love it so much you're like
all right let's get started
this is basically my first time when
this wig I have tried it on multiple
times I am going to let you know that
when I first tried it on I loved it
the second time I tried this wig when I
was like I don't think I really loved it
as much as I did the first time I tried
it on so I was like okay I'm a week to
do everything on it
so then today I tried it on again and I
was like hmmm I think it's time to do a
review on this freaking week so here I
am doing a review on this gorgeous wig
that I love so much and basically it is
a ombre week and it's dark on the top
part and lighter as you get to the ends
so I do not wait a minute yeah the week
does not have duct root throughout the
week I think it's just like I'm mainly
in the top area and on the sides but if
you go like towards the back and stuff
like it's just one color which is fine
because the darker comes down um enough
where you can't even tell so this is
what the way it looks like it is a
really nice length it's not too long I
would say this wig is about 18
you know yeah I'm gonna say this week is
about 18 inches long so it's very
gorgeous now I haven't got much shedding
from this wig I think probably like a
couple strands here and there but it's
really not bad at all you guys and as
far as as far as did I say Shannon whole
did I say tangling okay so this week
does not yeah I was talking about
shedding this week does not shed oh I
might get a couple of strands hand there
but it's really not bad at all and as
far as it being tangled I do get snakes
hair there also but it's not bad at all
like I can run my fingers through it and
it's fine I can even run my fingers
through it and I won't get any type of
shedding and I think mainly the shedding
was coming from when I cut the lace off
so yeah so now I'm really not getting
any type of shedding the colors on point
I really love the color I'm not really a
fan of the model model weeks but they
are starting to grow on me I really
prefer the free trust equal wigs over
model model but yeah and I think free
trust equal gives you a more deeper part
than model my own that's just my opinion
I think they do but this is what the
part looks like so the part is not that
bad
um I did pluck out my part I did not put
any concealer or powder in it I didn't
even bring out my hand in front I just
popped this bad boy on and did my review
so yeah that's basically how the wig
will look when you get it well what am I
talking about the way will not look like
this when you get it you will have to
out the part because the part is it
wasn't really a part so you definitely
would have to pluck it out I mean if you
like your parts then and like well you
can't really see it then that's fine but
if you're a person who likes it more
realistic and you want to put in the
work as far as plucking out your part
then I would suggest that you do that
but if you lays in like I don't feel
like clicking on open
I'm not demold all that then it's
probably not for you or you can just you
know with like it is so yes this is what
the wig looks like um I will say though
in the top re they only give you this
much of a short piece so like if you was
to do like this you see how some hair is
still long I probably will cut this off
just to make it more even but yes I
definitely definitely love love love
this week so this is what it looks like
in the front and this is what it looks
like on the side and let me turn around
so I can show you what it looks like in
the back so if you're like a simple type
of person and you like your side parts
with the little bang going on right here
or the little swoop then this is
definitely a wig for you you have to get
it because I love it so much and this is
like everyday wig like you can pluck
this bad boy on and go like it's just so
easy so yes you guys this is the days
you
I did purchase this from Wiig types calm
this wig was $25 if I'm wrong which I
was in my last video I would just list
everything in the description box but I
do believe this one was 20 min effect
I'm lying it was like 23 or 24 dollars
but uh it's like I'm probably like a
dollar too of it's the same it was
around twenty three twenty-four dollars
I purchased it from wait I stay calm
okay um I forgot to mention that this
week does has this wig does have a comb
in the front it has one right here on
the side of the part and it also has
another comb right here on the other
side of the part and I'm trying to film
it does have a comb in the back and also
it has adjustable straps now this week
is a little big for my head even when I
do two adjustable strikes and I have a
very small head so if you have a larger
size head or regular two large head I
think that you would be okay with this
wig and it'll fit perfect but I do wish
I mean it's it's snug like it's fitting
I don't think that if I walk outside
like my wigs gonna fall off but I just
like more security in my wig so yeah
that's the only thing I don't like it's
the fact that um I got the shrimp's as
tight as I can get and it's not as tight
as I wanted to be but besides that this
week is perfect you guys so yeah like I
said no Shannon really no major tangling
it does tangle but it's a synthetic wig
so I mean it's gonna happen um so yeah
you guys tell me what you think about
this little wig I absolutely love this
way okay
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
