review and this week review is going to
be the wig that I have on my head right
now and this is by model model it's the
deep invisible part at least front wig
and the style name is Rhea and this is
what the picture looks like on the model
so yes I have her in a color SOP for
30-27 okay you guys one two this week
because I'm feeling this week like look
at that color you guys like really
really really hey guys so I purchased
this unit from Wiig types calm and I
paid $29 you might as well say I paid 30
bucks for this unit and yeah so the
length is really long like let me back
all the way up yeah this wig is super
long like I think that it's around 28
inches the curls um was not like this
when I first took it out the package it
was more um more of like a defiant I
don't know what I just did with the
paper I gotta be quick you guys because
my battery is dying but the curls were
more defined like how it is on the model
I don't really know if you can see that
but I just took I don't know with my
paddle brushes but I took my paddle
brush and just brushed out all the curls
and this is what it looks like after I
brushed out all of the curls so yes they
do give you a good amount of parting
space and this is what the part looks
like right here this week does
have two cones in the front like one on
my temple area and the other one um by
other temple area and then it has a comb
in the back and it has the adjustable
straps the way cap size fits great I
mean my wig is pretty snug and I have it
too almost as tight as not as tightest
but um yes it fits my head really snug
the only thing I would say about this
unit is I'm really not used to the tight
curls I feel like I want to take my flat
iron and just like go through it a
little bit just to loosen up the curls
because I like more of a like wave wavy
loose Curtis wig sheds a lot um I don't
know why because when I took it out the
package like it was a shot and I didn't
even cut off the lace part yet and then
after I cut the lace off the front it
was shedding even more so um yeah it
does quite a bit but it's not like
overly shedding like oh my god like as
soon as you put your fingers through it
and shits like it's not like that but it
does shed and it does get tangled a
little bit but I think it's because it's
such a long wig and it is pretty curly
and show you really quickly how the part
looks originally which is on the side
okay oh they're alright a little muscle
front with an open fire one pump for
right now
okay guys so I'm back I just wanted to
quickly show you guys what this unit
looks like after I ran my flat irons
through it I just felt like I really
didn't like the way the curls were I'm
used to more looser curls so this is
what it looks like after I flat on well
I didn't really flat on I just let the
heat hit it like I swipe my flat on
sturm and it just loosened up the curls</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
