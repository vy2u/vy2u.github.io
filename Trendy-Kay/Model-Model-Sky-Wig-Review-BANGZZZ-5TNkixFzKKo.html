today and this is the week that I'm
currently when on my head and this is by
model model premium wig and the style
name is sky and I have this leg in an
OEM stand grill so this is what the tape
looks like and it had like so many
colors to choose from when it comes to
this unit you guys I feel like I look
different like I don't know how to feel
like I feel like I look different it's
definitely a cute unit I'm just not used
to myself with a bang but this week is
absolutely gorgeous
like what look at that color
okay so I did purchased this unit from
Wiig types calm and I forget how much
this week was but I'll make sure I list
everything in the bottom description box
so yeah um I like this weight though
like it probably takes some getting used
to because it's been so long since I've
worn a bang but this is definitely
definitely cute and I love how they had
this color going on the color is just
like really nice so this unit does come
I don't think it comes with any combs
but it does come with adjustable straps
and yeah I haven't got any shedding from
this unit no Shannon and
no tangle in so far but I'm pretty sure
the more you wear to showing it um
it will definitely start Tanglin
probably in like the back area
so yeah just keep that in mind also um I
lost my train of thought oh yeah
and the the texture of this unit is like
it's not silky at all
it's definitely not like shiny or
anything it has like a slight Yankee
texture to it which I really really like
it feels like some real hair like it's
very very nice so this is the length and
I definitely love the lift I would
probably say this it's like like 14 or
16 inches so yeah this is what it looks
like they do give you like a fake scalp
I don't know gonna see that but yeah
it's a big scope up there I think that
it actually makes it more realistic
looking with the fig scalp but yeah I
know bangs are not for everybody but
honey a bang is for me today I like this
unit I just need to get a little bit
used tool but I actually like this I
wasn't sure how to feel about this unit
but it's actually growing on me like I
look dark and mysterious like like I'm
about to go out and Street kill my
husband that's what all the pike I look
like something like I'm about to do some
karate or something I don't know this is
really really cute you guys I have to
get another color cuz I absolutely
really like this I don't like it with
this shirt that I had on but like this
looked like I could wear some all black
and has some
like my lover Jacqueline and just yes
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
