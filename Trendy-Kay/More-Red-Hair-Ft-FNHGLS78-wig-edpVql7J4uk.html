the range
that way when up tipsy I still know I
got mine hey guys it's Kate and I'm back
with another video so this week this
video is gonna be on this week of course
and this week was sent to me from Friday
night here so they sent me the GLS 78
and I have it in a color RB 35
keep in mind that this color also comes
and 1b if you're not really a color
person so yeah they do have this
available in a 1b also this week did not
come straight it came curly and our
answer clips just so you guys can see
what the week looked like originally and
what I did to the week and its original
state but personally it was just way too
much hair for me so I am going to insert
a clip of what it looked like I did
record this video yesterday and I just
wasn't feeling I mean I did like the
look that I came up with but it was just
way too much hair for me so I wanted to
see how it would act straightened and it
really took well to heat I did have my
flat irons on like 300 I think so yeah
and this is how long the week comes it's
really really long so as you can see you
can definitely achieve some styles with
this head you can definitely play around
with it I really enjoyed playing around
with this week so yeah it's very
versatile even though you know Friday
night hair really don't give you that
much pie in space that's why I rarely
ever use the part in space anymore but I
will say if you're if you get this way
definitely try the flip over method or
if you decide to purchase any of Friday
night hair I definitely suggest flipping
the head over to either side I feel like
it just looks more natural to me
now this hair does not come with baby
hands
I did go in and cut some in the hairline
and just mold it with my dad to be glue
Joan also this week comes with hardly so
I don't feel like you really need to
secure the wig down with anything but I
did secure it's uh like right here with
the holding free spray I didn't use the
J I use the gel for the baby heads but I
used the free spray for the sides to
hold it down because this wig is not
making friendly so keep that in mind as
well and my head is small in the tips
don't come into air it's not really that
noticeable that's why I added sideburns
just so you wouldn't see and also it
kind of lifts a little bit on the side
so I had to put some free spray on it
just so it can hold it down but I really
think that this came out really nice and
I also had this up in the style that it
was in when it was curly I had it half a
pack down but I decided just to weigh it
all on one side just because I like it
better this way but this hair is really
nice both ways I do think that this hair
looks nice both ways so if you like the
curly way curly if you get tired of the
curly look you can definitely straighten
it if you get tired of the long look you
can definitely cut it it's all up to you
I think that you can get a lot of looks
out of this hair I think what got me is
the color for sure I'm definitely
definitely loving this color if you
watch my videos I recently did a video
on a red wig but it was human hair so if
you're looking forward for that unit
definitely check out this week because
this is definitely a deep foot that hair
and I'll leave the video link in my
description box just in case you guys
don't know what I'm talking about oh my
gosh I look like
also I forgot to mention about tangling
and Shetty it's not about a shedding but
this week does and as far as
tangling I do get most of the tangles
like on the bottom so yeah keep that in
mind it is a long synthetic wig so you
are going to get tangling but yeah I
just take my vent brush and kind of
brush them out right now while this week
is still fresh the tingling is not as
bad so yeah that's pretty much it for
this video I'm definitely not gonna make
this a long video because I already kind
of recorded this video yesterday but
yeah that's basically it if you're
interested in this unit or if you're
interested in this wig definitely check
out my description box for all links and
I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
