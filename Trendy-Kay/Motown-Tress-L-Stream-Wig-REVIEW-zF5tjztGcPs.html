this gorgeous wig that I had one today
and I do not have the packaging or the
picture to show you guys what it looks
like on the model this wig is by Motown
trust and it is out stream so yes I
absolutely love this way you guys but
let's get into this week first before I
do my writing about this way so anyway
um okay um so yes like I was saying this
is um a Motown trust week and it's
called l stream and i have her in a
color red wine and i purchased this from
Evelyn evany limes calm so yes I do
believe this wig was thirty-five dollars
or thirty met effect I'm lying this way
was $26 or 26 or 28 so you know I'm bad
with prices so if I'm wrong I will list
them in the description box but yes um
this is a long wig so yeah
the pardon is pretty good for a lace
front it's not a l part lace wig or
nothing like that it's just your regular
lace front wig and they do give you um
they do give you a nice amount of lace
and it just comes all the way around my
sides the
stay down so if I don't know how it be
how it will be on your head but if
you're having the same problem as me you
will probably want to take some bobby
pins and just clip them down on the side
so they'll stay down but I absolutely
love this way guys so um oh yeah and it
has two combs in the front a comb in the
back and adjustable straps I have my
adjustable straps to its tightest and
this thing is like suffocating my hair I
probably will have to loosen it up but I
don't know if that's the reason why
these little tip pieces are sticking up
because I have my wig extra tight but
then yeah just heads up on that and this
is what the wig looks like in the front
sorry
and this is what the way it looks like
on the side and let me show you what it
looks like in the back
so yeah um this wig is cut in layers
like a little towards the face area I
did not cut this week at whatsoever I
also did not pluck out the curls or
anything this is how the way comes
straight out of the packaging um so yeah
and also with the part I did pluck the
part a little bit like when I say I
plucked it a little bit like it was
probably like a couple strands of hairs
that I plucked out just so the part will
stay in the middle but you really don't
have to pluck out the part I just wanted
the part to be permanent so I kind of
like plucked it a little bit so what I
probably would do is take some spray
like the colored spray that you get from
your local beauty supply store and color
the roots but I'm pretty lazy and I
don't really like to put as much work
into synthetic wigs because I feel like
it's already curled style and however
you want it to be so yeah this is my
only con about this wig is the color um
I just don't like the color so I
probably and still want to try to order
this wig but in the color that I want it
to be because it's funny I went back
after they sent me the wig and I looked
and I was like ok usually when your
first choice is sold out they send you
your second choice ok so I went back to
the site and I looked and they still had
blue black so I'm like it's not even
sold out so basically they just say
forget your first color and imma send
you the second color so every line I
probably will not be purchasing from you
again
I don't know i'ma have to find this wig
somewhere else so if you guys know where
I can find this week add in the color
blue black please leave it in the leave
it in the comment section down below
oh because I really want to get this
color but I just don't want to order
from there anymore
and it's really hard to find this week
or to be she wig in a blue-black color
so yes other than that I really really
love this week it's not too thin at all
um this is all the hair to the front and
it's just a gorgeous wig I just don't
think that um this red color really
works for me without the dark route so
um benzo this is like a lace front and
you can part it wherever with in the
front wherever the lace is usually um
from ear to ear in the front but they
mostly give you more lace towards the
middle part but you can part it anywhere
you want so that's a good thing um your
part might not be as long as you want it
but yeah it's many things that you can
do with this week um you can pull it up
into a cute ponytail if you're not a
middle part person you definitely can
like put some of the hair to the side
and this is just what it looks like with
with everything to decide which is
really cute and I would definitely wear
um this week both ways it's a girl that
I love um and she did a review on this
week in the same color
um the color looks good on her but yes
her name is wigs in Brazil and yeah so
if you want to see what the
looks like on her go check her channel
out um the only thing about her channel
is that she's from Brazil so if you
don't speak Portuguese then you won't
understand what she's saying but you
would like you can still look at the wig
and see how it looks on someone else but
you won't know what she's talking about
if you don't speak Portuguese so just
something um you know to throw out there
but anyway I'm gonna leave this video at
that I hope you enjoyed this video you
guys tell me what you think about this
wig so if you have any questions or
anything as always feel free to leave
them in the comment section down below
and I always respond back so yeah bye
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
