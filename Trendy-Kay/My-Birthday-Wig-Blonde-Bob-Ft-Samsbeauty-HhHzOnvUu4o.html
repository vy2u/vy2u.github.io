it'll back with a another video I've
been getting a lot of questions about
what we got wool for my birthday so I
just wanted to share with you guys the
wheat that I wore for my birthday
yes this is the wig I will for my
birthday I did receive this from Sam's
Beauty if you are familiar with my
videos and you watch my videos like that
then you know that I have done a wig
similar to this in the past I can't
remember I knew it was about
I know it's by new born free I can't
remember the number but it looks
identical to this week only that wig
doesn't come in like this blonde ash
color so I was searching for this color
finally found a wig that a bald wig in
this color and I reached out the same is
beauty like help me I will pay for the
wig I just need y'all to send it to me
in time and they actually wind up
sending it to me
like for free I didn't have to pay for
it because I was willing to pay for it
but they was like no it's on us and they
sent it to me like in a day so I was
real pumped about that so yeah this is
from Sam's Beauty I'll go ahead and
leave all the links in the description
box just in case any of you guys are
interested in this week the way I got em
when is five Bobbie bus and I have it in
a style MLF won 2-6 Lena I think I'm
saying it right Lena Lena the color is
TT 6:23 and basically that's like a
blowing color like a ash blonde color
which I really love
so yeah basically this is another blonde
wig for you guys and for all you guys
that has something to say about black
girls when for long wigs I guess that's
your problem so yeah basically this is
another blonde bombshell on my melon
skin yes honey and I
well basically the construction is your
typical construction it has two combs
and the front has a comb in the back and
it also comes with adjustable straps
this week fits my head pretty snug so if
you have a larger size head this might
fit a little bit tight well you probably
won't be able to fit it so a day come
with lace to cut off of course the least
it comes off and it comes with a part in
the middle now if you wanted to put on
the side that's not gonna work because
of course one side is gonna be longer
than the other so you probably want to
find above and I think they if I'm not
mistaken they do
heavy sigh bub-bub like this in this
color don't quote me on it but I do
believe I did see a side part bub in
this color um if I could find it I'll
leave it in a link in the description
box but yeah this comes as a middle part
and when I first got the wig you didn't
really I don't even think I can't
remember you know to be honest with you
but I don't think that I plugged and he
has out of this wig I just think that I
added powder to it because it was pretty
good one as far as it looking natural so
this is what the part looks like the
only thing I did do was add a little bit
of baby hairs just up in the front part
and like I said I added my powder you
can add you can say little powder so if
you're not a person that you know if
you're a person that does not like pluck
in your parts I don't think that you'll
have an issue with like the part being
too tight I feel like you can get away
without plucking apart so yeah this is
what the wig looks like this is how the
cut came and everything so yeah this is
pretty much what it looks like I don't
know I really like this week I had a
free string
I had a few strands of shedding but the
shedding has not been bad at all as far
as tangling this is a bulb short of cut
style wigs so you're not going to get
too much tangling this week is Yankee it
definitely isn't shiny at all the Yankee
nests is pretty light it's like a nice
realistic type of yeah
came as far as the duck bridge the duck
bridge doesn't go all the way through
yeah they pretty much do go all the way
through but they're not like in a lower
back half of the week but as far as like
on the side and like right here it is
duck routed so you pretty much can't
tell that it's not dumb pretty all the
way through you might as well say it is
duck food all the way through but yeah I
love this freaking wig you guys I just
feel like the blonde is on point this
whole color setup it's just amazing so
yeah if you're interested in this wig
I'll go ahead and leave all the links in
my description box just in case any of
you guys are interested and yeah if I
left anything out about this week feel
