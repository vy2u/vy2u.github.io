hold on tight and Abajo I'm sorry I
can't say you can oh no you'll keep
interrupting hey guys it's Kate of
course and I'm back with another video
and I'm so excited to be filming this
video because this is gonna be a
giveaway video for this head that I'm
wearing which is one of my favorite
weeks I know I get that question egg so
many times what's my favorite wig this
is one of my favorite wigs and I'm so in
love with this way same speedy was nice
enough to collaborate with me so I can
give two lucky winners my favorite unit
so stay tuned for the end for all
details or you can just look in my
description box and I'll have all the
details on how you enter this giveaway
so one two two this week so this is the
Empress lace wig and I have it in the
style perm romance and all of you should
be familiar with this week if not then
where have you been so this is the
performance wig and I have it in a color
t1b / burgundy and I don't have the
stock car but this is basically what the
stock car looks like and this is the
packaging which I definitely love the
packaging because they had like the
slide-out box and I just find it
convenient because you don't have to
like take the plastic off you can just
slide out the box so yeah I'm sure now
put the construction of this week it is
your typical construction they give you
two combs in the front on each side on
each side of the park they also give you
a comb in the back with adjustable
straps
I feel like this wig is definitely big
hint friendly because I have so much
room and this week it's ridiculous but I
still feel like me adjusting the straps
if it's my head okay even though it's
still a lot of room but you can't tell
cuz this week does leave really flat
which I love about this week so yeah if
you have a smaller size here
just adjust your straps it is a bit on
the big side but she can definitely get
away with winning and for all my girls
who have a normal to larger sized head
this will fit you so perfectly this is a
middle part wig if you wanted to win the
pot on the side all you have to do is
shift the wig to the left or the right
and it still looks right so if you are a
person that likes you put on the side
you definitely can do that but I love my
purse in the middle so that's one probe
that I loved about this week is that it
comes already with a middle part it also
comes with a soft lace and that's one
thing I don't like about this week not
that it comes with soft lace but when
I'm trying to pluck the part it's so
hard to pluck the part without ripping
the least and every time I get this wig
I always rip the least so you can just
add your concealer or powder if you feel
like you don't want to pluck the part I
feel like it's optional you really don't
have to pluck the part if you don't want
to it did come okay but I felt like I
wanted to pluck it
but as you can see like the back of the
part looks like the front of the part is
not really a difference so like I said
you really don't have to pluck the part
if you don't want to you can just go
ahead and edge your concealer or your
finishing powder and yeah me I just edit
my finishing powder to it and this is
what it looks like I also went ahead and
brush some of our baby heads out and I
use gossipy gel for my baby heads I
didn't cut any baby heads into this week
just because I just don't I just use my
own baby hands and yeah I'm so that's
what that is looking like and this week
is also a light Yankee texture which I
love is not like to Yankee and it's not
like too silky either they also have
some nice color selections to choose
from in this week which I really love I
have this week and like
almost every freaking color you guys
that's how real it is like I really love
everything about this week I love the
fact that the like the front part of the
hair is in sync with each other like it
goes back how I like it to go because I
know some way it's only one side is like
only one side at right and then the
other side is just a mess where the
curls just are not in sync but these
curls I love now the density on this
week is not too too thick but it's just
right like the DISA tea for me is just
perfect it's not hot it's not too much
hair but it still looks full in my
opinion also the dumper is not all over
the hair it's just up in this part which
I don't mind because you can't even tell
but the ombre how they have it it just
looks so realistic like this doesn't
look like synthetic hair whatsoever and
that's what I really love about this
week and the fact that it lasts me a
good little minute I definitely
definitely love this week and like I
said this is not like fresh out the
package or anything like that I have one
this week literally all day and once I
took it off like it was a little bit
like but all that there was took my vent
brush I'm had women but I took my vent
brush and just brush the curls out and
it came back to life um this week does
tingle a little bit I haven't got much
shedding from this week but it does
tingle so keep that in mind and it
really tables like in the nape area
where most weeks would tingle but it's
not bad at all you have to do is brush
it out and you'll be good to go but
you're like you can go the whole day
without brushing this hair and it still
would look so good so it's not like you
have to be carrying your vent brush
constantly brushing this hair because it
just stays like this
that's another thing that I like about
this week is it don't switch off on you
when you leave the house that's how
you're gonna look the whole day so yeah
the curls like stay like this at all
times and I just love it I definitely
love the lift for this type of style I
just feel like I don't know it's so cute
the color is definitely lit I love when
it's colorful like the fall / winter
seasons I just feel like it just goes so
yes I'm so in love with this week yo
