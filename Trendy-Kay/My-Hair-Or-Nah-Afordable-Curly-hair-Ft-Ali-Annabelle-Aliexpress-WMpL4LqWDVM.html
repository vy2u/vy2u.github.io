busy dancing on the line
hey guys it's Kate of course and I'm
back with another video so this video is
gonna be all over the place I do
apologize well not really all over the
place but I'm filming my intro and then
I'm showing you guys what the hair looks
like when I put some effort into it
because the clips that sure about the
scene like that was just me putting on a
wig even though it's still kinda the
same
it's just part it when inside and I
don't know okay so if you follow me on
snapchat then you or Instagram then you
already seen that this hair most of you
guys damn my computer going dead most of
you guys thought that this wave was
actually my hair which is not but it
definitely comes close to looking like
my hair my hands not this full one is
curly but it definitely looks really
really natural hey guys it's Kay and I'm
back with another video of course and
this video is gonna be on Ellie
Annabelle hair and you can find them on
Aliexpress and I don't think they have
like a store but if they do all the
links will be in the description box but
yes they sent me bundle hair they send
me the Brazilian curly yeah they sent me
Brazilian curly hair so I have it in the
lymphs I have three bundles in a frontal
and the limps of the bundles are 16 14
and 12 and then I have a 12-inch frontal
I had this hair for quite a while but
basically what I did was I made the
bundles into a wig of course so if I
have any clips of what the hair looked
like originally then I'll go ahead and
throw them in but it's been so long and
I had been made the wig and all of that
stuff but yeah this is what the actual
wigs look this is what the actual wig
looks like after I went to
and made the bundles into a week so as
you can see the construction and
basically how I make my wigs is I use
the mesh it's like a mesh no like a mesh
stretch cap or whatever so yeah um
that's basically what I used and I felt
like I have a whole bundle leftover I
think I have for the 16 inch leftover so
I think I only use the 14 inch 12 inch
and the 12 inch frontal and this thing
is thick already so I'm gonna go ahead
and put this on now with the front tools
if you familiar with making frontals you
know that they give you like some extra
air space and this part needs to be cut
off but I didn't cut it off because I
just don't want to and I don't feel like
it but yeah this is what the party looks
like now the knots are not bleached I
didn't bleach the knots and I didn't
wash this hair even didn't washes him I
did wash his hair I washed his hair
because I could smell it I watched his
hair after I'm after I already made the
wig so yeah my hair is in a ponytail
I'll take this off so you can see it's
real nasty also don't mind it but yeah
my hair is in a ponytail and it's real
crusty I need to wash it but I'm just
not so I just put this little stocking
cap on if you have a new stocking cap to
match your like skin tone that would be
great because it makes the lace just
look really natural so my hands like
flat already besides the back a little
bit but nobody's really paying attention
to that because you know this is like
some big hair so I'm not going to use
and he got to be glue or anything I'm
not gonna use any got to be glue or
anything like that because
I just want to show you the quickness
and how you can just how you really
don't have to do much to this week so
yeah like I said I didn't add any powder
I didn't bleach the knots I'm not gonna
lead this week down with any kind of got
to be blue gel anything to lay the lace
down so yeah this is basically what I do
when I wear this week is I just adjust
the straps which you can already see
they were adjusted like I didn't even
lay no baby heads down on this week and
of course the sides will lift up the
only way that's gonna be secured is if
you use like one of those um what does
it call one of those law like stretch
little things that you sew into the wig
I can't remember what they call but
y'all know what I'm talking about um you
can do it that way or you can you know
gel it down but I felt like I don't want
to go through all of that because this
week is already really big and I'm
wearing it as a middle cut so I feel
like nobody is gonna see that but yeah
and look how natural this part is you
guys which is freaking crazy if I'm
looking this way is because I'm looking
in the mirror now one thing I did notice
is the curl patter in between the
bundles and the closure is really
different not really different like you
really can't tell but you can tell like
the curls are more defined versus these
curls up here so that's the only thing
that I would say about this hair but
it's definitely really really pretty
now as far as shedding I don't receive
shut in from this hair and tangling
actually the tingling is not
like you can still bring your fingers
through this hair even though it's curly
and it's still like it doesn't tingle
it might get a little bit snag but it
doesn't tangle like you can short enough
brush his hair and I feel like it would
just get bigger versus get entangling
but yeah also this head does not really
shed the only time I got shedding was
when I washed it and that was it um so
yeah I don't really have anything bad to
say if you're looking for some
affordable curly hair bundles definitely
check the description box for the links
to this hair I'll have them all in my
description box but overall I definitely
love this curly hair I wanted to try
something shorter because the last time
I had curly hair it was longer so yeah I
wanted to go for the short look so
anyway I wanted to go ahead and film um
you know a better version of what the
hair looks like because my last video I
did I did I wasn't really feeling how
the hair look and I definitely didn't
like the hair put it in the middle so
yeah I styled it to the side and this is
the part in space I didn't pluck the
pole anything like that I only added
some finishing powder and I also cut in
some baby hairs then the front just to
frame it and make it look a little bit
you know nice-looking and put together
so yeah I think in so many compliments
on his hair everyone thinks that it's my
head guys if I'm looking this way is
only because you know I can see myself
so so anyway I've been using to get the
curls defined because like you can see
in another clip when I just put it on I
was telling you I was telling you guys
about how I wasn't really
of the closure I felt like the curls
were much more loose and not really
defined it was more bushy than the
bundle hair so I tried out this water I
just mixed water in my aussie
conditioner into a spray bottle so i
just sprayed this on a closure and once
i sprayed it on a closure like the curls
were still a little bit loose so what i
did was i took my Moose this is by
Nairobi I freakin love this mousse I
don't know where the top is
but this moose right here I'm thinking
about using this combination like using
this mousse for my real head and see to
see how it will work out but anyway I
use this mousse on the closure to define
the curls to make them look like the
bundle hair and it worked you guys so
when I put it on I just you know put it
on the closure and then at the ends I
kind of like the this little thing like
I separated some pieces in like kind of
twirled it so when it dried it just
dried like this and the I don't know if
you can see this but the closure
definitely matches the bottom piece so
I'm going to give you like side-by-side
before and after don't - but but I'm
going to give you like a side-by-side
just so you can see the difference in
what life this moves and conditioner did
to this hair but yeah it's so freaking
fool I just love everything about it I
love the left because it just looks more
natural now you guys know if you watch
my videos like that then you know that
Ellie Annabelle hair is not new to my
channel I have done I have tried out
their hair before and I tried out their
would weave hair and that was an inches
- what inches was it that was in 26 and
so it was really long but I really
really love their hair and I wanted to
try out some more hair so I decided to
go to curly hair even though I've been
really loving the you know curly
lately as far as like it being like
human hair and stuff like that
but yeah this is what it looks like and
yeah that's pretty much it for this
video I hope you guys enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
