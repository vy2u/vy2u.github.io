with another wig review and this week
was them to me from hajiman hair so I'll
make sure I leave all the links in my
description box if anybody is interested
in the town or just want to check their
site out in general so yes well first
off this is not a whole wig it's a u
part wig which you probably know from
the title if I do include that in the
title this is my second a you call wig
that I will be redoing for you guys and
if you're a fan of thick hair and cakey
like kinky Yankee hair you are
definitely going to love this week
because when I tell y'all that this wig
is lit okay I really really like this
wig
so let's just get into with this wig is
all about and then I'll just answer a
clip of hired actors look basically this
is how I with my Street here all the
time yours so if you own your time
Santa's I'm so sorry but it just fits me
like hands in my hand behind my ear
especially when it Street and you just
don't know what to do but you still want
to list you at the same time this is
definitely a good everyday look you can
just put together in is so freakin
simple and the fact that I'm wearing
earrings because y'all know that I'm not
like a big jury person I don't wear a
ring to my ears I don't know I just have
it whatever I used to be big on erasure
let me tell you I used to be so big on
earrings and the glove like you could
not tell me nothing I so y'all are not
let me talking I'm just going to insert
the clips of me unboxing this wig and
everything like that so I hope you
enjoyed I will come back like after I
show you guys how I applied this one
I'll show I'll tell you guys what I like
about this week and when I so much about
this week so yes okay yeah so this is
the box and this is what the hair comes
in so
yes this is a u-part wig it's 18 inches
long and this de kinky blowout you part
so this is what it looks like and I'm
just telling you guys what this cap is
extremely big but it comes with two
combs like Nair the u part and then it
comes with two combs on each side like
by your temples and then it comes with a
comb in the back and addressable straps
now I'm just showing you the adjustable
strap that they give you to sew on and
they also give you two weight clips and
like the clip II clappy other weight
Clips I forget what it's called but now
I'm just trying it on so I can see where
to part my hair and I had too much I had
to leave a little bit of leave out
because the wig is too big so doesn't
that was basically the only way I was
going to fit my head but I'll get more
into that after this video but I'm just
basically showing you guys what I did
and how I put it on because a lot of
people like to see this type of stuff so
yeah now I'm just combing out my hair
and I'm going to part it and just braid
each side so in total I'm just giving
myself to brazenness basically so I can
insert the clothes I mean so I can
insert the combs to the braid so it can
be more secure but I always say that you
are going to want to utilize the combs
that they give you so be ready to sew
some combs into this week because it's
not going to work without the combs at
all unless you sold this down to your
hair which I know some people do do that
but I'm not going to do that because I
don't want this permanently so I'm just
taking the other side and I am leaving
my edges out only because if the wind
blows back or something like that I want
to have it cover up so yeah and I'm just
going to breathe bravery for bravery
breathe you know if you all have a
little head I wouldn't suggest getting
this week because this wig is huge it's
so huge I'm really like disappointed
with how big this is and it is supposed
to be a size small cap which I don't
think this is a size small anyway
but yeah so now I just I'm going to pin
the back up and I'm just pinning up look
like a bobby pin or you know however you
want to have your braid your hair it's
fine you just have to have the middle
you have to leave the middle of your
hair out because that's how you cover it
up to you part so yeah I'm just
suggesting the straps and I'm going to
put that bad boy on and I just put the
combs inside while I hook it on a braid
right there and as you see I had to use
some bobby pins because it was not
secure enough at all so that's why I
said that you're going to need to solder
combs on there because that's the only
way it's going to say like I said unless
you I'm so the whole thing once in your
head which I feel like that probably
would be better I'm in more secure
especially if you don't want to see your
cones in but you can do what I did which
I just body pendant and it was okay but
I had to keep on adjusting it like you
can see and for anybody who is wondering
I am all-natural I don't have any like
chemicals or nothing in my hair and I've
been natural for about almost three
years now and my head is just like
blow-dried I just pulled out my hair
I'll explain more about that in Part B
is so now I'm just combing it and I
think I'm going to straighten all of the
hands when I'm just putting that back in
because I'm better be like the last plug
that I flat on or that I straightened
and I was getting in your I was
listening to my music and yeah I was in
the zone
and I do stuff from the back because I
feel like it's much easier for me to
start from the back even though when I
straighten my real hair always stuff
from the side and work my way to each
side in the front and then I do the back
last is with but in this case I'm doing
the back first and then working my way
up so yeah if y'all wondering um when he
I heard she's around handles on 450 but
they really don't sell like the end for
success or like these are great so there
wasn't all this freaking time like these
heads have a shortage in them so like I
could I could plug them up and they'll
like be on the off button but they'll
still work so the whole time it's going
to off I'm thinking like it did work for
a hot minute but then I guess it just
failed only show I'm in trying to
straighten anyway I definitely think I
couldn't have got this hand much
straighter and remember I did not wash
the tail anything this is like the
history out of the pack and I just
decided to strain it but I'm pretty sure
of course you know you want to wash your
hair before you wear anyway I just do
their lazy oh but I'm yeah I'm pretty
sure if you watch this hair and then try
to go back and straighten it it was
straightened like a charm but I didn't
want it to be Destry anyway I feel like
I like how it came out cuz it still had
a lot of texture and kinkiness going on
so I definitely love the texture of this
hair it's really really pretty and it
just looks so natural so I'm not going
any special kind of direction or
anything like that I don't know if I
said that oh no I don't even know if I'm
repeating myself I feel like I already
said this maybe I just said it in my
head and then said I left so anyway yeah
yeah I think I did say okay nevermind
I'm tripping oh I was talking so much
you guys I don't even know where we
talked about half the time but let me
know if you rather hear me like talking
and not having the video on
forward or do you like it like this like
let me know if you want me to you know
you want to hear what I'm talking about
I don't really be talking about nothing
anyway but yeah I don't know I would
talk more if y'all that's what y'all
want so yeah this was a long process but
like I said I was real imitated by this
piece because I had a couple heads no
I'm a bobby pin it over and over because
it just did not feel secure so that's
basically what I'm doing and I'm not of
course I'm not going to show you I'm not
going to show you me when I'm talking
about show I'm not going to show you
guys me straightening the other side
only because it's just going to take too
long and you already saw me flip on one
side of the head already so after I
finish straightening the front of my
head and making it blend in better
well I don't even know if it's blending
in better because my hair got really
straight but you can't really tell once
I like all blend it in together that my
hair is more straighter than the wig but
you can't really see so as you can tell
I already went ahead and to the other
side now I'm just working on the middle
and I did not have enough leave out to
cover up the top of the hair see that
was my dilemma but I still just want to
hear in digitate one thing so yeah it
really turned out really nice I wished
it was smaller that way I could have had
more leave out but it just did not work
for me at all but I love this hair so
much you guys and it just looks so
natural oh my gosh so I did do my baby
hairs because you know our I had my baby
his lead and I am using it's got to be
blue this I don't use this for my baby
hairs on the regular I normally use
ecostyler the gel the green kind but I'm
all out so I'll just grab this and it
kind of works pretty okay I will say
that your baby is will be still late the
next day so yeah okay so that was
basically how I got this look and it's
just
simple and easy to do and it's just so
effortless and you still look poppin so
yeah and I just threw my earrings on and
I feel like my look is it's cute it's
like right a little whatever but cute
regular so anyway you guys okay so this
week I absolutely love like I said if
you're empty like that can't you text
your hair then you would really really
love this week now as you can see when I
flat on my hair it blends in so good
what's the 10th like you cannot even
tell where my hair is at all like this
legit looks like my hair I'm not even
lying I was so surprised like the whole
this company is on an issue because they
give you like the little adjustable
shred things they give you combs and so
in and they also give you a little clip
on comb stuff so in your wig tune so
like the quality of this half and like
it's on point it's let on beautifully
like and it still has it thick texture
this week is really really thick so if
you do have thick hair alright yo real
quick can we just talk about my shirt
right now look at these sleeves
why doesn't look like my shirt is uneven
I don't understand and then y'all know I
had to go back after I'm like edit in
this video and I had to go look at the
shirt like and looking two sleeves and
actually the sleeves are even so I don't
know if it's like my body that's even or
whatever the case may be but that that
that best looking room Treisman
okay I was grow up said like why is my
shirt gotta be like that really really
big so if you do have thick hair you can
wrap this it is still a natural because
I feel like it will blend in with your
hair really well because the wig itself
is thick already so don't worry if you
feel like your head is too thick and it
won't blend in is
definitely will because this week is
really really sick okay now the only
things that I really do not like about
this unit is the sense that it is so big
and if you've been watching me or you
watch my videos like that you already
know that I had a really tiny kid and
this way is just like even if you will
even if your head is not smaller you hit
a normal scientist I feel like this
would still be too big for your head the
only way you get in the way was when is
weak is if your here is extra big so I
see why they put like the adjustable
stress and like the wig clips inside to
make this week since you hit because
it's no weight like I'm just going to
tell you now that I'm not going to wear
this wig only because it's just too big
for me and I feel like even still if I'm
putting the adjustable straps in there
to make it fit my head what happens to
all this extra spaces right here it just
makes it to buckle and just look big so
to me personally I feel like this will
only work if you have a bigger size head
unless you don't mind the extra all the
extra space up here because if somebody
would like to fill your hands they would
fill the whole wig head that's my big it
is just like really really really being
I'm not really sure if you're standing
but yeah also um I wanted to I wanted
more leave out for my hair that was
another con that I ran into I wanted to
I liked leave it I don't like my leave
out to be like I don't know some people
like a lot of leave out and some people
don't like a lot of leave out now it's
basically impossible if you have a
smaller size to have a whole bunch of
leave out because the weight is so big
so you have to leave a little bit of
hair out in order for the week to really
fit I don't know they even smells right
but I had to leave a little bit of hair
out and for me leave it a little bit of
hell I'm really not able to
couple of the tracks in the top and also
the combs that they gave you like the we
clip combs that the ones that go through
sir you have to put those right here cuz
I had to add bobby pins as you can see
in my last clips that I showed you I had
to add bobby pins right here because it
was no way the wig was going to stay
down so in a sense like I feel like the
construction of this great wig is just
not on play at all and for this to be a
small camp size I would hate to see what
the medium or the large cat's eyes look
like only because this one is like
really big already and it's supposed to
be a small so overall I would recommend
this week only if you had a bigger side
to me I haven't got any shedding or
tingling yet and like I say I didn't
wash or anything I just flattened it
like so that's all I did and I feel like
it looks so good so yeah that's pretty
much it I really don't have too much to
say about this week but honestly I'm
kinda a little bit mad because I really
do love this wig um and I just like I
couldn't wait to like fix my hair so I
can like install it the construction of
the lens you part ways that was good
construction I wish that this week has
that construction but the hair because
the hair is just like it's really good
even if you wanted to curl this and you
want it like some big nice curls you can
do this with that wing because that's
how much head is this is a lot of hey
you guys this is all the head to the
front look at that this is a
so yeah and I definitely really really
love the length is not too long but not
too short so like if I did want it to
add some curls in here it would still
look nice and still have a nice length
to it but yeah that's it y'all for this
video if you don't have any questions
feel free to just leave it in my
description box and I will see you next
time I hate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
