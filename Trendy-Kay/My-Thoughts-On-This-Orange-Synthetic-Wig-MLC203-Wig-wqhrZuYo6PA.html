with another video and this week was out
but assistant to me but it wasn't sent
to me I purchased this week from Sam's
beauty and this is the MLC
203 and I have it in a color deep yx4
tangerine and if you follow me on
snapchat like I'd be letting y'all know
what's poppin on snapchat
okay and to me I thought this week was
so poppin so this is what the picture
looks like and it pretty much still
looks the same you can tell I did a
couple things to this week umm so yeah
we just won't get into like the
construction of this week and then I'm
gonna give you all my thoughts because
this week this week really played me off
so first off it has your typical
construction which is the two combs and
a frontal komen event and adjustable
shirts
I felt like this week is big head
friendly so if you have a bigger size
here you can fit it if you're here it's
when the smaller side like mine's you
can always just eject straps and
you'll be good to go I feel like it with
my straps adjusted like it's still a
little bit big like I would need to put
bobby pins on each side but for the most
part it is okay but it's a little bit
my head so yeah keep that in mind also
this day comes with soft lace and it is
a putt in the middle so the putt is not
like on the side or anything it does
come with the part straight in the
middle and this is what the part is
looking like which I am really pleased
with the part it does look really good
and overall like this wig lays a really
flat far as the texture of this week
this is a light Yankee wig it also is a
bit one the shiny side it's not too
shiny but I feel like you could like it
some dry pool or some dry pool did I
just say dry pool I felt like you can
add some dry shampoo or baby powder to
you know take the shininess out of this
week I really thought this was like it's
a perfect orange wig for room and it's
just not right now it looks it looks
cute but I feel like this way is
deceiving okay
first off they have two colors in this
week so the bottom layer is like a
height it's like a orange like neon
matter of fact I did I did a video on
some head that I died from levy hand
company and it was like this file orange
type of hair that's what the bottom
looks like it's like a fire orange oh my
god
this camera is not giving any justice
but it's too kind of orange tones in
this hair the bottom layer is like a
fire orange color like a red orange
color and then the top is just like that
nice orange that I've been looking for I
just wish that the orange that's one of
top was all the way through I don't
understand why they had to add this
layer orange not saying it is a ugly
color but I just
I just wanted this simple one color all
the way around I felt like they should
have just left it alone and just made
the whole week this color so when I got
it and you can't really see it in my
camera but in person is shocking like I
legit
spent like 45 minutes looking at this
week like what the hell because it just
was not what I was expecting
so X I got over the color being away it
was I was like okay it's been really not
that bad
it still looks cute so today as I'm
trying on the weight and prepping it you
know I pluck the pluck the pot or
whatever like I always do I do it to all
my wigs um just in case I didn't mention
you don't have to pluck the pot if you
don't want you to pot actually comes
pretty good it also lays really flat so
that's a good thing about this way but I
got tried it when I was like it the wig
was so freakin choppy like the cut of
this wig is not what's up y'all I was so
disappointed in the cut of this wig so
basically I had to go in and try to fix
up the cut but it's hard to cut in
synthetic hair versus human hair so I
felt like I had to stop because I was on
a verge of just messing this wake up so
much more so I tried to like even it out
but it's not really a hundred percent
even but yeah I will insert a clip of
what it looked like I try to I try to
get a clip of it but you can see what
I'm talking about clearly and when I
turn around you're going to see what I'm
talking about because it's the
choppiness is still there and I did go
ahead and flat on the ends because I
felt like when it was bad at the ends it
really looked really awkward and you can
definitely tell like you could tell you
could just see the choppy pieces and one
top of that the layer that's this darker
orange was actually straight and then
the top layer
had a been in it so of course I just had
to straighten the top part to blend it
and with the bottom part it was just a
mess I just don't understand this week
has so much potential to be Bom
especially with this color but they just
took it a whole different route like
they just I don't know what it was lazy
with it but the thought of this color
was just everything and y'all know my
expectations was really high for this
week and I think that's why I'm so
disappointed because I was literally so
pumped to get this wig like I even
purchased this weight on my own I
couldn't even wait for them to send it
to me I just was like forget it because
I didn't want it to be sold out again
and hence it is sold out on the site
again so if you did purchase this week
tell me your thoughts on this week in
the comment section I would really like
to know or if it's just my wig and I got
like a bad one yo if y'all follow me on
snapchat y'all know my feelings towards
this week like legit like I was so in
love and just pumped like I was ready I
visited this site every day hoping that
this week would come back in stock so
yeah like it was real the love for this
week was definitely real but you know
what got me was the color because I was
looking for orange wig that's why I did
that video of me dying that of a wig
orange because I wanted this wig so bad
but yeah I mean it's cool whatever I
still definitely love it it's definitely
picture perfect for sure it's my son
crawling in the fall also guys I forgot
to mention who's choking me put me in a
choke hold this shirt oh my god so also
I forgot to mention that this wig the
doctor is not all the way through so
it's darker around the hairline
and it's also duck root with the parties
but like far as if you was going in
between the wigs there's no duck root
like and I'm just want to turn around so
you guys can see what I'm talking about
I cannot have like fixed it but y'all
probably can't even see it but I'm going
to insert a clip because it's it was
definitely bad so if you can't see it
then that just means I did a good job
I'm cutting it
you
but I will give this with this just by
looking at it this is a beautiful wig
and you really can't tell like its
imperfections especially because I fled
on dating kind of cut the ends it
definitely still look good I still
really really love this color but I feel
like the wig can definitely be better it
just was not what I was expecting but I
definitely love the color on my skin I
still like the style I love the fact
that it's the middle part because you
all know what I like middle put's
so you guys know I definitely had to
come and give you the scoop on this week
and especially if you follow me on
snapchat because I was really hyping
this wig up and I know I made a lot of
people like it made a lot of people look
at it and want to get it as well and I
don't know if people got this and this
color or got it in like a different type
of color but yeah I just had to tell you
my thoughts on this wig so just beware
I'm not saying that don't purchase this
week it's like a bad wig but it does
have some imperfections that I'm just
really not too pleased with but all that
all like the look of this week
everything is definitely bummed I even
put the orange eyeshadow one yo-yo can't
really see it because I don't do too
much eye shadow and yeah I didn't want
it to be looking all crazy and so I
just did something slight but um I'm
definitely feeling myself though
especially taking like selfies and stuff
in his head it's just lit but yeah like
I said um if you decide to get this wig
don't think that you're just gonna put
it on your head and it'll be okay like
you definitely have to fix it up just a
little bit so a yes you guys that's it
for this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in a
comment section down below and if you
have this wig definitely leave your
thoughts on how you feel about this weed
in a comment section down below again I
did purchase this week from save
community and I'll go ahead and leave
all the links in the description box
just in case you want to try it out for
yourself but yeah like I said all the
noise is really not a bad week I
definitely definitely think the color is
fired for sure so yeah I'll see you in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
