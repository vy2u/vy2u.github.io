hey guys is Kay and I'm back with
another video so this is uh outrace miss
Exley front leg in a style of victims
low L straight and I have it in the
color dr 33 this week is like a remake
of the victim so in if you're not
familiar with the victim so in is
basically giving you the ability to part
your hair in 4 ways so you can have more
versatility with your head or and Stalin
it so that is one thing that I do like
about this wig I think that that was
like genius well me personally I've
never had it so in so I can appreciate
the fact that they made a wig out of the
victims oh and just so I can experience
it and stuff like that even though it's
not sewn but I mean it's close to it you
throwing out first off let's talk about
the construction because the
construction is very different from your
typical lace front always part wigs so
I'm going to insert a clip just so you
guys can see how the construction is an
inside because this clone commented this
comb because this way does this way
comes with a six six this week and comes
with six cones in total so if you give
you four cones in a front they give you
two cones in the back and it also gives
you an adjustable stress I'm not really
a fan a comb so then putting all these
combs in a wig I just don't understand
it but it six combs in total so if
you're looking for some security and
you're worried about chewy falling off
trust me baby you is not one fall up
also this week is synthetic and it is a
Yankee texture now this week comes with
two options you can either get the light
Yankee or like the blowout Yankee I
don't know the other the other wig is
also Yankee but I don't think it's this
year is more on and still here texture
but it's so yet easy to insane so yeah I
don't know if I showed you guys the
stock card but this is
what the stock heart looks like and I do
like the fact that they have dumpers
going all throughout this way so the UH
fruit is all throughout the wig and the
Yankee texture on this I thought was
going to be like really really heavy and
it's not it actually looks really really
natural so I can appreciate the texture
of this week and I also can appreciate
the fact that they put duck root all the
way throughout the wig the shadow one is
sweet for me is a no-go it's definitely
 it's not right now but it
does shed so be aware of that this wig
also came with little like white things
like right here and I guess that was to
basically show you guys where the pardon
is on the side yeah and for me I just
worked those things out because I didn't
it was interfering with me brushing his
hair and that kind that was I can it was
smart but it was done also
so because it's like how are you combing
the hair without you pulling that out
you can say so that was I don't know
that was weird to me it definitely go
for this week if you're looking for if
you're looking to wear multiple hands
down you would definitely love this wig
now I will say that if they would want
to do if they want to come out with a
vixen type of wig they should have went
full force with it and what I mean is if
they won't give you some part in four
way pardon they should have made the
hairline much better than what they did
I did go in and pluck my hairline the
hand line is miniature but I felt like
me plucking the hair line really helped
the headlines of natural so I did go in
and pluck my hairline I also went in and
cut baby hair and just molding today
with my
have to be blue Joe and this is the way
it came out which I can really
appreciate the headline but if the hand
lights up is really rounded and it
doesn't look natural at all another
issue I have with this head is trying to
find the part it takes it takes a while
just try to get your part situated to
style it how you want it to be so that's
another thing that I don't like also I
don't like the fact that it comes with
so many combs yes I've been having a
full week party I don't feel like this
week is any different from any other
synthetic wig in my opinion I feel like
the quality of the hair is still the
same in my opinion I do like to say that
it does comes duck roots so like I said
this is a good wig if you want to switch
up your hairstyle and things like that
with your wig but other than that
Daryll dues I mean you're not really
missing anything when it comes to this
wig
it is cute though and I like the color
also this week is around 18 inches long
so on a mannequin I meant on the picture
on the website they had like this week
with two braids and the braids were
literally so long so don't really go off
the picture really look at reviews
because the wage is not that long I feel
like if you plan it then place a price
on stop right here so yeah so guys
that's it for this video if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave in
my comment section down below
and like always I will see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
