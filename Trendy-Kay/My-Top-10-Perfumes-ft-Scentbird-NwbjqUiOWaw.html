video as this as you can tell by the
title is going to be my top 10 favorite
fragrances or perfume at this moment I
tried my best to eliminate some because
I just had way too many so I think that
I am confident in the 10 that I picked
so since we're talking about khrushchev
I would sent 3 sample fragrances to try
from December and if you're not familiar
with separate basically it's a
subscription based company and they send
you out little sample what cartoons
every month so it's like a monthly
subscription where you pick out the
person you want and they send it to you
every month you get to switch up your
cents so this is what the packaging
looks like and they send you out a
little sample size which is basically
equivalent to a rollerball or a little
smaller but I think you get a good
amount of perfume to let you the whole
month if you're like me I don't know
because I spray a lot of Kircher but if
you don't go crazy this was definitely
less you a month and basically what it
does is if you are not sure how a
perfume smells and you don't want to
commit to buying perfume because hire
designer and perfumes are quite
expensive so if you want to try it
before you invest all your money into a
perfume that you're not going to like
you definitely can try it and this is
where scent bird comes in it so I think
I think the monthly subscription is
$14.99 I'm not sure everything would be
a lesson description box and also on the
screen just in case any of you guys are
interested and I don't know if I
mentioned but they do sell varieties of
tombs in Cologne I think these are homes
I'm not sure but they are designer and
all their perfumes are fitted so they're
not sink or anything like that basically
they send me three set examples to check
out to see if I like any of them now I
do like one out of the three samples
that they sent me only because the
samples that they send me are on the
floral side so if you like floral
smelling scents then you will definitely
love these so the first one is what is
this one and basically you just twist it
up and then you spray and if you wanted
to come out you just take it out like
that
so this one is Tim rose by a wild child
and this is a really floral scent it's
okay but I'm not into like really slow
recent so anything like that so the next
one I have is my mess and it is called
Dahlia and vine and this is the one that
I like I all three of them so yeah this
one is still on the floor like sigh but
it's more of a sweet kind of scent the
groups with it which it's fun and I like
nest you know perfume so yeah um and
then the last one is the random a I
don't know how you pronounce this for
you now before I get started my scent is
more on the sweet side I like sweet
smells I know some people really don't
go for the sweet smells because they
feel like it's too immature for them or
they feel like it gives them a headache
but me I'm all for the sweet smells I
love to smell edible it's just like I
love it so yes that's my type of smell
yeah if you're anything like me you'll
love these perfumes I will not set you
up like I'm about to put your be okay so
yes okay so this is not like going to be
in no type of order like from our least
favorite to my favorite I think this is
just like the ones that I wear the most
that gets them
to use as a right now mute and I'm not
one person I'm not like a one fragrance
or Christian type of girl like I
switched my smell up every day like I
know some people have just like one
signature smell and that's what they say
work that's what they know and yet
that's not me so the first person I'm
going to start with is by Katy Perry and
it's called me young and if you have not
smelled this y'all need to smell it it
smells so good and the packaging is just
like a plus but I don't know y'all can
see that but I uses the crap out of this
it's wrong just sweet like like it
really really really smells good I don't
know if I'm going to put the notes up
for you guys because I'm really bad at
explaining stuff so yeah I'll leave the
notes on the screen I think but this
smells really really good and it's
definitely less long on you so if you're
the type of person that loves like
fragrances to live longer you I
definitely recommend this and it's not
expensive at all this is fairly cheap so
the next one is fancy by Jessica Simpson
and you can tell that I really really
really really really love this perfume
because it's almost gone so I definitely
need to read up but and if you have not
heard of this perfume where have you
been this person is has been out for a
while now I first bought this person
when I was in high school I do believe
or maybe like some years after high
school I really can't remember in a
distant is also alone lesson this thing
is powerful you're this is very very
powerful and it's very very strong but I
freaking love this perfume oh my gosh
and I will continue to spend my money on
this fragrance because this is like my
all-time favorite and never
pointsme at all but yeah this is also on
the cheap side too I guess like
celebrities celebrity fragrances are you
know cheaper than a designer fragrance
of course playa this was affordable and
one next one since is a trend here I
guess I'm going to do like a low-end to
high-end umm so yeah this is and it's on
many and small most of you almost all of
you should know what fragrance it is or
what perfume this is so yet this is
fantasy by britney spears and this was
one of my very very first persons that i
ever owned and I've been hooked ever
since
and the bottle is so cute basically it's
like a hot paint and it has like green
stones like green rhinestones all
throughout the bottle this is a little
one I think this is like I don't even
know what's who else this is old I am a
huge fan with Britney Spears and her
tunes I freaking love all our patrons
like she don't do no wrong in the
perfume Department so yeah she is the
bomb when it comes to creating sex iswe
all because her career is at one point
but this is one of my favorite favorite
favorite is perfume from Britney Spears
that she ever came I went next is pink
sugar by aqua aqua I forget but picture
that I forget who it's by I know a
sucker for a I can't remember but I'll
leave everything and want a screen of
course but yeah this is what it looks
like in you freakin guys this wasn't um
this wasn't expensive as well they sells
this and also sold
I don't know well she can find it's
wrong but I definitely know that they
said listen Ulta they might not answer
for as well but this is just like a
whole
a level type of sugary candy smell it's
like really really sweet super super
super sweet young so I'm wanting y'all
like this is and this led so so so so so
long but I definitely love this so if
you love sweet scent too you'll love
this one this one probably has to be the
strongest between these two these two
out of all the sense that I'm going to
show you all the perfumes that I'm going
to show you these two has to be like the
sweetest of all sweets these two so
sweet so yeah this is another one that I
really really like and this bottle goes
a long way and I don't even think this
is the biggest vial this is 1.7 slow elf
so yeah and I wear this quite a lot and
I haven't even put a dent in it yet so
yeah this one is like really really if
you follow me on snapchat then you see
me snap about this when I first got it
and it was a while ago but y'all know if
y'all follow me this is what it looks
like and the packaging itself is just to
die for your that's one of the main main
reasons that I either wanted to get this
person because I just like the way it
looks but when I smelled it I was like
oh my gosh it like smells legit like
really really good and sweet of course
because you know I'm a sweet bitch so
yeah and this is Viva La Juicy to crave
so if you're like into like the Juicy
Couture perfumes because they got like a
whole line of Viva La Juicy like gold
viva la juicy see crazy Villa juicy La
Juicy like they had like a whole bunch
and surprisingly like all of their Viva
La Juicy lines things smell so freakin
good they also had Viva La Juicy Couture
for the Viva La Juicy gold one of them
it smells so good and I
to get my hands on that one but this one
it smells like fun in a bottle I swear
like it smells so freakin good and I'm
sorry I can't like really describe what
it smells like
but it just smells sweet just know that
it smells sweet and won so yeah it does
smell like a bakery shop and as you can
see like they got steam going on so it
definitely smells like a cupcake or some
sort of bakery type thing the only thing
this doesn't land so if you're looking
for something that's going to last you
throughout the day then this is not it
this probably lasts me around like three
three maybe three to three hours and
then it does to fade away
I'll give it like four hours four hours
tops
this lets me but if you're looking for
something that's lasts longer and you're
probably not going to like this one but
still it is very very good it smells
really really good I think I also
snapped about this as well and this is
BA Chanel and it's the Coco Mademoiselle
now this is more like the groaning sexy
but still sweet in my opinion like you
can definitely smell the sweetness but
it's more mature so yeah if you like
more mature sense but still with like a
hint of sweetness you'll definitely love
this one this one is just like the bone
next I had the UM YSL black opium which
smells so good and I got this as a gift
from my sister
because I was just like somebody that it
gets this for me for my birthday I don't
know if she got it for me for my
birthday or Christmas I can't remember
but y'all I don't really wear this one
that often but it's definitely one of my
favorites it's like a really unique
smell and that's what I like about it
like this really really unique and I
kind of like unique smells so yeah if
you guys have not
heard of black opium by ourselves we'll
check it out because it's lit so yeah
this one isn't really as sweet as some
of the other ones that I showed you but
it definitely has a sweet scent to it
but it's more like musky than anything
so since we're talking about yl perfumes
the next person in my head is by Y cell
as well and this is the Mon petit and
this one oh my gosh I got this from all
tub yeah I got this from all so this is
what it looks like it just looks so
dainty and girly and how the bottle
looks is basically how it smells so
girly and sweet
now I gravitate towards this a lot like
when I'm going out I feel like it's
definitely more of a day scent but low
in Chinese what I spray this on in the
morning and the night whenever when I'm
going out so this next one is by Lancome
and it is they're these is their la vie
est Belle I think I'm saying it right
but this is what it looks like and y'all
mmm
Jade you know wrong when they made this
personal it smells divine like when I
say this person is everything and I'm
boosting it so much and you're right
like well why you ain't get a big bottle
get I need I still have some left
perfume is not cheap yo I just want to
let you know like it's not cheap at all
so anyway around buying a big bottle I'm
all for it and you know this has been
satisfied me with my little rollerball
and you see I still got like a lot left
but it's like these two I don't know why
they remind me of each other and they're
the same color I swear like these are
almost identical so yeah if you don't
want to spend a lot of coins on the
Chanel one definitely try this one
and this one is doing exercise but it's
not expensive it's not like Oh deep
sources like fishing i won
but yes this right here is love in a
bottle y'all it smells so good you know
just to dance that that that said this
goes with my body chemistry like so well
it's like ridiculous how is it smell
yeah this is indigo by next and this is
what it looks like and if you follow me
on snapchat I've snapped about this per
trim as well too and y'all this is like
the best out of their lives like this
indigo one is the best and this is still
like it's a flurry type set and like I
say I'm not really a fan of the floral
scent but for some reasons it's just I
just gravitated towards this smell and I
don't know I can't might tell you what
it is but it does smell like a hint of
floral but sweet it just has like a
combination of goodness up in here
but it smells so good and it's different
and I like fragrances that's like gives
me my knee which is sweetness but still
in a unique type of way if you do them
same like something that you don't smell
often and this is definitely it so yeah
that is indigo by nest and this smells
good I met this is like right here at
this point so I'm definitely going to
have to get a bigger bottle of this so
yeah that's it I hope you enjoy and if
you like me and like sweet smelling
scents then you should definitely check
