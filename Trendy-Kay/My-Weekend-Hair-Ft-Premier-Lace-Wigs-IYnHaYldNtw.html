we together I moved on for the better
don't you ever I went down but whatever
in there some people make the work
hey guys this is Kate and I'm back with
another video of course this week was
sent to me from a premier lace wigs and
I'll leave all the links and everything
and the description box just in case you
guys want to check out this hair or just
head that they sell in general so if I'm
looking at damage because I'm looking at
my phone so let me tell you about this
wing and I also insert clips of what the
wig look like originally and everything
because of course this way did not come
like this so this is their loose curly
Indian Birmingham and instead 360 at
least week and if anybody is unfamiliar
with what a 360 lace wig is it just has
at least going all the way around so it
gives you the option to pull the head up
if you want to win a ponytail it just
gives you more option more styling
options so this is a hundred and fifty
percent density the hair color is a
natural color the lymph is 22 inches the
camp size is a medium so that's
basically it like I said this is 22
inches when I was also the hair line was
pre plucked I did not bleach my nights
and I also denied pluck out my hairline
because I felt like and look natural
anyway I did go here a little bit of I
did a little bit of finishing powder
because I don't know it really looked
good without the finishing powder but I
was being extra so I just said I just
put some in there but yeah this is what
the party looks like that's what the
headline looks like like I said this
already comes a pre plug and I did not
cut the baby hairs or nothing like that
I just used some of the baby hairs I
really didn't styled a baby his hot
normally do but for the most part the
headline looks really natural now when I
received the hair I did get some shine
inch tree out of the pack also when I am
i meant when i received the hey I think
I got like one strand when I was running
my fingers through it besides that it
didn't shed straight off the pack now
when I watched this week it did shed a
little bit but it's nothing
worried about in total I probably got
like five strands of him but that's not
bad at all so it's men who shot and
didn't shed a lot and what I was as far
as tangling I have not received anything
Lynch from his head and I've been
wearing this hand for two days now and I
still have not had any issues with
tingling whatsoever I'm when I first
received this week it did come in a
loose curl patter and I'll show you that
our insert clip so you guys can see what
it looks like but it was pretty but I
really don't like how to curl patter and
dry after like I watch that everything
maybe because I was rushing and I put
the blow dryer into it so he dry faster
but I'm pretty sure if he was just to
leave it alone and let it edger I
probably would drive really nice but for
me because I was rushing I really went
away this week I just like blew dry hair
but not with the comb but I just like
put heat on the hair so it can dry fast
them I didn't like how it look so I just
went ahead and installed it on my head
and I didn't use my got to be glue job I
met Nigel but the holding spray to hold
down the lace so once it was on my head
sorry if you hear a whole bunch of noise
but I do have company upstairs so yeah
and then I went in and kind of like
straightened it a little bit so I would
straight for a day and then today is
when I curled the hair and the hair
curls beautifully it also holds a curl
really well Zoara
but anyway this is what the hair is
looking like and alls I did was take my
flat iron and I just put some curls in
it and I also rolled the head with my
flexi rods in the front only in the
front and I left it in for probably like
30 minutes while I did my makeup and I
just liked the effect that flexi rods
give you and I feel like it just looks
so freakin cute like even though I
curled it I still can run my fingers
through it like I haven't got any
tingling in the nape area all day and I
said I slept was our waters head and a
low ponytail and even when I took it out
the ponytail like still no tingling
which I was really surprised about but
yeah this wig is yeah I really like this
week so anyway that's it for this video
I hope you guys enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
