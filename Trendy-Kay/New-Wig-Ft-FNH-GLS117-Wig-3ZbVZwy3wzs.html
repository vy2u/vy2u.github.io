hey guys is Kay and I'm back with a
another video so this video is going to
be on this hair and this hair was sent
to me from a Friday night hair so I'll
go ahead and leave all the links in the
description box just in case any of you
guys aren't interested I'm going to make
this video really quick because my
battery is going dead so this is the GLS
117 and I have it in a color 1b this is
one of their annuity units if you're not
familiar with Friday night hair of
course this is a synthetic lace front
that's what most of the wigs are our
synthetic lace front wigs
I feel like this wig is a normal size we
camp so if your head is on the bigger
side or if it's sort of smaller side I
feel like you can get away with this
week either way just adjust your traps
to your hair sides or if your head is on
the bigger side just don't adjust your
stripes at all so yeah this is a lot of
hair it definitely is a natural type of
hair and yeah all that did was pluck out
the curls and this is my end result
I also added baby hairs to this week and
just you know I didn't want to part it
because Friday night hair the lace you
really don't get a lot of parting space
so I normally just flip the hair over to
either side and this is just how I'm
wearing it I did get a lot of chatting
from this wig as I was finger combing in
it so be aware of that
now this isn't like a wig that you comb
or brush or you know stuff like that
because it is such a tight curl but yeah
I didn't really struggle like a finger
combing the curls oh I mean I do get
snakes but it wasn't really a big
struggle but I did get a lot of hair as
I was finger combing the wig out and as
you can see I'm still getting
here I don't know if you can see that
but yeah I'm still getting a lot of
shouting so as far as tingling of course
it's curly synthetic hair so I would try
not to really comb it or brush it or
really run my fingers through it because
it will snag or get tangle and shedding
you do get tangled I met you do get shot
in whoop this week okay guys so I'm back
and my camera did so while my camera was
dead I was playing around with his head
and I put it my part of that in the
middle and I actually like it parted in
the middle this is how much part in
space you get which is not a lot but the
part in like the part itself looks
really natural I just wish that it was
longer so anyway back to this hair this
hair is a lot of hair it's definitely
really hot but I wanted to show you my
shirt I wanted to basically show you
what this hair looks like before I cut
it because I feel like I want to cut it
I'm scared to only because this looks
really really pretty you guys but why
not so let's just cut it I'm thinking
about cutting it into like a short ball
but I don't know how that's going to
look it's probably gonna look freaking
crazy I should just leave it alone cuz
look that looks just looking kind of
crazy
I don't know see in my face
it's already gettin fat because y'all
I'm getting fit yo but um I don't know I
might leave it alone I don't know but I
mean I already did my video on this so I
could cut it but then it's like what if
I want to wear this again and just rock
it like this okay I'm gonna cut it I'm
gonna cut it oh no I'm not one kind of
I'm not gonna cut it
okay take all right so I don't know you
guys I'm not gonna cut it
I changed my mind just because I love
the way this looks it's just like giving
me that natural vibe and I don't really
wanna mess it up because I feel like if
I cut it I might regret it so yeah
that's pretty much it for this video if
you guys have any questions feel free to
leave it in a comment section down below
also if you're interested in this wig
I'll go ahead and leave all the links in
my description box just in case any of
you guys are interested and yeah that's
it I would ahead and cut it just because
y'all know me oh I cannot sit still and
when I see a vision I just want to go
for it
so yeah I actually like the left though
yeah this is definitely cute
again I liked it longer but I think this
short is doing something like I like
this little bulb cut look so I just want
to see so I just want to see like how it
looks in the middle I midnight in the
middle on the side
you
I don't know how to beg is but I'll show
you the back let me flip it back over to
the middle
I definitely I don't know like and the
mirror is giving me such a better vibe
versus like looking in the camera why I
don't know once I like edit and play it
back maybe gonna be better but I don't
know like in the merits I don't know
what Bob is giving me but I like it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
