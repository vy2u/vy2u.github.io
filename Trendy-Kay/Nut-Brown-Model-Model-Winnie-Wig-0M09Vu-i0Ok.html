let me in it imma get you switch in
different position hey guys so I'm back
with a another so I was sent this week
from a glamour trust I will leave as a
link in the description box as well as
links to you know this week and
everything like that but this is the
model model premium 7 star least front
wig and I have it in the style Winnie
and I have it in a color SP nut brown so
this is what the picture looks like and
originally I wanted the green but they
didn't have the green anymore but for
some reason I want to try green hair but
I just cannot get my hands 1 green hat
like a style that I want no it can't be
like it has to be iced out and I'm
feeling that goes with the green so I
just decided to get this one and I also
have another way in this color that I'm
gonna be doing a review one but I don't
know I believe this color I mean I don't
know I do not get any tangle in I have
received a little shedding but I guess
it's only because I cut into the
hairline a lot of people been asking me
to show you guys what the wig looks like
originally before I do anything to it
and also to show you guys how I style my
units before I wear it so yeah of course
this week did not come like this I did
do some alterations and y'all know I had
to do my Old Faithful because for some
reason I just like the way that this
looks when I cut like the little side
bang into it so yeah so if you want to
see how I got this look then just keep
on watching it ok so before I get
started
this wig has to
homes in the front you can see that two
comes in the front one on one side of
the part and then the other one is like
way over here I guess this will a niche
like your temples on the other side
because this distance should be a side
part and the part is on the left side so
if you like your parts on the left side
you will definitely like it this week
and this is what the party looks like
which it is not that bad at all
they also give you a comb in the back so
they give you two combs in the front
they give you a comb in the back and
they give you a just a bull straps I put
my adjustable straps to the middle so
yeah and this is the wig fresh out of
the package the only thing I did was cut
off the least I did not tamper with the
part whatsoever and I don't think I am I
think I'm just gonna add concealer I
meant
finishing powder into my parts before I
put this one everybody eggs what I use
to lay down my edges and I use the Eco
style a professional styling gel the
olive oil one I feel like the argan oil
one really doesn't hold my hair that
well so I do believe that this one is
stronger than all olive oil it's like a
better whole this is how my hair is
braided down for now and I don't have
any of my hair out and I breathe in my
head so tight I breathe it like
everything up in there so I don't know
if I'm be able to get no edges out but
we'll see so okay I'm taking my eco
styler gel I'm no because the mirror is
over here but like I'm saying I normally
water to my edges and then that Yukos
college oh but it's what I want so
basically what I'm doing is I am laying
my edges down for this week so I'm just
placing my edges how I want them and
it's just gonna be out so and I don't do
the whole thing I just fixed my edges
where it's gonna be showing I think I'm
like this over this way this could all
change you guys because I'm real like
picky sometimes so this is how I have my
edges late and now I'm just going to put
this bad boy on y'all
so I have the week 1 and yet this um
this week actually fits my head pretty
good I don't feel like it's really tight
but I feel like it's nice and secure so
if you have a smaller size head you'll
definitely love this week because it
does fit but I don't use the combs
because I feel like the combs y'all know
how I feel about these combs these combs
be ripping out your hair so and if they
not ripping it out they thin and they
definitely is thinning your edges so
don't use these combs I can't speak for
everybody head because I know some
people would love to use combs but
personally for me I do not use these
combs because they put all my heads up
like I don't like none of that I want my
edges so after I had my lease place to
where I want it to be will my parts I'm
going to add my concealer and another
thing is this is kind of like rounded
hey guys so my camera cut off on me but
like I was saying feel free to leave
some of your hair out in the front if
you want chewy
to look more natural and yeah I already
took it upon myself into a concealer
into when I consider but my finishing
powder into my part you couldn't see it
only because I didn't know my camera had
cut off on me so I didn't film that but
I am just cutting away until I get my
desired look and it doesn't even matter
if the front is long or not it still
looks bum but you know I gotta be extra
and do some whole extra stuff and cut on
a wig so I do like this week you guys
but the only thing that I don't like is
the back of the wig it really turns me
off and I don't really know about this
color but the style and everything is
really nice and I'm just cutting into I
get it how I want it to be so yeah I'm
just like real extra but it's cool and I
got a hair all over my face and stuff
look at me
I think I'm cute
oh this is the end results and y'all
know this is like my old faithful I
don't know why I just love the way this
style be looking when I cut the bangs
but anyway this is what it looks more
quick I just wanted you guys to see what
a regular color looks like now I'm not
going to do any alterations to this week
only because I just showed you guys what
I did to this week but just in case you
were curious to see what it looks like
in a natural color I got you bro

don't see no shoot but I'm not saying I
have girl on his couch I
