Korea this is um from a Friday night
hair and this is the GLS 76 that I will
be reviewing and I have it in the color
one bit so yeah I already took it up the
up pic and I also cut off the lace if
you're not familiar with Friday night
hair um they do give you two combs and
the front
I'm out use of homes also yeah they give
you a comb in the back and it also gives
you adjust both straps and this is how
much lace you get they also give your
tape just in case you want it to tape
your wig down but I saw this and I just
thought it was so gorgeous now a
straight out the pack I can already tell
that this way is going to be a tangle
area because it just tables it also
sheds often but yeah this is what the
wig looks like so let's put this on I'm
gonna put this one in the front of the
camera and yeah I just had my hair
braided in two braids but for this
particular unit don't just wear it baby
hairs nothing like that I can see for
curly but not for this only because what
I'll put it on to you
you'll see
okay so this is all ahead to the front
and it is a nice thick unit and I also
love the length this lymph is around 22
inches long or maybe 20 I would say 22
inches long oh my god like can y'all see
that
okay so you see what it looks like when
I put it on and this is why I say that
you might want to leave some of your
hair out because it's just like it's the
the headlight really doesn't look
natural so yeah this is what the way it
looks like when you get it out the
package and it just has like these loose
kind of curls to it which i think is
really cute so I'm just going to take my
brush and I'm just gonna brush out I
know when I'm whenever I'm brushing my
weight say I always start from the
bottom just because it's less tension
this side is like really really cute
look at that this side I can already
tell so basically all the curls are
going this way so if you want it to wear
this in the middle um
and wouldn't look right only because
only because the curls are not going
like that
one is going this way and this one is
going that way so I'm what I would do is
I would definitely wear this wig to this
side
okay so this is definitely how I with
this unit I'm the only problem for me
with this unit is the fact that it's
shutting in it's um it is tingling I
feel like my might be defective on what
um your wig might not be like mine's um
and if this does happen and you do
decide to order this wig um I know
Friday night hair has a policy where if
you're not happy with your wig I think
to give you seven days it might be seven
days to return the wig don't cut off the
lace and you can like get a new wig if
you're not happy with it
so that's always a good thing so this is
what the wig looks like it's not
shedding anymore
it's like two strands now so it's gotten
to slow down on the Shannon but y'all
this way is really really cute look at
the head let me show you guys what this
looks like all the way around so this is
the front this is the side
this is the back
can this is the other side so let me
show you guys what the half-up half-down
looks like cuz more than likely I'm
going to wear my hair like that with
this week I do like it inside but I just
want to see what the heads up half down
looks like if you don't want it to look
Wiggy you're gonna have to pull some of
your hair out so home so I'm back and
this is what it looks like half up half
down and y'all this looks so cute and it
looks so natural even though my head's
not on the front but look at that like
this little hair style is so cute I love
this hairstyle with this wig yo so yeah
so yeah you guys this is it for this
video overall I do like this hair I just
am not really a fan of the shedding on
the tinglin is not even my concern it's
more so with the shut-in but I like this
week your wig might not be like mine's
when you get it I don't know but um I
still really do like this wig um I'll
leave Friday night hair links in the
description box if you have any
questions about this wig feel free to UM
leave it in a comment section I love you
boos and I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
