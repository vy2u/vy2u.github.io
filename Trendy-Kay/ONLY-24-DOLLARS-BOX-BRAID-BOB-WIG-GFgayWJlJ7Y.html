another wig review and this is basically
like a bub a box braided Bob wig and
this is from lace front expressions wait
a second is this out right and I have it
in a color number two I did purchase
this wig from wig types a calm I will
leave all the information and links
where you can find this made in the
description box so this week does come
with two combs on each side it comes
with a comb in the back and it comes
with adjustable straps now I do feel
like if you have a normal to larger
sized head then this wig will fit you
perfectly when I receive the unit this
is basically how the unit will look the
only alterations I did to this unit was
cutting this side just a little bit when
I say a little bit like I actually mean
a little bit so after I cut it I did
burnt ends and I went through and burnt
some more ends that I felt needed to be
burnt because um the ends do look like
they are lightly burnt but to me it kind
of looks like it would eventually start
to unravel okay so the reason behind why
I cut off um those couple of strands of
braids on the end was because it just
looked really funny looking to me this I
came looking like really good and full
right here and then this side kind of
just like it like it didn't look right
at all so I wanted to cut the pieces off
and also by me cut in like the pieces
off I decided to wear a side part only
because now the weight is kind of uneven
but even still a middle cut it didn't
look right because as I said before this
I was very full and then this side just
looked real skimpy so I was like
No a side part is good so this is what
the picture looks like and the wind
doesn't look I mean it's okay but when
you first look at this like you look all
happy and stuff like you wouldn't be
like oh like let me get that but when I
saw the price I was like what do I have
to lose I did pay like twenty four
dollars for this wig and I was like well
let me just try it out because my
experience have not been that great with
braided units so I'm like third time's a
charm so I feel like this week hands
down is definitely better than the
previous two weeks that I have reviewed
also this week does come with a skin top
you do get a little bit of lace in the
front area and this is lace from ear to
ear I did cut off the lease and then
it's skin type behind the first braid
you
like this unit versus my last two units
the scalp definitely is a plus I did add
concealer into the parts just to make it
a little bit more known because you
really couldn't I mean saying you really
couldn't see the parts that well so I
think concealer did the trick I'm
normally I don't add concealer to my
weights but this one took concealer
really good it really made the wig look
even more realistic wasn't expecting
this wig to turn out good and as good as
it did to me it really looks natural not
that natural but natural enough well you
probably can pass for a box braid having
box braids the only thing I don't like
is I don't like how right here it's like
no type of scalp it's only really in the
top area now I don't believe that this
head this way it comes with baby hair I
can't remember in my but if it did I
probably just cut it off I definitely
think it's worth the $24 are you if you
are interested in the box braid bulb
look right now only thing I just feel
like it's a little bulky right here I
feel like it could be a lot flatter
maybe it's just me I'm and I did start
to add some of these jewels I am going
to finish adding them but I just wanted
to hurry up and do this video because I
was actually excited
um but yeah as far as like if you won't
put these on this unit I put them on too
because if you try to put them on one is
it won't work so if you wanted to see
what this unit looks like up this is
definitely what it looks like which i
think is really cute the only thing I
would say about me when this unit like
this is I would have to cut this side to
make it even with this side because it's
just like really uneven and really
noticeable when the hair is up but I
might just cut this out to make it even
and I really like how the way that looks
like this
but yes I think this week is like extra
fun and cute and I really enjoyed I'm
doing this review for you guys just
because I finally found the wait that's
not half bad you guys and I don't feel
like I wasted my money because then
other ways was not cheap they was on the
expensive side and I paid $24 for this
one and it's definitely constructed way
better than the ones I paid like 50 and
you know all of that stuff so yeah it's
like half the price of previous ones
that I've paid so yeah you guys if you
wondering how this wig looked and you
was debating on whether you should get
it or not
I definitely think that you should get
this unit because it's definitely worth
it like it's it's it's some stuff that
needs to be fixed but once you fix it it
turns out really really cute so that's
it for this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below and tell me
what you think about this wig I actually
like this you guys I don't think it
looks fit for the price that I paid so
yeah it's not it's not perfect but it's
definitely a nice unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
