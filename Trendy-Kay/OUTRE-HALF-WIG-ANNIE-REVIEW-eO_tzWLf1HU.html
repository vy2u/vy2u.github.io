not your typical more the typical wigs
that I do this is a half wig and this is
by outre and it's called an e so this
week it's like so popular on YouTube and
I'm just having on the bandwagon and you
follow me on Instagram I did post a
picture of me when this unit and a lot
of people wanted to know what it was
so yes it's the Annie week by our tray
and before I get into talking about this
unit I just want to give Carly hi Carly
I want to give her a huge shout out
because she was nice enough to make me a
better for my channel which I never got
around to doing and she may be one and
yeah I'm so thankful for that and I
really really really appreciate so yeah
she is also a fellow youtuber on here so
um her youtube name is Carly smiles so
if you want to go check her out go check
her out and yes she does like these
videos and I'm all sorts of things she
has a lot of variety on her channel so
one two this um wig this is going to be
really quick because it is a half wig
and it's really nothing to say about it
I'm really except for the fact that this
wig is also this look like some real
sure-enough hair like what so basically
this is a synthetic half wig and
basically where head weights are is arm
they're made so you can pull out the
front of your head so it'll blend in
with the unit and yeah so this is like a
Yankee texture so basically what I did
is
i braided my hand back and I just left
the top section of my hair out see this
is where's my head so yeah this is my
hair right here and I didn't straighten
my hair anything like that this is my
hair blowdried and that's all I did
and this wig is about 18 inches long so
this is what it looks like I did weigh
this unit all day yesterday and I didn't
get it for like I haven't had any issues
with the wig tangling up on me I might
have got like a few snags but the wig
was not like Maddie in the back or
anything you see I can still wear my
fingers do it um it still has a lot of
body in it as far as shedding I do not
get any type of shedding um with this
unit and yet this thing is like the bomb
you got so yeah as you can see like this
just blends in with my hair so perfectly
like you really can't tell like it just
looks like it y'all I'm like in love I
want to buy so many more units like this
okay now about where I purchased this
weight from you can purchase this wig on
weight types back home but all of the
like all of the colors are like
basically gone so you'll have to go
somewhere else and look for this unit so
I went to my local beauty supply store
and they had any the price was $29.99
see these Beauty Supply stores really
get over on you that's why I like
ordering my hair offline because like
$30 for this like if you're serious like
really you gonna charge me $30 for this
where you can go
on the website and get it for $13 and I
was desperate yo so I just paid the $30
I will never again go back to the beauty
supply store to pay for this week I'm
going to search online for it and pay
that 13 dollars because that's just
absurd yes nothing else really to say
about this unit I can do like a 360 for
you guys so um I'll try to find this way
on another website for you I will leave
way types link down below just in case
you want to take a look or maybe they
have more in stock but I'll try to see
if I can search for some more units from
different planet this unit from a
different website and link it in my
description box but yeah if you guys
have any questions or anything about
this unit feel free to leave it in my
comment box down below</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
