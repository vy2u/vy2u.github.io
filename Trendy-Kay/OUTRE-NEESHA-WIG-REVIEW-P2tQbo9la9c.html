weight this is but anyway this is our
trades lace front lace front wig why
don't I just say that this is all trades
lace front wig and the style name is
Nisha and I have this in a dr 30 so this
is what the hair looks like on the model
which I thought it was absolutely
gorgeous okay so let me just start by
saying that I seen this week a couple of
times
and I wasn't too pressed to get it
because um it looks like I don't know I
just wasn't too pressed to get this unit
so um I saw a review on this wig and you
know I think her name is Deidre but I'll
post her YouTube channel name right here
so yeah I was watching a hard review on
his wig and she just is funny
she made me want to get this unit so
yeah that's the back story behind this
unit and why I purchased it um this is a
gorgeous unit and before I get started
on this um I did purchase this unit from
way types calm I'm not really sure how
much it worth was I think it was like
$35 but I'll leave everything in my
description box and leave links to this
unit as well
this unit has two combs in the front a
comb in the back along with adjustable
straps either way if you have a bigger
head then this wig will fit you so
perfect because I have my straps
adjusted to its tightest and the wig is
still big on me so yeah that's kind of
like a problem for me yeah that's a
problem for me
this unit is yaki is a Yankee
sure it's like really really really
thick and it's a lot of hair you guys
like when I say it's a lot of hair it's
it's a lot of hair um I wasn't expecting
it to be this big in full I feel like
it's overpowering my face like this this
is this is just way too much hair for me
um it is a nice unit don't get me wrong
but I just feel like it's way too
powerful like it's like coming at you um
maybe if it was in a darker color I
would probably like it more but um I
don't know like I'm not sure like I
really I absolutely love this color on
me I've been really feeling um these um
honey blonde colors lately but this week
is really big like it's really full um
something I'm just not used to so yes
like so as far as the shedding and
tangling is concerned I do get a little
shut-in here and there it's not bad and
I'm pretty sure it's because I cut off
the lace but um but yeah it's not it's
not really bad shedding I haven't got
any tangling yet out of this unit I will
say that this unit is really really soft
and just like full and bouncy so yeah I
have not received any type of tangling
yet but definitely been getting some
shedding so it might be just for me like
like I said cutting off the lace but yes
it's coming it's coming up um so yeah
this unit is a ground I would say 22
inches
is maybe 20 to 22 inches long and this
is all the hair to the front and like I
said it's it's a lot of hair so if you
like that thick full type of look this
is definitely the weight for you um if
you're a fan of the Yankee texture this
is definitely the wig for you but I
think that is a really pretty pretty wig
but it just threw me off because it's so
much hair um and this week also is meant
to be a side part but I like my wigs
more towards the middle so that's how
I'm wearing it um
they do give you a good amount of lace
pardon again you probably will have to
pluck your part but I'm being real lazy
today so yeah I did not plug the part I
just put um some powder in my parts
which I'm not going to weigh it like
that I'm actually going to pluck the
part out but I just wanted you guys to
like get a feel of how the wig will look
but um but yeah I like my I like my
units when they're um I like my units
when I pluck out the part because it
just looks more natural so I am going to
pluck the part so I can feel more
comfortable wearing this but yeah
overall is really a nice unit it's just
absolutely a lot of hair um the color is
on point I wanted egg ombre all the way
what get out of town they have ombre
they got the dog I met on break they got
the duck roots all the way through this
wig so that's definitely another plus
because most weeks don't come with the
ombre all the way through the I met
most ways that don't come with the duct
root um all throughout the unit is just
mainly on the top area so that's
definitely a plus for me because I
prefer my units to have dark roots all
the way through so yeah let me um turn
around so you guys can get the full
effect of this unit so yeah overall um
this wig is absolutely gorgeous I just
think that it's a lot of hair for me um
but it's really starting to grow on me
as I wear it more but yeah if you're
interested in this unit I did purchases
from wave types calm and like I said
I'll leave the link in my description
box if you have any questions I'm about
this unit or anything feel free to leave
it in my comment section down below and
yeah oh yeah if you're curious to see
how this week looks on the side I'm
going to show you that so oh so this is
what the unit looks like on the sides
and I like it on the side but I feel
like I like it in the middle better I
don't know maybe it's just me but um
because this part is just like it's like
real real real real bulky but um I said
what country real bulky but yes this is
how the wig originally comes as a side
pod so it is it is if you contain this
part right here this will be gorgeous on
the side like look at that but I don't
think it's no taming this wig like but
if I could get it to stay just like this
that is super pretty
so yeah this is what it looks like one
aside
hey guys I'm back really quick I know my
lighting sucks but I came back to show
you guys what this week this week looks
like after it has been flat hard so yeah
I was trying to flatten it out and I did
fix my part so that is how the part
looks after it's been plucked and um
yeah
anyway so yeah this is what the way it
looks like after I flat ironed it and
okay like I was saying I put my heat
setting at 300 and yeah it did not lose
is a yucky texture at all like it's
still really yucky um but yeah I feel
like I wanted the curls to be there but
it was just like you big but yeah so if
you guys were thinking about putting
heat to this hair definitely put it on
300 I know I put mines on 300 and it did
not lose a Yankee texture at all have
you hear anything in the background
that's my son um but yeah yeah hi hey
honey
what captain toy I'm trying to record
and you're messing me up laughs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
