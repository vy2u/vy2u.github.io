review and this is the wig that I'm
currently weighing on my head now so
let's get into the video so I received
this unit from ozo weeks and I had to
say I'm very impressed with their units
so they sent me a wig and I will insert
a clip of how the wig look once I
receive the wig but this is the
packaging that the wig comes in which is
really nice and it has all the
information and right here in front of
them okay so when I receive this unit I
received a brush to go along with it and
I really like this type of brush so yeah
also the weight paint inside of this
package in and they do put holes in it
cuz you know how once you put something
in like a ziplock bag and it's still
like heads the air inside of it so yeah
this has holes in it so when you put
your weight back in the bag it doesn't
like the air comes out basically and it
won't be all fat and stuff so yes and
this was inside of the unit they also
sent me a wig cap they sent me a ozo on
wristband and they sent me a little rose
looking thing which is really pretty
from looking at other people reviews I
think this is a bag I do believe it's a
bag yeah so it comes apart in it's a
baby and then they also sent me just a
card that says thank you on it so yeah
this is the stuff that came along with
this you
okay you guys so this is a full HD unit
and the cap construction for the inside
basically that they give you two combs
on each side they don't give you a comb
in the back but they do give you adjust
able straps so yeah the product name is
Kenya Moore full lace human hair wig and
it's LW 8:07 and the color of this unit
is a 1 B which is a off black and the
length of this hair is 20 inches and
this is where 20 inches come on me so
yeah and I had a cap size one and the
cap construction is a number 3 which is
a glueless lace cap and this hair
texture is not yaki it is silky so yeah
and if you forget what you order yeah it
will be right here on the front of the
box ok yeah so I'm like really really
really really in love with this unit um
it's everything like seriously like this
the one right here yo so yes it's pretty
affordable um I'm going to insert a clip
of how the wig looked when I received
the unit because this is not how it came
I did curl this unit basically in like
loose curls by re curled this part but
this is like the same curl that I had
for a couple weeks now and this unit
holds a curl really really good at like
this unit
curls very very well so yes this is what
the hair looks like so let me go here
and insert a clip so you guys just can't
get a feel of what the weight will look
like when you
receive it okay now as far as shut-in
and tingling I do get tangles or snakes
hand there but that's about it
I don't really receive shedding from
this unit at all like at all but like I
do get snakes hair and there but no like
major tangling from this unit at all
also this is a for least week so
basically it's least everywhere so you
can part it basically whatever you want
to so I just have the part in the middle
and this is what the party looks like
which I am absolutely in love with the
hair is so soft you guys like I'm sure
you guys will love and enjoy this unit
as much as I have because this unit is
on point um at first I was thinking I
wanted it to be a little bit longer but
after like when it because I have longer
units already this is pretty long for
some people but yeah I like the length
of this unit and this is basically a
everyday unit you can two-way straight
I forgot to mention that I did
straighten this unit and when I say the
unit was bone straight this thing gets
straight and it looks so good so as far
as like curling and straightening this
unit like it does good on both in some
you don't have to worry about your curls
falling or it nightstand in or you don't
have to worry about the hair not getting
straight because this head gets so
straight
and it's so soft like I love the texture
of this hair it's really amazing so
again if you are interested in this unit
check out Oso hair com I mean also would
check out also wix.com and I will leave
all the information and the links to
this unit in my description box so I
hope you enjoyed this video sorry was
pretty fast but I wanted to just get
straight to the point so yeah I hope you
guys enjoy and I will see you in my next
video

to tell you guys what I'm laying on my
lips and half the time I never even
remember when people comment it asks me
what's on my lips even on my Instagram
page so if I don't respond to you it's
because I forgot what I'm wearing on my
lips so yeah I am wearing 696 burgundy
blush and I think I wore this in one of
my videos but yeah so this is what this
is you guys and it looks like this so
