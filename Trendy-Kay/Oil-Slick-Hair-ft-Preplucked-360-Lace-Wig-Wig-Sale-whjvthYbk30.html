article ooh yeah you know I go get it so
baby L keep walk let it fly above it in
an L happen on a leash or derailing over
here Monsta Cho pretty has gone in a
chair you know I stand and saw what the
funny guy so I'm back with a another
review and this week was come to me from
while African hair I know some of you
guys may be familiar with Wow African
but their company is amazing so if
you're not familiar with chemical check
them out I'll leave their links in the
description box they have really high
quality nice weeks they are a little or
the pricey side so if you don't like
spending a lot of money or a week I
wouldn't suggest that you even go on
inside because I'm I don't to me
personally I also like their wigs are
very affordable they are a little bit on
the pricey side so um enough about that
let me just show you the packaging
everything and I will mostly for this
video just be inserting clips of this
hair but I am going to tell you what it
is
this hair did not come like this you
guys I did do this myself and I don't
have like a full-on tutorial but I do
show you the process of what I do this
was all like through child and her I
didn't really know what I was doing I do
plan on doing this look again and I will
do a tutorial on it when I do it and the
colors will be more and think I just
like this I feel like it trust and
believe I do like the way it turned off
I just which my color coordination was a
little bit more put together so yeah but
the quality of this head besides the
color and everything and how this hair
looks the construction the quality is
amazing is definitely worth the price so
if you do like spend a little bit of
coins on your hair definitely Wow
African
cuz their hair is amazing it you can
tell like it's such good quality it took
to bleach very well and didn't damage
the hair whatsoever the hair after I
bleached it it's like it never was
bleached that's how good this hair is
you guys so this is the packaging and
what I have in my head is there 360 360
wig it's basically like your 360 closure
and then you know you have like the
Western the WestEd hair in the middle I
do think I had some clips so I can just
show you the construction of the wig and
stuff like that also I think this is
Brazilian version Brazilian hair I do
believe but everything will be in my
description box just in case I'm wrong
I'll leave it on the screen the one
thing that is not really bad but this
week does have a lot of slight ways and
I had to take my got to be glue the
hairspray like the holding spray and I
just sprayed it on my hands and rub my
hands together and I just like slip down
the flyways and I also went in with my
wand curler and just put some heat over
it so it too might say and that helps
this wig out a lot
this is all the hair is on the send side
but I think thank you all for this week
and 180 percent density 180 percent
density yet so yeah if you want it your
weight thicker they do offer it to be
thicker whatever they're like this
density is definitely good if you want
to wear your hair straight if you love
weighing in history because if you
wanted to curl this and you want it
those big like nice curls and it to be
full you're not going to get this from
this week because it's just not enough
half of that unless you want to go in
and add your own tricks to it but I
wouldn't do that I would just go up in
the density like I said they do offer
180 percent density but I have no one no
intentions
and Carl instead it definitely looks
really nice sleek and straight and I
definitely love when it behind my ears
so yes this week is cute and this
lighting is not going to discolor any
justice because to me it's just looking
like this is green and red and that's
actually not even red it's pink but it's
coming off that color so I'll insert
clicks of what the color really looks
like you just can see the goodness of
this color of these colors and I'll
insert pictures of the hairline and all
of that good stuff so basically this is
just the construction of the wig and
it's three combs and the front one comb
in a bank with adjustable shrimp and
it's just 360 construction okay
guys so basically you can go to your
local beauty supply store or anywhere
that sells you know hair products and
basically I just got the Claro
professional BW - this is the bleach
package and they run you about like
three dollars so I 3ds I really don't
know how many I'm going to use but I
just got three just in case I probably
don't need all three but yeah I got me
some gloves I got my mixing bowl I have
40 volume developer because I want the
head to lighten really fast and bright
and then these are colors that I will be
using baby blue valley gem electric
blonde and neon pink so yeah never did
this before I'm about to see how it
turns out I have okay so now I'm just in
my bleach powder into my mixing bowl and
I use two packs of this because I didn't
bleach the whole head I just took pieces
basically and just chose where I wanted
to you know bleach to be so yeah that's
basically what I'm doing and I'm just in
the 40 volumes of
the 40 vows did I say volume I don't
know what I said but I'm adding a
developer and then yeah I'm just mixing
mixing mixing away mines was like a
creamy consistency it wasn't too watery
but it wasn't sick at all it was just
like in the middle so yeah I'm just
mixing make sure you mix this really
really good and just keep on mixing away
so now I'm using this aluminum foil and
I just cut up pieces or rip pieces
basically this is just to make the hair
change faster and then I felt like it
was just better because I was doing it
in sections so for me this just works
but it works better for me you don't
have to do this but I just chose to do
this and that's basically what I did to
all the hair and in fire I just picked
pieces I didn't do any hair in the back
and now this is how light it got the
hair and I left the bleach on for maybe
like 15 minutes so this is Fi edit the
color and like I said it turned out
really bright and vibrant and I really
loved the results and I loved his hand
like I said the hair was not damaged at
all it's not for everybody so if you
don't like the colors and everything
it's cool you don't have to like it
my style is not everybody's style but
yeah if you don't like this color just
look past the color and look at the week
itself which is beautiful the hair is
beautiful
this is proof that the hair colors
beautifully it's not damaged at all but
y'all know I love my colored hair I'm
just that type of person who just likes
