never heard of this company before it's
an invisible deep part wig the style
name is Luna and I have it in a color in
orange so this is what it looks like
y'all I love this week I don't really
know about the orange color I don't know
I'm just like not really a fan of orange
hair but besides the orange um it is
really really pretty I don't know it
something about orange with my skin tone
that doesn't look right
but um yeah I freakin love this wig so I
purchased this weight from wave types
calm I think that's the only place that
you can find this week is week types at
home if you know anywhere else that you
can purchase this weight
leave it in a comment section down below
because I would really like to know um
this way just became my favorite weight
I also had this wig and a color 1b and
I'll show you what that wig looks like
in a little bit but I just wanted to
tell you about this weight before I let
you guys see the 1b but yeah purchases
from Wiig types calm I will leave the
link everything in the description box
the only thing I would say about this
wig is it don't it doesn't come with a
lot of colors I think the only colors
that you hit that they offer is like a
1a 1b a - this orange color like um a
blind color like it's like a lot of
blondes mixed into one and yeah they
don't only colors and I'm like how could
you make such a great wig and not have a
lot of colors for it so yeah but besides
and not having a lot of colors all this
will be a wig that is like everyday week
everything
only a lace part you don't have to cut
off any lace it just comes with the lace
part it does have two combs in the front
I think like and it also has a comb in
the bank if I'm not mistaken
yeah and it has adjustable stripes I
have got a little bit of shutting no
tangling so yeah like this wig is
actually like really really good like
where did you come from the wig looks
exactly like the picture in my opinion
um and the only thing I did was finger
comb this week I didn't brush it or
anything the curls look so good just
straight out the pack um this week it's
probably like 16 to 18 inches long what
else is really nothing else to say about
this week um it's hella cheap like go
get it I think it was only like twenty
two dollars on weight types like this
wig is everything you're like look at
that the part okay so this is what the
part looks like um I had to do like some
serious plucking because it was
basically like no type of part when his
unit at all so yeah I'm going to come
back and show you what the UM
no I said I had a number one be it's
actually in number two that I have so
let me show you guys what that looks
like and I'll be right back
okay so this is what the way it look
like straight on my head yeah and I
didn't do enough for all the day it was
a finger comb it like this and look how
I just fall into place yo like what I'm
so yeah if you have any questions about
this unit feel free to leave it in a
comment section down below
um this hair texture is unlike the
Yankee it's kind of like it's like a
light a light Yankee but it is thick
it's nice and full and I love it like
this is my favorite hair right now like
look
I just love how it falls into place oh
my god
but yeah you would definitely have to
pluck this part to make it look like
something but yeah this is what the
front looks like this is what the side
looks like
so yeah I really really loved this unit
this is a sad part but I think if you
wanted to hold up man
oh it is a little bulky like up in
this area but that's fixable but yo like
this wig is so pretty like how the curls
follow the curls are so perfect to me so
yes if you have any questions feel free
to leave it in my comment section down
below again I did purchased this weight
from wave types calm I will leave the
links and everything in my description
box and I will talk to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
