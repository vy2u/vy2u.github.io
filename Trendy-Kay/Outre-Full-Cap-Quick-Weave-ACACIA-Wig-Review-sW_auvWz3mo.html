weight review okay so if any of you guys
follow me on Instagram I had this well I
was wearing this wig and one of my
pictures but that was like I posted that
picture probably around like a month ago
I'm not sure but um yes I absolutely
love this week in this okay so I was
trying to find a picture to insert so I
might insert a picture because I had
this wig for a while now and this wig um
I have no idea how you pronounce it but
I'm going to try my best
it is Acacio I'm not sure but it's the
outre um full cap full cap a quick weave
and I think the name is a Kashia not
sure I don't know but okay let's get
into this wig um like I said I had it
for a while now um and I did post a
picture on my Instagram so if you follow
me you can go check the picture out but
that was a while ago and then I start
wearing it but before when I first
purchased this wig and if I didn't
mention I'm pretty sure I didn't mention
this but um I purchased this wigs I
purchased this wig from Wiig types calm
and I do not know the price but I'll
link everything in the description box
because like I said it was a while ago
that I did purchase this wig um when I
first purchased it I did not like this
wig at all like I was like oh my gosh I
don't know if it was like the color of
the wig or I don't know what it was but
it grew on me I had to like keep on
playing with it these are one of the
weeks that you have to like play around
with and like
walk in the house with it just so you
can get used to it um I don't think when
I purchased this wig I shoulda purchased
um like a 1b like my normal color I
don't think I should've did color umm
but yeah this is the burgundy this um
wig is in Burgundy so yeah it does head
um it has a comb in the front and a comb
in the back it's pretty much like a
quick weave wig if you ever had one of
those before it's just a long comb in
the front and a long comb in the back
but I love this wig y'all I know I'm
like all over the place and normally I'm
like prepared but it was just like a
spare moment thing and I was like oh let
me do a review on this week because I
didn't do a review on this week and I
don't even think that um it's a lot of
reviews for this week if it is any
reviews for this week so yeah I've been
definitely um filling this wig a lot
lately like I really love this week um
now if that keep on winning I am glad
that I got this color but if you're not
really like a color person or you are
like stepping out of the box and trying
new things
um I wouldn't go for a bold color um I
would just stick with your normal color
like stick with the twos 1b1 but um yes
I absolutely love this wait you guys
like this is so cute like I said you
have to keep like playing around with it
um let me show you the back so yeah um I
have my hair and just a ponytail in the
back I didn't feel like braiding my hair
down but yes I absolutely love this way
it kind of looked like one of those boy
cut lie
back in the day kind of cut it's really
pretty so um like I said I will link
everything in my description box like I
said this is um out Ray's full cat quick
weave um I have no idea how you
pronounce the name I don't even know if
I'm saying it right yo but yeah
everything I probably will post a
picture so you guys can actually see
what the wig looks like on a model like
if you was to go and buy it so you won't
be like lost or anything like that but I
love this week I think it's so cute yeah
it took it took me a while cuz it's like
really had to grow on me but I like it
so I'm still on my um um oh yeah I'm
still on my um my short hair streaked
y'all so yes I'm rocking a short hair
and another thing it's like the weather
is breaking and I feel like sometimes
the short hair I meant sometimes like
the long hair is too much so like get
you a short wig and yeah you don't have
to worry about all of that and if you
want it looks like and um I don't know
okay so yeah you guys tell me what you
think about this wig yea or nay
um I like it though y'all um but like I
said you have to keep playing with it
because you can umm see my camera is
messing me up cuz I don't know what side
come work okay see like you can do it to
the side if you want to or like have it
in your face
yeah so I think that you just have to
like really just like play around with
it I think it's a really cute wig um

anything else to say
