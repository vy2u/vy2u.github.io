so I have a another video for you guys
today I will sent this week from sister
weeks and this is the
outre lace front lace front wig roll out
rate lace front and it is in the style
hawaiian and i have it in dr 30 now this
is what the card looks like this is what
the wig looks like fresh out the pack
and I did not do anything to this wig at
all the only thing I did was a powder
into the part and the part one is weight
is really good I really love the part so
it is optional if you want to pluck your
part or not I feel like you can get away
with not plucking your part I think that
you can wear this wig like this if you
want to but um for me I'm going to brush
it out now this week is really really
really really long um it comes all the
way down to my bellybutton this week has
two combs on the side like right here by
the temple area I may also has a comb in
the back with adjustable shrimps and it
has like a baby comb right here is this
this way oh no I think yeah I'm pretty
sure this week yeah it has like a baby
comb like sitting at the end of the part
like just chilling right here but they
don't like that you can cut it out or
you can just leave it in now as I run my
fingers through it will not even run but
if I like do like this it does shed um I
am getting quite a few strands of hair
so this wig does shed
on the longer side so I feel like this
hey we'll tango and we'll shadow you but
for now like I'm getting some snags when
I run my fingers through it but yeah
overall this week is super cute like I
said you can't win like this but I think
I'm going to brush the curls out also
this week is big hit it friendly um so
if you have like a smaller sized head
then you probably want to secure it or
something or use your combs I really
don't use my combs but I mean so anyway
I'm going to just start off at the
bottom and I'm just going to brush this
baby out because I want to seem to look
like
this way looks so pretty brushed out
oh my going my way slipping off hold on
let me fix that this is like some
glamorous type of hair going on here so
yeah this is this uh untouched unbrushed
and i am still getting a few strands
when i'm brush the hair but it's nothing
serious
and it's not like really tingly or
anything like that but lord girl this is
gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous this
will be a cute like birthday week or
like a going-out type of wig like
something like fancy child yeah it's
like oh well okay let's brush the other
side oh excuse me if you can see my bra
you guys because you know I didn't think
that you can gonna see it that much
wanna yeah what anyway Oh
so this is what the week looks like
brushed out and I definitely like it
more brushed out then just leaving the
curls like they are so yeah do I think
that this week will tangle up on you
just because of how long it is but I
definitely think it'll last year so I
will leave the links in my description
box if any of you guys are interested in
getting this wig I think it's really
gorgeous really really gorgeous gorgeous
glamorous type of wig the curls are
absolutely bomb I will say it is on the
longest side just in case you don't like
um long hair and as far as the density
is like the right amount like this week
it wasn't really stingy with the hair it
is on a thick size not like overly thick
but it's definitely a good-good density</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
