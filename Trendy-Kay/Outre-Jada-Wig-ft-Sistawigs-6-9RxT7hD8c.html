review and yeah so I'm in a different
you know my background is different
basically but that's only because they
be trying a dog on me on quick and stuff
now so I gotta like make you what I guys
so I had to change where I'd know
anything and this week was sent to me
from sister wigs so I will make sure I
leave like the links to sister weeds
website and a link to this week and my
description box so yeah this is our
trade leads front wheel in the style
Jada and I have it in the color one
being why I got it won't be I don't know
I should have got a two but oh no I
usually get it to you I never I rarely
get a one B if you like the carrots and
definitely the wait for you okay because
this is some big big hair and this is
basically what it looks like when it
comes out the package I just put it on
my head for Oh only thing I did was plug
the pot a little bit so when you get it
depart it's gonna be really slim like
it's not even really a part there
because so much hair did you watch
together
so yeah connectability Rihanna this
won't be on his bed that's a discussion
ok the shuttle ok before I was really
interrupted so anyway guys yo this has
really cute is really thick so like I
was saying if you like they can get this
week because this wig is like hella
thick I'm just going to start saying if
the week is synthetic or not because a
lot of people get confused so yeah this
is a synthetic wig this is also heat
safe
they say that you oh did I show you how
to picture this is what the is just a
regular kind of like
Street week um they do say that this is
heat safe up to 400° so you can put
heat on it I wouldn't suggest you put
heat on us because it might lose its
texture like I think that it's going to
turn silky when you put heat on on it by
me if you want it to be like more like
toned down and not this thick then you
can definitely like run your um
straightening through it and it will
probably get a little bit more like
thinner I guess um this wig also comes
with two combs and the front I'm a comb
in the back with adjustable straps so if
you have a big head for like you can get
away with it I feel like this works for
every size head if you ask me I do have
my straps adjusted um then this wig also
comes with lace around the perimeter so
you do have to cut off lease and yeah
like I said you're gonna have to pluck
the putt because the putt did not come
like this it came really tight and
that's what it looks like now which I
think it looks really natural and I just
edit my powder in there so this wig is
around like 16 inches yeah 16 inches now
it's not like a straight up straight wig
um it does has like a little bend to it
now this way it kind of reminds me of
like back in a day like what everybody
used to be getting reps but your mother
do your rep and she put that bin at the
end I don't know if it was just me but I
used to see everybody with wraps and
maybe looking good and then
my mom can I get read and she will
always put the whole bin right here so I
mean it's bringing back memories
I can appreciate this so yeah I would
say that this wing is really hot as well
so if you don't like a lot of hair like
all right your neck area and stuff like
that this I'm sweating already um this
is a lot of hair I'm just wanting you
guys um this does come in like nice
colors like I'll not feel like it was
too much if I would have got this in a
color because it's so big like you can
tell shriyak like of with the you can
tell by looking at the picture that this
is going to be some thick hair so yeah
it's definitely thick I really don't
have it's just plain straight so if
you're looking for like a kind of
straight thick unit you definitely want
to get this one because it is like
really nice besides the part but the
part is fixable because this part is
like slate and laid honey this week does
shed a little bit I haven't got any
tangling but it does shed it's not
shutting out it only shed after I
finished plucking the part and cutting
off the lace um so I guess that's for me
like plucking apart and cutting off the
lace but besides that like I haven't got
any more shut-in and this way does not
tangle but keep in mind that this is a
synthetic unit and you will get some
tangling and I'm pretty sure you will
get shedding I feel like this week will
last you a good long minute doe um so
yeah it's really nice I really like it
the only complaint that I have about
this wig is the fact that it's like
thick all the way around and then when
you get to the back like right here it's
kind of thin I feel like they should
have put it it like more hair right here
is not noticeable I don't know how be if
you get it like this week and a color
like you know a color but for me it's
cool I like this week though this wig is
really cute I feel like it looks really
really natural so I'm going to turn
around for you guys so you guys can see
you know what the back looks like is
real plain though but it's then in the
back like it's super thin so yeah that's
it for this video so yeah I will leave
all the information in my description
box and yeah I will see you in my next
video
you ain't gotta like me but you know my
name down the top of me and again down
just got some new I shall be down in my
tank locks I got scream money on me like
a back rub</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
