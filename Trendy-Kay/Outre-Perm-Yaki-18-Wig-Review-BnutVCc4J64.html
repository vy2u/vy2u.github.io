and it is the perm Yankee 18 unit so
this unit has been around it's not like
a new unit or anything like that so yeah
I do have this unit and in color number
two and I did purchase this unit from
ebony Locke evany lines calm so yeah
let's get into this unit I really really
really really love this unit I didn't
think that I would love it as much as I
do to me um I just love how it falls
like this unit is really really
beautiful like so this is the Parden
space I don't know you're probably like
why is the pod in space like a V the
Parden space is like a V because my
freakin lace ripped I'm going to show
you guys my situation um after I explain
everything like about this unit but this
has never happened to me you guys and
I'm so mad because I'm like truly truly
truly in love with this unit so like
this unit is everything to me like it
looks so natural the part looks really
natural besides it looking like a V now
like it looks like that only because the
lace is ripped but besides that like the
cut of it the way that the layers like
the the way the curls are like it just
falls so nice like the thickness of it
is not like really overbearing like it
just really does something to me um that
I really really like so this unit has
two combs in the front of home in a bit
with the adjustable straps I did get a
few shedding like still now
is still shedding but that definitely
has to do with the fact that the lace
ripped and the hair is like coming out
of the lease now so that's the only
reason this unit is really shedding as
bad as it is because like the lace is
ripped to the point where you know the
UM the hair is going to come out but as
far as as far as that like I had no
complaints about this unit um yeah I
really love this unit I will purchase me
um another one just because I really
really really love this unit it's
definitely natural it has no shine it is
like a Yankee texture it's very
lightweight um it fits your hip really
snug so if you have a smaller size head
this will fit your head really good um
it's not fitting me snug anymore but
before the lease trip um it was fitting
really really really snug um so yeah as
far as tangling I don't get any tangling
as a right now I'm pretty sure it will
tangle a little bit but for right now
like no tangle in like this unit it's
really perfect so yeah I'm just
happening on this bandwagon because I'm
pretty sure a lot of people already know
about this unit but um the way it looks
on a model like I didn't really care for
it that's why I never got it but then I
was just like
sima disavow and it actually looks much
better on than how it looks on the UM on
the model so yeah I'm really really
really love this unit you guys and I'm
really disappointed that this lace
ripped but this is what it looks like
like this unit is giving me so much life
I just look at this you're like okay so
let me just show you guys what this rip
is looking like because like I'm really
really mad so I don't even know how this
happened but the part is right here this
hair belongs on this side like this side
but like it's ripped so yeah um that's
how it's ripped so anybody else have
this type of issue or had this issue
with this week please let me know am I
the only person wonder this or does this
happen like I didn't think that this
happened to people like understand like
if you pluck the unit like pluck the
part sometimes if you pluck too much
hair at one time like the lace can rip
that's happened to me but as far as like
the lace just ripping like the wait like
coming apart like off like I can't even
explain you guys seen it but this has
never happened to me I didn't think this
type of stuff happens but I guess it
does um but uh yeah so that's what that
looks like if anybody was curious to see
how my wig ripped but yeah I'm
disappointed now I have to buy a whole
new unit because I love this unit so
much but um yeah so yeah this is if you
have any questions feel free to leave it
in my comment section down below um yeah
but I will list all the links and
everything to this wig in my description
box so yeah umm I highly recommend this
unit I'm really really really in love
with it if you like that natural but
full type of look then this is
definitely the unit for you because this
like really looks like somebody's hair
very full beautiful type of hair is
really really nice and I'm loving my
pardon I did also I didn't mention but I
did plus my part but I'm yeah I did plus
my part and everything I didn't add any
concealer or powder into my part is just
pluck and pluck and that's it the length
is one point like this like this way
it's so natural like they have the cuts
and everything like one point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
