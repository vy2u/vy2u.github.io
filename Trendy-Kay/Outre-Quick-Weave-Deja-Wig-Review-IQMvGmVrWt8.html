for you guys and it's on my head it's um
kind of out of my element because all my
reviews always have been longer wigs I
do love the short wigs that every time I
wear short wig it looks so natural and
everybody thinks it's my real hair
so I wanted to come and do a quick
review on this wig that I have or now
and if you do not like short hair you're
not a fan of short hair or wigs um this
video might not be for you so this is
deja by I'll trade quick weave and I
have her in a color 1b and I'm so in
love this wig actually reminds me of the
wake that I had um the mommy wig um it
was about a Janek collection it was the
mommy wig and I think it was mommy 4 or
5 one of them but the only difference is
this in the back is um his straight I
don't know if you can see that and the
mommy wig is a skirt like wavy curly all
over but I did get this wig from
wave-type Stockholm of course and this
was $15 I have been I in this wig
forever ever since I got the mommy
the mommy weight and I was like oh my
goodness I want another short way but I
don't know you know what I was show wit
will look like that and want to get the
same one so I did some reviews on this
but it wasn't no reviews like I looked
up on YouTube typed in the wig name but
nobody
review on this so I guess I'm the first
person I know it might be a review on it
but I didn't see any so yes this is deja
in one being and my camera doesn't give
this wig any justice but it's so nice
like it looks like like finger waves
basically but you can kind of pluck it
out and it'll be more like curly layered
all over if you don't want the finger
waves but I still kind of have like that
finger wave vibe going on but yes this
is what she looks like me turn around um
I haven't wore her out yet but I don't
know I might wear out today but yes she
is so pretty I'm she does come with
because she is a quick weave so she has
like um one huge comb right here in the
top area and um one huge long comb in
the back area in this wig has adjustable
straps so yeah the thing I find about
the adjustable straps on shorter wigs
though is that you want them to lay as
flat as possible as flat as possible so
if you like tighten up the adjustable
straps it kind of like squishes the wig
in the back and give it like a hump so I
don't use my adjustable straps I find
that the wig cap size actually fits my
head pretty good I don't even use the
combs so yeah and I just had my hair
braided down under head just to make it
flat because I hate when you weigh in
short wigs and you can see like the hump
I can feel my butt
I don't think you can really see it that
much you can see it right handles it
but yeah so so again this wig is from
wig types
it was $15 right now you have 22 percent
off of you know the site so I would go
and get that wig because it's so cheap
and it's so pretty like if you love
short hair this is the hair for you
because I love this hair it's shorter so
it doesn't do any shuttin or tangle and
I haven't got any of that
I'm usually my shorter wigs what lasts
me longer than my longer wigs so yes
this is deja and I love how you guys so
