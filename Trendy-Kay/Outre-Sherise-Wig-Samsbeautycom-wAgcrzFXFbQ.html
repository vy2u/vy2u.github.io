know ho stuff I read the rule of Dharma
cool cool
DISA rolling nada mewling Dabba nothing
like the usual dad magic with the bridge
rule do magic courtside with him hey
guys so I'm back with another video and
this week that I had one was sent to me
from sans beauty so I'll make sure I
leave sense beauty links in the
description box so the wig that I had
one is the outre lace front lace front
wig and it is in the style of Charisse
and I have it in a dr 30 so this is what
the picture looks like and I'm pretty
sure most of you guys have already seen
this week because it is a couple boys a
few reviews on this week already now
before I start talking about this wig
this uh this wig is a lace part wig so
that means it has a lace part it also
has a lace throughout the perimeter so
you do have to cut off the least around
the hairline and this is also a
synthetic unit so it's not human hair or
anything like that
this wig also comes with two combs in
the front a comb in the back with
adjustable straps I feel like this week
is big-headed friendly because it's very
roomy and I have my strap suggested and
it still fits a little big on my head so
if you have a bigger size head you can
definitely definitely get away with when
this wig if you have a smaller size head
I feel like you can still get away with
wearing this wig I did put a bobby pin
right here because with my adjustable
straps I felt like it was not secure
enough for me so I added my bobby pin
right here on the sides um so yeah
that's just what I did you might not
need to add bobby pins but my head is a
bit small so I had to go in and bobby
pins just so I won't feel like my wig is
going to follow I would definitely say
that this week is everyday
wait it also comes in multiple colors
coming natural colors it also comes in
like 956 13 deep blue D violet dr 27 dr
30 which i'm wearing right now
dr 25 the arc copper and dr red so if
you a big color person you'll definitely
have fun with choosing a color and you
guys know that I'm like a sucker for the
dr 30 i think that it just looks really
good against my skin tone so now as far
as the texture of this wig is concerned
it is a light jacket
texture don't start Jordan it is a light
yaki texture I wouldn't say it's like
really really Yankee but you can
definitely feel um Phil it's Yankee
texture it is a nice full wig I wouldn't
say like it's overly full like it's
really really full but it's definitely a
full wig it's not thin at all now this
week does have duct roots well obviously
this wig has dug hurts but the doctor is
not on throughout the week so if you
like your dog look throughout the wig
that you probably are not going to like
this week because it doesn't have the
dark route all the way around but that
doesn't bother me because they put the
duct where it needs to be like no one
will be able to tell that this duct that
this wig does not have duct roots all
the way through so that doesn't bother
me when I took it out the package I
didn't really do nothing to it I just
took my vent brush and brushed out the
curls um it's more curls towards the
front of your face and then when you get
to the back it's more straighter with
kind of like a bin in it which mmm it's
not too bad I'm not really a fan of
that type of style but it's cute I like
it so like I said I only brush this wig
out with my vent brush and that was that
um or you can finger comb this way
because it comes style exactly like this
you really can't go wrong with this week
and my opinion so yeah and as far as the
part the part actually wasn't that bad
when I got it
but I did go in with my tweezers and
just pluck a few heads out the putt to
make it a little bit more wider and then
I edit my finishing powder to the part
and that's what it looks like I don't
really have any of my hair out just a
little bit right here and I did
place the wig behind my hairline so now
when I got it out the package it did
shed a little bit um so yeah this week
does shed um and this week
did tengo a little bit it was not like
anything serious where it will make me
not like this week so yeah I did get a
little bit of shut-in in a little bit of
tangling the tangling I meant dr.
gentleman the shutting did stop but that
was before I cut off the lease and after
I cut off the lease it didn't shed so I
don't know so this week is meant to be a
side part um I haven't tried it in the
middle yet but I don't know I might try
to the middle but the way is looking
already like with that and then how it
is right now I feel like that is not
going to look right in the middle so I
don't know about that but um I know a
lot of people at always eggs what side
is the part one and the part is on the
the right side yes the part is on the
right side so real quick I'm just gonna
do a 360 so you guys can see the week
how it looks all the way around
