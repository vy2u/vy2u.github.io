thank you
see
hey guys so I'm back with another wig
review and this week was sent to me from
a sister wigs so yeah they sent me the
l-train lace front wig and the style
stunner and I have it in a color di 13
and this is what the picture looks like
so I'm pretty sure everybody is familiar
with our tres Donna they also have a
half a week like this they came out with
the half awake first which I had the
half a wig if you follow me at one
snapchat while ago I did wear this head
and my snapchat now when I say a while
ago it was a while ago
but I didn't do a review on a half wig
because I felt like it okay so they give
you a common event going to give you two
combs and a front on each side like at
the temples and they also give you a
adjustable shrimp now if you have a
bigger size head then this will fit you
perfect because this is a little big for
my head so if your head is like small
like mine's then you probably have to
like put some bobby pins or something on
the side to secure it or use your combs
I don't know it come with my help I
don't use my comb so I don't know if
that will help the week or not but yeah
I'm just using my adjustable strap now
the construction and everything of this
wig is pretty good to me the color is
one point one thing that I did notice at
least I think as far as like the half a
wig they give you dark route all the way
around and they say thing don't quote me
on that y'all but anyway this one it
only has the dark roots um in the front
and then when we move like to like the
lower back um it's no dummy I think that
this color is so beautiful I feel like
it looks so natural like somebody's hair
so if you're into like those natural
Yankee wigs this one would be perfect
first thing I noticed about this head is
that it sheds um it does shed a lot now
I went and say like gloves or hair is
like shedding out like uncontrollably
but it definitely
 when I mess around with it and
stuff like that now it could be because
I plus the part but I mean I don't know
shut is not too bad but it definitely
shades so don't think that this is not
going to shed as far as tangling I have
not gotten any tangling yet but let me
tell you if this wig is anything like
the half wig you're going to get
tangling you're going to get shut in and
this wig will probably only last you a
day because if it's anything like the
half a wig I already bought three of
those already
and it only lands me like a day and by
the end of the day like this hair will
start to get poofy like it starts to it
reminds you of like some real hair like
once you had it like once it's like
humid outside and like frizzes up a bit
keep that in mind also I just know all
this stuff because I had the heavy wig
and this is pretty much the same it just
has a part I do feel like I like the
head way better only because I don't
know like the curls were I don't know
what it was just more popping in the
front to me but yeah I mean basically is
exactly the same now I only thing I did
to this wig was cut off the lace because
of course it does come with lace and I'm
and it does come with the lace parts so
I just added some powder into my pot I
did pluck it I feel like I could pluck
it a little bit more better but yet for
the most part this is how the part looks
and yeah the lace goes from ear to ear
and this is meant to be a side part of
course you can put it as a middle part
but I really think that it's going to
look bright maybe I should try this a
middle part just to see what it looks
like
okay I will say that this is actually
this actually looks really good as a
middle part I'm kind of surprised
because I didn't think that it would
look like this now I'm still I would
have an issue with playing it in the
middle because this part I feel like I
could work with like as cool as far as
like falling in the right way but this
whole part of the wait like this is a
part of the way that just like doesn't
have any type of curl in it at all so it
kind of like forces you to wait on the
side in a way I don't know but like I
said these are how the curls come
straight out the pack I didn't do
anything to the curls these curls are
already loose um when you start messing
with them they are gonna get really
loose to the point where you're gonna
feel like it's no curls left in this wig
trust me I know um it happened to me
with my um half wig when you start
messing with the curl but for this video
purpose and all some people are going to
want to know how the curls look brushed
out and I'm going to show you so I'm
just taking my vent brush and I'm just
starting from the bottom and it is easy
to brush out but I'm just showing you
what will happen when you brush this way
go because all the curls disappear like
this look like a totally different way
on one side so that's what it looks like
and I might as well just brush this out
out because these curls ain't coming
babe and I am getting shedding when I
brush them out where did I brush out
this week Wow
this is cute though so
sorry I'm looking over here look at the
highlight yes I have more my highlight
in a minute yo but um
so this is what the wig looks like
brushed out and actually I like it both
ways I feel like you can't go wrong um
yeah this week is actually boom you guys
I'm not even gonna lie as far as how it
looks this week is definitely bombshell
bum but it's not like it doesn't last
you guys like when I tell you this wig
will les yeux a day two days tops
that's it so that's the only issue so if
you plan on like if you don't really
want to waste your money or you just you
know but me personally I will go with
the half wig over this because these
wigs don't last at all I'm so out of
breath y'all now as far as had a look
these wigs look so bomb like now I'm
just want to switch it back to the side
so you guys can see what it looks like
brushed out on the side
I definitely love hottest wig looks in
the middle
so yeah and this is what the wait looks
like um originally how it originally
comes on the side
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
