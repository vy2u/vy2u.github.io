your game what's your game put your game
Gucci game read their ass on you change
my bill of doing cocaine oh I'm for the
bitch of a gun angel
I can't bomb in a wedding ring hey guys
it's K of course and I'm back with
another video so this video is gonna be
on this hair and this hair was sent to
me from the same Beauty so if you're
interested in this head and want to
purchase it all the links will be in the
description box the hair they sent me is
about our training is the Swiss X lace
front wig and I have it in a style of
Valentina and I also have it in the
color 950 so this week is safe and also
this they say that this week is pre
plucked which I do not think that the
headline the hair line is not pre
plucked whatsoever
also this week comes as a 4x4 meaning it
gives you that closure up the top and
I'll insert what it looks like straight
out the package and everything like that
so you guys can know what I'm talking
about but yeah basically with the 4x4 it
gives you the option to part it in the
middle or part it on the side if you
like your side cuts because most of
these wigs as you know comes as a set
part like is even in the middle or on
the side and you can't really you know
you can't really put the week so with
this one it gives you the option to you
know with the part in the middle or on
the side so as far as construction for
this wig it comes with your typical
construction we're not your typical
construction because this is a 4x4 but
it comes with the two cones and the
front the comb in the back and
adjustable straps I do feel like this
hit its big hit friendly my head is on
the smaller side so I do have my strips
adjust it just in case your head is
small like mine's just go ahead and
adjust your straps now if you have a
smaller size head than me and I don't
think you can get no smaller than that
but this week still with my stripes
adjusted fits me really big it's kind of
uncomfortable I probably
have to add bobby pins to each side just
to secure to wait a little bit more as
you can see I did all to this way just a
little bit so before I had this as like
a side part and it's not really a side
parts because I want it like the part
deeper and the lace doesn't go that far
on the side so basically I had to do my
Old Faithful flip over my fit which
everybody should know about there you
just flip the hair over if you don't
want to part it and that's like my go-to
is just like flipping the hair over so
yeah I just flipped the hair over to one
side before I had this look I had the
part in the middle and I'll just insert
a picture of what it looks like but the
middle part was okay like I felt like
when I looked in the mirror it was good
but then when I looked in the camera
like it just didn't look right I don't
know so yeah I decided to flip the head
all to one side I haven't received any
shedding from this week and as far as
tangling it doesn't tangle that much but
trying to run my fingers through it I do
get snags and the curls was a bit more
like together when I got it out the pack
and I did go ahead and finger comb the
wig just so I can get bigger this hair
is already big when you get it out of
the pack but I went ahead and finger
combed it just a little bit to like make
the curls a bit more bigger and messy so
if you like big hands this week is
definitely for you because this is a lot
of hair it gives you more of a natural
feel so I feel like you can wear this
wig on an everyday basis but as doll it
doesn't really have a shine I definitely
love the color the color is very faint
so if you're looking into wearing color
but you're just scared to like hop out
there on a color I definitely recommend
the 950 color because it's not too
noticeable and out there so if you're
not really used to like the bright in
your face type of colors definitely
start out with this color because you
know baby steps
so yeah I'm starting with this color
because the color and the light like you
can you can see like a hint of that
Burgundy but it's not like too
overpowering with though it's just like
too much so I definitely love the color
it still looks natural to me but yeah
overall I think this is a nice wig is
really cute so when I did have it parted
in the middle
I took my want curler and just put heat
to the part just so it could lay down
because it definitely looks really
Whiggish when you have it so this is not
like you can wear it straight out the
pec I do feel like you still have to put
a little bit of work not a lot but just
a little bit of work into the wig to
make it look right if I didn't mention
this when I received that I also went
ahead and finger comb the curls out just
a little bit to make it more you know
natural looking I also went ahead and
just cut a little bit of hair off that
was in front of my face because I didn't
want the head covering my eyes this is a
lot of hair so if you are not a fan of
just like big curly hair this wig may
not be for you but if you are definitely
check out this week because it's poppin'
so yeah that's it for this video and I
will see you in my next video I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
