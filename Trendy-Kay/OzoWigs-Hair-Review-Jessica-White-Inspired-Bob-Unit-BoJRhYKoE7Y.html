outfit is because I'm filming multiple
videos so you know don't mind it or
whatever but um yes you guys I'm pumped
to do this review because I am like
really really really in love with this
unit so yes this is not a synthetic unit
so for all my human hair virgin hair
lovers this one is for you and you guys
let me know if you want me to do a dupe
for this unit
like a synthetic version just in case
you know I know it's some people that
want to go the cheaper route but for
those of you who like the human hair
units this one is for you so this is
from ozo wigs and i do have a review
that I did a while back from ozo weeks
and I have no complaints about this
company like this is literally my
favorite company when it comes to him
and hair units so yes this is what the
box looks like and it comes in this big
nice sturdy box and right here is where
I don't know if you can see that but it
just gives you all the weight details so
so I guess I'll start off with um the
box itself and how the wig came packaged
and everything like that so when you
open the box
um the weight came inside of here of
course but the way it was wrapped in
this little baggie in a Danish stuffing
inside the unit and it was wrapped up in
this of course so yeah and then you'll
get your your weight brush and you'll
also get like this little flower thing
and is when you take a pot it's just
like a little bag type thing
they also give you a wake head it's like
an edit wig head so yeah and it's in
black so that's the bed looks like and
it's one more thing in here and they
also give you buy clothes or wigs beauty
and style pamphlet okay so one two this
hair because this hair is absolutely
gorgeous you guys like so this is a bob
unit what am i doing like huh so yeah
this is a bulb unit and I did get this
from also wigs so this is the Jessica
White full lace wig unit and it's Bob
803 so that's the product code and then
the color is one B which is off black
and then you have the hair length width
which is 14 inches cap sides which is a
sides one and that's the default unless
you X for something else and then you
have cap construction which is a head 3
and it's the glue this lace cap lace
color is a medium brown and the hair
texture is so key it's not yucky
and they just tell you what what comes
in this box which is the freeway camp
and a free ozo wigs brushes so yeah so
this is what the unit looks like and I'm
absolutely in love with this unit I
haven't got any tangle in I haven't
received any shedding yeah like their
wigs are amazing I really love their
units so this is what it looks like when
I did get this unit like the curls was
like this so the only thing I did was I
took so the only thing I did was just I
took my flat iron and I went through the
unit to straighten the bottom out
because I didn't like it and it turned
out really nice yeah I have no
complaints
just like a shameless with you guys
because I did post a picture of me when
this unit one Instagram and some of you
guys were interested in the unit I was
wearing which is this so yeah like I
haven't nope I do have a complaint about
this unit must back up so the only thing
that I had to say about this unit is
that my head is small so this unit fits
big they do offer adjustable straps so
it is three combs it's a comb up here
and it's two combs at your temple area
and then it's a comb in the back with
adjustable straps I did take out the
comb that was on top and I just left the
two combs and the side so I am using the
two combs on the side because the wig
itself is big on my head and I don't
want to use the adjustable straps
because I feel like when I use the
adjustable straps it bunches up it just
bunches y'all know what I'm talking
about yo use adjustable straps y'all
know how to wait like bunch up in the
back and I didn't want that because this
unit is not long and it's a bought unit
so you can like see everything and then
the even is fun even and stuff like that
so it won't work out so you probably
have to if you have a small head like me
I would even export smaller cap sites or
if your hair is like normal to own a
larger sides then you probably won't
have to worry about this problem but
yeah I can't use my adjustable Shrek's
because yeah it bunches up in a bed and
it's not good for this style now that
was the longest style then it would be
it would have been fine because you you
it would have been noticeable so if I
didn't mention this unit is a foolish
unit so it's lace all throughout the
units and yeah so this is what the part
in space looks like and again you can
part this any way you want to so you can
bring the part further back if you
wanted to so let me give you guys a 360
so you can see how well this unit is
like cut as you can see this is a
gorgeous gorgeous unit and I promise you
you will not be disappointed if you do
decide to purchase this unit like I said
I'm a huge fan of ozo wigs and I just
love them like they never disappoint me
I'm still when the old one that I had
did a review on so yeah I have nothing
but good things to say and this unit is
everything you guys like I've been so in
love with this unit lately so yeah I'm
trying to see if it's anything else
about this unit that I need to tell you
guys but yeah I think that's it so if
you have any questions or anything feel
free to leave it in a comment section
down below and I will leave the link and
everything to this unit in my
description box so yes I will see you
next time you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
