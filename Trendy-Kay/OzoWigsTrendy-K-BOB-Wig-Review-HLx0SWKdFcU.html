this week was sent to me from all the
wigs of course you all know that I love
all the wigs they're like my favorite
one of my favorite hair companies I feel
like their hair it's just such good
quality and it's the bomb so yeah the
weight did not come like this I did I
mean the cut and everything but as far
as the color I did color this week
myself this week didn't come as they
liked number 4 I think it's like a light
brown it's like the roots that's like
that's the color of this unit and I will
insert a clip of what the weight looked
like originally
but yeah this is 12 inches this is
version human hair it's 108 percent
density the hair texture is silky and
non Yankee the cap construction is a cat
3 glueless lace and the cap size is a 1
and lace color is medium brown so yeah I
feel like the cap is on the bigger side
so if you do have like a larger size hit
this week with it you good even though I
think this is like the smallest cap size
you can go so yeah um so yeah that's
everything about this unit this is the
box that comes in if you're not familiar
with the ozo weeks when i say the hair
is like butter like it's so soft and it
smell smells so good but as far as the
cut like i did not cut this way at all
this is how the way it comes cut and
like this week is perfect this week
actually bleaches really really well so
if you're interested in buying a unit
and you're not really sure about
bleaching or if the hair will mess up
know this hair feels exactly the same
before I bleached it like it feels
exactly the same like it's not dry is a
full lace unit so you can part this
anywhere I'm gonna tell you after I
bleached his hair like there was not I
probably had like three strands of hair
um and that's it like no shame no shame
no shedding from this unit at all I did
a little powder to my part and that's it
this hair does really well with color
like when I say it takes color like
really well like the hair is still
bouncy like everything um I forgot what
I was about to say oh yeah
now as far as the coloring I'm sorry
didn't I fill me like um bleaching the
hair or going through that process as
far as like bleaching the hair but I'm
not a professional when it comes to a
bleach I have and I don't know I just
don't have confidence in myself when it
comes to bleaching hair um something
just always go wrong and I don't really
know where I was going with this color
but this is how it turned out um yeah I
feel like I want to bleach it some more
but then I'm like hmm because I do
really like like I'm kind of proud of
myself but I feel like this side can be
a little bit better okay so let me turn
around so you guys can see what this
unit looks like in the back so again
this week is from ozo wigs I will leave
everything in my description box feel
