this week is from sister Wiggly and this
is the free trust equal premium deluxe
lace front and a style Cameron and it's
in the color pink gold and this is what
the picture looks like I didn't show the
picture but it's not meant to be a
sample it's meant to be a middle part so
yeah but I thought that I thought this
week would look much better as a side
part but you can make it as a middle
part like it comes or you can just shift
the weight over left or right to the
left side or the right side and make it
a sad part however you want to do it the
only thing is when you ship it over to
the side one parts one side will be
longer than the other because you know
the wig is shifted so that's I'm pretty
sure this wig will start to shed and
we'll start the tangles the older this
way it gets but right now I have not
received any tangling nor did I receive
shut in I would say that this week is
big head friendly because it's a little
loose on my this wig is also duffer all
the way around that is one thing I like
about these when it does come with soft
lace so if you go to pluck the part you
might want to be careful I did not pluck
my part because I felt like the part was
already nice how it was I feel like you
don't need to pluck the part by me if
you want to feel more comfortable um and
plucking apart is what you want to do
then go right here and pluck the putt
but all I did was put my powder in my
part and this is how it looks I would
suggest that you leave some of your
edges out because it is a little kind of
rounded it doesn't look natural but yeah
I don't have any
of my my edges of the texture of this
week is like a slight Yankee it's not
like overly Yankee but it's definitely
that Yankee texture this week is
literally so cute girl work yes honey
yes okay so my camera died so while I
was waiting for my battery to charge
I just shipped the wig over in the
center and this is how the way it comes
just in case anybody was look at the Hat
light but just in case anybody was
curious to see how it looks and yeah you
guys as I was shifting the wig over as I
was shifting the wig over to a middle
part when I tell you this week started
to shed so bad I was like why is he
shouting like this because at first like
it was not shedding like I quote it at
the end part like girl that's Kutty
but no it was way more than this and I
wasn't trying to dig in the trashcan to
get the rest of the help but yeah it
started shutting like it still shut it
so that's the only like that's the only
thing I'm that I don't like about this
week maybe it's just shutting right now
and then it slow down stop um but yeah
the only thing is the shutting for me
but I still love this week like gear
like honey
so the density on this wig is medium
it's not too thick but it's not then
either I would say this unit is a brown
18 inches long so yeah if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
description box down below
I meant my comment section down below I
will make sure I leave what's on my lips
in the description box because I mixed a
lot of colors just to get it cuz I
wanted it to be like I had a vision in
my head so this look because y'all know
I don't even wear eyeshadow I know
you're like oh she got my show you
another way I shouldn't girl no I don't
wait I show because my eyelids are fat
like I hate the way comment down below
if you have fat eyelids like this fat
pocket right here all this fatty tissue
I hate it oh my gosh I hate my eye
somebody want trait eyelids with me
because I hate my eyes and yeah so
that's the reason why I never wear eye
shadow if you guys haven't noticed I
just don't get down with my eyelids yo
but um I just had to put some shadow on
for this wig because it's pop intended
like yes like this wig is popping I'm
not even lying I'm so serious besides
the shedding like this week is
everything you know I hope I'm not
forgetting anything but again I will
leave the links and everything in my
description box I will leave assist away
links in the description box that's
where you can purchase this week from
and I will talk to you guys later
but let me set a row so you can see what
the wig looks like so this is the front
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
