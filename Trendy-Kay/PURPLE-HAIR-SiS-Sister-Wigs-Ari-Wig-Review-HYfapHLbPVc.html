review and this is the way that I'm
currently reviewing so yes this is the
sisters the wigs this is Ari and I have
her in a song red lily purple so yes
that's what the tag looks like and this
is what the hair looks like on the model
which doesn't look anything like the
unit so yeah you guys I know I'm late I
know it's probably a lot of you out
there who have already heard of this
unit so yeah I've been trying to get
this unit for a while but everywhere
that I've been searching for for this
unit is sold out everywhere especially
in this color so yeah it finally came
back in stock one week types calm so
that's where I purchased this unit from
I do believe this unit is $30 so yeah
plus two dollars for this color so I
think I paid like thirty two dollars
which I think that that is like really
really worth it
okay so let's get in to this unit um
this unit does come with a comb on each
side and it has a comb in the back with
the adjustable straps the cap size fits
a little big to me if you ask me and I
had my stripes adjusted to its tighted
so it is um it does I mean it fits my
head way I feel like it's not going to
like come off but I would have liked for
this unit to be tighter so if you have
like a small head then um it probably
would fit um
a little loose but I mean I'm not sure
like my head is like really small but I
mean if you hit it unlike the normal to
bigger side then I'm pretty sure you'll
be fine with this unit so yeah this is
basically how the weight comes when it
comes out of the package only thing I
did to this unit is where my fingers
through it I didn't even like brush it
with my vent brush or anything like that
so yeah and as far as the part I'm not
done plugging apart I just felt like I
didn't feel like plucking it anymore
I only pluck like this but well you can
tell where I plucked apart it so yeah
that's what the part looks like they do
give you a decent amount of parting
space but yeah I just plucked like that
much and you can see like I didn't plug
the rest of it because I just I was
running out of time basically so I
wanted to hurry up and review this unit
for you guys so yeah I would say this um
unit is like 18 inches long so yeah let
me step up so you guys can see the color
so as far as like I'm shedding and
tangling for this unit like I just read
I just like literally receive this unit
I cannot wait to put this unit 1 so yeah
as far as like tangling like right now I
don't get anything on as far as shedding
um this week does like right now I
just got some shedding I don't know if
that's because I cut off the lace and
kind of plucked a little bit of the part
so that might be a reason or this wig
probably just sheds is not every time I
run my hands through it it sheds it's
just like random shedding like right now
I got another strand so it's not bad
right now but it does shed a little bit
like I said I don't know
this from me doing what I did to this
unit but yeah I do get a shut-in no
tingling yet and the only thing that I
have to say about this week which is not
even bad because it's fixable but it is
a little on the shiny side so you
probably could take some baby powder and
you know to reduce the shine and get the
shine out of the wig I mean it actually
is not that bad though you could wear it
like this is not like overly shiny but
it does have a slight shine to it so if
you don't really like your wigs like
shiny then you definitely let you
definitely can apply baby powder to this
unit to make it look non shiny so you
guys know that I love wearing my part in
the middle I do have this wig on the
side because I'm not done plucking apart
so it kind of looks so funny in the
middle versus the side but this is how
the way comes originally I'm as a side
part but I will show you guys what it
looks like in the middle and I do plan
on when this wig in the middle so hold
on so this is what it looks like in the
middle and I am a fan of this unit band
on both ways but I'm definitely more of
a middle part type of girl
so yeah I'll definitely be rocking this
unit in the middle but yeah like I say I
wasn't done plucking my part because I
wanted to film this video before I run
out of time so yeah more and I
don't I really like that so yeah but um
this unit is shut it or meet you guys so
yeah this is what it looks like in the
middle though just in case you were
curious to see how the part looks in the
middle so yeah I'm just going to do a
quick 360 for you guys so you guys can
see what the wave looks like all the way
ever
so I hope you guys enjoy this quick wave
review or show-and-tell so yeah again I
did purchase this from wait sites calm
just in case you guys were curious and
wanted to purchase this unit so you
probably need to hop on it quick if
they're not already sold out because
these wigs are going quick especially in
this certain color soul and I will leave
the links and everything in my
description box so you guys can check
out this unit if you guys are interested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
