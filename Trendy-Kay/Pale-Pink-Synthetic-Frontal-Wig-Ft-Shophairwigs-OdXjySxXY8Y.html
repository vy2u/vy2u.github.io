I chose cute town just like hey guys
it's Kay and I'm back with another video
so today this video is going to be on
this hair and I would sent this hair
from shop hair wigs calm and I'll go
ahead and leave all of that information
in the description box just in case any
of you guys are interested so before I
get started as you can see this is a new
filament area for me so you guys tell me
what you think besides the red shaped
background because it is kind of like
wrinkly but if I can find a way to like
get the wrinkles out and I feel like
it'll look really good
I don't know what do you guys think well
the wig I'm wearing is from Bobbi buzz
and it is called silvina and I have it
in the color TT v vp k PC so I'm just
gonna show you all the stock card
basically the color is like a duck
routed weight and then it gradually goes
into this nice pale type of peach pink
type of color I don't know I can't
explain it but it's really really really
beautiful if you're not familiar with 4
13 by 4 it's basically kind of like a
frontal week when the 13 gives you 13
inches of lace base from in to air and
then force four inches of space for that
cell right 4 inches worth of space going
from like your hairline back so I do
appreciate it and I like my weeks come
like this because it just gives you more
options of styling the hair how you want
to style it so yeah ok so as far as the
construction for this week they give you
two combs in the front a comb and a bag
and adjustable straps I do feel like
this week is big hip friendly so if you
do have a bigger sized head you are
going to love this week because this
week is it's big y'all so I would say
regular size to bigger sized head you'll
definitely get away with it I mean if
you have a smaller size head like me I
would just take the extra steps to
secure this week down right there if
it's bobby pins or using got to be glue
for the hairline just to secure the week
some power or some way
because this week is really big now I do
really love the parking space I think
the pardon is very very natural
I feel like this color is everything you
guys and that's what actually drove me
to this week was the color and that's
probably the only reason I got this week
was because of the color now this is
like in the same style category and some
of the other wings that I've shown you
the only difference between these wigs
like this week and other wings that I've
shown you is the construction like some
are lace parts some are the 4x4 and like
this one is the 13 by 4 and also they
offer you different colors different
brands offer you different colors so
just keep that in mind yes they kind of
look alike but it all depends on what
color you're looking for if you are a
color person or what type of Kent
construction you're looking for because
if you are more of a person that likes
to do different styles of a few weeks I
would probably go with a cap that's more
constructed like this because you can
put this on the side either the left or
the right side you can part it in the
middle you also have the option to put
it up in like a half up half down type
of style if you wanted to this is a
Yankee texture so it's not like really
like overly Yankee but it's definitely a
good type of Yankee texture also the
density on this is in the middle is not
too thick but it's not thin either it
gives you the natural feel which I
really like as far as the shine there is
no shine to this wig like I said it
looks like somebody legit dyed this hair
which I really love well moving on to
tangling and shedding so this week does
tingle and it does shed this week shades
a little bit too much from our liking
and as far as the tangling it does
tangle quite a bit at the ends which I
wasn't really expecting because it's not
like a longer longer unit that I
normally
we're or that I have one previously to
this so I wasn't expecting it to really
tangles that bed but it actually really
tangles um quite a bit on the ends and I
do get quite a few strands of hair as
far as like shutting it straight out the
pack the curls are basically like this I
feel like you don't have to do too much
to the curls for them to look right now
I feel like I did struggle with the
curls like mainly towards the face part
I feel like they just wasn't going the
way I wanted them to go now this week
does not come with baby hair so I did
had to add my own baby hairs but I wind
up like combing them up just because I
didn't like how they turned out
this is what the Parden looks like and I
did go in and add some finishing powder
to my part I feel like you don't need to
pluck the pot anything like that I feel
like it looks very very natural now let
me see if I can step back just so y'all
can see the length
so yeah guys that's pretty much it for
this video if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below and I love
you guys I will see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
