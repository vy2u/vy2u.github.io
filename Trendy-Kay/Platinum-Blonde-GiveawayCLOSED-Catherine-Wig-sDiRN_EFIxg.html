we review and this is going to be a
giveaway as well in this week so I would
sit this way from same beauty I sent me
this way exam wearing and this is my
sensational and it's a Miss out
Katherine and I have it in a color 613
now if you guys have not noticed I've
been really loving the numbers in my
week but I just like that one solid
color so yeah I've been like trying a
lot of different colors without any
roots just to see how I like it
I don't like this one more than my pink
one I just think visit penguin looks so
much better on my skin tone or outdoors
I don't know what do you guys think I
mean I am feeling it but I feel like I
just need like a little teeny bit adult
group like oh yeah I think I'm going to
add divers the only reason I haven't
added over this week is because I don't
have anything to it but if I do decide
to it does roots to this week I would
definitely keep you a post it and I'll
probably put on my output it one my
naked this is what the picture looks
like and I know you guys are probably
like they're they're always switching
something that without show a slight
weight I need to rerun so yeah it's in
the next clip you guys but yeah I don't
know why she talked about this weed and
didn't show you guys what I did or
matter of fact I'm just going to show
you guys what I did really quickly it is
it come like that it was basically
straight in the back and then had that
little curl action going on the front
which it wasn't too bad why I felt like
for this color I would like it more
straight or maybe I'm just going through
my straight face I'm always going
through a phase like everybody else so
yeah I just drained it but I'll um I'll
show you guys how I did that and without
also when I strain this week before I
straightened it it was a Yankee texture
and
and ASA I streamed it it's kind of like
a Yankee texture but not really also I
am wearing a black stocking cap under
here
I do allows you to put on a stocking cap
that may be similar to your skin
collection or just don't whisk I can cap
it all and if you're on the lighter side
then you probably have to add like some
concealer or finishing powder because
the party in lakes and all that is
pretty dark it is brown so yeah if you
are lighter than around the lease or
whatever like a brown complexion then
you always want to have to use something
to lighten it up this way is around 16
inches 16 inches long so I do feel like
this week is good for everyday wear the
only thing that I don't like about this
week is the fact that from it being so
light if you are wear makeup assist it
kind of transferred onto the hair so be
careful with that but that's the only
con that I really don't like and it's
not even a issue with the wig is just
like the color because you know anything
can show up on this color but besides
that I don't have any complaints about
this hair it is on as inside but it's
not like too thin where you're seeing
like the tricks in the back or anything
like that like it's a natural type of
thinness also tingling and shudders it's
weird heads tangle a little bit and I'm
in this weak head shed a little bit and
I have not received any tingling
courtesy so it does shed a little bit
mostly when I cut off the lace but
besides this it's all good like I might
get like a few strengths not know I
didn't get insurance that time but yeah
I might get like one or something like
that I mean it's not bad at all
so yeah I can't even lie like I'm
definitely loving the platinum blonde
color um it is going to take me a little
bit more getting used to and I'm
probably not going to wear this I'm
probably not going to wear this week
often so me to really get used to it so
yeah um I don't know I might go out and
get something so I can add doors just so
I can see how is going to look but
actually it looks pretty good I was
trying to well this is my look that I
had but I had to take off the glasses
because the glare was killing me but I
definitely love the glasses with this
look I feel like it's so cute
