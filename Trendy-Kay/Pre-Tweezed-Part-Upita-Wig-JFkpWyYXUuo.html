hey guys okay so I'm back with a another
video again my dish is like I'm trying
to get these videos out for you guys so
yeah this is this way what am I talking
about okay so this week was sent to me
from elevating styles so I make sure I
leave elevate styles website in my
description box along with like links to
this hedges in case you're in sir just
in case you're interested in it you can
definitely go ahead and purchase this
unit I will have to say that this is
like a really simple everyday type of
unit so yeah let me just tell you guys
what this is and this is another assist
as the wings Deva pre tweeze part and
this is called u pizza I don't know if
I'm saying that right
I live in midnight blue which is
basically like a blue color it is like a
one being has like streaks of duck blue
throughout the wig it's kind of settled
but you can definitely see the blue
color so this is what the stock card
looks like and I think that it looks
exactly like the model I mean she has
her spooked over her eye but to me this
is too long I don't really like it all
the way you know but anyway so yeah
let's get in to this week oh that's
kinda cute oh oh
so if you more of a simple type of
person and just like the simple type of
style or type of wig um where it's just
effortless and you put it on your head
and you don't like have to do anything
to it as far as like for everyday work
purposes like this is like a work week
for real so yeah of course the the part
already comes pre tweeze so you don't
have to pluck the part or anything like
that which is really good because I know
some people are lazy and just don't feel
like plugging apart so that's a good
thing now the only thing with this type
of wig is it doesn't come with lace
throughout the perimeter so if you don't
like cutting off the lace or whatever
you don't have to worry about that
either the only thing is when it just
comes with this lace part it is a little
bit thick up in here so you can
definitely tell where the lease begins
so be careful with that but I feel like
once you put like some finishing powder
or concealer on it a little bit it kind
of conceals that little demarcation
right there so that's exactly what I did
I put a little bit of finishing powder
just right here in the front area I
didn't like extend it all the way back
because I felt like the part looks
already natural as is and I don't feel
like you have to do too much as far as
like adding powder in there but I
definitely will suggest that you add
your powder just right here to make it
blend and that oh yeah this is a
synthetic unit this wig has two combs in
the frontal comb in the back and
adjustable straps
I feel like this wig it fits my head
really good so if you have a normal to
smaller sized head you definitely can
get away with when this unit I feel like
if you have a bigger size head it might
be a little snug on your head but I'm
sure you can probably get away with this
unit as well but I don't know so yeah
but normal to logic I meant normal to
smaller size head you definitely can
rock this wig and if it's me very
comfortable I do have my straps adjust
now basically this is how the way it
comes straight out the pack I did not
literally do anything um to this wig at
all like as far as like plucking apart
you don't have to do that cutting off
the lace you don't have to do that the
wig already comes layered and it also
comes with like this curl type of vibe
going on right here and then this side
is straight and it still has layers
throughout the wig which are really
like also this way is around
so if you don't really like a lot of
hair this is definitely a wig for you to
get um one thing I don't really like is
the thinness this is not really a full
wig so if you're looking for a full week
you're not going to find it with this
week is more of like a natural type of
wig like as far as like the density is
definitely a more natural density um and
the feel of this wig is a light Yankee
when you look at it I feel like it looks
like it's silky but when you touch it is
definitely a light Yankee wig so yeah it
definitely looks um looks to be on a
silky side but yeah it's really nice so
I do like this wig I mean is I'm not
really a I mean it's not nothing to be
like oh but I do like it it's just plain
um so if you like that plain look or
like a wig that you can wear and your
work area or like a week that you can
wear to church or something this is
definitely the wig but like I said it is
um one like the thin side so yeah so
this is what this wig looks like now as
far as tangling and shedding is
concerned with this wig I have not
received any shut-in or tingling so that
is really a good thing so I definitely
like the fact that you don't have to put
too much effort into this way this was
like plucking the parts or just anything
like that this wig lays pretty flat
already like you won't get like a hump
action going on nothing like that like
this week it's really nice as far as
that is concerned so yeah this is what
the part looks like which is really nice
you
you
so that's it for this video you guys I
hope you enjoy if you have any questions
feel free to leave it in my comment
section below and yeah what do you guys
think about this week do you guys like
the pre tweeze parts because this is
really my first time trying them out and
I actually like I'm not like they're
okay but yeah what do you guys think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
