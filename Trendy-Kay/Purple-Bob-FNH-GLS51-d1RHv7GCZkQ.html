review for you guys and this is from
okay so basically this is like a nice
short bug unit I do wish that they had
more lace towards the front well if some
of you guys are not familiar with Friday
night have basically the construction is
first off this is a synthetic unit and
it is a synthetic lace front so they do
give you two inches in the front they
also give you I meant they give you like
two inches of lace space or part in
space to work with in the front they
also give you two combs in the front on
each side or comb in the back and it
comes with adjustable straps
I would say if your head is on the
bigger side I wouldn't suggest you
getting this way now this is definitely
a silky texture it's no yaki is nothing
yet about this hair all um so yeah let
me get up closer you guys can see this
color
the only thing I did was make the part a
little bit more like I plucked basically
I plucked out some heads and the part
and space to make it like state because
they kept on flipping over and I wanted
a little part on the side but this is
all the this is all the part in space
you get when you what am I trying to say
this is the only amount of card space
you get when you part the head to the
side because as you know when you start
going to the sides the lace it's only
you only get a little bit of lace
compared to the lace in the middle so I
can't like maneuver it because it is
above and if I turn it to the side then
it's just going to make the boat uneven
so yeah that was the only issue but if
you want a middle part then you
definitely can wear in the middle and
the part would be much longer let me
just put it so you guys can see I don't
even know if you can see that so so yeah
like I was saying basically I just
plucked a little bit of heads out and
apart so that the head can stay put
because they kept on moving to the side
and I also cut like this much off of
this side just because I don't know I
felt I just wanted to cut it so yes I
did cut a little bit of hair from the
side and that was basically it just
plucking the part and then cutting a
little bit off right head like when I
say I cut this much off like it was very
tiny and I did add my finishing powder
into the part a little bit just to make
it a little bit more natural-looking and
I also left my edges out I just felt
like it was it didn't look natural if
you hit if you don't have any of your
help I will say that this wig is on a
shiny me that's not too bad but it's
definitely on a shiny side now another
thing is this wig
a little bit it does not say what all I
haven't received any tangles from this
week but shouting I don't know if it's
because I cut off the lace but it did
shed the shedding dead stop no and I got
two shrinks from this side but yeah it
was doing some crazy shutting a little
but yeah this hair definitely did shed a
little it's not too bad but it did shed
I don't know if that's from merely
cutting off the lease before like I
don't know but um yeah I don't really
have too much to say about this way it's
really cute
so yeah and all's I do is tuck it behind
my ear I just feel like it makes the way
to look that up on how my hair like more
edgy because when it's out like this I
don't know I just look regular and then
we talk about honey is plate right yes
honey but yeah overall this week is okay
for me I'm it's not my favorite but it
is really cute and I definitely love the
color so I'll definitely make sure to
leave Friday night hair links in my
description box box as well as direct
links to the say if you want to purchase
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
