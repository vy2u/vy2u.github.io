me from lovely hair company okay so let
me just start off by saying that this
week is on the expensive side don't know
if you're not about their life anymore
on a budget this video it's not for you
okay so before I begin telling you about
my thoughts on this hair let me just
tell you guys what I'm wearing
so like I said this is from love me
virgin hair and I'll leave all the links
in my description box just in case any
of you guys are interested in the tab
this is a 360 least front closure wig
and I have it in duct root 613 and the
limp that I have is a 16 inches but I'll
cut it up a little bit shorter I took
like this much off but we'll get more
into that after I finished telling you
about the wigs
so yeah this week also has three combs
in the front a comb in the back with
adjustable straps this weeks it's me so
perfect I do believe that I got this
week in a petite size so if you hear it
small they do offer you a petite size
can old lately I just been into like
customizing my own wigs and stuff like
that like playing around with colors is
what I've really been into lately so
when I this company reached out to me
and I checked out the website and
everything like that and saw that they
carried a dove root six thirteen weeks I
was like oh my gosh I was still asking
about it because I didn't know like how
the hair was going to hold up well if
the hair was going to be good or not but
I'm definitely I'm happy with the
decision I made to try out their wigs
because this week is so legit you're I'm
trying to tell y'all
the density is 150 percent density
I love the density of this week I really
don't have any complaints about this
hell whatsoever I see so the lace is
also pre plus which I just went in after
I just went in and plucked a few more
heads out to make it look a little bit
more natural but before I cut any hair
out like you could get away with just
when and how they have it pre plucked
for you and also they did bleach the
night a little bit a little bit towards
the front of the leaf but not all of the
lease and I just went back and bleached
all the police just so it gives me a
more natural parent and it's just what
the hairline looks like and I just cut
some baby hairs a big couple baby hairs
the day was way too long so I just cut
them shorter um I kind of like I don't
really like how I really cut them
because it's kind of blunt and stubby
kind of but I made it work so yeah you
can't really tell it that much but I'm
definitely not feeling how I did the
baby hairs in this one but that's the
part and I did bleach tonight you guys
and if any of you guys are curious I use
got to be glued Jo to make the leaf stay
down and loved so at first you guys I
was not feeling this color whatsoever
and if you gotta follow me on snapchat I
did post like a product basically it is
a product that gets rid of permanent and
semi-permanent color so I was trying to
get rid of this color like I want to
distribute because originally this color
was like a lavender silverish type of
color which I loved it so much but then
I was trying to be extra and this is
where sometimes been extra doesn't pay
off so yeah of course I always have to
be extra so I ended up trying to like
put some darker tones in the wig and I
just mess
and a widened looking techie but I'll
insert like the colors that I use to get
to this point but it's not but this is
not going to be like a tutorial anything
like that but I'm definitely going to
tell you everything I use and I'll
definitely list it all in my description
box just in case you guys are interested
in getting this color okay so basically
how I achieve this look of course the
head came in like a 6 13 type of color
but I wanted it to be more on a ketone
because it was more like the yellowy
tone and I didn't really like that I
don't really like that in 6:13 wigs so I
decided that I was going to turn the
hair which I did and I was just insert
those products or whatever it is that I
use but I used this tone about Claro I
think it was like T 14 and basically it
was like a pale and she blonde color so
when I phoned the head and mind you the
head is already light into a 6 13 color
and that's the way it came originally so
when I told the hair it's time to head
to like this ashy gray color which I was
not expecting I just thought it was
going to be like on a more ashy blonde
tone but it ended up being like a more
ashy gray in color so after I told the
hair and realized that it was like more
greyish than what I wanted to be I
decided to I decided I had some color
left over I don't think I ever use the
color if I did I mix it with something
but basically I use the adorn
the pastel lavender color and if I have
a picture of our inserted but I used
that on her hand I just put it all but I
didn't mix a little bit of conditioner
and Lissa's so it could be a little bit
lighter so once I did that I achieved
the perfect color it was the look I was
going for basically it was like this
pastel lavender type of color and I love
this so much but like I said I was mad
extra and I added some dogs home because
I'm like oh I'm gonna make me contrast
I'm gonna give it some contrasting you
know tones I'm just going it's when we
let right no not at all so it basically
just did not turn out how I wanted it to
so I was like okay forget it
so I mixed a blue I think it was emerald
I mix and I mixed baby pink like I said
I'll insert clips of what some color and
everything look like but I mix like pink
and blue together to get purple because
I didn't say like going out and getting
more purple in so yeah and once I put
that one over top of the lavender type
of color this is how it turned out and
as you can see it still has like peaks
of lavender coming through which I like
it but originally when I died the hair I
did not like the color I knew I didn't
like it because the hair was in styled
or anything like that but I definitely
definitely regret messing with it that I
doubted that Lander type color because I
really really really like that color
with my skin tone so stay tuned next
because I think that's the color that
I'm going to achieve next time but this
is what this wave turned out to be so I
didn't have this week caught it in the
middle but then I was like I don't know
I feel like it will look more better
parted on the side so yeah and my hair
underneath is just really flat it has my
head part it in the middle and
his like little braids going down on the
side went straight back you know so my
head underneath here is the flattest
that it's ever been I'm definitely
loving my braid pattern under here and
it's meeting this wage look so flat but
this way it looks so natural
once I like fix it up and curled it this
week really came alive so I'm definitely
in love with this wig right now you guys
and as far as tingling and shedding I
had not received any Tanglin nor did I
receive any shedding from this week no
online so I did not receive any tingling
at all from this week I was paired this
 after I toned it but it wasn't
shedding bit or anything like that like
it was a couple of strands and that was
it for the most part but this hair has
been holding up so well it looks so good
I'm so in love with this hair so yeah
I'm deciding on whether I want to keep
it or not but I'm probably going to sell
this in my wig sale and I know you guys
have been so patient so I'm not going to
say the exact date but it's definitely
coming up soon so stay tuned for that
but so I'm going to go here and turn
around so you guys can see what the wig
looks like all the way around and like I
say it might be uneven in the back
because I feel like this sides a little
bit longer than this side but you know
don't mind it
so guys tell me what you think about
this color are you feeling it or is it
enough I would really like to know but
basically this is just how I've been
wearing it um and I did cut it because
it did come the hair did come right here
and I just cut like the end of kind of
to give it like this bulb type of look
but not really but I think I am going to
cut a few more pieces up because I think
this eye is longer it's in this side and
I love the way this side looks and as
far as like how I got these curls I just
took my flat iron and just curl the hair
so I didn't use like a barrel curl or
long curl anything like that I just used
regular slit on a regular strainers and
this head is really a bouncy and it's
really really soft and the second is a
lot of body you guys do see this color
so if you're looking for a bomb wig and
you're looking to invest in a nice
weight that's going to last year or if
you are looking for a duct root 6:13
