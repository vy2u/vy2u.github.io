fashion this is not a plague on ain't no
fish fight bitch I'm blasting look for
me like I'm 13 years I've been so many
records hey guys is Kate of course and
I'm back with a another video and this
video is going to be on this hair and
this head was sent to me from a fat wig
so if you're interested in this hell or
just interested in saying any head that
they have available one insight I'll go
ahead and leave all their links in my
description box so the way they sent me
is their lace front wig and 24 inches
and I have it in a color one b613 and
the density is one hundred and fifty
percent now I'll go ahead and leave
everything and the description box just
in case I left something out but
basically that's what this wig is so of
course I did go ahead and die this hair
so first off when I receive the wig it
was nice I come on my fingers do it I
didn't get any shot in at all so I went
ahead and put in the color and like I
said I use four bottles of the
periwinkle color and one bottle of the
platinum color and all of this is about
a dorm so I'll put that in in it
initially I only use three bottles of
the periwinkle and then I had to go back
because I still felt like it was blowing
pieces peeking through so I went back to
my beauty supply store and I got another
bottle of the primary school and then I
was like hmmm I want that hard week but
look about is some like great tone to it
cuz that's the kind of look I was going
for anyway so I just picked up the
Platinum color as well so then I mixed
those two together and put it on the
hair and then I let it sit in the hair
for about thirty minutes and when I say
the wig was saturated I release
this thing so I thought let it sit for
30 minutes I went here and rinse the
hair out and I watched it with my
Pantene pro-v y'all I'm so in love with
that stuff like like I'm only in love
with it because of the smell I still
like my Aussie but the smell of that
Pantene pro-v it just gets me every time
so basically that's what I use to wash -
I meant to shampoo and condition this
hands and once I rinsed it out or
whatever I didn't let the hair air dry
but but if I wouldn't let the hair air
dry you can tell that it would add dried
- like this light wave pattern but I
didn't let it air dry because I just did
all of this today and I want you to get
this video up today and show you guys my
results so yeah I was pressed for time
so your girl blew dry hair but I didn't
like blow dried looks like a comb or
anything I just blew you know the blows
you're out on the hair and kind of like
messed around with it with my hand so
yeah after and I did that oh and before
I blew dry to hell before I put heat on
to the hair I did go in with my Tresemme
heat protectant and it's in like a black
bottle I think you got a red top on it
and it's like a spray bottle and I just
sprayed the head with that I only did it
I normally don't do it but I'm starting
to do it on my um died head cuz I just
felt like it's already gone through like
the processing and all that stuff and I
want to save the hair as much as I can
so yeah I just use the heat protectant
on it before I blow dried the hair so
that if the I blow dried the hair
I took my warm Carla so this is what the
wrong curl or looks like and I don't
like really know what size it is but
this is just what it looks like and I
switch my hair wrapped it around and I
took pretty small pieces that's why it
looks like this so yeah after I finish
perhaps it's my aussie holding spray
just spray on hair but i low-key
thinking that stuff just don't work for
me like this hair holds the curl anyway
so I felt like I really didn't need it
but it actually holds the curl really
nice so after I sprayed it with the
holding sway I went ahead and plucked
some uh the long curls out like I just
went individually and pluck them out but
then I really didn't like that look and
also I had a middle punch you guys but
when I put it one I was just not feeling
that hairstyle so when I put the wig one
I just went and hit with my vent brush
and brushed out all of the curls and
this is just how it ended up and I still
had that middle part and I was like you
look like a poodle
so I ended up just flipping the hair
over to one side because I feel like you
just can't go wrong with it especially
when you have curly hair so I just ended
up flipping the hair or two on one side
and this is how the hair ended up I did
not bleach my lights on this week and I
did not pluck the hair line which I
recommend you doing if you want chewy to
look more natural but I felt like um it
looks natural to me how you know I got
the baby heads off flowing and stuff but
I was pressed for time if I wasn't so
pressed for time I wouldn't have went in
and bleach the knots and plus the
hairline because the hairline did not
look natural whatsoever the hairline
also came with baby hairs which I didn't
use but there was a little bit too long
so I just cut them down and I actually
like the way the hair line looks right
now like you can't even really tell that
I did it like the hairline is in pluck
it still looks really natural I don't
think that the hairline was really
really bad but I still felt like if you
wanted to even go in and pluck it but I
do suggest doing something with some
baby hairs around your hairline if you
are lazy and don't want to pluck it
because it always makes it look just a
little
more natural and it's puzzling my baby
hands down this time I use my moose and
I don't feel like wanna go get it but
it's fine I Roby and I only get this is
what the color is looking like and I
swear it's like some blue tones purple
tones as well as like and she purple
type grayish tone it really has
something nice it has a lot of dimension
in this week and I just love the way it
turned out you guys and it definitely
looks nice on my skin so I'm very
pleased with this week still no I have
not received any shut-in as far as
Tanglin I don't receive any tingling I
received a little snag on the bottom I
will say it is a little snakey but
that's only because I sprayed it with
holding spray so yeah I get like this
niggas like towards the end where the
head is really curly head but it doesn't
it hasn't really tangled up on me or
anything like that so this is it for
this video I love you guys and I'll see
you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
