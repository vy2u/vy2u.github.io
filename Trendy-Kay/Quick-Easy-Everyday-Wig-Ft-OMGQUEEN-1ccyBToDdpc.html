might face in her me she be mixing with
the rich see the plug shipping Nancy the
running part of God shell stress you
don't trip bet she put on my boss over
fire
gotta choose someone
okay yeah so I cut off the leads to this
wig and I was going to use my got to be
hairspray just to hold down the lace but
I discovered something so in the
previous clip when I was showing you
what came in a box this little thing
came in a box or whatever which is like
the adjustable strap but it looked weird
to me it just didn't look like your
normal adjustable strap because it has
these little pieces at the end and then
it also is like literally adjustable so
you can adjust it so as I was cutting of
the lace I saw these little tips which
is new to me I don't I've never seen
this before and OMG Queen is like not
new to my channel so I'm thinking that
you hook this up to these little I don't
know if y'all can see that but it's a
piece that clearly you can hook this
into so I'm gonna try that out because
if this works and I don't have to spray
this we've got to be glue holding spray
then we it's in the money okay so that's
what it looks like sorry you can hear
noise in the background so it's hooked
on to there then I'm just gonna hook the
other side and we
to see how this works out so basically
this is how it's cooked on today which
if this works yo this is just like this
is crazy
so nice team I'm excited
oh my god okay so I'm adjusting some
more because it's still being on my head
so let's just see
I'm adjusted all the way
this is a week that you definitely have
to add to your weed collection even if
you wear synthetic which you have to
have that just one human hair wig that
just never do you wrong and I feel like
this is the one right here first of all
it's Yankee so if you're into like
Yankee wigs you'll definitely love this
one and the fact that it's a good length
I feel like bulbs are always gonna be in
style and yeah it's just sleep nice you
can wake up I mean you can dress it up
you can dress it down yeah so this is
what it looks like the only thing I did
to this wig of course was bleach the
knots and it was okay I felt like I
needed to leave the bleach on a little
bit longer but I didn't so I might go
back and bleach him again I'm not sure I
might leave it alone hey do you all see
this headline first of all I think this
is a pre plug pay line I did not plug
this headline whatsoever this is how it
comes I did go ahead and straighten this
week and it is like so silky and flowy
but still has that nice yaki texture
that I like this way it looks so
realistic I feel like you wouldn't even
be able to tell that I'm wearing a wig
and literally looks like my hair so this
is definitely a look though y'all do
y'all see this this is like this could
be like a Valentine's Day look I'm not
even lying Oh y'all gonna kill me but I
love the way this came together I love
this whole look with this more time and
I'm not gonna make this video too long
but this is the end results and as far
as tangling and shut-in there is none I
don't get tingling from this week and I
do not receive shutting even after our
bleach denies and washed it I still have
not received any shedding from this wig
which is absolutely crazy cut off the
lace still haven't received any shedding
so this definitely is an
construct a wig the quality is amazing
the texture the style I didn't have to
cut this this is how the cut came so if
you want a wig that you just can put on
and you don't have to put any work into
it this is the wig for you honey this
wig is so nice so I'll go ahead and
leave all the links to this week in my
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested and I will see you
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
