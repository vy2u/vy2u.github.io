review and I was sent this hair from
Bella and more hair all right so I'm
low-key excited about this little hair
review because I really like this hair
now this has not perfect but I
definitely do love this hair and I think
that it turned out really nice because
lord I was struggling okay like your
girl was struggling I believe this is
Brazilian I'm pretty much sure this is
Brazilian so it's their soft curly
bundle hair I have it in four bundles
and I had the closure to match I have to
26 inches and to 24 inches and I'm not
sure the inch of my closure but I will
leave it here on the screen and I didn't
even use the closure I only could fit
three and a half bundles on here so I
still have I still had like this much
hair left over which I was really
surprised about in care I was trying to
squeeze these bundles up in here
but it didn't really work out that way
so this was a struggle for me only
because I didn't go with my original
plan and just make a wig out of this I
mean this is a week but but it's like a
3/4 wig or a u-part wig normally when I
get bundle hair I just make a wig out of
it and use the lace closure but this
time I was like hmm this hair might
actually really blend in good or I can
blend my hair good with this hair so
I'll insert clips of how the hair looked
originally when I first got the hair and
this is what the curl looks like a star
you guys will see the curl before I
washed it which it was more tighter and
it just looked really really really good
yeah so if you was to purchases hand
used to wash it don't think that the
head when you wash the hair is gonna be
like it was when you first got it
because the curl was literally the bomb
like I loved it but it was it was too
short for me so I felt like I needed to
wash it so basically I wound up making a
u-part wig and I just had clips to to
you punch so I can just clip it into my
hair and how I have my hair under here
is it's just braided going like this and
I had my leave out right here and I also
had my leave out um around the perimeter
of my hair if you want to so the u part
wig onto your head you can do that but
I'm not that like loyal as far as these
we've been on my head that long I just
don't like it so um I just sold some
clips into my head so I can clip it on
it off and that works fine um one thing
I don't like about that is it's clips
and you guys know that I don't really
like using combs or clips in my hair so
already this is like really irritating
me because these clips I just feel like
my hair is being pulled out it's
probably not but in my mind that's what
I think I'm sorry you guys this review
is probably gonna be like all over the
place on okay so when it came time to
try to blend that my head in with this
hair it just would not work oh when I
tell you my hair was just way too curly
for this and my head is not I don't I
wouldn't consider my head being really
curly my head's more wavy than anything
so my head up against this hair it was
just like my head was just way too curly
and it just did not look right like you
could see where my
hair started and it just did not blend
in seamlessly so I was like no not
walking out the house like this then I
started rethinking what I did and I'm
just like oh my god what did I do
I should have just freaking and made the
whole wig and put the lace closure on
there oh girl what is you doing you
always wanna be extra and now look what
happen so I'm like thinking so basically
I came up with this and it turned out so
pretty you guys like when I say I'm in
love with this hairstyle like literally
I'm in love with this hairstyle so
basically what I did is I just a braid
it a braid down this side and operated a
braid down that side so that way none of
my hair is really out I'm the only
pieces of hair that's out is this and as
you can see like my hair is like wake
earlier than this so after when this
hair for a while I definitely noticed a
lot of tangling so that's one thing that
I don't really like about this hair and
that would be my only complaint like as
far as Shannon I don't get no shedding
from this week the only shedding I would
get from this hair is when I wash and
detangle it I'm just looking at it like
you can't tell that it's a little on the
tingly side now what I do like about it
is that it's really really easy to
detangle this hair all I do is spray a
little bit of water and conditioner on
it and the tangles come right back like
right out like what's like no hesitation
like it just snaps right back and even
when I did tangle this hair I don't get
a lot of shedding at all it would be
like a couple of strands now when I
first got this hair I did get it was it
was a nice and I wasn't like crazy or
nothing but it was a little bit of
shouting but after that like when i
detangled his hair just don't get that
much shedding from this
this is where 26 inches stops under me
so I do have a 10% off coupon code for
you guys and I will leave the coupon
code right here it's trendy so if you do
decide to purchase this hair you can get
10% off so girls don't sleep on a coupon
code okay and most of the time I have
coupon codes but I never mentioned them
in my video so if you don't look at my
description box thing you won't know
that I have a coupon code so that's it
for this video I hope you enjoyed it and
I will talk to you guys later
okay guys so another thing I'm gonna do
a Q&amp;amp;A video so if you want to leave your

matter but yeah I just feel like you

like a lot of you have a lot of
questions for me so why not just do like
a little Q&amp;amp;A and we can just get them to
each other easily leave your comments in
