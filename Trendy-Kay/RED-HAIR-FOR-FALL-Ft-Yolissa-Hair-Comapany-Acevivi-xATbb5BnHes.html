the seas I might start off on the beam
who you with my niggas Calais ha ha ha
oh ok guys so I'm back with another
weight review well no this is not a
weight review this is one of the a
review on some bundle hair I was sent
from yo Lisa a hair company offer
Aliexpress so yeah let's just get
started um with this video because I
want this to be kind of quick because
this for me has been like a two day
process so if you see me with like a
different outfit on it's because I
literally filmed this video in two days
because of all kinds of complications
but so this is what the hair looks like
straight out of the package and it is
pretty nice it's very soft and I love
how this hair already came colored on
top of this color this had been bleached
I also bleached his hair two times too
and it took a really good - the color
this is what the way it looks like after
I have sewn it onto my dome cap and
gotta head all that good stuff so I'm
really pleased with my results and how
this wig came out as you can see I'm
like grinning and everything cuz I'm
just so happy with the color so yeah um
let's just get started on its video I
hope you guys enjoy and yeah comment
down below if you like this color on me
you guys before I get started I just
want you guys to know if I watched it um
because this is body with hair it does
kind of dry itself to like a loose wave
but mines didn't dry like that because I
kept one like running my friendís story
so that's why it's so big and bushy
because I kept on playing with the hair
but yeah so just in case you want to
know if the head dropped like this no it
didn't I just was messing with it so
yeah I hate my Old Faithful Trina's and
I was like I don't
really know if I want to you know get a
new stringing up but I was like it's
time to just get something new even
though there's nothing wrong with my old
straightness but I definitely wanted to
try some new strands and when I tell you
like this is not even a lie yes I will
sent these straightens but they
definitely get the job done and I'll
insert a clip to just show you guys
proof that these really work because I
use my old flat irons on like one side
of this wig in the back just to test it
out and I did my and I did these new
flat irons um on this side and actually
these flat these treatments work better
so I was really surprised and yes so we
just want to get started so if you're
interested in these flat ones I will
leave the link in my description box so
now I'm just getting started on
straightening my hair and I'm removing
the flat ons and that's just the
direction to everything so this is what
the flat on looks like or the
straightener and yeah I don't know if
I'm butchering this name but I'll leave
it all in my description box and these
really get hot you guys so be careful
because I did like burn myself so I'm
not like doing any kind of certain way I
just well I kind of am I start in the
back and then I work my way up to the
front and these I'm not saying like go
out and spend your money on these flat
honest but they are only 30 bucks and
for the price they are really good
they're not extravagant or anything like
that but they are pretty good flat ons
if you wanted some new ones so yeah
that's basically what I'm doing and this
video is going to cut off so be aware
but yeah that's basically what I'm doing
this
video is basically want to be like
chopped and screwed because um my
battery went dead when I was trying to
show you guys me um straightening my
hair so basically this is the basically
this is the next day and as you can tell
this hair does not really keep I mean it
doesn't stay straight I mean for the
most part it does stay straight but you
can see it start to wave up so basically
I'm just gonna go over um
this hand to make it straight again um
I'm just going to straighten the hand
just don't go through it I'm not gonna
yeah thanks so this is it goes up to 230
so cm stealthier I don't know I thought
it was Fahrenheit I don't know if these
equivalents and how they without but
it's on a 230 so that's the highest they
go and that's what I have anyone so yeah
if some of you guys are retarded like me
basically a Celsius gets converted into
a fern height so all in all these flat
ons or straightness go up to a four
hundred and forty six degrees so I do
have these straightness set at its
highest setting which is four hundred
and forty six degrees so now you just
see me straightening my hair all over
I'm not doing it in no special type of
way I just wanted it to be quick and
fast so I can keep it moving so yeah
okay now overall I absolutely love this
hair I have no complaints about this
hair whatsoever no I do well it's not
like serious because I mean this is some
affordable hair but for this price like
this hair is so long so the things I
like about this hair is that it takes to
color very well like bleach I bleached
his hair two times and it took really
good to the color it didn't damage the
hair at all I mean it took took really
good to the bleach and the bleach did
not damage this hair all as you can see
I can wear my fingers do it and you know
everything like that so yeah one thing I
don't like about this hair is that it
reverts back within like maybe give it
like an hour and it is start to wave up
now that my entire head won't wave up
but in certain spots especially this
spot over here it likes to wave up
another thing I don't really like about
this hair is it tangles a little bit I
don't know if that comes from bleaching
the hair or not but yeah it does get
like a tingly in the back as you um as
you wear it so you got to kind of keep
on like so it's not perfect but this is
definitely some really nice hair and I
really love it I definitely love the
color like this color is on point you
guys and if you follow me on instagram
i'll put my instagram right here they
like peanut butter jelly like if you
follow me on instagram you have to be
following me on youtube vice versa so
yeah i'm going to insert my instagram
name so hurry up and go follow me after
you watch this video and if you are not
subscribed to my channel you need to
subscribe to my channel because you are
missing out girlfriend like I'm trying
too tight sorry if you can hit a fan but
I'm so hot so I have three bundles in a
closure
I have 16 18 and 20 inches
and I have a 14 inch closure I feel like
I want to cut it but I'm not sure
because I do eventually want to curl his
hair so I'm just gonna wait on it but
yes this hair turned out so perfect so
basically what I did was I just made a
wig and I sold the bundles onto a dome
cap you can get a dome cap from your
local beauty supply store and they only
like a dollar ninety-nine whoa - it's a
thousand 99 I did not do anything to the
part the reason it's a little light is
because I have a new stocking cap
underneath so yeah this hair is really
thick in full three bundles with like
the hair it's so thick and remember I
don't have all the fun
no wait a second hmm okay
my mistake I didn't use all of the
bundles and as you can tell this hair is
really really really really thick so I
did use all the money to lose my mistake
because I said I didn't but that was
awesome
over here so yeah thank you guys for
watching if you had any questions feel
free to leave it in my description on my
description box with my comment section
and Josh y'all I will see y'all in my
next video I love you all

hair I will leave everything in my
