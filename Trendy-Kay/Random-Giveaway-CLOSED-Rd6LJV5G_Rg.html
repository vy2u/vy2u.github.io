wondering what it looks like I'm pretty
sure this is still on their website and
you can just go see what it looks like
but it has 12 color eye shadows and yeah
and I'm guessing they're all knew it was
really pretty so yeah but I don't like
other people stuff like that so yeah I'm
just not going to open it um um the next
thing you will get is this nude blush

big fan of nude so yeah this is a 10
color blush palette and this is what it
looks like so yeah again if you want to

of this stuff um with my own money so
yeah the next thing i have is this
sculpt and blend too so they already had
like a brush set but this is the second
one that they came out with and it's a
10 piece brush set and I get all my

also from bhcosmetics as well um yeah
next
next I picked up a few things from elf
so like all this stuff is like double
from from like stuff that i purchased so
yeah a lot of people have been excellent
like what highlighter I use so yeah this
is the highlighted that I use and it's

in love with this color in my lips and a
lot of people always ask me what do I

care I use it for my lips anyway so that
is in here as well then I also um have
some been a banana powder and this is
what I use for like my under-eye powder
form i highlighted areas I use this
stuff and yeah I thought it would be
neat to give you a sample just in case

would be cute so that is a sample size
of the Ben Nye banana powder that um I

and one is the color 30 so yeah this is
what they look like so yeah you can try
them out you might like them you might
not but it's free bow so yeah and these
also were only like a dollar on ebay as
well so yeah um I didn't really think
this through like I said when I was
shopping I was just getting double up
everything so yeah I don't know who's
gonna win so I don't really know what
your complexion is going to be like I
said it was random I was just like it
was like a spare moment type of thing so

my um my skin complexion between like
toffee and phone is my skin complexion

dramatic highlight I'll add like fun Oh
Tuffy under my eyes or however it goes
or cool 10 or I'll just like use this
concealer for like over foundation and
really don't matter but that's just how
i use it um so yeah so these are in here

think that through but if you like my
complexion or darker you definitely can
get away with these colors now if you're
lighter than me I don't know maybe you
