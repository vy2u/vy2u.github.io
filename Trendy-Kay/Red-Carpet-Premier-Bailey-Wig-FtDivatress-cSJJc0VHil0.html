video of course and this video is going
to be on this week so I received this
week from demon tribe so I'll leave all
the 'trust links in the description box
to this way just in case any of you guys
are interested so wait I'm wearing is by
the red carpets middle east front week
and I had it in the shower daily and I
had it in a color 9 IJ and if you watch
me or watch my videos you'll know that I
love the 9 9 j color I feel like it just
keep popping on any skin tone so if you
are lighter skin or darker skin I feel
like this color is just all for you baby
cuz it's just possible any skin tone so
let's get into this wig before I tell
you my thoughts on this week and
everything like that my computer I mean
I keep once more to say my computer code
my camera cut off so I want to know if I
showed you guys the picture but this is
what the picture looks like and of
course this way it looks nothing like
the picture because I did tweak it a
little bit but I'm going to show you
what the wave look like original little
first off they say that this is a lace
front wig and of course it's not so if
you want to part this week or thinking
you're going to be able to cut this wing
in any kind of way it's just not going
to happen for you basically this is like
a half a wig with lace the only things
you're doing is cutting off police so
keep that in mind that you cannot part
this wig in the front anywhere the only
thing you can do is basically we're back
or flip it over to each side and that is
what it so anyway this week comes with
two cones in the front a comb in fact
though this week is I'm just
and you know it comes with two combs and
the front of home in a bag with
adjustable stress yes I do feel like
this week is the kid-friendly so yeah
have I got any tangle in or shut in no I
have not received any shedding from this
week even when I brushed it out I didn't
receive shedding Tanglin I did receive a
little bit of tangle in once I brush the
hair out now I'm just going to answer a
clip of what this head looks like before
I justice to it and the hair is long and
it's okay without it they're brushed out
but if you want more volume in your head
to look bigger then I feel like we need
to brush it out but the curls how the
curls are originally I really really
like because they're not anything it
kind of gives you a feel of like some
version hair which I really like now on
the wig is kind of shiny before you
brush it out but after you brush it out
I just feel like the wig just looks so
much more natural and I did brush this
out with my vent brush no special way I
just brushed it out and I also cut this
part and then I took and cut the ends
off so I like this much off because I
thought wash it out I just felt like it
was just way too much hay because this
hair can get really big so I was just
lying true maybe I should cut it down a
little bit and after I cut it down I'm
very very satisfied with this hair I
feel like this head is pop and go okay
so overall I really liked this wig I
don't think that it's like a Yankee
texture or anything like that but I will
say after you brush you out I'm telling
you this week comes a lot honey so if
you do plan on getting this wig and you
make it to how low my wig is will you
switch it up I would really like to see
it go take me one Instagram or send me a
DM at at pitches because I'm really
curious to see what it looks like but
yeah besides is not having no lace
really to work with in the front
I definitely love this
I love the curls honestly so this is not
going to be like no long video I'm just
getting straight to the point but if you
have not already purchased this weight
check this wig out I'll leave all the
links in the description box because
like I said I really really like this
video it's so cute
like even before I cut it I'm still like
the curls I mean even before I brush it
out like the curls are wearable I feel
like if you like those type of curls you
definitely can wear like that and then
as the wig gets older and you want a
different style I think you brushing it
out is just going to create a whole
different look for you oh yeah and
basically all I did was cut me some baby
heads and lifted there with my got to be
glued and I said if anybody is wondering
what's on my list is color copies chilly
child
so that's into this video if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave it
in my comment section down below and
I'll see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
