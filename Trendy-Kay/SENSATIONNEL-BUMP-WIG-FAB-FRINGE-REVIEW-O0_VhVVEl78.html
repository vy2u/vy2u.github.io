that have been waiting for me to do a
nother um short wig review so this is it
right here and this is by sensation or
believe um yeah sensational it's the
bump collection wig and it's called the
fab French I did purchase this wig from
wig types calm and I believe it was
nineteen dollars
I'm really not too sure but you know I
always leave the price in the
description box so if I'm wrong I was
definitely leave the price in the
description box and yeah this is
basically a full cap unit and it's also
a hundred percent human hair so you can
curl and style this with you however you
want to so that's basically what I did
okay you guys now I'm just going to let
you guys know that this unit did not
come like this at all I mean I didn't
really do too much to this unit but I
did do some tweaking so basically um the
wig will look like this when you get it
is kind of like long on one side and
then short on the other side you
definitely can like flip it it gives you
the option to like flip it to either
side so it really doesn't matter if you
weight on your your right side or your
left side so if you want to see um if
you want to see how the unit looks fresh
out the packaging I'm pretty sure you
can
on thousands of reviews on this fab
fringe week because a lot of people have
been doing reviews on this unit so I
think it's pretty popular so um so if
you want to see how the unit looks fresh
out of the package just um check other
people's reviews on this and you'll see
how the week comes originally what I did
to this unit is I didn't really like all
that long stuff in my face so cuz I mean
the unit was like long towards here so
what I did was I just cut this out
I didn't even mess with this side cuz I
felt like it didn't really need to be
cut so I just want to hit and took my
scissors and just like started layering
it like I didn't like chop it off I kind
of like did it downward downwards motion
and I just started cutting some inches
off and I think I cut it to about here
yeah I cut it to about here and the wig
originally came like right here so this
is the part I cut and I also cut a
little on the side because it was a
little longer on this side versus this
side so yes and bends though this is
100% human hair I decided to curl this
unit with my flat iron and this is the
look that I let me go ahead and show you
guys the back um under here my head my
hair is in a ponytail and it's braided
at the end and I just have it picked up
so it is kind of like a hump because
it's not really that flat but this is
what the back of the week looks like
they forget to mention that this week I
believe I'm not even sure I think it has
two combs on the side a comb in the back
and adjustable Shrek's I'm definitely
positive that it has a comb in the back
and adjustable straps but I'm not sure
about how many combs or if he even has
combs in the front area but I'll
definitely list it in my description box
because I wasn't even paying attention
but I do know that it has a comb in the
back and it also has adjustable straps
so I'm pretty sure it probably did come
with a comb somewhere up in this area
and as far as the cap construction and
how big this um this way is it is kind
of big for my heads so guys real quick I
just wanted to show you a clip of how
the hair looks now after I went ahead
and cut the wig even shorter so I'm
really happy with the results I did like
the wig before I cut it even shorter but
I just felt like I wanted a shorter look
so I went ahead and cut the wig even
more so I hope you enjoy bye guys
what else oh yeah if you guys want to
see how I cut this unit and styled it
just give this video a thumbs up or
leave it in the comment section below
saying that you want to see a video on
how I cut in style this unit so like I
said before I did purchase this from
Wade tights calm I'll put the price in
the description box and yeah I don't
think I really have anything else to say
about this unit so I will see you in my
next video you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
