and this time this review is going to be
on some hair i was sent by she loves
hair company which is a new hair company
providing you with virgin brazilian hair
so I'm yes I was sent four bundles and a
closure which was 24 24 22 20 and a 16
inch lace closure so I did make a wig
out of this um out of the bundles that
they sent me right now I'm just going to
insert a clip of how the packaging came
to me which was really nicely packaged
and like the packaging was on point i'll
give them attend for how the packaging
looks i was really pleased by the
packaging is really okay guys so this is
the box that my hair came in and i think
this is a really pretty box and it just
has their name on it which is she luks
hair company so now this is the bundles
that i received and it has a go sticker
on it i gots to go with the theme so
that's my closure 20 inches 22 24 and 24
and i really like the packaging this is
just a thank you card and it has
instructions of how to take care of your
hair so i thought this was really cute
so this is one of the bundles that i'm
showing you how it looks and its really
nice the wefts are constructed really
good and it's just so bouncy and this is
the closure which i think the closure is
really good as well and if they have
baby hairs on it and now this is just me
showing you how the part is and that's
basically it okay so here is what um the
wig looks like that I'm
eight and that is the part in space
right here I did slightly put the part
to the side and this is how long it is
it's really long and let me just take it
off the style foam head so you guys can
see how I constructed this wig and yes
it does have styrofoam in it because
when I make my wigs I do glue down the
hair I don't sew it because i think it's
just way too much time it takes way too
much time to do that in um I don't want
to spend that much time so in some hair
too I'm a cat so yeah I take the easy
road out which is gluing it down and it
works fine for me I know some people
prefer to sew their units um to make
their units like soda hair down but um
yeah I guess it will last longer versus
the glue but my leg my weights last
pretty long and they don't come apart so
I'm fine with gluing it down the only
thing I do so so down is the closure and
the last track that I put um next to the
closure that's the only thing that I so
down but the rest is glued so if you do
decide to glue your units down I would
suggest that you put a plastic bag maybe
under I met over your mannequin head so
this doesn't happen I'm before you start
gluing but I mean it doesn't bother me
so but yeah this is what um it looks
like and I did ed clips yes and I hate
clips but the only problem I'm having
it's like the caps are so big so when I
do my next I'm wig when I make my next
week I did buy a different cat in I want
to see how that works out because these
don't care
really do not work for me I mean if
anybody had suggestions on what i can
use because my head is very very small
so this week that i made is like the
worst out all my wigs I made you guys
like literally I had to put clips in
here and it makes me not even want to
wear the wig because I don't want to put
clip these clips on my so I'm just going
to put this unit on for you guys so you
guys can like see how it looks I don't
really know how this is going to work
because you know I don't have a week at
all anything on and my part is in the
middle and not on the side but I guess
what just before I don't even know if
it's going to stay on my head you guys
but it's so huge I'm not even going to
clip these clips in my head because it's
what the pardon looks like which I think
the part is really nice so and again I
just put this on my head so yeah I
didn't really put any effort into like
trying to make it look real but it
actually looks pretty good but i did add
some powder to my part I didn't pluck it
i just added powder because i felt like
the lease was a little bit too light for
my skin complexion so i just added some
powder and it turned out really good in
my opinion okay so this is where 24
inches stops on me it's really long it
is true to its length so you guys this
was just a quick little show-and-tell um
if anybody is interested in um you know
flourish ahead this is another one for
you this is a really great company and
they do offer bundle deals so that's
always a good thing so if you interested
in his hair I would suggest you go to
their website and check it out so I will
list everything in my description box
and links to their website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
