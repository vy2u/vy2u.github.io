for you today and yes this is a wig that
I'm wearing on my head and it is by sis
sister wigs it is the lace braid box I
guess that's what it's called lace braid
box and this is what the picture looks
like and I had this wig in a 1b
ok you guys so let's just hop straight
into this wig because I don't want this
to be a long video so I did purchase
this week from Wiig types calm and I
paid $70 for this week this week has a
comb on this side it has a comb on this
side and it does has a comb in the back
with the adjustable straps um
this did come with the lace going
straight across from ear to ear and I
just cut the lace off and this is what
it looks like
there isn't much part in space they give
you like about this much of a part of
space so basically it's just like from
let me see I don't know if you guys can
see that but it's not basically any
parting space at all on the shoot it so
yes you don't have to worry about
shedding or tangling because it is a
braided unit okay you guys so I
absolutely hate this wig
umm I think it was a waste of my 70
dollars because it just was not what I
was expecting I was expecting it to be
more natural-looking but I didn't get
that wig just looks really unnatural on
me I just don't like it I will
never wear this wig out so I just feel
like I wasted $70 but I feel like it is
worth the $70 if you have a nice week um
a weight that you like I just don't like
the seen a lot of people review Box
breeze and the box braids wigs and it
looked really good on them let me tell
you about the things that I don't like
because you guys are probably looking
like well it's really nothing wrong with
this week but I tried to fix this wig a
lot and then I just gave up because I
felt like with synthetic units
especially like a braided unit you don't
really have to do anything
but I found myself like taking the hair
out and braiding it over and I just
wasn't for any of that because I felt
like I was basically putting too much
work into something that should already
you know be I don't even know the words
that I'm trying to say but it was just
basically too much work that I was
putting in when I really didn't have to
so firstly let me say let me start by
saying that the picture is how the
weight came so it looks unnatural to me
because when the way came it didn't you
know how when you have box braids it's
like the fake hair like the the part is
like a fake hair on the root and then
you know it's like I can't explain this
for these braids look like as if you
braided your own hair and they're really
loose and it just looks really fake so
what I did was let me take this down
okay so this is the hair down and before
I get into showing you guys the
construction of the wig and how they
planted this hair let me stand up so I
can show you guys how long this wig is
so the wig is pretty long the straggling
pieces like right here that's really
long was me
braiding the hair myself so that's why
it's pieces that's long already you get
up close to the wig you can see that I
braided this I braided everything in the
front you can tell the difference
between my braids and the braids that
already came in the wig which they are
more tighter and these are looser now
you see this like this is just all loose
right here and you see how this really
looks like because I took fake hair and
I braided it to this because that's how
I box braids look it doesn't look like
this so I did all of these braids up
here and I did just basically the front
row and then I did the second row in the
back but I didn't do them on the side so
it's basically like the first the second
row up here and then on the sides just
the first row so yeah this is what it
looks like this is the hairline when I
do pull it back the lace does come up so
that's something I don't like as well
but I just feel like after a while of me
braiding the unit I just gave up because
I'm like this would literally take me
all day and if I was just going to braid
this whole wig I could have just braid
my own hair get me wrong it is a very
gorgeous unit but I just don't want to
put in any more work to make it look how
I want it to look so yeah not gonna wear
this unit anymore I just feel like it
looks really really fake oh oh oh well
come out from the lorac
I'm just really disappointed because the
way I look at it is I spent $70 and $70
could have got me like three or four
extra you know three or four weeks that
I could have been rocking right now so
I'm just going to chuck it up and just
take this one as a loss but I mean if
you are interested in the wig and you
want to put in the work to make it look
more realistic like um like real box
braids then by all means you can
purchase this week because I think this
is like the cheapest wig that I found
full box braided like a box braided wig
because I think the other wigs buy like
sensational and I'll trade what about a
hundred dollars so if you want to spend
that kind of money I think that it's
worth it it's definitely worth it if you
find a wig that it's constructed well
but this just looks really thick to me
you
okay you guys so I'm done with this
video I'm just going to end it right
here so if you have any questions about
this unit or just anything in general
feel free to leave it in a comment
