quick wig review this week I got at my
local beer supply store I have a new wig
that I got from my local beauty supply
store and this is my sister weeds it's
cause this by sister woods and this is
what it looks like right here this is
brimming fibers and I feel like it
really is because like this is different
from all the other synthetic heads that
I've been wearing like you can really
tell in the quality of this hair because
it doesn't do any tingling and it's so
soft it's like butter so yeah this is an
invisible top part
it's called deals I guess that's how you
pronounce it Dios yaki 22 and I have her
in a color for and this is invisible top
where you can cut out the part and put
your hair but I don't do that with my
wig so this is fine with me
they say 22 inches but I feel like it's
wait longer than 22 inches like I feel
like at least 24 to 26 inches like this
is a long wig I don't know it comes to
my bellybutton so yeah um this week was
39.99 I will look online for this week
if I can find it online I will
definitely let you know and link it in
the about in the description box but I
love this wig it does shed a little bit
like I'll get a couple of strands like
just now here and there but other than
that I don't really it doesn't really
shed bed where it makes me not like the
wig and as far as tangling like
no tingling like oh I haven't noticed
any tingling at all and I had this week
for a couple days probably like sorry
and I had this wig for probably around
three or four days and I haven't got any
type of tingling or minimal shuttin but
I mean it's nothing that make me not
like this week so yeah this is what the
way it looks like up close look how it
just like flows and bounce like it's so
pretty you guys like and it does say
that it's future fibers up to 400° but
I feel like if you want to you know if
you want to put heat on a wig or you
want to have a curly unit or have a unit
with curls in it I think that you should
just purchase a wig with curls in it
because this is like you don't need to
do anything to this wing if you want to
string wig let it be straight like don't
try to switch it up just buy a new one
cuz this is gorgeous like it's not too
thick and it's not too thin it's just
right but yeah that's what it looks like
in the front and
and this is what it looks like in the
back
we it's because it's so thick right here
that you can see where the lease starts
like I don't really like that but I
don't know I probably have to do some
more tweaking to this wig and try to get
it right so you can't really see it Oh
like pick that plastic off the pot but I
don't want to mess it up but besides
that I love this wig it's so pretty
ok let's try this again this week has a
comb right here and a comb right here it
does not have a comb in the back at
least I don't think no but it does have
adjustable straps but yeah you guys tell
me what you think I absolutely love this
wig I think that it's like the perfect
Street wing like it's so pretty
so that irritates the SH out of me
but yeah so bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
