this um this week was sent to me from
sister waves out calm so this is free
trust equal lace front legs deep
invisible out part and this is in the
style justice and I have it in an Opie
for 30 this is what the picture looks
like so yeah I am really really and love
with this unit it's just so simple I
feel like I love the length of this wig
like it's not long it's just and look at
the color it's just like so natural
looking like what the part is actually
on point I did pluck my part I did not
add any concealer or powder um and I
didn't do much as far as blending um
like my hair and with the part or
anything like that so I am getting a few
strands of hair so this week does shape
it is not shedding like really crazy and
as far as tangling I have not received
any tangles from this unit this unit is
just like everyday like nice unit okay
now I have a question because this is
not like a new unit this unit has been
around I think I did see some reviews on
this UM one this week but it's giving me
kind of like a bug
like he's giving me like a bob bob but
it's like a real long bob so if you do
have this unit let me know like is this
a ball like I feel like it is though I
just feel like it's like a longer bulb
but um this is definitely how I would
wear it I don't think I would I mean it
really don't matter like you cannot go
wrong with this unit it just is so sleek
ish and just really nice and you know
I'm a fan of the color 4:30
I feel like this for like brightens me
up a bit like it just works for me
so yes I really don't have much to say
about this unit it's just really really
nice I does have two combs in a 4-hour
comb in the bag and adjustable straps
this wig is a little one a big size so
if you have a bigger size head this way
would be perfect for you um but yes like
I really like this the texture is on the
silky side it kinda gives you like a
Yankee feel if you can't if you like
look at it got some crinkle ease like
that type of texture I don't know I call
it a creamy texture I don't know but um
yeah gives you like that kind of feel
but when you touch it like it's kind of
more on a silky side then the Yankee
side if you ask me but I'm fit I feel
like this is a ball I don't know y'all
told me but I absolutely loved it so if
you are interested in this unit
I will leave sister wigs link down below
and the link to this I'm wait and you
guys can purchase it yourself because
this is definitely a nice everyday type
of wig um it doesn't have dog boots all
the way through it only has the dog root
right here but it really doesn't matter
like the color is on point but yeah
so yeah this is what the front looks
like this is so cute like look how flat
is laying this is like really really
poppin okay so this is the front
okay guys so that's it for this video if
you have any questions feel free to
leave it in a comment section down below
and I will try to answer your questions
if you're wondering what's on my lips
because I'd be forgetting your I can
never remember either what I'm wearing
on my lips or just hmm I don't know I
just don't be putting in but this is um
color pop I'm a huge fan of color pop
lipsticks only because they're so
affordable and they just are so
affordable and for the price like the
quality of the lipsticks like what like
this looks like it's probably like
twenty other lipsticks and they only
like six dollars but anyway yes this is
color pop lax legs that's the color of
this look so yes um I will talk to you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
