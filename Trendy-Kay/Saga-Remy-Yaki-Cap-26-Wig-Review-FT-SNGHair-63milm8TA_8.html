review and I know I've been gone for a
little minute well it's been like two
weeks since I last found my video but
I'm back yeah so I don't know I've been
going because my face my facial has been
like really breaking out like it has not
been good so you know sometimes you just
feel real crazy and you just don't want
to show your face so yeah that's me I
just you know wanted to wait until my
face cleared up what you did so yeah my
face just be giving me all types of
problems you're like I do not understand
but anyway yes so I am here to review
this gorgeous wig that I have on my head
right now okay so I was sent this wig by
shake-and-go um so he is like SN g
shake-and-go so yet me and this is the
soap saga I'm a Yankee cat 100% remain
in my hair and this is what the box
looks like so yeah this is um hmmm hey
guys it's not synthetic um so basically
on a box that says full sewin with WF
Yankee and this is 26 inches y'all
notice not really 26 inches um let's
just keep it real um this is about 18
inches long so I'm not really trippin
off the lymph uh but if you do decide to
purchase this be a way that you're not
really getting the limp that they say so
if you purchase the 26 inch and I'm five
five so it will fall like right under
your boob which I think it's like 18
inches so they do have other
I'm available so this is the longest
lunch so I'm pretty sure if you do like
24 22 it probably will be shorter than
what they say
I don't know well yeah this is supposed
to be 26 inches but it's falling at like
18 I didn't have this in a color km 30
so basically that's like a DRI 30 which
is like a dot root and you know what's
the blonde or whatever so yeah that's
what the virus looks like now let's get
into this unit because when I first like
put this on I do not like this wig at
all so this unit um they come straight
now if I have if I can post like
pictures of what it look like before
then I would do that but yeah I'm this
unit did come straight and um it was not
cut into layers I did let the front area
and that was it I didn't keep the length
so I only cut legs like throughout the
front of the unit so yeah um and I did
curl this unit with my when that cutters
with my flat on so I caught a curl of my
yeah I curl all my head with my flat
arts I just think it's easier so I don't
know I don't know my I don't know I just
carry with my flat ones so yeah um now
let's talk about why I didn't like this
unit in the beginning um the reason why
I didn't like this unit in the beginning
it's because like they do give you a
lace part right here and then that's it
everything else is like no lace in the
front none of that
um it's not even combs and this unit is
only adjustable straps now if you have a
bigger size head I don't really think
that this wig internal fan is so high I
don't think that this fan I meant in
this thing I don't think that this unit
will work for you only because it's
already on this
on the side Soviet is like regular you
know too small then yes but if you have
like a big head then don't even waste
your time purchasing this unit because
you're not going to be able to fit it um
yeah I have a really really small hit
but without me and Justin adjusting the
straps
um the wig fit so yeah
I'm what else oh yeah like I was saying
it only comes with a part right here now
this part is all skin type there's no
type of lace or nothing and then okay so
this is what the part looks like so when
I got it it was like some fabric under
here and it like some hair was stuck on
to the fabric and it was just like hair
right here and then the skin type part
so I was like what am I supposed to do
with this like it doesn't look natural
whatsoever so I started like plucking
the head like so I took my pleating well
I cannot talk today I took my tweezers
and I started plucking a hair out of
like the fabric that they had underneath
of it and when I started plucking at it
like I could see like some lace so I was
like okay so it's lace under here so I
cut the fabric it's so hot explaining
but if you want to purchase this wig I
think that it is worth it because at the
end is a really beautiful wig but if you
don't want to put the work into it and
you really don't know what you're doing
as far as like the parts then don't even
waste your time because you have to work
with this part but anyway um so
basically what I did was I cut the
fabric underneath like out and then some
lace started showing through so
basically after I did all the work to
the part arm the part now reminds me of
like what's a wig Anna that's a good
example the anyway you know how to
innovate heads like a little
teeny amount of late space and then it
has like the fake skin to our heads like
the skin top that's basically what this
wing is now after I plucked all the hair
out of the front so yeah I'm pretty
happy with the part but that's only if
you want to put in the work because at
the end I think it turned out really
really really good so yeah you just
gotta like keep plucking and cutting
into you find at least underneath but um
I think that my part did turn out pretty
good um I did it a little bit of powder
to my part but yeah so of course this
unit is also a yucky texture which I
really like it is on the thick side so
it's like I really really like it yo um
what else can I say about this unit as
far as like tingling and shutting this
wig does not tangle and I had this unit
for a while now but I just been like you
know trying to get the feel of it so
yeah as far as like tangling I guess no
tangling from this gum unit but as far
as shedding I do get shut in hair there
but I think that's no move um so yeah
the shedding is not bad to me in the
tingling is awesome because I don't get
any tangles at all so yeah that's pretty
much it this would be like a quick video
but if you're interested in this unit I
will definitely leave the links and
everything in my description box if you
have any questions feel free to ask me
and I'll try to get back to your
question but yeah this is what the unit
looks like let me show you how to bag
yeah
and the color is everything like this is
my color like I don't know I just like
am a sucker for the color 30 I think
that it complements my skin really well
especially like now this house I and you
know we get in tans and yeah I
think that it just works well well on
darker skin if you ask me so yeah so um
yeah I will see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
