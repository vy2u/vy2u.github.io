hopeful interchange to change your mind
I could give a thousand there's way hey
guys so I'm back with another week
review of course and I purchased asleep
from wake time so she'll be all the
links in the description box just in
case any of you guys are interested in
purchasing this week this is the
sensational Empress lace pardon week and
I have it in the style Sierra
and I have it in a color TP 410 16 which
is just like different varieties of
blondes is more like on an edgy cool
tone so yeah
this is what the stock card looks like
hands down honestly this has to be one
of my favorite waves you guys literally
this wing is almost perfect but let me
explain what I'm talking about because
some of you guys might be like me and
run into the problem and stray away from
balm and sweets like this but being so
depart be messed up you'll be like okay
I'm a pest but I'm going to show you how
to get this week late because I know
some people probably are like me and
really love this week but don't want to
purchase it because of the part so the
part is just a lace part meaning it
doesn't come with any lace to cut off or
anything like that it's just a lace
parted that's a good thing and that is a
bad thing the reason that it's a good
thing is because I know a lot of you
guys out there you do not like to cut
the lace so this is a good alternative
because you don't have to cut anything
either downfall of not handling to cut
off is they make the part so thick what
I mean by making a part so thick is
where the part is it doesn't blend in
seamlessly to your scalp so it's like
you can see that demarcation mark right
there so from that mark damn right there
it's kind of like detectable if people
can see clearly see the two tabs on
a lace-front way so I'm here to share my
little secret if you want to see how I
get this you look like this which I know
y'all can clearly see is no line of
demarcation or anything like that and I
had my hand line I meant now my Halon I
had my way slightly behind my hand line
and this week is laying so good so
officially right now this week is kind
of like perfect to me honestly so I'm
going to go ahead and show you guys how
I achieved this part and getting my way
to look as natural as possible and then
I'll come back and tell you guys my
thoughts on this wig man hey guys so
let's get started right now I'm just
showing you guys what the part face
looks like and it's not really realistic
it looks pretty bulky well now our here
is where the lace is double it is making
it look kind of like unrealistic and it
has that demarcation so I went to a food
article because not doubled a lot of
party like an inch for some devilment
hello anyway again so basically now I'm
just going to what my part and I'm not
going to believe plus my part all the
way and with that pathway and right here
I'm just taking a hair clip like from
underneath of the wig and this part is
very important so pay attention now what
I am playing when I start to pull up my
parts I'm not going to plug your hair at
the beginning of the hair line when I'm
 my part I'm going to start kind
of like behind the hairline still leave
in the hairs that worn the hairline and
beginning up as far as get me anything
but just keep watching because you'll
see why I use it but now I'm just going
to speed it up for basically the whole
wood car
okay so this is me halfway through
 apart and it actually looks
pretty good so now I just want to go
ahead and finish plucking the rest of
the part
mmm
well now I'm basically finished
my person finish talking my part and I'm
going in and plug in any care that I
might have missed but again this is what
my partner looks like that guy finish
plug in it and this is how I plus all my
clothes all my wigs so we get pretty
simple easy to do now this is where the
step comes in where who you guys leave
some hair or the hairline and now you
will see what I was talking about so
this is a hair that I wanted you to
leave and not supply if you collect it
it's okay I just see it there it is
easier for me to cut because it works is
like a little bit but it's just easier
for me to cut the lead because where
there is a hand line so just pay
attention so you know what I'm talking
about
and once I cut that tape off it creates
kind of like a openness then it divides
it separates the later part because you
want you want to keep one layer of leap
and then you want to get rid of the
other layer because I'm on it with
making it your heart and soul bulky and
unrealistic so yeah I'm just going to
cut this one I'll just remove it some of
the hairs because I don't need to cut
all there so yeah just paid closest
achieve that one really hood explaining
stuff so yeah I'm just cutting back
little slip off and it would be wise to
have small scissors did you work better
this is our recommend are the like
scissors that you cut your eyebrows lips
those work really good that I can't find
mine so yeah and this is how much lead
that you're going to cut it literally I
mean right now you're going to cut more
leads of course but you have to cut that
for that part in order to cut the other
part so yeah it's hard to explain like I
said just keep on watching I hope you
guys get this oh my god this be so
messed up
go on Samson so now just flipping the
week inside out so you guys can see what
I'm talking about if you can see is like
an opening right there justify belief
and I'm just going to go in and this is
like that you need smaller scissors
you're not going to you're only going to
cut a small
pushes button centimeter abilities right
now you can't see but I realized that
the weight down here just follow the
instructions you guys are Kimberly
explain why but you don't want to cut
all the way up cuz if you do then it's
just going to be so bad in your holiness
gonna fall apart so you just want to cut
it up enough you just want to cut these
out late off right there so then the
beginning of the leaf will lay in
Glyndon reviews out if you give them
same so literally that's how much lead
from cutting off you guys you don't want
to cut the whole thing off because you
only needed to blend it in the front
anyway you only be delete to not be
picked in the front so that's how much
leek are cut off literally is like a
little but it makes a hell of a
difference trust me so yeah this is the
end result and what is flying up close
and personal I hope this video was
helpful for you guys
Oh
okay so I didn't go in to really like
details as far as showing you guys how I
cook there is one and everything like
that but honestly basically the way
already comes Bom you don't really have
to do anything to the weight even if you
like your parts like that you can just
add some concealer or finishing powder
into the part and be good that's how
long this wing is but again I'm just a
person I don't like my my legs all thick
like that I like it to blend in because
I want my hand to look like it's coming
out of my scope I'm just a person like I
like some stuff to look natural so yeah
so basically when I read what I got the
hell out the pegs the curls were more
defined meaning they were more separated
and defined it did look cute and you
could wear it like that if you wanted to
but all I did was finger combed it I
didn't brush it out with my vent brush
or anything like that I just a finger
comb this way I also plucked out my part
which you saw in the last clip I did a
little teeny bit of dark route to
diversion because I do have some of my
hair and it just didn't look right
because the top part is a brown color
and my hair is a dark brown and he's
more of a light brown so basically I
just added a little bit of dull fruit
this week is a Yankee texture and the
color is sunny you guys when I say
literally I had this color I had this
week in every color
not every color but almost every color
the texture is so nice the color like if
you have this color you know what I'm
talking about what the color looks so
good it looks like like somebody really
set then took the time to color your
hair
that's how nice it looks and it's not
shiny at all it has like that dull
appearance to it which I really really
love the curls are all also and think I
don't know if y'all can see my child but
the curls are also and think we're so if
you wanted to wear in a middle part you
can do that because the curls go both
ways on each side
it's the same way on each side he's
really distressing yeah as far as
tangling and shutting I did receive a
few strands of hair but I guess that's
for me you know doing all the cutting
and plucking so right now this hair does
not shed now I did get a few snakes here
and there but besides that this week has
not really tangled up on me as much but
it is a really cool wig and it's really
curly so expect tailing and shutting you
guys and this is a synthetic weight so I
want some people expectations for these
synthetic wig just be over-the-top
remember you guys this is still a
sentence that it can't okay and even a
human hair still tangles a bit and sheds
so just keep that in mind you can slay
every day in this week you can wear this
wig when you step it out put drinks you
can go on a date with this week special
occasions anything in a wig it's popping
it's so thick in full I freaking love it
you guys how cool simply is like I'm in
that area long because yo I'm just a
feeling myself that much but yes you're
like I absolutely love it this weekend
is a little bit big but keep in mind
that I had a tiny head so if I can wear
this me you can wear it trust me
um if you need some extra security to
always add bobby pins but I had my
strength adjusted to its tightest and I
feel like it's okay on my head like I
feel like I can walk out the door and be
confident okay and just physically walk
down the street and you know so my habit
and not worry about what anybody has to
say okay like that's what this wig is
going to make you feel like your this
wig is lit like I'm not even lying
I feel like Beyonce out here like yeah
