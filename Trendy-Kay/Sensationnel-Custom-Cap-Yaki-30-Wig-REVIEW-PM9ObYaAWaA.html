I always come back to my love which is
um YouTube so I have like a whole bunch
of wigs that I should have been doing
reviews on but I haven't so this is
going to be like three no I don't see I
don't know if I want to do if I want to
do all the wig reviews in one video or I
want to do them separate so if I do
decide to do them separate um if i have
the same shirt only you know why it's
the same day i'm just three quote
multiple videos so i'm yeah so the first
um wig that I want to review with you
guys is the UM what is this week oh it's
by um custom so custom lace wig is by
sensational and it's the Yankee 30 um I
got this in uh t1b
burgundy so yeah the picture I try to
say to picture but I don't know where
the picture went so you guys can see but
this is on um wig types and that's where
I got mines from and I paid $26 on there
I think it was on sale so yeah um I what
it's like two times
yeah would like let me step back so
y'all can see but this is what she looks
like
um I just keep it in its original
packaging and put the net over the top
of it but yeah this is her
huh this is the part you can't really
see but she has two combs in the front
and a comb in the back where's my wig
kick so yeah this is what I'm working
with my head's just pulled back into a
ponytail so I'm going to put my way cap
one and then come back and try the wig
one I have my wig cap on yeah my hands
so flat um yes so I'm going to put her
one for you guys I really like this wig
like it's cute I think okay well the
thing just broke off where you clip it
and I have a small head so I don't know
how that's going to work but the thing
the adjustable straps the clip just
literally broke off light come on out so
I know this week it's gonna be evil my
head my head
okay so this is what the wait looks like
um it is tingly and this is um I'm sorry
I don't know if I got the name right
I think it's Empress if I'm not mistaken
I don't know I'll put everything in the
bottom description but yeah so I don't
know why they called it Yankee 30
because clearly um this isn't 30 inches
maybe maybe 24 inches it comes to above
my belly button so 24 inches I believe
but and I'm 5'4 um
the wig is really pretty I love the
color on me the only con that I have is
that my strap just broke in the wig it's
not tight on my head I have a small
peanut head so but um I had this wig for
a while but when I for a while probably
for like three weeks and um I only would
twice and I stopped wearing it because
like the ends were getting frazzled like
it's not that bad I'm pretty sure if I
take up flat onto it it'll get straight
again but I don't know like it's cute
I'm the part you can't really see the
part I had to do some plucking to this
part because like the pot was
non-existent like you couldn't even see
the part so yeah but this is what the
way it looks like um this is the front
sorry this is the back so yeah and it
already I didn't cut this wig at all it
came with these layers in the front so
overall I really do like this wig um I
just wish to strap didn't break and it
is very tingly but that's with all
synthetic wigs anyway and it does shed
so but I like it I love the color to me
yeah so this is her I got her from Wiig
types calm
she was $26 so yeah this is her</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
