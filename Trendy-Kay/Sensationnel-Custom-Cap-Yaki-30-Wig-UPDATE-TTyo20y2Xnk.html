rivet wow this is not even a wig review
is actually a update on ah oh my
goodness
on the Yankee 30-week that I did a
review on probably about a couple months
ago or month ago but some people were
asking about this wig and how it was
doing so I just figured that I'll do a
update on this wig I'm also I just put
up a video on alpine meadow so if you
didn't see it go check it out but yes
this is the Yankee 30 wig um the custom
yeah y'all know what I'm talking about
because my brain is like I can't think
straight right now um yes so this is her
um I just took it out its packaging and
my hair is like it always has and a
pointy tail in the back um with my
little fun so yeah I'm going to part one
I don't have a wig cap I can't find it
but my stripe is still broke so
so this is um the wig and I must say
that I haven't wore her in a while but
she's actually still holding up very
well um the last time I mentioned that
the ends were a little like dry um
I wore this out to a club a few weeks
ago was so tingly and basically what I
did was I took my flat iron and I just
went through the wig and it brought it
back to life so I'm pretty sure about
what to wear this again I would
definitely just like put a flat onto it
and it would be fine but the wig is
doing good you guys like she was
definitely worth the money even though
it wasn't that expensive I forget how
much I paid for this but this is
basically what the wig looks like like
she's still in really great condition
besides being um tangley but as I stated
in my previous video when I was doing a
review on it
she was tangley and she also was um like
a little dry like frazzled when it ends
but just take a flat on and just go
through it and it'll be fine so I just
wanted to do this a quick update for you
guys to let you know how she's holding
up um if you want cheeks to last longer
um just make sure you keep all its
original packaging like the net um in
the bed because basically what I do is I
like to
Rep mines and the net that it came in
and then I just put it in the bag and
put it up and that's basically what I do
every time and when I'm wearing my wigs
if I'm in a house I do not wear them in
a house because I feel like it's no
point I just take it off and put it in
its original packaging and then that's
it when I'm ready to wear the wig again
I'll just take it out you know style it
how I want to but this is pretty much
how I wear um the wig straight in the
middle so yeah this is what she looks
like
after months I don't really know how
long it's been but it's been it's been a
while so this is what she looks like
that's the ends you can see the ends do
get quite tingly in you know Frizzle but
I'm telling you take that flat on and go
through some pieces a couple times and
you'll be good like when I say the wig
will look brand new again it will so yes
so this is my update on um the custom
lace wig yeah Keith 30 so if you have
any questions or anything that I didn't
say in this video because I know it's
kind of quick and just like straight to
the point
um so if I miss any questions that you
guys have just comment in the comment
comment um leave your questions in the
comment box below and I promise you I'll
get back to you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
