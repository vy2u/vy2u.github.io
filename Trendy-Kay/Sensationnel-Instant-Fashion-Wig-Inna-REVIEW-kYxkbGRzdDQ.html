review I'm gonna try to make this as
quick as possible but this is the week
that I'm rocking on my head today and
this is instant in Fashion Week Couture
and the style name is Anna and I have
this wig and a color D r27 and this is
what the wig looks like on a model I did
purchase this week from Wiig types calm
and the wig was $19 let me start by
saying this is such a gorgeous color you
guys like do you see that color like I'm
just looking up when it comes to these
colors because every wig that I bought
it in like a color 27 or 30 or I don't
know they all have been looking really
really natural so this wig is about 22
I'm going to say 22 to 24 inches far as
the construction inside of the wig like
the wig does not come with any combs
because it is your full cat wig they say
I'm so the wig doesn't come with any
comb so if you're a person who likes
combs in your wigs this week might not
be for you because it comes with no
combs the only thing it does come with
is adjustable straps and you could
possibly take bobby pins and secure the
weight down to your hair with bobby pins
up if you're not comfortable enough with
when the wig with just the adjustable
straps so I have been getting a little
of shedding from this week nothing - um
nothing too heavy anyway you'll get
shedding over any hair you'll get
shedding so I'm not really worried about
the shedding but it does this week does
shed and as far as tangles like I
haven't got any tangles from this wig
yet but the longer the wigs are the more
likely for your unit to tangle so I'm
pretty sure this wig will start tangling
the more I wear it so this is what the
wig looks like and let me just step up
close so I can show you the part so that
is what the part looks like anything
about the lace part um is that is it
gives you like that big scalp and then
it only gives you this much of a part in
space and if the lace is not it ear when
it comes to the hairline when I had to
cut the lace off the lease
it was only right here like the lace was
from here to here so it was like this
much this much lace so you don't really
have a natural hairline if you're not a
fan of the fake scalp then you probably
won't like this week this week actually
reminds me of the Zen week which I did a
review on that um that was like my very
first wig I did a review on like my very
first week but one of my very first
weeks that I did a review on and that's
the feel that this part is giving me
kind of like the Zen party only thing
different is they do give you more of a
parting space versus the part of space
on Zen another thing that I really don't
like but it doesn't really bother me
that much is it is a little thin so if
you're not a fan of a thin hair even
though it's not like paper thin wavy
like somebody will be like girl why
don't you go and I was bundle up in it
hair like it's not like that thin but I
mean it's kind
like natural thing like it's not really
thin but if you're more fan of thick
bigger hair then you probably will not
like this um this unit
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
