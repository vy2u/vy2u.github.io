review and y'all I have another full cap
wig review for you guys so this is not a
lace part or lace front wig it is a full
cap unit so I have the sensational
instant fashion week and this is Jill
and I have her in the dr burgundy and
this is what the picture looks like on
the model so I've been really filling
these full cap units but you know I
don't really rock the full cap units and
unless I really really feel like it's a
nice full cap unit that I can rock and
this is just like absolutely beautiful
okay so Vince though this is your full
cap unit it does not come with any combs
it only has adjustable straps and I
would say that this wig is around 12 or
14 inches long and look at that color
like the cut one this is so pretty like
oh my gosh like I'm so in love now if
they made this wig into like a lace part
wig I would really be in love but I
would still rock it even though it's a
full cap unit it really doesn't bother
me but I know some people are not a fan
of full cap units because they look
Wiggy but this actually it looks really
really good so I did purchase this from
wig type combed and this unit was only
$14 Evan got any shedding out of this
week or tangle in I guess because it's a
shorter unit
and I didn't have to cut off any lace so
I'm pretty sure up one strand right here
yeah I was about to say I'm pretty sure
that this wig will shed a little bit but
I haven't really got any shedding except
for the one strength that I just pulled
out um and like I said no tangling
because this is a shorter unit so you
should be fine with tangling um you know
after a while probably would start
tingling in the nape area but I haven't
got any problems out of this week yet I
did purchase this in another color which
I will show you guys at the end of the
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
