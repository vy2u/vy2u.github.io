for you guys today and y'all gonna love
me for this one because this is Maylene
by sensational is another instant
fashion weight Couture and this is what
she looks like
so when I seen that they had came out
with another one
I had hop on it as quick as I could is
by the same brand um that I did my last
wig review on which was Anna and this
one is called Maylene so they just added
a new week to their collection and I had
a good feeling about this with you guys
so I was like let me order it okay you
guys told before I get started and put
this on my head I just want to show you
guys what the wig looks like and I do
have this in a dr burgundy and this is
what it looks like and again this wig
does not have any combs inside so if
you're a person that likes combs in your
unit then you probably will not like
this unit because it doesn't have combs
it only has adjustable stress now I feel
like this button is better than the
other pardon on my um on it in a wig
look how that looks I did pluck this
though you guys but look how much
parting space they give you this week as
far as the construction is exactly like
the in a wig so this is what it low um I
didn't have time to bring my hair down
you guys and I wanted to make this a
quick video because I'm not really
wearing the wig I just wanted to do a
review on it but um yeah so this is how
is in a bun in the back so I'm just
going to put my wig cap on one and I'm
gonna put two on so my bun can be like
kind of flat in the back
all right you guys I'm going to put the
wig on and come back and show you guys
what it looks like okay you guys so this
is what the wait looks like and I just
have to say that this wig is um another
winner so yes I am really loving this
week um this is what the Parden space
look like
hold on hi let me take off let me take
this off so I can get into like weight
mode okay I don't think I like it as
much as Ana but she's definitely
definitely pretty so this is what she
looks like
basically she's more like feather going
back like in the face area and then once
you get to the back it's like basically
straight this is how long it is it comes
down here I will probably say around 22
inches I would say it is the same
thickness as the inner wig is not too
thin I mean full person who likes their
hair really thick this probably will be
a thin wig for you but um it's more like
a natural thickness so I'm not really
complaining about how I'm thicker than
it is cuz it's like in the middle they
purchase this unit from weak tapes calm
and she was nineteen dollars so this is
what it looks like in the middle
I actually I mean I do like the way it
looks in the middle I just don't like
the fact that this is more curl like
more tighter than this side see like if
this side was like the
sigh then I'll be cool when my little
middle part but I don't know you
probably can't even really notice it
that much
so you guys I really hope that you
enjoyed this wig review and if you have
any questions about this year and and
feel free to leave it in the comment
section down below and I will talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
