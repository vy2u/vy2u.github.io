for you guys and I'm laying it on my
head right now and I have to just say
that I am absolutely in love with this
unit you guys like y'all know I'm all
for my lace part front wigs or what not
but I'm like really feeling this full
cat week so let's get started this week
that I have one is called Sumi old so me
and this is what the packaging looks
like and this is what it looks like on
the model and I've been eyeing this wig
for quite some time and I couldn't
decide what I wanted to get it or not
because it was a full cat wig and I
don't know I just like you know I really
had to like a wig in order for me to get
it in a full cat weight so I just said
forget it imma get it I mean it was only
16 dollars so that's not a lot of money
I will be wasting so yes this is the wig
and it's absolutely so gorgeous and edgy
and all of the above so I have this wig
and a color dr 27 which is basically
like your don't root and then the the
ends are you know the 27 which is like a
honey blonde color and I have to tell
you that this color is gonna point y'all
I think that this color like really
complements my skin tone so well and the
way that they have this cut set up it's
like bomb like it looks so natural you
guys so let's get into this week so yes
you guys this is what the wait looks
like and let me get up close so you guys
just can like see how gorgeous this way
it is
um and this is the side
so yeah you can Eve you can either wear
it like this with covering some of the
short hair on the side or you can kind
of like tuck it behind your ears
it kind of already ladies like behind
your ear but you can wear it over your
ear if you want it to but I don't mind
it being both ways I mean it's whatever
the wig Falls I love it so much so yes
if you don't like a lot of hair in your
face you definitely can like swoop it
over to the side and it still will look
nice so that's what it looks like
swooped over and like not in your face
but my forehead is too big for all of
that so if I might have the side part
I'm up I'm gonna cover up my forehead
uh-huh but yeah even though I love my
own backwards
I like middle parts better than side
parts and middle parts definitely
exposed here for you but I don't know
I'm back with sure but when I have a
side part I like to have some head cover
up this for you cuz to me my forehead
looks bigger with my pot on the side in
my head like this like just look at it
so yeah I don't know that's just my own
opinion like I'm kind of weird like that
so okay so I'm thinking that this week
is around like 14 or 16 inches but this
is how long the wig is so it's not long
at all um it comes like to the middle of
my boobs and this is what it looks like
in the front and I'm just gonna do like
a 360 uh
another thing that I left out is that it
does not have any combs in the wig but
it does has adjustable Shrek's I'm not
even sure if I said it or not but if I
didn't yeah it only has adjustable
straps and the wig cap side fits good
I'm pretty sure would probably fit
anybody saying if you have a smaller - a
larger head - a regular-sized head my
head is on the small side and I don't
even have the straps adjust it to its
tightest so yeah I just have them eaten
at the middle so yeah this wig this wig
fits really good on your head and lay it
so flat I just have my hair braided in
two braids going straight and the cut is
only from like here like all of this is
long it's just cut right here on this
side so yes and as far as all the other
layers like this came like this I didn't
have to cut anything I just cut the bang
like I said before and that was it
but yeah this is definitely a nice wig
also it's not like a really silky
texture is kind of like it reminds you
of like a yaki texture everyone every
mind you of like a Yankee texture but
it's not too too Yankee if you know what
I'm saying like you can kind of see some
of the crinkles I don't know if it's
gonna show up in this camera but yeah
but it's not like overly Yankee because
that turns me off like I do not like
overly Yankee head like oh that burns
you have this side like I don't know but
yeah it's like just right so okay I'm
done I wanted to keep this video short
and simple and just straight to the
point so it's nothing really bad because
I have to say about the wig and it's
nothing really that I have to say about
the wig it oh I just wanted to show you
guys this quick little um weight that
I'm rocking right now so if you have any
questions or anything feel free to leave
them in the comment box and if I left
anything I I will list everything in the
description box so you guys have a nice
day or weekend or whatever you want to
call it whenever I put this video up but
love you guys bye
I'm really feeling this wig you guys

dr 27 stop know so yes I hope you
