of wait because I didn't film this video
on this unit and did a review for this
Union but my lighting wasn't so great
because I didn't film it later on in the
evening at night so I do I did want to
put up a clip since I'm you know filming
multiple videos in one day just to put
the wig back on so you guys can see it
in a better lighting I don't know if
this is kind of gonna be like after the
video or before but I'm thinking about
making it and to begin another video so
you guys can definitely just see the wig
so you'll know if you want to keep on
watching or not to get the details on
this unit but this is what it looks like
and the pardon is like so great
so this is the unit in a better light in
okay guys so I have a another week
review for you guys and don't mind the
background or the way this camera it's
like the lighting is not so great but it
it's late at night and I'm filming this
because this is the only time I had to
myself so yes if you're wondering why my
background is different it's because I'm
in a different area because I'm trying
to find some good lighting this is
sensational impressed lately and this is
what the packaging looks like and this
unit is called Irene and I have her in a
color DXR 1350 or 1 350 so yes this is
what it looks like ok so I'm gonna have
to be really quick because now my
battery wants to die so anyway this week
has two combs in the front Oklahoma in
the back and adjustable straps I did
purchase this wig from Wiig types calm
and I believe it was I'm not even gonna
say how much it is I'm just gonna list
it in the description box because I had
this week for a while now it might be
even cheaper than what it was originally
which I can't even remember
so I'll list the price in the
description box down below so as far as
tangling and shedding I get no tangling
or shedding not yet at least I'm pretty
sure this wig will tangle and shed but
mind you the only shouting that I have
received it's from when I plucked my
part and as far as Tanglin eye
not receive any Tanglin I like this week
because it's a shorter length this is
more for a everyday look focus this is
more for like everyday look so I would
say this week it's around I'm gonna say
like 16 to 18 inches maybe 16 I'm not
sure but somewhere in between that so
yeah this is how the way it looks fresh
out of the packaging I did not do
anything to this wig I didn't cut it I
didn't do anything the only thing I did
was pluck my part and this is what the
part looks like and I didn't add any
concealer or powder I hope you guys can
see with this lighting but yes when I
say the hair looks like it's coming out
of my scalp like look at that part so I
love this week a lot like I said I think
you can wear this one like an everyday
basis it's really nice simple you can
just pop it on your head the only thing
that I don't like about this unit it's
the fact that um the color on the bottom
I wish that it was like this color
all the way through instead of heaven
because it kind of looks cheesy to me
having this color on the bottom to me it
just doesn't look really realistic so
that's one con that I don't like but I
probably would purchase this in a
different color maybe like a 430 because
I do like this color with my skin tone
it really complements my skin tone like
it looks really really good
and another kind that I had is that
the back of the week is like extra thin
like I don't know if you guys can see
that but it's like really thin so if the
wind is blowing I don't know how it's
going to look back there but they should
have added some more hair up in the top
area because it's really thin so those
are like the two cons that I have about
this unit but other than that I really
really love this unit so like I said you
can purchase this from wig types that
column if you are interested in this
unit
that's the end of my video if you guys
have any questions about this unit feel
free to leave it in my comment section
down below sorry this was a pretty quick
video because my bed my battery is dying
and I don't want it to cut off on me but
yes like I said you can purchase this
from Wiig types calm and I will list the
price and everything else into the
description box so yes I will see you
next time you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
