really care about you can enjoy
experimental denominated with you they
can shoot hey guys so I was sick this
week from Sam's beauty and this is the
sensational dream news series and I have
it in a style Mathilda and this is in a
color 99 J now this week comes with two
combs in the front a comb and a bag with
adjustable straps and this is also a
synthetic unit and it is a Yankee
texture put the love an album with
everything that they miss and there's a
superficial don't understand how we do
we don't need a lot we got it and that's
why we went into them department after I
cut off the least I did get a lot of
shedding which I was not expecting but
it wasn't too big but it was just more
than what I was expecting so now I'm
just taking my flat iron and I'm just
flattening the part in space because I
once a week to lay as flat as possible
and I basically do this before almost
all my wigs so I can get them to lay
flat now you guys if you wanted to wear
your hair in this style how it
originally comes by all means viewed it
because it's really not anything wrong
with the way the way it comes originally
I just like to be extra and you know I
just wanted my hair straight so this is
the reason why I'm straightening it but
I actually really liked the original
style especially when you put it on the
side it really looks nice as a side part
also guys make sure you enter the
giveaway for this wig I will be choosing
two winners for this giveaway so yeah
all the details for this giveaway and
how you enter will be in the description
box so make sure you check out my
description box but yeah I'm going to
you know let this little video right out
until I need to say something else
so now I'm just taking my Smashbox
finishing powder and I have it in the
color medium and I'm just adding that to
the part I did not plug the part to make
it wider or anything like this is
basically the end result and again this
is Matilda by sensational the dream new
series and yes I have it in a color 9 on
J and basically this is kind of what the
color looks like unless you are like and
did sunlight it's kind of more vibrant
but for the most part it's a really
really nice subtle color I'm definitely
happy with the results I love the
density I love everything about this way
this way shed more than I expected it to
it's not shedding nail so it might just
be from me cutting up the lace and I do
get a little bit of tingling towards the
ends so keep that in mind you guys the
density on this is really nice always
already comes with layers cut in it so
you don't have to cut any legs and it
frames your face pretty nice I feel like
this week is a song bone this is what
the part looks like and I did not plus
the part at all
you can't go in and pluck the part it's
optional it's not mandatory to pluck
your part but if you wanted a more wide
apart you can definitely cut your part
but for me I feel like the part was
sufficient enough all that was at my
finishing powder into the part and this
is just basically how it turns out and
how it looks this week is around 24
inches long but if you like sensational
ways you can find a straight weight like
this you don't really have to get this
week that's on sane by me it is really a
nice wig if you're more into that then
swiftly and like the times like that
fake what is it a fake silk base which
is not really so famous baseless ill
face
and stuff like that then you definitely
can you know purchase this week so one
more thing before I leave this week is
snug so if you have a bigger size head
don't even waste your time because it's
my city tight because I didn't have my
when I first tried on this week I didn't
have my strips adjusted and it fit it
fit my head really good and as I had now
that I had my stress adjusted it fits my
head really snug and just perfect in my
opinion I don't feel like this week is
big-headed friendly because most of you
guys know this but if you don't I have a
really miniature head like it's real
world soil like this big so yeah yeah
good luck everyone and I will see you in
my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
