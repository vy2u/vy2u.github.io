drop my cold and I can take your that
few but for him
let's tell me play aha doesn't make it
hey guys it's Kate of course and I'm
back with a another video
you're definitely give me my props
because I feel like I didn't filmed the
video every single day so anyway this
week was sent to me from Missouri
Hollywood and they sent me the wig
they sent me assistance to wig beyond
your imagination I think the other week
was beyond your imagination too I think
this is like a collection with like
really nice and different colors so yeah
this is beyond your imagination and I
have it in style Siri and I have it in
the color chambre arty sunset so they
sent me this one but I had already
bought like I said I have a whole bunch
of weights that I already bought on my
own that I want to do videos on but I'm
just trying to you know get the weights
that the company sent me out the way but
I was like well everyone wanna do a
video on this week I might as well just
show you the ones that I already bought
because there's no point of me doing a
video on the wig now because I already
have it so this is what it looks like
I'm just going to show you the fresh one
this is the one that Boyd and I'll leave
all the links to this week in my
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested so yeah yeah this is
what it looks like and basically this is
a soft Swiss 4 by 4 inch
free pardon so basically it gives you
room to part the wig whatever you want
up in the top if you wanted to part it
on the side you could you couldn't get
like a deep part but you can always
shift the weight shift the weight over
to get a deep part if that's how you
like your parts but you can definitely
get a little side part like me or you
can just do it in the middle either way
it looks good the curls are really nice
so like I said this is Swiss Lee so it
is a
off the lace it also provides you with
two combs on the sides and it provides
you with a comb and a bag with
adjustable straps so this is how the
curls coming everything I am going to
try this wig on for you guys just so you
can see what it looks like straight out
the pack because y'all really be coming
for me okay I'm not going to cut off the
lace or do none of that because you
don't really have to work with this wig
like that like this is the easy way to
wear so yeah the color that I bought
though is I'm sorry arts here dark
selfie Miss a DK selfie I don't know if
this ain't for dark but DK selfie so
yeah but back to it this week this is
like an orange color with duck roots the
duck roots isn't all the way through but
I really don't mind cuz it's just look
so freaking good
and I definitely live for these orange
colors so yeah the week is also not as
long which I really really loved the
length because it's more wearable when
it's not too long even though I don't
really care because if it's long we're
not doing away every day but um yeah if
you are big one left and you don't
really go for the long to live so you
can definitely try this one out because
it's like I said the left is it really
that long what else this also offers you
a Yankee texture the texture is really
nice like it's not too Yankee at all
it's just like just right the Yankee is
really nice it definitely comes off
natural-looking it is a tad bit shiny
but not really like you can do without
try shampoo or whatever like it's like
you really don't have to add anything to
dull the weight down if you don't want
to but yeah I'm not because I don't feel
like the shine it's like ridiculous but
yeah this is basically what it looks
like the curls are amazing you guys so
the only thing I did do oh and also it
comes with freaking baby hair
can you hopefully that made here so yeah
I did not create these baby hairs like
it actually came with the wig also I
didn't
but the part this is how the part comes
the only thing I did was at my finishing
powder into the part and cut off the
lace and my finishing powder into the
part and combed down a baby heads that
they did provide for this wig and
brushed I'm the way out with my fan
brush which is looking kind of funky but
yeah brush me out with my fan brush and
it was one point like I said if you are
a middle part girl like me
even though I liked it I actually like
this week in the middle and on the side
it really didn't met him but I just
wanted to go for a side part today so if
you wanted to wear this part in the
middle you could and the curls are still
in sync they still flow just write like
this wig is freaking bomb yo I will say
that this wig is a nice density is
definitely full it's not too full with
just like overwhelmingly hot but it's
definitely a nice density with not
see-through not too thin it's full its
bouncy it's just a lot and I love it so
honestly you guys I really don't have
too much to say about this wig like it's
it's definitely on the lines are perfect
definitely one of my favorites I feel
like psoriasis is definitely definitely
winning I'm not even playing like they
are really awake
so all these other companies I feel like
they really need to catch it up because
they lose in this race right now for
real they receive a few strands of hair
but I'm not getting any shut-in anymore
so yeah this light Shannon it doesn't
really shed and as far as tangling I
haven't received tangling yet but I'm
pretty sure as time goes on and you
weigh the wig more often you'll
definitely receive more shutting and
more tingling as well but besides that
this wig is on point you guys this is
some gorgeous freaking hair I'm
definitely impressed so yeah this is
what it looks like
and now I'm just going to open up the
one that I would so you can see what it
looks like fresh out the pack okay so
this color again is Psalm grey RT DK
selfie which I left with commas like the
show I really really loved the color so
yeah this is well yeah it comes with the
soft lace of course and as you can see
it gives you that full back floor look
four by four part in space and it gives
you a comb right there and a comb right
here and then it gives you a comb in the
back and adjustable straps now I feel I
do feel like this wig is a universal fit
like I feel like it will fit big heads
and small heads and it's a good stretch
so if you do have a bigger scientic or
smaller size head you can definitely fit
it for my small hair people just go
ahead and adjust the strips and it will
do the job
and if your head is a little bit bigger
you don't have to worry about adjusting
the straps so yeah this is what it looks
like these are how the curls come
straight out of the PEC so yeah now I'm
just going to take this one off so y'all
can see
and I'm not going to adjust my straps I
was just basically gonna put it one oh
yeah underneath this is how my hair is
so when you put it on this is what it
looks like and I'm just going to put it
down the middle just so you can see how
much potting space you get so this is
how much part in space you get yeah
but as you can see you don't really have
to do too much for the curls to act
right like they already act right I'm
not going to really brush this out too
much and I'm not going to cut off the
lace because I'm not landing yet but as
you can see this wig is the bomb y'all
you don't see that that's crazy
so yeah this is this color which I
really really love you can do like the
whole side part if you want it too and
it still looks nice sorry yellow if it's
looking kind of crazy I can't see
anything that I'm doing I'm trying to
look into my computer um but it's I'm
struggling so yeah but this is basically
what it looks like I don't have a mirror
in front of me so I'm not really gonna
do too much styling but as you can see
it wouldn't be hard to style at all
look at that well yeah this is a
beautiful beautiful color so anyway you
guys this is it for this video if you
have any questions feel free to leave it
in my comment section and again I will
go ahead and leave all the links in my
description box where you can purchase
this wig from and yes I love you guys
I'll see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
