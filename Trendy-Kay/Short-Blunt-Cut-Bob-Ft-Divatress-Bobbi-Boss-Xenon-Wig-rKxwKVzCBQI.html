feeling like I need space right now hey
guys it's K of course and I'm back with
another video and this video is gonna be
on the wig I'm wearing so I was sent
this week
Sariah I gotta get the paper hold on ok
so I was sent this week's for I was sent
this week from diva trust and they sent
me umm this is Baba v bosse the MLF 178
a on Enon
I don't know how you pronounce it but
I'm gonna leave it in the screen but
everybody shouldn't be familiar with
this wig already I have it in the color
TT 1 B indigo blue so this is what the
scar looks like if you watch my videos
you know that I recently did a video
well not recently but I did do a video
on the yard wig and this is just oh this
is just a shorter version of the Yara
wig and I also had the y'all wait in the
same exact color is this and I just
figured why not get the same color since
I like the color I'm on in your wig so
so if you like the yard wig but you felt
like it was a little too long and you
wanted more of a shorter buck definitely
check out this week because like I said
they really are identical to be honest
with you guys
um but yeah so the construction is
exactly the same it should typical
construction in which it has two combs
and the front of comb in a bank with the
adjustable straps I feel like if you
have a smaller size here just adjust the
strips if you have a larger sized head
just don't adjust the straps I do feel
like the cat is a little bit stretchy so
I feel like the capsizes University
Davis is exactly how it comes um the
only thing I did was and finishing
powder into the part and cutting some
baby hairs just to make it a little bit
more natural-looking but that's what the
part looks like and I feel like overall
this wig looks really natural I did get
a little bit of shedding as I was like
combing it with my hands and that's
about it so this way it is also a
you texture so if you like Yankee hair
you'll definitely love this one but I
really don't have much to say about this
week because like I said it's exactly
like yourself it's shorter um I know you
guys are probably gonna ask me which one
I like better and I definitely like
y'all better than this one I don't know
I feel like the are wig was poppin on me
I don't know and even when a picture
like the wig comes to her chin and I
thought that's where the wig was gonna
stop on me because I do have a pretty
long neck but I guess like she has a
super long neck on here because this
definitely doesn't hit me where my chin
is but um yeah I don't know if it's the
color
I feel like this color was popping more
on a Yahweh than this week I feel like I
have to have this in like a natural
color in order for me to really love it
but I definitely do like it but I
definitely love y'all better I just love
the length of that week and I don't know
it was just some about it this one is
okay though the color is still really
really nice
also this week is heat-safe just in case
you want to put heat to it I know when
it starts to get old it it kind of
starts to get like thick at the ends and
stuff like that so you can always go in
with your flat iron and straighten the
hair of course it won't lose its Yankee
texture so if you don't mind the wig not
been Yankee like it was when you first
received it then that's fine but if you
want to prolong the wear of this week
you can definitely straighten it and it
will you know pop back to life so I'm
just gonna go ahead and turn around so
you guys can see the wig all the way
around but yeah um I don't know this wig
is almost hitting my shoulders I just
felt like it was gonna be a tad bit
shorter than what it is but this is
where it falls on me I am five five just
in case anybody was wondering
so guys that's it for this video again
this is from island diva trust so I'll
make sure I leave all these trans links
in the description box just in case you
guys want to check out this week if you
were looking for a shorter version of
the Yahweh this is definitely an option
I know some people are really not into
the black cuts but I like it I like the
blunt cut or whatever um but yeah I
definitely love y'all better than this
one the love you guys have any questions
