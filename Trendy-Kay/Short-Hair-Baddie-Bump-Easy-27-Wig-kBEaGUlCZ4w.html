love with short hair but you know I
always got to find the right short wig
because not all of the show baby popping
so y'all I came across this week and I
was just like I have to get it even
though it's old but I was like let me
see what this about so anyway this is
the bump wig and it's the EZ 27 which is
really old and it was popping on here a
long time ago and like in so many
reviews on this unit so you can
definitely check out other reviews but
yeah so and this is human hair it's not
synthetic so you can definitely curl
this unit basically it just comes cut
and styled and ready to go so again this
is how the way come straight out of the
package the only thing I did was like do
like this that's all I did and I flipped
these like this and that's all I did
like it's effortless like you don't have
to do anything to this wig like y'all
look at this mic please like so I'm
going to tell you that you're going to
have to braid your hair down really flat
I think I say this every time I do a
review on a short wig please because you
don't want your hand underneath to be so
bulky where your weight just looks fake
especially when it comes to shorter
units because they can tend to look
really fake if your head is not braided
down really flat so keep that in mind
but yeah like it's really nothing to say
about this unit it does not shed I
haven't got any tangling it's a shorter
way and it's human hair and its thing
was cheap and I purchased this wig from
ebony lines y'all know I wasn't really a
fan everyone's but how many loves been
on a niche a lot lately so I've been
like
most delete all my wigs from that only
thing I don't like about it is that it
takes longer to get my wigs versus week
types because I purchased my wigs and I
get them the next day when I shop with
wig types but anyway just look at this
week so I feel like my hand could have
could have been braided a little bit
flatter but I was being lazy but let me
just show you guys what this looks like
all the way around
seems like real humpy right here but I
mean that's cool because my head is flat
anyway so this little hump bitch action
going on in the bag it's kind of okay
because it kind of looks like my head
verses to being like Flay I hate my hair
yo don't judge me
so this is what it looks like I did get
this in a 1b they also have other colors
mm I don't know they just like this part
is color in the rest is like a 1b I'm
not really a fan so I just stick to the
normal colors and that's it was like a
doper and then like some color action
going on but yeah overall I really
really love this way you guys if you do
not own this unit you need to get it I'm
telling you like you have to have this
in your collection buh
I will not stay you're wrong I will not
do you wrong I will now point you into
the wrong direction like I let y'all
know I had this thing for short wigs and
this is like perfect because it's summer
in don't know maybe find like dinner
with all that hair sometimes sometimes
you just want to want a little short
cute wig and go so yeah um as far as the
construction is concerned with this unit
they do not give you any combs in the
front and they only give you a comb in a
bit and adjustable straps so if you like
combs in your unit this might not be for
you because you're only getting
home and that's in a bag um they do give
you adjustable straps but I don't like
adjusting my straps with shorter units
because a buckle man in the back but
y'all knew that already so I feel like
if you do have a normal to bigger sized
head this wig will fit you perfect now
if your head is a little snug
I meant a little snug if you here is a
little miniature like mine's then I mean
it's cool I don't feel like it's going
to fall off or nothing like that
but I do feel like it could be a tent
more tighter um if you wanted to insert
like some bobby pins on the side you
could do that because you might not see
them on the side but I don't know I mean
I feel like if you have a littler head
it's okay but it I do feel like it could
be a little tighter guys that is it for
this video
I hoped you enjoyed this little short
wig like I said if you do not have this
weight you need to get it because this
wig is life like it's everything no
seriously like I really really like this
wig yo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
