review and this wig was sent to me from
so yeah um the wig I will be reviewing
or show you guys today is the free trust
equal wig in the style Hayley and I have
it in a color 5:30 so this is what the
picture looks like and this way does
come in um multiple colors my light is a
little bright so there we go but yeah um
it does come in a lot of colors but
these are like not realistic colors like
I'm pretty sure people I mean if I
probably is people that will buy it but
these colors are weird to me so I may
need you have like my leg which is super
pretty in a pink I saw a couple people
do reviews on the pink short wigs and
that's what it reminds me of but yet I
have this like British type of burgundy
color which is a 5:30 I don't know if
I'm internet but yeah um if this video
looks a little bit I'm trying out some
new lighting and I'm trying to see if I
really like it um I don't know right now
so yeah so this is what the way it looks
like and this is going to be a short
simple straight to-the-point
review because this is like a shorter
wig and it's really not much to it but
yeah this is um this is where's the
front okay this is the front and it does
have ear tabs and it has adjustable
shreds this wig has no combs be I do
have my straps just placed in the middle
I would suggest you cross them closer to
start to bunch up in the back so let's
just
put this one so I can show you guys what
it looks like
so Oh before I put this one my hair is
um in two braids and I have two stocking
caps on so it can be flat since I am
wearing two short wig so let's see so
you want to make sure I always mention
this but you want to make sure your ear
tabs the little tips on the side of the
wig is placed at your temples and you
want to make sure the way is sitting on
your hairline because you don't want it
to be too far up or too far back so yeah
so this is what the weight looks like
like straight on my head without me
doing anything to it which this is not
going to call for a lot of attention
you're just going to put this on your
head and you'll be able to go you can
style this how you would like samba
speed this up just so I can play with it
so I can like frame my face a little bit
and
and this is pretty much how I'm going to
leave the wig I think that it's super
cute yeah I will leave the link to this
wig in my description box so I really
like this wig you guys you don't really
have to put too much effort into this
wig it's just basically like you're
puttin putting it on your head and you
just like going yes it is optional if
you want because you want to play around
with the front are you just to think
frame your face because it does look
better when you kind of manipulate the
wig in the front how you want it to go
but besides that this wig is super
simple I feel like you can wear this
like as an everyday wig if this color is
a little bit too bold for you you
definitely can get like a natural color
like the ones the 1b but besides that I
really really really love this week um
as far as shedding and tangling of
course this week does not tangle because
it is very short um but as far as
shutting this wig does shed a lot um I
normally don't get a lot of shedding if
any shutting at all for my shorter units
and this week it really surprised me
because it was like shedding a little
bit crazy like hair hail something now
right now it's not I guess is done
shedding or whatever but we'll see but
for the most part I definitely love this
week so I'm just going to turn around in
the back so you guys so this is what at
the back of the week looks like and I
think it looks super super natural so
yeah sorry if this was a pretty quick
video but it's really nothing to say I
really really love this week besides the
shedding but um yeah so we shall see but
this is just an easy quick cute wig um
this week does fit
my head so if you have like a larger
sized head I wouldn't suggest you
getting this way because it probably
would fit your head super tight um or
probably won't fit your head at all but
if you have like a normal to a smaller
sized head this week will be a perfect
for you this is it if you're wondering
what I have on my lips is elects by
color pops yeah honey gah gah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
