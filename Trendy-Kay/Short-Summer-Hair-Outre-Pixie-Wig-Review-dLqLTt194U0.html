one the same outfit because I'm filming
multiple videos in one day all's I did
was change my earrings and my lips but
it's definitely the same day so yes I
had a nother weight review again and
it's a short one you guys so I
definitely think that you guys are going
to love this week I just basically
transformed and alls I did was change my
lips in my hair so yeah it's like let's
get started cuz I'm excited about this
one okay so I'm gonna be really quick
with this one because I don't even think
that I have a lot of storage left on my
um my camera so yes this that I have on
my head
is the I'll trade on premium duty wig
100% human hair and this is what it
looks like and it's called pixie and I
had it in a color 1b so this is what the
picture looks like in the model let me
get up close so y'all can just see how
flat this is laying in I have two braids
in my hair okay like this wig is so
freaking gorgeous and it looks so
realistic you guys like oh I love these
short ways okay so this is um what it
looks like and I have the wig sitting on
my hairline um I don't know if you guys
watch my how I style my deja wig but
basically I was explaining how you put
the wig on your head so it could look
more natural but yes I have the wick to
my headline and again I have some up my
head just swooping out a little bit so
it can you know blend into the wig and
make it look as natural as possible so
this is basically like a little cute
pixie haircut and it's like really nice
um it is 100% human hair but you really
can't do anything to it I don't even
think it's long enough for you to curl
it well maybe if you had the little mini
flat on or whatever you can kind of curl
it if you wanted to but you really don't
have to like it's not needed um and if
the wig is sticking out basically what I
do is put water on it and it you know
flattens itself back out so this is what
the wig looks like in the front this is
what it looks like on the side and this
is what it looks like in the back
so I really really suggest this wig it's
really nice I'm losing my light and
sorry um it's really really it's a
really nice wig um it's just like easy
and simple but I do want to tell you
that you have to have your hair braid it
down like I had my head in two braids
going on the side and if you feel you
can kind of tell but um it still lays
down pretty flat but just make sure your
head is braided flat with the shorter
wigs it's so much that your hair is
definitely braided down flat so the way
could look as natural as possible um but
as far as this weight like I haven't got
any kind of shedding or anything um
because I guess it's a shorter wig this
is like a full cat wig so it comes with
a comb in the front I believe in a comb
in the back and it does has adjustable
straps but I do not I don't adjust my
adjustable straps because I don't like
that that like bulge right here that you
get on the bottom when you tighten up
your strength
um strap specially for especially for
the shorter wig so I just leave them
alone and I feel like the short I mean I
feel like um the the wig fits my head
good way I don't think it's fun oh I'm
not even using the comb or anything so
it's on there pretty good and yeah um
and I do have a pretty small head so if
your head is kind of on the bigger side
this probably will be a tight Wigmore
year um but yeah I love this wig and I
hope you guys like it I'm sorry I just
didn't want this video to be extra long
I just wanted to share this wig with you
guys cuz it's one of my favorite wigs
right now I'm definitely really loving
this week and I definitely love this
week with the dark lip um and if you
want to run what's on my lips I will
list it
in the description box down below so yes
you guys had a wonderful day and I will
see you in my next video bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
