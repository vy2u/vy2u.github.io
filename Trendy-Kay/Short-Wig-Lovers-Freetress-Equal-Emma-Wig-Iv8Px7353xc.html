review and this is the way that I'm
going to be reviewing y'all this week is
so so so so gorgeous I really love this
way it's definitely a short holiday week
so if you are a person that's a fan of
short wigs and you're looking for a
short holiday weight girlfriend this is
your wig I'm trying to this week was
sent to me from I will leave this
information in my description box and
links to this week so you can purchase
it if you are interested now this wig is
a synthetic full cap unit so with 4 cap
units that means it doesn't have any
laser doesn't have a part it doesn't
have any of that um this way does not
even have combs in it so if you like
homes in your wig I will probably stay
away from this week because it
definitely does not have cones in it the
only thing it comes with is adjustable
stretch and I do have my straps adjusted
so yeah as far as how the wig fits my
head of course you guys know I have a
small head so this week actually fits my
head pretty good it is um it is
tightened so keep that in my by not
having any cones and my straps are
adjusted um it is securely on my head I
don't feel like the wig is going to fall
off or anything like that just in case
anybody was worried about that so this
is the free trust equal in style wig
that's what it's called in style wig and
this is the style Emma and I have it in
a color too so this is what the top card
looks like and I know you're probably
like well why doesn't it look like this
so ok when I first received the wig
basically the wig was in finger waves
when a picture is showing it curly in
the front because if
style it like and take the finger waves
out it will become curly in the front
like that I don't really like that too
much um so yeah that's like after they
plucked it out and this is before they
plucked it out and still in penguins but
it's kind of like longer on this side I
don't really I didn't really like that
so what I did is I what did I do
oh yeah I just cut probably like an inch
off um
because I didn't want it long I just
wanted it in a finger wave type style
but I didn't like the long part right
here so I cut the long pieces off I cut
about an inch off and this is what it
look at this is what it looks like now I
will insert a clip of what it looked
like fresh out the pack and before I
started to cut on it this week did not
really come with sideburns and four
short weeks I love my sideburns oh I
have to have sideburns not having
sideburns one shorter wings just don't
work for me so I was like I'm not really
liking that I need something going on
right here
so I found some um left their hair and
basically what I did was I cut about an
inch of wet hair and I cut two pieces of
one-inch rough hair and I glued it
together so it could be a little bit
more thicker as far as like the density
of the hair its little tabs at the
temples and basically what I did was I
glued um I glued the hair right where
the tabs are and yeah and then I just
cut the hair and curled it with my
straightener so that's basically how I
got it to look like that think it turned
out really really good I really really
like how this turned out you guys but
that's all I did so I just cut like one
inch off where it was a lot of hair on
one side and I just added some sideburns
I didn't really do too much like
plucking this is how the wig
I didn't do too much styling because
like I said I did I do want the finger
waves I do like the look of the finger
waves so I kept the finger waves and and
then I just basically framed my face and
styled it yeah that's basically all I
did this is going to be a pretty simple
quick video I just wanted to share this
week with you guys because I thought it
was so cute so the only thing I don't
like about this week is that it doesn't
have a comb in the nape area because
usually with my shoulder weights
sometimes I do like to use the comb in
the back just so the back part can lay
down because I hate weights that ride up
in the back and it just makes it look so
fake like your headlights start all the
way like not at your neck like I don't
know like your hairline start like all
the way up here I don't really like that
so I'm going to turn around so you guys
can see the back and everything because
this is really really a nice week
you
so this is what the weight is looking
like it's so simple but yet so cute and
I really really love it it's giving me
like a back in a day type of vibe which
I'm really feeling so yes this will be
cute with like some big hoops you know
um I haven't been really when I don't
really why I don't really wear earrings
that often even when I have short hair
still don't wear earrings I don't know
I'm just really not a fan of earrings
like that but as far as tangling and
shedding of course you're not going to
get really any tangling because this is
a short wig and of course it's going to
last you a good little minute because it
is a short wig now some shorter wigs
that I have it they do shed this one is
not shedding at all so that's a good
thing because I don't like them stubby
short pieces that shed it reminds me of
cat hair and it itches and just I'm not
for that but yeah this week has not shed
on me at all which I'm really really
happy about so yeah if you guys have not
checked out Emma go check out Emma
because I really really like this wig
it's really nice um I feel like you can
weight both ways you can win with the
long piece if that's what you're into me
I'm just was not in today um it is
simple to just snip snip the long piece
off and it will still have that finger
wave effect you're not going to mess up
the wig so if you're scared to cut it
don't be scared because you're I promise
you you're not going to mess this leg up
there's no way you can mess this makeup
but yeah like I said I just wish that
the back stayed down a little bit more
because I don't know like when it right
up and makes me uncomfortable for some
reason but yeah sorry this is a quick
video but I just wanted to share this
cute wig with you guys um for all my
short wig lovers so yeah I will see you
in my next
video you guys make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
