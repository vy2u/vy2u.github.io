she knows she shutting it down maybe you
gonna shut it down for the party in the
life
party tonight
utilize the part of utilize
night for the party like any young nigga
cuz you're so good nigga paper
she's popping her own bow I should walk
in two claps it for put it back - claps
it's a booty fit all these guys it's K
of course in a fake with another video
and I'm so excited y'all because I've
been dying to do this video on his hair
so of course this video is gonna be on
it this wig I'm weighing yes honey cause
it don't even look like a wig girl got
my snatched okay what did I even
purchase this week from I don't even
remember where I purchased this week
from your but I'll list a couple sites
that Curtis wig just in case you're
interested on the wig I'm win is by it's
a wig and it's the infamous near wig
which most of you guys should be
familiar with this week and I have it in
an M 2/4 so this is what the stock card
looks like so if you know me you know
that I am in love with finger wave short
style fing Wave style wigs like this
type of style I freaking love I just
think that it fits me and suits me so
well so that's what I gravitate towards
when I'm wearing short hair is this
style so when they came out with this
style and a head apart I was like Lord
you answer all my prayers like come
through so when this week did come out I
did go ahead and purchase this wig but
of course all the like solid colors were
sold out this week also comes in like a
blueberry type of color I think it is I
don't know yeah and DX blueberry and
that's basically the color that the
model is wearing and I thought that this
color was so beautiful and I wanted to
get it so bad but of course it was sold
out and so this was actually my first
choice that color was actually my first
choice and it was sold out so that I was
like okay I'm just gonna get it in like
a 1b or like a 2 and of course that sold
out so the only eye
and I had was like this colorway it was
just one it was like a orange type color
I don't know it was like an orange type
color on the top and then the back was
like a brown color and it didn't have
duck root and when I tried to know what
I did like the style so that's how I
knew that I loved this wig because you
know I already had it so when I tried to
do and I was like yeah it's like I love
the style of this week and everything
but the color was just not it for me so
I wound up selling that week shout out
to you whoever bought it but yeah so
then I just decided to wait until this
week came back in stock and finally this
wig came back in stock so after 20 years
of waiting on this week to become
available again I finally got my hands
on the color that I want and I actually
think I'm gonna go back and get the
color that the model is wearing because
that is the color that I wanted but I
don't know I don't know why I didn't get
that color I just decided to go for
natural color I don't know but um this
week is definitely late as far as
construction is concerned this is a lace
part synthetic week so this is not human
hail nothing like that it is synthetic
it also comes with a lace part and as
far as the lace part goes oh I'm looking
on the other side hold on which poison
Oh the part is on this side I'm thinking
apart is on this side so this is a left
part
wait okay so this is a left part week
just in case you like wearing your parts
to the left I'm more used to wigs coming
on the right side cuz normally all weeks
come with the part on the right so if
you're a fan of the left side you'll
definitely love the part one this week
I'm not really a fan of the left side I
normally wear my wigs on the right side
but I'm not picky when it comes to which
side looks right I feel like both sides
look right to me
so um because I'm more so a middle part
type of girl but anyway so this part I
meant this part so this way does come
with a side part I keep on playing over
here so if I'm point over here I'm star
yeah
and I can't see myself so I don't know
what I'm really doing like I can see
myself but I really can't see myself so
anyway um this week does come with a
left part and it's also a late part now
you do not have to cut off any lace so
if you're a person that's lazy like me
and then you don't like to cut off lace
you'll definitely love this week the
only thing about this week not coming
with any lace of course you'll have that
little indentation I do have a video on
how you fix that and I'll just go ahead
and leave the video link in my
description box just in case any of you
guys want to check that out now I didn't
fix the part because I was just like I'm
not really too worried about it and when
I added my powder you really can't see
the indentation so yeah you really can't
tell when the lace starts so I was just
like okay it's not really a big deal to
me so the partner is nice it doesn't
bother me but if it bothers you you can
always fix it and it's an easy quick fix
also this week does not come with any
combs you guys me personally I'm not
really a fan of the combs but I do use
my comb in the back so I don't know if
you like combs and your wig then keep
that in mind because this one does not
come with any you can always of course
take bobby pins to secure the wig it
does come with a duct
it does come with adjustable straps
though but I normally stay away from the
adjustable straps on my shorter units
because it kind of bunches up to me and
the backward doesn't lay flat to me so
right now and I have a small head this
wig is fitting me good but I feel like
it's good for any his sides I feel like
if your head was a little bit bigger
then it would still fit you because it
does have a lot of stretch and this week
well right now I don't have my strap
suggested and I didn't add any bobby
pins to the wig and the wig is still
fitting on my head nice but if I was to
go outside like I'll probably wear some
bobby pins in just in case but so I'm
sure you'll get your ways out of this
wig because of course too
in my opinion I definitely feel like the
shorter way to last longer than the
longer weeks so yeah no tangling and no
shedding from this week also I did go in
and pluck I keep a 1/2 point over here I
did go in and pluck the part it's not
really necessary to pluck the part and I
didn't pluck like I didn't fully pluck
the part I stopped in the middle what
you can't even tell so I feel like if
you just wanted to add your concealer or
finishing powder to the part you can and
it would still look realistic in my
opinion so yeah I just played with the
front a little bit but as far as like
the rest of the week I did nothing to
this week whatsoever y'all this week is
like so bum Street out the Peck I don't
know it's just bringing on my sex appeal
like I feel so sexy in this week yo I
don't know short hair just do something
to my soul she knows you shutting it
down to all the me too much owner I'm
gonna go ahead and leave all the links
in my description box to this week just
in case any of you guys are interested
this wig was only $20 yo if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below and I will
see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
