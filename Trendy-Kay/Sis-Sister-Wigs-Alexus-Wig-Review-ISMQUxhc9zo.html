review and today I'm going to be
reviewing the week that I have on my
head right now and this is my sister's
the wig and it is a least part unit and
the name of this unit Alexis and I have
it in a 1 being so this is what the
model looks like so I purchased this
unit from wigs types that come and I
paid I know I paid less than $20 but I'm
not really sure the exact price so I
make sure I list everything in the
description box but yeah this is what
the wig looks like as far as the
construction is concerned I do believe
it has two combs right here in a comb in
the back and it does not have adjustable
straps it has a drawstring like a
ponytail Jojo you know how like I don't
know if you ever wore like a fake
ponytail before that's the only thing I
can think of like the drawstring that
come in a little pony tails like this
like this was only it like
so yeah that's the only thing that I do
not like well that's one thing that um I
don't like about this unit is that the
adjustable straps like there are no
adjustable straps is a jaw string and
its really annoying and that's like a
big con for me I do not like the way
this ket construction is set up at all
um another thing that really bothers me
is and let me step back so you guys can
see the length but this is how long this
unit is I think it's like around 20 26
to 28 inches but yeah this wig is very
very very very thin like I had to like
keep them one puffing it up just so I
could look thick so yeah that's another
kind that I had is that this unit is
really really really thin so other than
that like I really loved this unit I
just wish that it was thicker and I wish
that the cap construction was a little
bit better than what it is and um as far
as tangling and shedding that's another
con this wig tangles so bad like it
tangles a lot um it doesn't do much
shedding but as far as like tangling the
way tangles so so so bad so this I know
is not going to be one of those weeks
that lasts long so yeah um this is what
the pardon area looks like so you do
have a nice amount of pardon um and I
just plucked my part out in it yeah I
decided to wear this unit as a side part
because
I do not like it as a middle part I
think it just looks really funny looking
but it is meant to be a sad part anyway
so yeah that's the reason that I'm
wearing it one the side so yeah it's
just a lot of complications with this
unit this unit is very very gorgeous but
if you interested it was only it was
under 20 bucks so I mean if you think
that's worth it then go ahead and
purchase you this unit I did get this
from weight types calm so yeah it's like
so glamorous though like look at this
how you can put it like that
but it's just so thin I wish it was like
ba-ba-boom like like just like y'all
know what I'm talking about right I just
if you have any questions or comments
you can leave them in the comment
section down below and you guys tell me
what you think about this week like I
like it but I just know that it's not
gonna last and I do not like this skimpy
like thinness going on so yeah um I will
see you in my next video you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
