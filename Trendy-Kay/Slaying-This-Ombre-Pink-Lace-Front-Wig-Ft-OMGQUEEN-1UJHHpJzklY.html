chopped up New Hope y'all gonna know
this money's no good are you guys okay
of course and I'm back with a another
video
and of course this video is going to be
on this gorgeous hey you guys so if you
follow me on Instagram or snapchat then
this wig is no surprise to you because
you've seen it I've been doing my thing
in this week I've just been when this
week non-stop y'all well it's been in
rotation but for the most part I've
really been rocking this week because I
love it and the color is just like one
point for me so anyway I received this
week from omg Queen and this is what the
packaging looks like which if you are a
fan of packaging and packaging matters
to you then you'll definitely love the
way that they have this week package I
just find it really really cute so of
course the we came inside this little
one plastic bag and worn it in his OMG
queen and it just has like the product
number which is imw 21 and the hair
color which is ombre pink and the hair
length which is 22 inches so it came in
this it didn't have like a net and
everything over it but I don't know
where the net is
cuz like I said I've been really playing
this week it also came if y'all can hear
screaming I'm so sorry it also came with
a wig ban and on it it just tells you
how many inches it is and I'll take it
out yeah so y'all can see how long it is
I don't really know if that matters but
yeah so they give you like a little wig
ban just in case the wig it's too big
you can adjust it to your head sides
so these always come in handy ladies but
if you're lazy like me
yeah usually I don't use this because
I'm a lazy bitch and I just don't be
feeling like so - and
to my week so yeah but it is good and it
does work also it came with this little
pamphlet thing and this basically is
like a after sale service card so you
can exchange or return so if you're not
satisfied with this week they do allow
you to exchange it or return it and I
noticed it has to be a certain amount of
days you can return it but yeah if y'all
curious about exchange your returns this
company and their policy do allow you to
exchange and return the weed and of
course I don't think that you can cut
the lace off or anything like that it
has to be like unworn okay on to the
specs of this week and if I'm looking
down this because I'm reading because I
don't of course know it off the top of
my head so yeah the hair type is Indian
virgin hair and the hair color is ombre
pink the hair style is silky straight so
it's not a Yankee texture they say hair
style is silky straight but this
actually I feel like this is Yankee I
don't feel like this is silky hair to me
and my opinion maybe because it's bleach
I don't know I just feel like it's not
like silky to me I get like that I get
like that yaki texture from this week um
hair left 22 inches the hair density 150
cap construction is the cap d which is
the glueless lace front wig and yeah
that's it
also I'm going to leave a coupon code in
my description box and it gets you a
five percent off all hand not just on
this wig I mean it's not a lot but it'll
do something so yeah I'm gonna leave my
discount code right here and get you
five percent off any purchase which is
kind of wack in my opinion but I mean it
would get you a little bit of something
off just in case anybody is interested I
have
we've been having fun when this week I
get stairs every uncle I don't know what
it is about this wig but every body
freakin loves this wig you guys
everywhere I go I get compliments from
like men women it does not matter like I
just like get non-stop compliments and
I'm like oh okay I knew like the wig
look good but then I started thinking
like this week must really look good
maybe it's my complexion and then the
color of this hair I don't know but I
feel like this is like the perfect color
for me which is like a pale pink type
color and also I did wash his hair and
the color remains the same like it
literally did not feed when I washed it
or anything so I don't know what they
did to achieve this color but whatever
they did I like it I like it a lot so
yeah this is what the wig looks like and
I haven't been wearing this wig for a
while now and overall I just really
really loved this week now I will say
that this week sheds a little bit more
than I wanted to which I don't know I
don't like the shame but it's
understandable because I feel like
before they even achieve this color like
they bleach this head to the mix like
when I say bleach I mean like white
bleach
cuz that's the like not like white
bleach but like white blowing like the
hair was like a whitish blowing but you
can tell that the hair was lighting to
the max and it is still healthy but it
doesn't shed so I want y'all to know
that and it's definitely I feel like
it's definitely from the bleach for sure
I did go in and clip the ends just a
little bit because they was kind of like
scraggly as well and I guess that's from
like the bleach but once I like clip
some of the ends and of course this is
22 inches so it still remains 22 inches
but like I
I clicked like this much often and it's
just because I was like they kind of
look fried to me and when I got this
week like when I received this week this
week was Carol I did go ahead and
straighten it because I just felt like
the curls this week looked better
straight into me and my opinion also
when I watched his hair it does like it
does have a wavy texture when it's wash
so I guess in his natural state the hair
is wavy which it looks really pretty and
I was thinking about winner in his
natural state but then I was like I just
want to street so I decided to
straighten it again but yeah I feel like
a low like if it was the deep condition
his hair it would be fine I feel like
I'm what I wanted to deep conditioning
but I just didn't have the time so I did
him but I feel like this he'll probably
it would be much better if it was like
treated in deep condition but for the
most part like it doesn't tangle or
anything like that like I might get a
snake or hair there but it doesn't
tangle to the point where you like oh my
gosh like I can't deal with this hand no
it doesn't tangle like that
but like I said shut him for me is a
little bit too obsessive for me I don't
really like too much shed and if you
leave him saying but like I said it is
understandable because you know this is
like bleached hair for real so this is
what it looks like and to achieve this
look or how my wig is land I use got to
be glue Joe of course to lay down on the
perimeter I do feel like the lace was a
little bit too light for my liking I was
over color the laces I think the lace is
like a medium brown which I feel like
it's more of a light brown I don't know
I just felt like the lace was a little
bit too light and I didn't go in and
pluck my headline which I feel like you
should if you want your weight to look
more natural but for the most part I
felt like it does looking at true to me
um and I also did not bleach my night so
those are probably two things that she
wanted
you want your weight to look more
natural but I just added my finishing
powder into the part I didn't pluck the
part this is just how it is and like I
say I didn't pluck the hand line this is
just how it is but I did utilize my baby
hands just to give it a more natural
appearance but I really want to I really
wanted to go oh and and like put the
work into this wig but then I was like
no cuz I just got too comfortable but
went in just I don't know I was just
like whatever it is what it is but I so
loved this week you guys like this right
here honey
I got turns into a different person
y'all know how I feel about the pink and
I had a pink synthetic wig that was
about this color I feel like this is a
tad bit more paler than the other weight
that I had and that wig was also a
synthetic wig and it didn't have dark
roots so when I saw this and it was
human hair plus and hey a little bit of
dog fur and on top of that it was this
color I was like oh my gosh she Lord you
just answer all my prayers like Oh is
she doing to me
so I definitely love this hair and y'all
I don't know is it just me or does got
to be glued it don't last long like for
me some people be saying like your last
three days and stuff like that but
literally by the end of the day all my
lace is like lifting up basically I can
like take it off without wetting the
edges to try to get it up or like it
does not last for me if y'all have any
suggestions on what I could use to hold
my lace down let me know I like I don't
want like no legit glue because I'm not
about their life but like something
along the lines I've got to be glue so
yeah I'm not really a fan of the
Gorillaz night so don't recommend it
because
just not wanna gonna use it um but yeah
if any of you guys have any reckon
recommendations so if any you guys have
any recommendations on what I can use
besides got to be glued to get my legs
to lay down and not like no blue blue
because like I said ya know um that's
not a bitch you know let me know huh let
me know homegirl yes
but um yeah I'm definitely wait a minute
okay and also I don't know if I
mentioned this but this is a lace front
wig is not a full lace but you can
definitely do some things with this wig
if you wanted to switch it up so also
this week does hold a curl like really
really well for a long period of time
but when I curl did I did not like how
it look I like this Wigmore Street with
this color so maybe it's just me but
yeah but if you wanted to you know if
you wanted to wear the front up of
course you could do that but yeah this
wig is lit your I freaking love this
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
