answer me right now I need you
please take away the stress at Dhoni
you got me on my knees baby James Brown
hey guys it's Kate of course and I'm
back with another video so this video is
gonna be on this hair and this hair was
sent to me from oMG her hair company so
I will here and leave all the links in
the description box just in case any of
you guys are interested so we're just
gonna hop straight into this wig I'm
wearing the pre plug 360 at least we
icky icky straight Indian remy human
hair the hairline is pre plucked the
hair texture is yaki straight of course
the hair color is a natural color the
hair density is 150 which I think when I
first received this week the density
felt like 150 but after I straightened
the wig it kind of loses its thickness
but when you wash it again it thickens
back up if that makes any kind of sense
but you know how your like natural
texture is thick and then when you
straighten your hair is a little bit
thinner so that's kind of with this
break reminds me of
the hair left is 20 inches the cap
construction is a 360 lace front 4
inches laced lace color is light brown
and the wig sides is average which is a
22 to 22 and a half circumference so
yeah that's basically all the details on
this wig okay so on to this beautiful
hair do you see this so I am going to
insert a clip of me curling his head
just because a lot of you guys are
curious on how I curl my wigs so yeah
just in case you were interested in
seeing how I curl my hair I don't know
if I'm gonna keep talking and like have
a clip maybe like right here or just
throw the clip in but either way I did
curved this hair I also bleached the
nuts and I had this way for a while so I
can't remember if I plucked out the
hairline but I think I did pluck out the
hairline but as I stated before the
hairline
it's already pre pluck so if you didn't
want to pluck the headline you don't
have to well if you don't know I am a
sucker for Yankee human hair I don't
know it just comes across as looking so
natural to me so definitely if you don't
have a Yankee human hair wig in your wig
collection definitely check out this
week I always stress that to you guys
every time I do like a Yankee texture
wig just because I just feel like you
can never go wrong with it and it looks
so natural and it definitely looks like
your hair so basically I curled this
like I said I did bleach the nuts um you
don't really have to bleach nice it
still looks natural but I want it this
week to look as natural as possible let
me tell y'all how this week has been
holding up it has been holding up
so like amazing okay like this week is
definitely amazing as far as tingling
and shedding I have not received any
tangling from this wig yet and shedding
I probably got like maybe three strands
of hair after item bleach the knots and
washed it and everything like that as
you can see this wig is still holding up
very nice it had a lot of body it's
definitely a very very soft you can
still feel like that yaki texture in it
it's soft but it definitely has like
that Yankee texture to it which I love
I'm definitely a fan of the Yankee hair
because it just looks so real so what I
have going on right now
Oh first of all as far as the
construction this has two combs in the
front Macomb in a bag and adjustable
straps now like I said before this is a
average sized cap so if you have a
bigger sized head or smaller sized head
I feel like you can get away with this
with this type of cap sides now for me I
did go in and adjust my straps because
my head is a little on the smaller side
and and if you was to adjust your strips
I feel like you don't need to
any type of got to be glue or anything
to secure the lace I'm telling you guys
it fits that good way you don't have to
do anything especially if you land this
head down now if you land the hair up or
like I have it I did have to go in and
put some got to be glue hair spray or
holding spray on the sides just because
the sides don't stay down especially if
you tried to wear the head up or back it
does not stay down now this part like
from here to here it stays down but the
ants head definitely don't so right now
I do have my straps adjusted and I do
have got to be glued holding spray
holding the air tape down on this side
not on this side just because this side
is the only side that's really showing
now I think this week did come with baby
heads but I went back in and cut a
little bit of baby hair and as you can
see the headline looks really natural I
don't really have too much baby hairs
won't orange just because I didn't want
that kind of look for this style but
yeah and basically all I did was pin
this bag just because I just like that
look and I do have some bobby pins in
and y'all look how cute these bobby pins
are this is like a watermelon and this
is a what is they fruit call it a
pineapple and then on this side I have a
cherry right here and it's definitely
giving me their old-school 20s
take a look which I am definitely living
for right now I don't know I just think
this whole look is like really girly and
cute I also leave a link on where I got
these bobby pins from and also if you're
curious about my lip color and when
color pop take a pixie I believe I'll
leave it in the description box if I'm
wrong but yeah this is what the week
looks like oh yeah one more important
thing the curls did fall and I didn't
put this
we gone straight away after our code
that I did like leave it sitting for
probably around like three hours as you
can see the curls that definitely fell
some they didn't fall a lot but they
definitely felt but I would suggest if
you was to curl this hair I would like
put some flexi rods or like rollers or
like just pin curl it and pin it just to
keep the curls and then spray it with
some hairspray I didn't do that because
I'm lazy and I don't feel like going
through all that but yeah I still like
the way that it turns out I just wish
that the curls were a little tighter so
yeah be aware of the curls falling this
week still holds a curl but they do fall
after time if you're interested in a
Yankee texture type of wig definitely
check out the description box but yeah
this is it for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
