when put your loss
when put your last now
which is on
before I get into this video you guys
let me just make a PSA here he here he
okay for some reason everyone thinks
that I'm pregnant okay and I'm here to
tell you sorry to spoil whatever that's
in your mind that you think that I'm
pregnant but I'm not and when I mean a
lot of you guys thinking that I'm
pregnant but if you don't see no ring on
this finger thing is it you don't see no
ring on this finger
your girl's not pregnant okay I'm just
getting fat y'all so no babies so I hope
we can clear the air on that and I won't
be getting no more messages or people
leaving comments in my comment section
like you're pregnant you're glowing I do
appreciate it but I'm not pregnant like
no so um yeah I hope that clears
everything up because when I get
messages like that it just reminds me
that bitch you're getting fit okay guys
so I'm back with another video of course
and these are the beautiful other
bundles that I used in my previous video
I'll link the video down below in the
description box if you haven't already
seen that but these bundles I just went
ahead and Co washed them and now this is
me putting my hair into a low sleek
ponytail and I do part my hair in the
middle it all depends you can put your
part on the side the middle straight
back it doesn't matter so now that I
have my ponytail and I'm gonna go ahead
and braid oh no i'm not hold up and yet
after I fix my edges I'm gonna wrap my
head with a scarf and I'm gonna go ahead
and braid my ponytail and if you watch
my previous video before this you know
that I did another what I did another
method where I wrap the track or the
weft around my braid but I'm not gonna
do that and I'm also not gonna put my
hair into a bun because I know a lot of
people will probably be like well why
didn't you like put your head into a bun
before you edit the track and I feel
like when I put my bun right there
it just makes it bulky up in the base
part I don't know maybe it's just me but
I like to leave my braids hanging just
because it looks more natural and it
doesn't look big and bulky and now I'm
just taking the hair and wrapping it
around the ponytail with the base of the
ponytail just to make it look a bit more
natural but yeah that's basically it for
this look you guys I hope you enjoy and
I'll see you in my next video
I literally just noticed that I had the
same top one huh I had the same shirt
one I wore in the previous video but I
just changed so I could like give y'all
a look so this is the end result and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
