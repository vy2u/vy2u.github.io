another wave review and this is like my
second time filming this video so
hopefully everything will go smooth this
time because I swear I did enough for
like filming this video at third time so
anyway garol we are going to be talking
about this week that's on my head or my
head if you're not following me
Instagram I follow me on Instagram
because I'm you'll definitely have a
chance to see what I post next as far as
videos is concerned I normally comes the
picture before I put up a video so yeah
I will leave my Instagram right here
just in case you're not follow me on
Instagram and those of you who all
follow me on Instagram
you have already seen this beautiful
hair I would have had this video out
sooner the day that I posted this
picture because I know a lot of people
be kind of mad about it but um so I'm
filming this over look at that
yeah okay so this um look at this okay
alright so this week was sent to me from
sister wigs and this is the free trust
equal follow me wig and I have it in the
color op9 IJ which i think if you're not
too big one color but you want something
different will want to do some color but
you don't want to be out there like it
sounds like when bright colors this
color is definitely very subtle it's
like a deep burgundy color and it does
has dark roots and then it gradually
goes into the 99 J which are really
you're I'm definitely a big fan of this
hair I do recommend this hair now I know
a lot of you probably already know about
this way but because it has been out for
quite some time now but when I saw I
felt like all the ways were starting to
look the same to me so I was just like
these were one of the ways that I just
was like I'm just going to pass on it
but actually if you were like me and
passed on this week you need to retrace
your steps and go we'll get this week
because it's absolutely beautiful
like the whole construction of the wig
everything like the texture the feel of
the wig the part the faith that I'm not
getting any shedding from this wig
no tangling yet and I'm in my second day
like this I love this wig now I had to
say if you're not a fan of long hair you
probably won't like this wig because it
is extra long but I feel like you still
like the curl patter and the way that
this is style you can definitely cut it
and I don't think that it will take away
from the wig and all this week is so
nice and full um I feel like for all my
girls out there or guys for all my
people out there who like that I'm thick
full hair you'll definitely get it here
because this wig is so full and thick
and it does have like a Yankee texture
to it which is nice because it's not
like overly Yankee also this is a
synthetic unit I forgot to mention
because I know a lot of people you know
like I said previously are confused so I
am going to start addressing that so
this is a synthetic unit um as far as
where I got it from of course it's the
wig sent me this week so I'm going to
leave all the links to sister wigs and
dialect on Dalek
direct links to this wig so you can just
it be easy to find it you can just
purchase it if you want to buy it now
one thing that concerns me is
one of my fellow youtubers and she did
do a review on this week and she was
saying how her wait like this is not as
full as mine's so don't be mad at me if
you purchased this wig and it's not as
full as mine um I don't know maybe I'm
just like have a small head but yeah I
mean mines is like really full the curls
of bouncy this is my second day win this
wig I still haven't got any shedding I
haven't got shedding on the first day I
haven't even got any shuttin after I cut
off the lease and plucking apart a
little bit and tangling this is a longer
unit so beware that these units that's
this long does tango I mean all
synthetic wigs tangle so you will get
tangling but right now like I have not
experienced any tangling from this unit
I have absolutely no complaints about
this no I do have one complaint but it's
not really like anything to not want to
make you buy this wig I guess I don't
know the only thing that I really don't
like is that the bang part doesn't
really have a lot of layers going on and
I'm not a person that likes a lot of
hair in my face so I find myself
brushing the hair back all the time so
yeah that's the only thing but that's a
quick fix you can always go in with your
scissors and just cut you know some hair
off if you don't like it in your face I
don't think I mentioned this but this
week is it does come with soft lace
throughout the perimeter so I know some
people are not a fan of soft lace and
some people are they don't like the
heart lace because they feel like it
without their edges but for me I like
hard lace over soft lace um only reason
I like a hard lace over soft lace is
because when you when you're plucking
your part
normally the like lace will rip if it's
tough and you're not paying attention
clucking like more than two strands
ahead at a time it definitely will rip
on you but so be aware of that
but this way even though I did go in and
pluck some hair out you really honestly
don't need to pluck any of the hell out
the way to depart is already comes is
good enough I feel like you can add your
concealer and powder and then be done
with it but I did go in and pluck some
hair out of my part and I did not add
any powder or concealer or anything like
that to the part like this is definitely
some going out hair or holiday hair
holidays are rolling around you need a
bomb wait to wear this one this is the
one this has to be one of my favorite
weeks right now this is crazy look how
far it just looks like real hair like
you will not get synthetic vibes from
his hair oh that's how real it looks
so yeah that's it for my video I think I
covered everything if you have any
questions about this hand you can leave
it in my comment section and make sure
to check out my um my description box
for links to this hair and also I'll
leave what's on my lips in my
description box and yeah I think that's
it and I'm just going to turn around
real quick so you guys can see what the
wig looks like in the back but yeah also
I wanted to say thank you for all the
support that I've been getting on my
last video because as most of you know
I'm trying to switch up my content is a
