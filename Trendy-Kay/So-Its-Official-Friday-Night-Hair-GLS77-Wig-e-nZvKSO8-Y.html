wave review and this week is from Friday
night hair and this is the GLS 77 and I
have it in a color one being basically
this is one of their in newer units and
this is what it looks like now if you're
not familiar with Friday night hair they
give you two combs in the front a comb
in the back and adjustable strap the
lace is heartless and they give you two
inches worth of parting space up in the
front um the most part in space is
towards the middle right here and then
when you get to the sides it's less lace
that you can pile I feel like this is
like really different for Friday night
hair because I've never seen above unit
on their site so this is basically like
a messy type curly bub unit and I like
it now this is how the weight comes and
everything um I did finger comb it out a
little bit but I will show you that um
you
the only thing that I don't like about
this week is that the texture um the
hair that's on the lace it's more of a
loose type of curl but this happens with
all their wigs I'm sorry I'm so hot and
then the back part is more curly I don't
know if you guys can see the difference
but it's definitely a difference in the
two heads with the hairs that's on the
wefts and the hair that's coming out of
the lace it's not really so much of a
big deal but yeah that is something to
keep an eye on just in case you're like
but the hair actually blends in pretty
good so I'm not tripping off that this
also is a lot of hair I'm a literally
sweating over here right now y'all I
don't even know if y'all can like see
but this unit is a lot of hair you don't
have to worry about this unit being thin
and sand the tracks in between or
anything like that because it definitely
is a thick unit so the cut oneness is
really nice but I did have to go in and
snip a few like an inch or so off on
both sides only because um it was
basically like long right here
it didn't gradually go into the bulb
like it was a bulb and then it was like
long pieces right here so I just went in
and I cut the UM I cut the pieces off
there didn't really that kind of like
threw the ball pole look off because it
I don't know it just didn't flow
together how I wanted it to so yeah I
just cut it off and this is the end
result I don't have none of my hair out
right here and I have a little sliver of
a baby hair right here but this is not
even my hands actually the wigs hair and
I just like swooped it over to the side
a little bit so yeah it's really not
it's really not much to say about this
unit it is really nice so if you have
not checked out
Friday night hair go check them out I
will leave their links in the
description box now as far as tangling
and shutting on on this unit I did
receive some tangling and some shutting
and tingling wasn't too bad was a couple
strands and that's it now um it did like
the tangle up on me a little bit like
when I run my fingers to it um but I
feel kind of like snakes but this week
is not tingly um this is a shorter unit
so of course this is going to last you
longer than a longer unit and so that's
always a good thing so guys that's it
for this video if you have any questions
feel free to leave it in my comment
section now oh this time he's passing by
but I'll still came</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
