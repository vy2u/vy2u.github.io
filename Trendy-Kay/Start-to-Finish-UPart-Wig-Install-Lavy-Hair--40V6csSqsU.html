with the levee hair company packaging
this is what the packaging looks like
Anna came with like a little pamphlet
and a wig cap of course and this u-part
wig is 18 inches and it came with the
net and the paper and the inside and
it's really soft and gorgeous so it does
come with lace ndu part it also comes
with three clip combs at the U part and
it comes with three additional combs and
adjustable straps so now I'm just
placing it on my hair and it fits very
very snug and tight I really love the
construction of this so now I'm just
pinpoint and where I need to leave my
hair out and yes I know it's scary but I
had these braids in for a minute now and
I just didn't feel like you know washing
my hair or nothing like that
so please excuse me I actually just
washed it probably like a week ago so
yes that's basically what I'm doing you
guys and umm yeah so just watch if I'm
getting quiets because I just want you
guys to watch so yes most of you guys
are probably going to kill me like why
didn't you get a bigger comb or
something to detangle your hair but that
was the only comb that I had and you see
I quit because I was like it was just
hurting too bad so now I'm just a part
in this section that that's going to be
my leave out for the u part wig and I'm
just going to pin it up and move it out
the way so I can umm comb roll my the
rest of my hair so yeah these are
basically going to be my anchor braids
for when I clip in the u part wig so I
hate breaking you guys but that's what
I'm doing and my arms get so tired so
just braid braid braid
okay so now we're moving on to the next
braid which will be my other anchor
breed for the you part and or whatever
so yeah I'm just going to breathe this
straight back like I did the other side
and that's basically a yo when I say I
hate braiding I hate bringing and my
head is like shedding because from it
Ben and those braids and you know your
hair sheds a certain amount of strands
everyday and for me not like really like
well basically for me having these
breathing once I took it out my head was
like shedding like crazy from all that
like head it wasn't never comb so now
this is what it should look like and now
I'm just going to go ahead and cut off
the excess lace from the U part so yeah
you're going to want to cut this off and
everybody should know how to cut off
some lace so that's basically what I'm
doing is just cutting off the lace and
after I cut off the lace I'm just going
to place it on my head and you guys know
that I don't like combs but I feel like
it's best to use combs
but first I'm just going to pin up my
braids in the back with a bobby pin so
yeah that's what it looks like and now
I'm going to place this on my head and
yes I'm going to use all three two combs
um right here they like like clip the
little Clippy kind of combs and then the
rest of the the other three combs are
the like wig combs that usually come in
a wig if you do them saying so yeah and
if it's perfect and that's what it looks
like so I didn't have to do no
alterations and now this is just what it
looks like in light because I need it um
to flatten like the street in my hair so
I had to move to the bathroom so now I'm
taking this Guarnere forties and it's
like a serum and don't kill me for this
I notices a lot and it made my hair
really crazy and normally I don't use
this stuff because my head gets oily
already so I don't really use like a
base type of
um he protected to put in my hair
because like I said my hair gets all the
overtime anyway so yeah it just made my
hair really oily but we just won't work
with it so yeah that's what I'm using
I'm just flat I'm just straightening my
leave out and okay so as you can see the
hair is really not trying to straighten
and I wish I would have got this you put
um in a straight texture instead of
getting it in the body wave texture I
don't really know what I was thinking
because my plan ultimately was to wear
my hair straight so yeah um so you can
see me like struggling trying to
straighten it and then after a while I
just gave up like all right it's not
straightening so whatever so yeah um
this is basically how it turned out
so hopefully once I wash the unit and
then try to straighten it again maybe it
is straightened but I'll keep you guys
posted but yeah that's basically it
so this is basically how it turned out
so let's go ahead and give you my
thoughts on this new part wait now I
actually do love this you part wait you
guys I feel like if it's my head so
perfect so if you are person that has a
small head and you can never find a you
part to fit your head or you know
anything like that this is a you part to
get now this you part I did get this you
part and body wave this is the Malaysian
body wave why I got this in body wave
I don't know I think that was my mistake
I'm because I wanted to wear this
actually straight um and of course my
head it's really straight and then as
you saw me in the last clip trying to
straighten his hair and it got straight
a little bit but for the most part it
really didn't get straight now mind you
I did not wash this I just straighten it
I'm pretty sure if I was to wash this
and then try to straighten it it
probably would straighten better but for
the time purposes I just you know didn't
do all of that but um so yeah but the u
part wig is seamless the construction of
this u part wig I give them a ten out of
ten it's really nice I just wish that I
would have got this and straight because
it does they do offer this u part wig in
a body made texture a straight texture
and a curly touched so yeah but this is
what it looks like but of course you
know I'm going to update you guys so I'm
definitely going to wash it and then try
to restrain it to see if that works out
because I definitely will love to wear
this hair straight but for the most part
I love it because
you can't tell that this is a u part wig
this looks like my real hey you guys
like I'm not even lying it's so secured
like this thing all these cones in here
and I used every single cone it's best
if you just use the combs because the
clips right here it just makes it so
much better like so if you're using
these cones it just makes it better to
clip it if you do them saying so yeah
like if you saw me you would think that
this is my real head this is like really
nice so it is song did shed a little
when I was straightening it and I did
get a few snakes here and there for the
most part but it's definitely soft I
really like it I really love the length
like it really looks like my natural
hair and the thickness is not like too
thick and gives you that natural density
now when it was in a body wave state it
was a bit um fuller but as I
straightened it it got a little bit more
thin but I actually liked the density on
here because it just goes well with my
hair so this is what it looks like
overall I do like this week I definitely
like eight plus as far as the
construction is concerned and everything
like that um yeah I do so far like this
week again I am going to give you an
update just to see if it does straighten
because I know like people like to have
that versatility with their wigs and you
might like the body wave texture and
want to wear it like that and then one
day you might want to strain it and you
know if you can't straighten it
you want to know right so I am going to
let you know if it does work out better
once I wash it but yeah this is the hair
and this is what it looks like and it
really blooms and really really good
excuse this shirt because you're going
to be saying a lot of this shirt after
this video cuz it's gonna be like video
overload so yes where is my man so yeah
I'm just going to wear it like this just
because I'm just like I'm gonna wait
like this
I will show you that this really looks
like my hair I'm trippin so yeah it's
honey so yeah if you have any questions
