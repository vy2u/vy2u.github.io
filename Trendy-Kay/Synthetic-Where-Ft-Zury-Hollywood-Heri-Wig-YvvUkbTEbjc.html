Danner my like my spell
I'm gonna beat da Liang nigga to close
on a jig and Braille my feet all night
on the streets in a Washington y'all
niggas evil oh dear but I never got down
on my money the money I got so it's K
and I'm back with another video so this
video is gonna be on this hair and this
week was sent to me and from zouri
Hollywood so yeah I'll leave the links
where you can purchase this wig in my
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested so the week they
sent me is sisters two weeks and it's
beyond your imagination I guess that's
the collection and the color is some
very artsy blossom so this is what the
card looks like and the motto is
weighing a color the color all blind so
that's basically a blonde color with our
dog root so yeah this is what the stock
car looks like and I felt like all in
all the way it looks exactly like the
stock card so yeah basically the
construction of this wig is not a lace
front because that's what it says on
there but this is Natalie's front it
gives you a lace part I didn't like the
way the style and look put it in the
middle so I just shift the week over to
the side and I'm wearing it as a side
part but if you you know like it as the
middle part by all means do you think
and you know do whatever fits you but
for me I like it more towards this side
in the middle so yeah this is how the
hair comes originally I didn't brush it
I didn't do anything to this hair it
comes in this loose wave honestly you
guys this looks for sure like something
died under hair I'm not even playing
like it really looks so good so like I
said the part comes in the middle they
do provide you of soft lace you
you have to cut off the least um what
else it gives you two combs and a fry a
comb in a bag and adjustable straps I do
feel like this week is BK friendly so if
you have a bigger size head definitely
definitely this week will work for you
if you have a smaller size head like me
you can still get away with when this
week I would just adjust the strips that
they offer you and I just in my straps
and I feel like you know the wig is very
secure on my head now let's get to this
color because I cannot wait to talk
about this color do you all see this
color like look at this color this sure
enough you look like some professional
coloring has been done here like this is
absolutely insane so basically they give
you the dark roots which is like a color
1b and then it gradually goes to like
this purple type color and then the ends
are this pink color which I am so living
for right now when they sent me this wig
and I looked at it I was like oh my gosh
like come on this is K all the way like
what I'm definitely not a stranger of
colors and I'm definitely not shy when
it comes to colors especially if the
color is like one point and it looks
realistic like this looks like I died
someone to have for sure y'all this is a
Yankee texture is not shiny whatsoever
it is very dull it might be coming up a
little shiny on camera because of the
the light but yeah besides that this wig
is a very natural looking it just looks
so good so this is what the part in
space looks like and I didn't really go
in and pluck the part I did pluck the
part but I didn't pluck all of it I just
plugged
mainly towards the hairline and then I
just stop and edit my finishing powder I
also created a little bit of
this week does not come with any baby
here so if you're into like you know
baby heads you can just make them
yourself
sorry hear anything in the background
that's my son play with his toys but
yeah this wit is so freaking it um y'all
actually don't have any complaints about
this week
it just feels and looks so freakin
natural now I did get a light shut-in it
wasn't like crazy or nothing like that
haven't received any tingling from this
week yeah I'm sure it will start to
tingle because it is a longer synthetic
unit so yeah this week is actually
really long it's probably like 24 inches
it's definitely really full so you don't
have to worry about this week been then
at all like it's so for you guys like
it's for a full this is all the head to
the front and as you can see it's
definitely full so let me turn around so
you can see how
if any of you guys are into color like I
am in you know y'all love the color wigs
definitely try out this color again this
is the color some song arty blossom and
this is really truly a beautiful color
I'm definitely feeling feeling this
color it just looks too natural to me if
it wasn't a 1 or 1 like a tube or
something like that I probably wouldn't
like it as much as I do with the color I
think the college is it just does
something to this week so yeah this week
is the ish okay look at this color like
I look like this Rapunzel of night like
this it's bomb I'm not even playing girl
what this color is like this Gary should
get a trophy oh it's amazing
so guys that's pretty much it for this
video if you have any questions feel
free to leave them in my comment section
down below and I'll see you in my next
video I love you guys you guys
