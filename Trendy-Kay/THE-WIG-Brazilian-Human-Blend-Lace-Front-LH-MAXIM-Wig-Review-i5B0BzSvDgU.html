hey guys so I'm back with a another wig
review so if some of you follow me on
Instagram then you have already seen
this unit which is by the wig I guess
that's like the name of the company is
the wig and it's natural Brazilian remy
I don't think as I do think it's like
the synthetic hair but it says 100%
brazilian human hair blend so it's
basically like a human head blend and it
is a lace front arm with the lace part
so this is what it came in and I just
thought that that was so cute I did
purchase this unit from Wiig types calm
and I payed 39.99 for this units ok so
I'm going to show you guys what the part
looks like real quick and this is what
the part looks like the arm hair texture
is like really thick but it's not like a
Yankee Yankee texture is more on the
silky side but then it's kind of not
like it it feels really thick but it
doesn't feel coerced and it doesn't feel
too silky so at this wig is pretty long
it's about hmm now I'm gonna say like 24
inches so yeah it's pretty long 24 yeah
about 24 inches it's far as shedding
entangling I don't get tangling out of
this unit but I do get shedding I don't
really like how this unit shits because
I may not be heading right here
every time I run my fingers through it
it sheds so that's one thing that I do
not like about this way and another
thing that I don't like about this wig
is the fact that the layers like in the
face area are really really long so I
was debating on whether I should cut
like up in here like this part because
like the front area is so long so I know
all units are different maybe it's just
mine I don't know but I definitely don't
like the shedding and um I feel like
that I feel like this wig needs more
layering up in the face are you
but overall I absolutely love this unit
um yeah I think I will cut like more
legs up in the front
so if you are interested in seeing how
this way it comes originally as a sad
part this is what it would look like so
yeah I really like it on the side as
well but um I feel like yeah I feel like
I like the middle better with this unit
so yeah and again like it's just really
annoying because this is a really nice
unit but like it sheds so much like but
yeah that's it for this little review so
you can purchase this from wait tapes
calm and I'll leave too late the link to
this week in my description box along
with the price and everything else so if
you have any questions about this unit
or anything in general feel free to
leave it in a comment section down below
and I will see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
