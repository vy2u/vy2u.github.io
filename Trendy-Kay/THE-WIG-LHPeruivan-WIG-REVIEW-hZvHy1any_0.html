to me from Sam's Beauty so yeah I'm
going to be redoing this way that they
sent to me and this is from the wig this
is from the wig and it is the 100%
brazilian hair hair blend so it is a
blend with the deep invisible part and
it's the style LH peruvian so yeah and i
have this inner color be 27 so this is
what the picture looks like i'm pretty
sure some of you may have seen this unit
alright in there um I like I like this
line is this it's pretty okay I
definitely love the packaging that they
give you hold on as soon as I put this
tape this is what the hair comes in so I
actually I I like this week like this is
really really cute at first I thought I
wasn't really gonna like it that much
because when I tried it on I didn't have
any makeup or anything one like that so
it didn't really look bright but once I
put my makeup on and you know all that
jazz um the wig looks really nice like
it's a lot of hair and it's big the
color is really gorgeous um yeah I
haven't got any tangle in from this unit
um because you know I haven't really ran
my fingers through it or anything like
that but I'm as far as shutting this wig
does a little um a little there's a
lot of strains right here but um yeah I
did just cut the lace off so maybe it's
from me cutting the lace off so yeah um
this way does have two combs in the
front a comb and a bag and
adjustable straps now this is how the
wig will come when you get it I did not
do anything to this unit I didn't brush
the curls out or anything this is how it
will come the only thing I did do and I
didn't even um I didn't even pluck the
part or anything I just added some
powder to the part because the part was
okay I felt like it was okay and I
really didn't feel plucking out the part
so yeah I just added some powder into
the part so I'm actually debating on
whether I want to cut this unit because
it is a lot of hair but um I actually
like it like this is really really cute
I wish my lighting wouldn't mess up all
the time like come on but um this week
is not shiny at oh I don't know if my
camera is making the same like it's
shining this way is meant to be on a
side part but I didn't like it as a side
part so I just switched it to the middle
part but um if you wanted it to be a
side part which the way it comes like
that originally by all means just you
know put it on regular if you want to
middle part then just slide your leg
over a little bit and you have a middle
part you can also do like the flip over
method but I probably wouldn't suggest
that bans though um for the dark route
they only give you the dark route
towards the top area and see like it's
no dub route anyway I was so yeah you
probably will just have to use the UM
the parting space so yeah this unit is
probably around twenty four inches
stretched so overall I really really
love this unit um
be aware that it is a lot of hands so
you know if you're not
and if you're not a fan of a lot of hair
and big curly hair then I probably
wouldn't suggest this unit to you but
other than that like this is a gorgeous
gorgeous unit um I really like it I even
like it down to the color um I want to
see what this looks like in a one big
but I'm absolutely in love with this
color I think it's so cute it's like a
lot of hair like this is some short
enough photo shoot or going out hair
okay you guys this is it for this way

this gorgeous gorgeous hair if you have
any questions about this hair anything
