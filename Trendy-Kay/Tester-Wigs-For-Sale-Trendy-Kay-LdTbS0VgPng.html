this video is going to be a little
different because I'm just showing you
some wigs that I'm going to be into my
site just in case you guys are
interested so yeah let me give you the
full rundown of everything before you
decide to purchase these leads okay most
of you don't know that I am coming out
with my own wig line for cool so yeah it
is Charles in tribulation - opening up a
business and it has been a struggle let
me just tell you I have lost thousands
of ballots which I'm not a said because
when opening up a business - is one of
the things that you go through is losing
money so yeah but you know it is not
going to discourage me it hasn't
discouraged okay
online so I was a little sad about it
but this is something that I'm really
passionate about and I'm not going to
get up so yeah on to these wigs so some
ways I'm just going to call them test
the wigs is basically like these wigs I
designed myself and they were basically
made from scratch and when I got them it
was just some of them was just not it it
just didn't make the cut basically so
what I'm going to do to get some of my
money back is I'm going to put them on a
website I'm not going to put all the
leaves on the website because I'm only
putting the ones that I think a word
bond on my site so yeah but the rest are
going to go in the trash honey because
I'm not going to sell you something that
I wouldn't even wear the way that I'm
going now will be on my site and if you
follow me on snapchat things you've
already seen this week this is one of
the wings that's going to be on my site
now I don't really have an issue with
this week the only reason it didn't make
the cut is because the curls are not how
I wanted it to be as awareness I
actually really liked everything about
this with you guys so I know I'm it does
shed so that's something that I don't
like so keep that in mind before
purchasing this week it does share I'm
not going to lie and say oh this week
doesn't shed because it sheds now as far
as tangling it doesn't really tangle
that bad I do get snags here and there
but that's about it it is a slight
yankee texture what else is loose curls
and what I like about it is the curl
they're not really a uniform so I don't
know I just feel like this week it's
just really really natural now the part
in is really good this is what the party
looks like and I want to construction
for my wigs
are the same so this is another one
that's going to be on all my sites and
the reason that just didn't make the cut
is because of the color it was supposed
to be an orange color and it's more of
like a like a yellowish orange ish type
of color but this is my baby you guys of
both of these I really really like it's
just a few things that need to be
tweaked storm but other than it oh yeah
and it's part 1 plus so you guys need to
get these wings you are going to have to
plug the car like I said these wigs are
not perfect at all and for me when I
start my online I want
the wigs to be the best they can be I
don't want to sell your no bullcrap so
this is why I'm like being completely
honest with you guys and this is
basically why I didn't make the cut
because I feel like this is
not something that I want to put my name
on even though these are my babies right
here this and this was the better ones
out of all the wigs these were the
better ones let me go ahead and show you
the construction like I said the
construction for all of these wigs are
the same so they do come with the Swift
lace which is self but is very very very
durable and it is like really really
good with lay so if you wanted to pluck
your part you don't have to worry about
the least ripping because I've plus this
part this part did not come this wide I
did Plus this part and like I said
you're going to have to go in and flush
the part to the sweep the hairline they
made the headline really natural which I
can appreciate so this is what the
inside looks like and it comes with two
combs and don't worry about this is
hanging because I was in a practice of
taking the cones out because you're now
dealing with the cones in the front but
I did it comes to my legs because I know
not everybody is like me and a lot of
people do like the cones but if you
don't like homes you can do like I do
and just remove them so yeah it comes
with two cones in the front it comes
with a comb in the bank and adjustable
strength don't - lace is not really late
in the back so I don't know why that's
right dad but yeah it's released right
here that you have to cut off also I
love the cotton face because I feel like
if you didn't want your cut directly in
the middle the part in an area gives you
enough space to like fill parts within
that cup if you do understand because
it's so wide and that's something that I
really like about the construction but
yeah these two was not really bad and
that's why I'm putting them up on my
site but it's the heads work that needs
to be done to both of these weeks but
yeah this one right here is my favorite
and I'm going to put this on so I can
show you what it looks like
one I'm not home cause the late because
I am going to sell that's no actually
I'm not going to sell this and I'm
achieve it for myself but yeah I really
like this in both of these we are 22
inches long these are going to be on my
site for $25 so I'm going to be southern
these wigs well these two I'm going to
be having three different styles on my
site these two styles are going to be
$25 because like I said it's really
nothing wrong with the wigs but I
created the wigs and the way kind of
looked nothing like what I created you
doing said so to y'all it might not be
nothing wrong with the wings but to me
because I know how they're supposed to
look I have a problem with that you
doing saying so yeah but actually this
one is really growing on me like really
growing on me I feel like I'm going to
keep this one because I was going to
sell all of them and just don't even
keep this but actually I'm going to keep
this one because I actually really liked
it now that I'm wearing it and stuff
like that anyway this is what this wig
looks like an adult is not all the way
through it's only on a pardon area and
it's also on the side so you wanted it
to go behind your ear or if the wind
blow it's different right there so
that's something that I really like
about this wig now the shedding room
this one is not bad at all and the
tinglin is not bad either the only issue
I had with this one was the texture and
the color and this week is 22 inches
yeah I don't like all of this lace go
oh also the lace is light brown just in
case anybody was curious but this is
what the card looks like and like I said
the beginning of like the hairline they
made the hairline really natural
although we often see them
so yeah I really like this real I just
wish the color was a little bit darker
because I wanted it to be orange but it
still cute and is different I definitely
love the color ones it's like the color
has grown for me okay so for the next
one that will be on my site is going to
be this week and this is what's going to
train to but I feel like this week has a
little bit of potential so yeah um if I
can get it all so like I say all the
constructions for all the ways the same
it comes with the same type of
construction so that's what it looks
like and inside with the two cones and
everything then a wig is actually
supposed to be burning but to me is more
like a coppery tone is really not coming
out true to color on camera I don't know
why but is more of like a cinnamon it's
more of like a albarn coppery tone wig
and this week was supposed to be
Bernadine oh yeah also I don't really
like the ways that they had going on I
wanted two ways to be like more messy
and not and think in these I don't know
also this week tables a lot and I all
know this from it being long this week
is 26 inches also this week is silky I
wanted it to be Yankee and it's not it's
kind of silky side so yeah
this week was just really disappointing
to me but some of you highlight the curl
pattern going this me I don't like the
wave pattern on this but this is what it
looks like
and I'm just going to try on so you can
see but it looks like fun and also I did
go ahead and straighten this week so I'm
going to show you the potentials at at
hand I'm going to insert a clip just so
you can see it straightens also all of
these wigs are a heat-safe you can put
heat on these wait like I said this one
you see that part y'all when is it so
you're going to have to go in and pluck
the part also with this one I feel like
the carton is a little bit shorter than
the other ones it stops right here I
feel like it needs to like stop back
here some um so yeah this is what this
will look like I don't know I'm just
like I'm not feeling this wig whatsoever
and it is really really long but like I
said it has potential and I was playing
with it and that's the only reason I'm
adding it to my site but this one is
going to be or my fight for $15 oh yeah
and this is what it's looking like
brushed out
like I said also is shining you guys so
you might want to add your dry shampoos
or baby powder to this way to get the
shine out I feel like if you wanted to
cut this way you also can cut it and
that's probably why it's tangling
because it's synthetic it and it's super
freaking long so yeah but I mean you can
give it a try I'm just telling you
everything that's wrong because I don't
like this is this wig like I said it had
potential but for me this was not
acceptable friend what I designed this
was this was not it right here at all
it was nothing like how it's supposed to
look so yeah but I'm sure somebody can
find some use out of this or switch it
up a bit if you do decide to purchase
this week and you change the style of
this week please tag me on Instagram
because I'll really like to see what you
did with the tape so guys that's it for
this video if you guys have any
questions about any of these wigs feel
free to leave it in the comment sections
down below and like I said these weeks
have been headed to my site as of right
now so go ahead and check them out don't
put these waves on a pedestal or have
high expectations scissors wings like I
said these are tested with you guys so
they do have issues overall they are not
bad wigs with whatever it's just not
what I want it for my wig line so yeah I
hope you enjoyed this video and I will
see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
