Ridge this is from Friday night head and
it is the GLS 68 and I have it in a
color 1b so before I get started if you
are not a fan of big fan you might want
to exit this video because this wig is
so so full and so big so if you just
want to March this video just because
you love me then continue to watch but
if you're not a fan of BK and you really
don't love me too much then you can just
start watching because as you can see
this is a lot of hair so if some of you
are not familiar with Friday night hair
and the construction of their wigs um
they give you two cones in the front a
comb and a bag with adjustable straps
this week fits really good when my head
is really snug I do have my strips and
adjusted to its tightest I would say if
you had like a big head like I feel like
this week will be a little tight now I
know most of you get mad at me because I
never show you the process of me putting
on a wig and what the wait looks like
before I do what I do to it but actually
I just put this on my head this is I
promise you I did not do anything to
this week this is how the wig looks this
is how huge the way it comes straight
out of the package but yeah I just put
this on my head and this is what the wig
looks like just like this
I didn't pluck it out to make it this
vehicle thanks a GLX 15 and I'll spray
the mini camera curly-headed
incidentally I'm like truly in love with
this head is so big and bouncy it's
really soft I did not receive any
shedding and I did not receive any
tangling um just because I haven't ran
my fingers through it and I also don't
plan on aggression it or anything like
that
um but yeah no tangling no shedding I
wouldn't suggest that you brush this or
anything because it's so big and already
it always you need to do is like play
with it and wear the lace is these curls
are different from these curls these
curls actually look like the curls on
the GL eyes 15 unit but then when you
get to the back these curls I don't know
I can't explain it it's more like
stretchy and just more like fluffy and
bigger and these curls are more defined
if that makes any sense so I think
that's the difference between the this
unit and the GLS I'm 15 because with
these curls in the back it makes this
wig way bigger than GLS 15 y'all like
look at this this wig is really really
gorgeous play and this is a newer unit
from Friday night hair I think somebody
actually asked me to do a review on this
wig but yeah it's really not much to say
this is going to be a short yeah this is
what it looks like in the middle if
anybody was curious in yo like if she
drowned in my face that's how big this
is I also do like it in the middle but I
felt like I would have to like cut it to
frame my face um but I don't know if I'm
going to cut on this unit just because I
don't know I don't think I'm going to
cut one it
y'all know where I'm going with that
what I like most about these units is
the fact that these units last so long
like their curly units that look like
this last you a long time if you wanted
to pluck out the front to make the curls
kind of pushed out like the back see I
don't know if y'all can see that y'all
see how these curls are different from
these curls so if you didn't like that
you could pluck out I'm these curls the
curls in the back give it that full
effect and it makes it look really
really big you can definitely wear this
up yeah it's just like so many things
that you can do
so this is what the part looks like I'll
give it over you can see that but again
they give you like one and a half to two
inches we're applying space more on one
and a half but with the curly wigs the
part in space really doesn't bother me
the fact that it's a little on the short
side only because you can like flip this
over and you don't really have to use
Department though the is so much hair
that the part really doesn't matter so
make sure you check out the description
box for what's on my lips I will
definitely make sure I leave it in the
description box so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
