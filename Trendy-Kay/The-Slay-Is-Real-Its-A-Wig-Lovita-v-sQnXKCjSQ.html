review and this week was sent to me from
Sam's Beauty so I will make sure to
leave Sam's Beauty link in my
description box if you want to go check
them out or if you want to purchase this
unit just click on the link in my
description box this is the it's a wig
Swiss lace la Vida and I have her and
the color TT 27 if this wig is coming up
shiny it's my lighting because actually
is not really that shiny like it has a
shine to it but it's not as shiny as
what this light is making it the same so
when you receive the weight this is how
the wig will come it will come with two
comp two combs in the front on each side
of the parts and it also gives you combs
in the back while one comb in the back
with an adjustable strap and they do
give you the soft lace as well and they
give you this much part of space which i
think is um really good you will have to
go in and pluck out the parts because it
is kind of closed in i also took my flat
arms and i just flatten the parting area
because it was like extra humpy if that
makes any sense like you guys saw when I
put it one it looked crazy
um but yeah it was a bit on the happy
side so I just took my flat irons and
flattened it out and then I added my
powder all my finishing powder
underneath of the wig but I did go back
and put it on the part itself because it
wasn't showing up where I didn't pluck
the part it so yeah
this head does shed a little bit it
could be because I cut into the lace um
but it wasn't like OD shadow or nothing
like that and now it's not shouting at
all so I'm pretty sure it's because I
cut into the lace and it's far as
tingling like this week has not tangled
up on me yet I haven't got a snake of
anything um of course I'm pretty sure
that this wig will tangle so when they
say tangle free don't believe that
because number one this is synthetic
hair and number two all hair tangles
even human hair so you're going to get a
snag a tangle or something it's just not
going to be like you're just not going
to be able to run your hands to it as
time goes on so yeah um I think y'all
need to stop putting these for your
product
also this wig is not dope or throughout
they only give you a duct root um on the
top area and then once you get like down
here to the bottom it's all the 27 color
so yeah um that doesn't really bother me
because it's not like I'm laying the wig
like an up style or anything like that
so this part really covers it and you
don't you can't tell that the darker is
all the way through but honey in the
wind blow back I don't know ain't no
dirt right there on the side so I'm
turning to today if you don't like it
you can go in with a sharpie marker or
some hairspray some colored hairspray
and you can just fill in your own words
um if it bothers you that much but me
and wonder bother me too much
I'm definitely a really feeling this wig
I thought that it would have been more
Yankee than what it is if I'm looking
over here is because my mirror is right
here but I actually thought that this
week will be more Yankee
than what it is is more on a Sookie side
to me then Yankee it does has like a
slight slight slight um Yankee texture
and my opinion but it's definitely more
on the silky side they also give you the
law
the layers in the front which I think
are really nice I kind of wished that
the latest was a little bit shorter in
the front but it's still cute and also
the the sides are even like both sides
flip back and you know like I'm picky
about stuff like that
and that's one thing that I do like
about this week is that both of the
sides flip back this style is really
good but then my right side you really
have to work with it but once you work
with it it leaves it leaves like the
other side so this is me styling the wig
after I've already flattened the part
and spaced out with my flat iron and
plucked my part a little bit edit my
finishing powder into my part so now I'm
just styling awake the way I wanted to
look and I'm just taking my vent brush
and brushing the curls in like away from
my face basically so yeah
so this is the end results and I
actually really like this
um I actually really like this week I
did have to go back and my part because
as you saw I added the powder underneath
but it only showed up right here where I
put the part so I had to go back in and
add some right here I also placed it
behind my hairline and just like a
little bit so it can blend in that you
will need to pluck this part like
there's no way around it like you have
to pluck this putt you can't just add
powder I mean you can add powder but you
can definitely tell what I plug I mean
hmm I guess it's okay it looks good in
the camera but um the one thing I hate
about this wig is the fact that it has a
soft lace because for some reason every
time I go to pluck my parts it always
rips I don't know if I'm like
heavy-handed away every time I have a
wig that soft lace and I go to pluck the
part it rips on me so I just stop
because I have ripped a little hole in
it you can't really tell um but I didn't
want to take no more chances because I
actually really do like this without
that you can wear this every day um it's
definitely a bomb it is a very thick
unit it is not like overly thick but
it's definitely a good density it's a
it's a nice amount of hair it's not thin
at all but I'm just loving this left
look at this live I love way it falls on
me
so if you have any questions feel free
to leave them in my comment section down
below and I will be sure to answer your
questions and I will see you guys in my
next video
watch me take my future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
