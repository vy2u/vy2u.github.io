I'm back with another video and this
video is gonna be on this head so this
week was sent to me from a company
called Annalise
hair and wigs so this is what the
packaging looks like um
this company is freakin amazing okay the
they are based out of Nigeria so this
frickin way came all the way from
Nigeria so before I start talking about
them let me just give you a little you
know description of the week so they
sent me there I know the length is like
waist length is a custom lace front is a
custom lace front braided wig I have it
in the sides medium or large I can't
remember if it's the large braids or the
medium that I picked I think is I think
it's large so this is a custom wig
meaning they do everything by hand so
yeah they made this way for me and
basically it's like how you make your
typical typical like frontal wigs
basically the front is like a frontal
and that's braided and then the back is
like Animesh type of cap and they sewn
like braids on to the mesh cap which is
really neat I like the way they
constructed this week it also gives you
an elastic band in the back and I did
have to go in and just Jo the lace down
with my got to be glued hairspray
because that was the only way it was
really gonna look right actually no and
kind if your head is bigger than mine
then I felt like the elastic band would
have worked with what it worked for you
without using any type of method the
glue to lace down my bins on my
it's small I had to use that sort of
lace what laid flat to my head but if
you do have a bigger sized head I feel
like you wouldn't even need to go
through those steps so anyway this is
basically what the wig looks like you
guys and let's just take a moment to
embrace all of this goodness like do you
don't see this wig I don't really think
the choice see like y'all see this wig
look how good this week looks y'all this
is sick these wigs are custom made so it
did take a little bit of time to get to
me I wouldn't say more than more than
three to four weeks I can't really
remember but I know it took a while for
it to come to me and remember it's
coming all the way from Nigeria so yeah
it did take shipping did take a while or
probably not shipping but the processing
time for them to make the wig it took oh
wow so let me get in close just so y'all
can see kind of like the construction so
this is how much lace you get and that's
basically like the frontal part so I can
tell that this is like graded by hand
also this we came with baby hands the
baby his was extra long so I did have to
cut them down the nuts was bleached as
well so I didn't have to bleach the
knots like everything this is just like
it looks so good yo they do offer a
variety of braided wigs your choice are
small large medium micro braids they
offer a lot of rates so inside of the
box the we came in this little bag and
it just has their company name on it and
this is what it looks like
so yeah
okay one thing I have to let you know is
that the hair when I got it it smelled
like kind of like a head like a smell
not like a real bad smell but it kind of
smelled like wood like fresh wood it
smelled like so yeah keep that in mind
but I sprayed it with perfume and it
didn't work like you can still smell the
wood small but it's not really bad the
only con I would say is that the hair
that they breathe it is not the same
size as the hair in the back you see
these braids are much smaller than these
braids right here it is a size
difference but once it's all together
like it doesn't look bad and that was
something I was nervous about when I
first got it out of the package and
looked at it I'm like oh my gosh like
the braids are not the same sides all
the way through but once I put it on and
fixed it up it looks really nice so if I
can give my advice one thing I would say
it's just to make the braids all the
same size all the way around so like if
you were gonna use these braids in a bag
I feel like the braid that you braid it
and a front should have just been a
little bit more smaller to match this or
vice versa but other than that like I'm
very pleased with this unit I really
love this unit it's like my favorite
braided unit ever it looks so natural
everybody thinks that I got my hair
braided yeah like it's it's official
yard this crap really looks good so yeah
overall I really loved this company if
you're interested in this
I'll leave all the links in my
description box just in case you want to
check it out but yeah y'all don't sleep
on it so I saw you guys coming live from
Kay's car I had to film the rest of the
video in my car because I left out a
point I mean I left out important part
and that is the highly requested
question are these or oh now are but is
this wig heavy or the braids heavy on my
head and actually the braids are pretty
there okay like I'm not gonna sit up
there and be like oh no they're not
heavy like it definitely feels like
something's on your head but it doesn't
feel like annoyin and like you want to
take the wig off basically so it is a
bit of weight you can feel away but it's
not like OD heavy or nothing like that
but you can definitely tell it's and
stuff on your head okay but as far as
there being like super heavy on your
head and uncomfortable no I did not get
this from this wig at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
