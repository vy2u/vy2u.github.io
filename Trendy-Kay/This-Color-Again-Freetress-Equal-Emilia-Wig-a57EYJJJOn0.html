so I'm back with another wig Rivera so I
would sit this way from sister wigs and
this is the free trust equal premium
deluxe lace front wig and I have it in
the style Emilia and the color is SP nut
brown I'm so mad that I picked this wig
out not just not because of like the wig
itself but only because of the color I
wish I would have picked this out in a
different color but at the time I didn't
know so yeah we're just gonna roll with
it
but I'm pretty sure some people out
there that likes this color but this
y'all know this color is just not for me
but yeah anyway all the information will
be in my description box as well as like
links to this wig if you want to
purchase it and everything like that
now the wig itself I love the way it is
some cons that I don't really like one
con band that the lids in the front like
it doesn't really frame your face so
this is why I had the wig the part on
the side because um the weight does come
with the part in the middle and I wish I
had like the card to show you what the
model looks like but I must have
misplaced it because it's not in the box
looks much better as a side part but
yeah that's one con that I don't like
about this wig um another con it might
be like it's probably not a con to other
people um but another con about this wig
is the fact that has soft fleece I'm not
really a fan of soft lace even though
it's laying down pretty good but I'd
rather have the hot lace that's not
really a con is more of like a
preference type thing so yeah um if
you're not a fan of soft lace then
you're probably not going to like this
week but they do give you a good amount
of space this kit fits me perfectly so
if you have like a larger size head I
probably wouldn't recommend this unit to
you this wig is a little shiny it's not
like really shiny but I felt like it
could be a problem for some people so if
you wanted to put
your baby powder or dry shampoo - this
way you can it's not like really really
like a really bad shine but it
definitely gives up a little shine also
this week is a slight Yankee texture
which I really really like I really like
the texture of this wig I feel like if
this week was this color all the way
through like this would be a bomb wig
like I need somebody to make a wig
that's like this color it's like kind of
like a Riddick Brown type of chocolate
brown color I don't know I can't explain
it but it looks really really good now
for the length this length is probably
around 22 inches long so here depending
on how tall you are and hit you
differently but I'm five five so it hits
me like just above my belly button yeah
oh I don't have any complaints about
this unit I my main concern it's just
the color so yeah I'm just not really a
fan of this color but as far as like the
wig and everything it's really cute I
definitely love these premium deluxe
wigs by free trust equal this is how the
weight will come straight out the
package I didn't do anything to this wig
I did finger comb the curls but
basically the curls will look like this
I did cut off the lace and I did not
pluck my part but so ever because I felt
like you can get away without plucking
apart and you can just add your powder
onto the part now I did add any powder
to the part and I don't have any of my
hair out just because I'm trying to make
these videos pretty quick and the reason
that the sculpt is like this color is
because I have a new stocking cap under
here so just in case you don't want to
add anything to your part like concealer
or powder you definitely can put like a
nude stocking cap on and it will look
really natural the only thing about
wearing a new stocking cap on
the wigs is sometimes like when you put
your weight on the staff and cap might
slide back so some of this will be like
a darker lace color now this week does
do a little bit of shutting but it's not
bad at all keep in mind with the longer
units you are bound to get tingling
right now I have not received any
tingling from this wig at all
so let's it for this video if you guys
have any questions about this unit or
anything feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below
I will make sure I leave everything um
in my description box like this far as
links to Zweig and stuff like that so
yeah um that's if my video you guys have
a wonderful day or night I don't know
when I'm gonna post this video but yeah
talk to you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
