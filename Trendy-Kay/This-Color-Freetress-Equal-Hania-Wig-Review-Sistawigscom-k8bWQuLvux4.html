all the information we often find it
because this Des Moines yo this is the
one so anyway um I would sit this way
from sister wings a column I'm sorry I
was sent this way from sister wing
Stockholm so make sure you check out the
link I will leave it in my description
box this week is features equals less
deep invincible L part and the style
name is Hannah and I had this in a color
530 so this is what the picture looks
like okay as far as construction is
concerned this week has two combs in the
front or comb in the back with
adjustable straps uh this wig is
big-headed friendly so yeah I think if
you have a bigger or normal to bigger
sized head then you'll be follow this is
like a little nice bub cut now um as you
can see in the picture that I just
showed you it didn't have like this bang
it did have like a little part that was
kind of like swooped a little bit but it
was like a miniature like it was just
like a little piece of hair that swooped
I don't know I just wasn't feeling the
front so I decided to cut it um to make
it look like this I did kind of flat on
it to give it a bump and it lost some of
its Yankee texture you can so that's one
thing I really don't really like about
it is um when you do put heat on it um
the text the texture of the wig will
change by me it still looks good if you
ask me so yeah as far as shutting
entangling this week has shed a little
bit but it hasn't been anything serious
and that's probably from me like cutting
on this unit but as far as like Tanglin
I have not gotten any tangling from the
shooter oh like no tangling which so
ever
since one of the wigs that will last you
long because it is a shorter wig so
right now I just love everything about
this wig I love the color I love the
length I love the texture of this unit I
love how thick it is without it being
too like much hair like I can't explain
it but it's like really nice um one
thing I don't like on this side they do
give you like a little bit of hair I
gots the feather over like that but I
don't really like it like that so I just
kind of do like that what else can I say
about this year if you have not heard of
this way if you have not purchased this
wig like you need to get it because this
wig is everything now I will say when I
first put it on I was like I don't
really know but like once I like work
with it and stuff like that and like cut
the bag how I wanted it to be like this
wig is everything to me as far as the
pardon the party is going point they do
give you a long part and the part it's
also all lace um and they do give you
lace around the perimeter so that's
always a good thing um yeah I don't know
you're like this color is like giving me
so much life like so um yeah again I
receive this our unit from sister wigs

everything in my description box down
below so check their site out I will
