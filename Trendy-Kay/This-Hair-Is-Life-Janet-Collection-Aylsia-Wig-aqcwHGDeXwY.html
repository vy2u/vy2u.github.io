review and yo I'm in love like this is
definitely stepping outside of the box
this is the genic collection Brazilian
cent lace wig and the style name is
Alyssa and I had it in a color grey
brown and this is what the card looks
like because I'm pretty sure a lot of
you won't like this color
but the wig itself is like gorgeous and
it's like such a great lympha everyday
jung-bae a definitely on point when it
comes to these colors with these wigs I
just cannot get over this maybe he's on
my planet one side of my face so this
week was sent to me from head to
beauty.com so I will make sure I leave
all of their links in the description
box down below so y'all can check out
their website and order this wig if you
have not already because wig I'm telling
you go get it because you will be mad
when you try to wait and then you go
online and it's sold out so why not just
go online and get it now so you won't
have to worry about waiting when it's
also now saying oh my gosh I should
order that weight like or right now I'm
not even mind doesn't have to be this
color even though this color is poppin
but like girl whoa okay so let me stop
okay I can't with myself because color
is doing something to me you're alright
I missed out all right so this week
comes with two cones in the front
adjustable straps I will say that this
wig fits really really big so if you
have a larger size head here you go
right here because this wig fits so big
um I even had my my strips adjusted
tight and his wig still fits very big I
would say very big but it still fits big
but that's neither here or there because
I'm so in love with this wig that it
doesn't even matter when you get this
wig out of the package the way it comes
exactly like this basically um the curls
are more for me so I didn't brush it I
just ran my fingers through a little bit
and this is what it looks like now this
week is kind of on the Yankee side it's
full but it's not really full it's like
in the middle way is not too thick but
it's not too thin either it's just right
it's definitely been shedding more than
I want it to that's one problem I'm
having is the shedding
as far as tangling I haven't received
any tangle in yet but shedding is
something to worry about and I'm trying
to think like that I cut it in a
headline but I really didn't cut these
baby hairs on this week looks so natural
and it was just popping so I had to
leave morning so that's another reason
why I think that this week is just
shutting when it's on and it has nothing
to do with me cutting off the lace
because I didn't even cut in the lace if
anything um I left more lace on my unit
this of course I plucked um the part but
if you're not a plucking you don't like
plucking your parts um you can
definitely get away with just wearing
this wig without the plug women without
the plug without the part being plucked
and you can just add your concealer or
powder to your part but yeah I pluck
this part and I put a little bit of
powder into the part and I feel like it
came out really good like that looks
good you guys it looks so realistic now
they do have duck words but they don't
give you duffer's all the way through
now it's mostly all the way through I
think like on a bottle bottom layer they
didn't at the dark root but all up here
is darker y'all like this wig is so bomb
it's crazy
this color is like a good combination
when I seen this color first of all like
the wig itself is so beautiful when I
saw the wig before I even saw the colors
that they had available for this year I
was like oh my gosh I gotta get this
week because I mean the way it looks and
then the length was just perfect it was
like a bright room point so I was like
okay I'm gonna get this wig and then
when I seen the color and I saw this
color I was like mmm but then I was like
it's different and I just like these two
colors paired together and then they had
the dog were to go if I was like stop so
then when I had a beauty reached out to
me and he wanted me to do a review
I was kinda hidden just send me this
week okay let me just wait in this gray
brown like I can't get over it I'm just
like filling myself a little bit too
much but it's cool yo
so I don't think I really have anything
else to say about this wig if you have
any questions feel free to leave it in
my comment section down below and I will
leave links to head of beauty in my
description box it's like their color
selection was on point
who ever like thought of this Yuda
I just want you to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
