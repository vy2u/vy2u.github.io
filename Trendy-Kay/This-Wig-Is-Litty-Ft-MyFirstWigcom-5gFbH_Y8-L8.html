she liked oppression see that I didn't
make a cookie melt when I met him it
love i acttally stop and she went it
with their booty on their Gucci belt hey
guys welcome back to my channel so I was
sent this week from my first weeks and
this is what the packaging looks like
and it comes with a cosmetic bag and
inside the cosmetic bag was a new
stocking cap also instruction manual a
rat tail comb some bobby pins two clips
in a elastic band and it also came with
a wig thing and of course it came with
the wig inside of this nice bag okay so
this is the Valentine's Malaysian ombre
hair boldly front wig and the sound
number is LSW 0:07 and like always I'll
leave everything in my description box
just in case you guys miss anything
the hair color is same as pizza which is
number two at the root and then of 5d
which is basically like a dark blonde
color almost like a brownish caramel
color and then the limp is 14 inches the
texture is Yankee which I love the
texture of this week so if you like so
if you like Yankee texture twigs
definitely check out this week because
like it's really good the lace color is
a light brown the cap size is a size one
which really fits my head good basically
and just give you lace in the front from
ear to ear and then lace from the
headline on back some companies are sent
you will say lace and only give you this
much lace to work with but as you can
see this lace goes all the way back so
you put can be nice and deep and I
definitely love how much lace they
provide us so I have not received any
Tanglin nor did I receive shedding from
this week so that is this thing I also
did not watch this unit I felt like the
wave was bomb straight out the tank only
thing I needed to do was
straight in the head yeah if you are new
to wig definitely check this site out
because I think it will be a very
helpful I'm the only thing you really
have to do is cut off the lease and of
course everybody should be able to cut
off the lease but yeah and normally for
most of my wage I have to go in like the
pardon face and kind of take my Flatiron
just to flatten it so it won't get
through that humpy effect and actually
it's laying down pretty good I didn't
have to use my flat on to flatten apart
up areas underneath the hair my hair is
just like slicked in a ponytail so yeah
I just have a cut in the middle and my
head just slipped back into a ponytail
and I just flipped my ponytail up bobby
pinned it down to my head and put my
stocking cap on so it will be a little
slack now if you do see like some time
that you going on a bank it's only
because you know my hair is not Landis
laid down but I still say for my head
not to be braided flat down this week
still has given me so much life it just
looks really really natural so basically
this is the final look and this is what
it turned out also I don't know if I
mentioned density or not and I don't
need to know is it's has anything about
density on here but for above the
density is like really good is like has
a nice fullness and thickness but it's
not too thick and it's definitely not
thin it all but it still looks very
natural so yeah I love love the density
on here I don't really know how the back
is looking but i'ma turn around so you
guys can see the balls um you know
turned around and stuff like that so
yeah
we'll little DRC that bruise look at
that you look at my fingers this looks
like a working man's fingers this is
disgusting so basically I set my finger
in the door and it hurts so bad you guys
so all night I was basically up in our
cousin go to sleep because the pain was
just so excruciating
so y'all if anybody know is my nail
won't fall off or it might won't be okay
I'm also for the pain the other thing I
need to take like some common oil or
something in this won't go away oh do I
need to put like some icy hot on it or
like a heating pad with some ice like
let me know y'all cuz I'm really having
a difficult time sleeping at night way I
hope I didn't miss anything if you guys
have any questions feel free to leave it
in the description box again
I meant leave it in the comment section
and as I had at all the details to this
way time so time card day all the
details to this way will be listed in my
description box so yeah it's your first
time wig wears or anything like that
definitely check out the site because
they definitely have some bomb wings and
I think that you can invest in these
wigs I think that is definitely legit
and it definitely is easy and you don't
have to go out to buy the supplies to
try to get your way to fit your head I
mean everything already comes with it so
that's definitely a plus but yeah guys
that's the end of this video if you have
any questions feel free to leave them in
the comment section below and yes y'all
I love you guys and I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
