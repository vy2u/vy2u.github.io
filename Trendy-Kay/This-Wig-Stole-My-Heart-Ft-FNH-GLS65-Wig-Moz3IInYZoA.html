fashion this is not a plague or ain't no
fish fight bitch I'm blasting city
looking for me like I'm not right here
man
if I tell tears I mean right to my
kitchen
 ability suffered 13 years I've been
okay guys it's K of course and I'm back
with another week review so this week
was sent to me from Friday night here
and this is the GLS 65 and I have it in
a color one lead so this is what it
looks like of course it's not like a
model wind wave or anything but you
can't even see it so I don't even know
why I'm showing it but yes if you're not
familiar with Friday night head
basically they so synthetic lace wigs
they also so human hair but nobody
really gets to humiliate wigs so I was a
little if he won't get in this week
because it is a shorter style wig but
I've seen a potential in it so I'm like
it can't be too big like I know it can't
be too bad like I'm pretty sure that I
can work with this week so I'm really
happy that I picked this weed out
because I actually really loved it and
everything I was thinking in my head is
how the weed came out to be so yeah
straight off the package I'm gonna
insert clips and everything of how I got
to this point but as you can see like
straight out the package this week was
bum if you even wanted to wear it on the
side like born over to the side I think
that that will be really cute even in
the middle when I was playing around
with it it's still look cute like the
curls are really really really pretty
like this week it's really nice and full
and it just really looks natural now one
thing I did notice is the curls really
tangled a lot so it was kind of hard to
finger comb because the curls was a bit
tingly
as far as shed him I did not get any
shut in from this week but I did get
like snakes as
finger Coleman the hair and even when I
was brushing it it was kind of hard to
brush it without it gets nape so yeah
and that was mainly like the back area
but up here it was fine
so yeah just keep that in mind but I did
go ahead and cut the front but like I
said you'll see all of that because I'm
gonna insert a clip so yeah let me stop
talking so y'all can see what this week
is all about honey and then I'll come
back
you
well yeah I'm just going to turn around
real quick so you guys can see the back
also another thing before I go before I
come down this week this week was a
little moonshine aside like I always say
my videos if you're trying to get rid of
the shine you can always add dry shampoo
you can always add dry shampoo or baby
powder to like dog down the widow get
rid of the shine but as I out the curls
it definitely dulled itself out and it's
not as shiny as it was before
I definitely feel like now it's more of
a natural type of shine and it doesn't
look fake by fall okay this week really
looks good I just can't hold on if
you're wondering what's on my lips it's
limbo and the shirt I'm wearing because
I know I'm gonna get a lot of questions
and my shirt also from forever 21
this shirt is sold out but if I find a
link I'll still link it because they
might come back in stock so I'm not
gonna make this video very long or
anything like that because the week it
speaks for itself honey like this wig is
a lid okay you guys like I'm definitely
getting some vibes from this week don't
know what vibes it is but I'm getting
all kind of goodness okay
goodness vibes so um yeah if you
interested in this week check out my
description box for all the links to
this week and Friday night hair and yeah
that's basically it I hoped you guys
liked this video and I will see you in
