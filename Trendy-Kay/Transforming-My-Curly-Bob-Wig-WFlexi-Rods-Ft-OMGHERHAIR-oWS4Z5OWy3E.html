with a another video and this video is
going to be on this hair so this hair
was of course sent to me from oMG her
hair this is what the packaging looks
like and actually they changed their
packaging I don't think it used to be
this color I have to go back and look at
my videos we'll try to find that old
package but I do believe that they
change their packages so yeah and inside
of the box
you know what the week was packed in and
what a bag it just has all the week
details they give you a stocking cap
they give you an elastic band they also
give you two clips a comb which I love
the fact that they give our combs
because I swear I'm always missing my
combs so the name of this wig is the
fashion curly police wig and the hair
type is 100% human hair the headline is
pre plucked which you're the headline on
this week it's serious yo the hair
length is 14 inches which this is a bulb
the hair density is 180 percent which I
could believe it I definitely can
believe that the texture is this says
fashion curly I don't know what that
means but it's curly it's not like real
real Carly I'll insert a clip so you can
see what the wig look like originally
the hair color is natural black the cap
construction is glueless lace front wig
it has four cones and adjustable straps
at the back the lace color is medium
brown wig sizes average
is a 22 inch circumference and yeah
that's basically it
of course everybody loves bugs and you
can't go wrong good for Bob but I don't
know I just was not for the Curley
looking buck this time even though this
is still like a curly look but it's just
different than just how the week came
originally so yeah how the way came
originally looks really pretty I love
the curls it is a very full so I'm gonna
go ahead and insert a clip of how the
week look when I received it straight
out the pack now when I received this
week straight out the pack this hair is
very thick I do like the curl pattern is
not really too curly like overly curly
is kind of like a wave curl in a sense I
don't know but I I don't know I just
wanted to switch it up so I decided to
flex erode it be flat flexing realized
this hair I did go ahead and Co watch
the head and that's just basically
washing a head with conditioner so I did
that and I actually let the hair a drive
because I was planning on when this hair
in its natural state but then I was like
boring I really don't want to do that so
the clip that you're seeing is actually
the hair washed and a dried so this is
actually what the curls will look like I
kind of like finger combed it a little
bit but that's basically what the curls
will look like in its natural state and
that's actually how the way it came when
I got it so the curls are exactly the
same so yeah I don't know I really just
wasn't feeling it the wig itself is very
pretty but I was like let me do
something different so I went ahead and
flexi rod I went ahead and flexi rod it
to hair and basically you can get flexi
rods from your local beauty supply store
and they're like depending on the sides
I think that if you get them bigger than
there
expensive the smaller ones are a little
bit cheaper so it just all depends on
what size you get I do believe I haven't
bought flexi rods in a while you guys so
I really don't know so when I removed
the flexi rods they still were a little
damp but it really doesn't matter the
only thing that messes you up when
they're damp is the curls kind of become
frizzy but I wanted kind of wanted that
look anyway I didn't want the curls to
be too uniformed anyway but yeah if you
don't like that frizziness you're gonna
want to let your you're gonna want to
let the curls set and make sure they dry
all the way through so yeah I took it
out and as you can see y'all I was
struggling on styling it it was just
something was off like I just didn't
like the way and look I really really
loved the way it turned out now
basically I didn't do much to this week
the only thing I too was pin the front
up so it's not it looks like it's in a
ponytail but it's really not I just took
a bobby pins and kind of like pendant
like that and I left I left some pieces
out in the front he ought to see this I
did not pluck the hair line with so ever
it literally came like this you guys it
looks so so so so natural like literally
y'all probably would think that this is
my hair if I never told y'all that this
was a week this is how that's how real
this hair looks I'm feeling this because
at first y'all when I tell y'all I was
struggling like a legit was struggling
trying to style this head and then
something was like something came to me
it's almost like just pin the front up
and leave you know like a little baggage
going on and it turned out cute but
anyway let me stop when it comes to an
OG Queen and on
her hair like I absolutely stand by
these companies like their hair is legit
really really good so as far as tangling
and shedding I did not get any any any
tangling from his hair shut it on the
other hand I did get a few strands of
hair but the shedding was not bad at all
um and it shedding took place when Aiko
washed it and you know brushed
everything through I did get probably
like three strands of hair which is not
bad at all after that I have not I still
have not received any shedding after I
washed it that's pretty much it for this
video I'm not really gonna make this too
long I'm just here to inspire you guys
so yeah I hope that I inspired somebody
with this video this is definitely
definitely a look it's really cute
simple and the looks like your hair
I just can't get over how natural this
hold on let me just show you how natural
this freakin hairline looks like are
y'all seeing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
