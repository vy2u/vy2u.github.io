with a another video and this video is a
little different as you can see I'm
coming on camera with my hair slicked
two goats okay I'm gonna be trying out
this and bagging this two and one it's
like a ponytail and it comes with a bang
so I would sent this from Sammy's beauty
and this actually just came out this is
five model model and when I seen it I
was like ok I can do this and especially
because I wanted to start bringing your
more content as far as like doing
different things with my hair and I know
some people do get tired of the wigs and
they wanna you know do other things with
their hair so I thought this will be
really neat to try out also I have this
in a color OT 5:30 and the style is
Yankee straight so this is what it looks
like so I'm gonna be showing you two
styles I was sent this from Sam's Beauty
and then this just recently came out as
well and this is by free trust equal and
this is a bun in China bang and I put
this myself and if you're interested in
any of these items I will leave the
links in the description box but yea
this is a bun and bang and the other one
it's like a ponytail in a bag
okay so when you get it out the pack is
gonna look like this so yeah I've never
wore a fake ponytail in my life you guys
so I'm just like curious to see I don't
know they always look kind of fake to me
I definitely love this color though I
don't know how to smoke it was just fit
but we bought the see alright yeah
so like me I'm sorry I didn't show you
guys me put my hands
ponytail because it's pretty simple and
everybody should know how to put their
hair in a high ponytail but yeah I'm
starting off with a pony town so this is
what the bang looks like and it has
three clips I don't know if I'm going to
use these two down here because it's too
close to my edges but I am gonna use the
clips in the top so like right there cuz
I feel like if I need to go in and cut
then I can do it and I'm just want to
school up so I can see myself in this
mirror okay look at that already up
alright
okay so this is what the ponytail looks
like and it just has the little
drawstring which I'm guessing you kind
of like just stuff the drawstring inside
like I said I don't know I never wore
ponytail before so
do you tuck the drill string in I feel
like it's not will you tuck in okay we
won't finesse it okay so this is what it
looks like
and it's cute or whatever but I'm just
like I feel like the ponytail itself
looks very fake yeah I feel like this is
cute or whatever I mean if you like this
type of style definitely go for it but I
don't know I just feel like I feel like
this pony is looking kind of phony all
right guys so I'm more of a fake button
type of girl I mean I never wore fake
bun before but I would think that it
looks more natural than a ponytail I'm
guessing I don't know but I feel like I
would like this more if it was a
ponytail
I met a button and I feel like it's
looking way better as a button so I'm
going to get my bobby pin
okay so okay so I wish that I actually
wish that this color came in our color
because I'm in another style because
this style only comes with what am I
saying I don't even know if I'm more
like it but I feel like I'm alike it
because it's a bun and a bang and not a
ponytail I don't know for some reason in
my opinion like the ponytail is just
don't look real to me I mean I don't
know it don't matter to some people but
that matters to me with our way of
ponytail so yeah alright so I wish that
this color came in this style because
this is boom this color is everything so
let me put my earring here so I probably
hit like hell
so the see was popping this this
necklace and earrings come from pretty
little things yo and this is like my
favorite necklace and earrings I never
wore together but I was just looking at
it like it's pretty much the same for
yes okay so I definitely love this I
know I'm gonna love the next look so
yeah I'll be late let's see alright this
one comes in a small box again this one
is the 2-piece this is the bun in China
bang it's called swirl bun bang I have
it in a color number two and this is by
free trust equal so it comes with the
bang and then it comes with the bun and
the bun is like a little swirl type
thing again it looks exactly like the
first bang and I'm not going to use the
two on it and because that's just like
too close to my edges so I'm just going
to use the
top comb right here and now this bang
scenes this bang seems shorter than
other day
and again I'm just gonna go in and like
cut it so I'm gonna do this off camera
because I already did the last one on
camera so yeah I'll be back
so like the ponytail this also comes
with in a little drawstring type of
thing oh my gosh it's like a cocoon in
the inside so it's pretty hard and
inside it also has two combs and an
inside Oda the ponytail had two combs
and inside sue I didn't mention that
y'all I'm really not gonna use the combs
because you know I might now I don't
know we'll see yes all right
okay oh this is crazy I had fun with
this you guys if you like this video
make sure you thumbs it up and if you
want more videos like this like for like
different styles for your hair
definitely leave it in a comment section
down below and tell me what you think a
which should look did you like that it
did you like the bang and ponytail or do
like the the bun and a bang I would
really like to know my fav will have to
be this one of course I just felt like I
knew like that I was gonna like this one
so much more only because it just looks
more natural like the bun to me just
looks more natural yeah okay oh I don't
know if I mentioned also the bun piece
is a bit shiny
um the bang is fun but the bun piece
itself is a little on the shiny side you
can't really tell but it's a bit what a
shiny side so I wouldn't take like some
dry shampoo or something like that but
look at this you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
