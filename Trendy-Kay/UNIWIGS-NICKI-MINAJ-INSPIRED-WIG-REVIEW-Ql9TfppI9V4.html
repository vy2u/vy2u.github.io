review and this is the way that I'm
currently wet on my head it is like so
gorgeous but so low at the same time so
this is a human head unit it is not
synthetic and for everybody who has been
patiently waiting for me to you know do
my synthetic units stay tuned because I
have so many units to share with you
guys I'm just trying to get like these
human head units from these companies
just out the way and yeah so I did not
forget about all my synthetic weight
lovers so this video will be for all you
ladies who love the version hair and
things like that and my battery who
wants to go dead every time I start a
video but anyway let's hurry up and get
into this video because I don't want it
to be too long this unit is from uni
wigs and I have did I did do a review
one away from uni uni weights but it was
a synthetic wig and I didn't really like
that way too much it was like the great
ombre wig so they sent me another week
to review and this is the nicki minaj
wave remy human hair ombre color lace
wig so this is what it looks like
and this is not how the weight came so
I'll quickly just show you how the
weight came originally
okay so yeah that's basically how the we
came and all I did was just add a couple
curls in the front area and that was it
I didn't I left the same curls in the
back I just wanted to it to be a little
more flattering around my face so yeah
I'm so like I was saying this is the
Nicki Minaj wig and the construction of
this wig is glueless Feliz so it is
laced all throughout the unit and the
cap size is petite because you guys know
I have a really small head and I still
even though it's petite I still adjusted
my straps and it fits towards he like
it's so perfect the density of this unit
is 150 percent and the length is 24 I'm
24 inches we is on the pricey side so if
you are willing to splurge then by all
means splurge on this wig honey okay so
when you receive your unit it will come
in the standard unit weights box that
looks like this and it's just a simple
cute box and um when you get your wig
you will receive whoa the weight comes
in this and has this stuffed inside of
it and it has tissue paper but it has
the tank with the style number which is
CL 0 4 9 7 so yeah um
right and it comes with the brushes they
always been which I'm not really a fan
of because they've got some loop things
over like this um it also comes with a
color wheel so yeah I thought that was
really neat and it comes with a weaving
cap and it also comes with another
weaving cap the other one was in black
this one is in nude and it also comes
with weights looks like if you was to if
you wanted more weight clips in your
unit so yeah so yeah I would really use
the comb so it's no point of me I'm at
mu comes in here and it's five combs
total with adjustable straps and this
unit is two right here then there's two
runners side back here and then it's one
in the back with adjustable straps so if
you love combs this will be a good unit
for you because it has a lot of combs
you guys last week does not do any
shut-in I haven't received any type of
shedding from this unit as far as
Tanglin I have not received any tangles
at all alike and the way that this unit
feels is so soft and silky and it's like
butter you guys like this unit is so so
so so so so I'm very very impressed with
this unit versus the great hombre
unit that I reviewed for them previously
so yeah like I said this unit is on a
pricey side so just be aware if you're
not really trying to spend that much
money on it wait smell like I don't know
what they did to this unit but it smells
so good you guys like like the smell is
ridiculous like it smells really really
good so let me just show you what this
unit looks like
so
you can put this unit wherever you want
to I'm just a middle part person so I
prefer to have my part in the middle but
this wig is like so late it looks really
really good as you guys as far as the
color though I don't think I will be
rocking this color because it's just
really really really blond what the wig
looks like and this week was this week
is from uni weights calm so if you are
interested in this unit
I will make sure I leave everything in
my description box down below and the
links to this company and if you have
