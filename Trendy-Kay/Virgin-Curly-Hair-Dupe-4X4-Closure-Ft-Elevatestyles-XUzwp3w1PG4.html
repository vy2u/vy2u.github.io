with another video so this video is
going to be on this hair and I would sit
this hair from elevated style so just in
case you're interested I'll go here and
leave all the links in the description
box so you can check it out so yeah okay
so move it along to this hair oMG this
is a lot of hey guys I'm definitely I
really really like this week so yeah the
construction so this gives you a full
bar for pardon which is like from here
to here and it just gives you the option
to apart the wig wherever you want
within that that late space that they
give you so just in case you wanted to
part it on the side either side left or
right you can and if you wanted the part
in the middle you can definitely part it
in the middle on the stock card it shows
this model when in the middle and then
the other model when it on the side this
way comes with two combs in the front a
comb in the back and adjustable straps
this week is big kid-friendly this is
what it looks like
obviously this is a lot of hair so just
in case you're not in two weeks with
like a lot of hair or be curly hair wigs
this probably is not going to be for you
but if you are into weights like this
you'll definitely love this one this one
reminds me of the penny wig for sure
like the curls are exactly the same so
to me I feel like it's exactly the same
way I will say the construction and
versus the penny weight is definitely
better in my opinion because they're
giving you the full bar for lace like
closure peace ways though you can part
it wherever you
one so I definitely think that the color
selection is not too great for this week
but I feel like the construction is
definitely one a point yeah so this is
what it looks like this is what the
color looks like now this is the khaki
Brown and I am so in love with this
color you guys I feel like it just looks
really good and it's like it's a
different color because it gives you
like the undertone is like greenish
color which I am living for so this is
how the weight comes straight out the
pack I did not brush it I didn't finger
comb it I didn't do anything to it
remember if you do decide to brush out
this week it is gonna get bigger but I
felt like this week was already full and
the curls were already came nice and
yeah I felt like I didn't need to do
anything to it so this is a week that
you can just dope on and like you're
good to go
you don't have to put too much work into
this wig at all I'm the only thing I did
do to this week was at baby hands I felt
like when I was cutting off the lace I
saw baby hairs but then when I went to
go put it on install it I felt like they
all disappeared I don't know if I cut
them off or I was just imagining things
but yes so I did go in and add baby
hairs to this week and our only our only
added big heads on this side because I
felt like it wasn't really a need for me
to add them on this side because nobody
can see that side but honestly guys I
did nothing to this week this is a long
week and it is around 24 inches
stretched and like this week and these
curls definitely remind me of like
summer virgin hair for sure I feel like
you definitely can fool somebody if you
was to walk out in this week like I feel
like nobody would know that it's
synthetic this week does not come across
as
or it's like it actually looks like some
good bundles right here it looks so good
and as far as the color like the color
is one point I really really love this
color especially up against my skin tone
it's just like a different type of color
now they do offer you dark roots but of
course the dark roots are not all the
way through the dark roots are only up
in the top area and then when you get
towards the back there are no roots
which I like dark roots all the way
through but this is so much hair and
it's so full that it really does it a
make or break this wig at all unless you
will plan on like win it up in a
ponytail or something like that then
obviously you could tell that it doesn't
have any dope roots in the bank this is
very very lightweight like it looks up
like it appears full but is very very
lightweight
so this week is a silky texture it's
also doll though because I know
sometimes when weeks are like that silky
texture they come off really shiny but I
don't notice because the color that it
kind of like dulls the weight down but
this week is not shiny whatsoever and
now as far as shedding I have not
received any shut-in even when I cut the
lace off I still haven't received and he
shot him now I'm tangling I'm sure once
you go to run your fingers do it like
it's curly hair
I wouldn't even suggest running your
fingers through it I think that you are
just good with how it is and bends
though is so long and it's synthetic I
feel like it is going to take welcome on
you especially if you brush this hair I
feel like it's not gonna last as long
versus you just leaving the curls how it
is and just let them be so I definitely
recommend just leaving these curls how
it is and like what should wait to be
bigger but yeah I love these curls I'm
just shocked that I didn't have to do
anything to these curls so yeah that's
basically it for this video if you're
interested in this wig I'll go ahead and
