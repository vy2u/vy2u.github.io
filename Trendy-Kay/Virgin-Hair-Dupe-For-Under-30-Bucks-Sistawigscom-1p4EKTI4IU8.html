again with another wig review and this
week was sent to me from assistant
weights so I will leave sister waves
links in the description box just in
case you want to purchase this wig so
yeah they sent me free trust equal lace
invisible L part wig and a style cut Ron
and I have it in a color too so this is
what the picture looks like on the model
and let me just start off by saying yes
this is a light hair sorry you guys I'm
out of breath because I just ran up some
steps but yes this is a lot of hair you
guys and it's really long so it's just a
lot of hair um so yeah if you do not
like a lot of hair you don't like big
hair if you don't like curly hair and if
you don't like long hair this video is
just not for you so yeah but if you do
like long hair or big hair or curly hair
or hair that looks like something other
than synthetic hair you're going to like
this okay I am like really feeling this
hair y'all this legit looks like some
like good hair like some Brazilian type
hair even feels so soft like I'm overly
pumped y'all I swear oh my god I felt
like I'm asleep when this way it came
out cuz I swear to you I didn't even
like what literally I did not do
anything to this week the only thing I
did to this week was add powder in the
part like am i finishing powder into the
part that's the only thing I did this
week comes like this
out the peg like I didn't finger comb
about it and brush out these curls
nothing it's already this big
it comes with baby hairs and the part I
feel like you don't even need to plus
the part really I mean you can if you
want to but I just added my finishing
powder into the part and it looks really
good
this wig is everything you guys like I
really really really like this and I'm
not really a fan of curly hair on me I
mean I do don't get me wrong like I do
wear curly hair like big hair but I
rather wear you know straight hair
versus kind of ham
hence that's why I don't wear my natural
hair but this wig right here
oh let me just show your goodness like
look at all of this hair like this is
crazy
yup I literally just forgot everything I
was going to say about this week because
I'm just in shock because I'm like why
haven't I ever you know what the reason
I did not get this week is because I
wanted this wig in a certain color I
didn't even think about getting this wig
and other colors like the color that I
had one now which is a two I wanted to
get it in Opie for 30 because when I saw
it on the mannequin I was like oh my god
I love that like that would look so good
against my skin tone and then I would
say reviews with people like reviewing
the old P for 30 and I was like oh my
god I gotta have that color so me one in
op4 30 it just I neglected all the other
colors and was like forget it if I can't
get it in Opie for 30 then I don't want
the way and then I don't know what made
me choose this wig like I was just like
I really want to try this week because I
just never like I want to try I knew
that it would be poppin but I didn't
think that it would be this poppin like
yo I swear to you this looks like a so
in like this looks this doesn't even
look like a wig like this looks legit
like some good hair I'm not even lying
and the fact that it comes with baby
heads I don't even have to take my own
baby hair all I did was just used a
little baby head that came on this wig
and swerve them to the side so this is
all the hair in the front oh this is a
lot this is a lot here and it's like 22
inches long I don't like having all of
the head just sitting right here
so basically however it is I just had
this you know behind like true and then
I have all of this to the front okay so
let's get one to this wig now this is a
synthetic unit of course and it is a
lace part unit so it comes with the lace
part and it comes with lace around the
perimeter like around the hairline so
you do have to cut off the lace and also
the lace is hard so yeah keep that in
mind it is hard lace so this week has
two combs in the front or comb in the
back with adjustable straps I feel like
if you have a big head you can get you
can definitely get away with when this
week I feel like if you have a smaller
hit you still can get away when this
week just adjust your straps like I did
and you'll be good to go like I don't
feel like the wig is not secure I don't
feel like it's going to fall off my head
or anything like that but y'all this
hair is so pretty now I have not
received any shedding from this head
even if I like do like this I haven't
received any shut-in from this hair now
Tanglin I'm pretty sure that this way
going to tango I haven't even tried to
run my fingers through it because it's
just so much head and it's so thick you
don't really need to run your fingers
through it at all
there is no shine to this wig at all if
anything it looks so natural like a more
natural shine or anything but it doesn't
look like plastic no like certain shine
at all
to me in my opinion this is like the
best curly wig ever bring it to me
you can switch wrong so this way also
comes with layers like it's not all one
length you do get some layers towards
the face which I can appreciate so yes
because I detest some wigs head like
they just curly weights me all my life
it bothers me so this is so pretty like
I'm literally in shock yo because I was
not expecting this way to look this good
in this natural like I haven't felt this
way about a curly synthetic wig in a
long time like Oh ever this week is a
dream you guys so I'm going to leave the
links down below in my description box
if anybody wants to purchase this wig
because honey this wig it's just given
me so much life like oh my gosh
so that's it for this video I'm sorry I
don't really have much to say because
this wig is like kind of perfect to me
umm I don't have nothing bad to say
about this wig it is a lot of hair and
it is very hot I can't say that oh my
gosh is snowing
