introducing more things to my site and
hopefully you guys like it but if you
follow me that I'm sure that your style
is kind of like similar tomorrow we had
some similar similarities and interest
so yes anyway let's move on it to this
week you guys because I know you're
probably dying to know what wait this is
also before I get started I know a lot
of you of going to X and my jacket is
from JustFab I probably got this like
last year or two gave you for that so
I'm not even sure if it's still in the
website but if I find it I'll definitely
link it in my description box and my
dress this is a dress and this is from
forever 21 and I got this for like eight
bucks
I think they sold out like that but if I
find it I'll definitely link it in the
description box for you also on my list
I really can't remember what I'm wearing
but I know is the NYX cream matte
lipstick so yeah I'll definitely link
that in the description box as well
because I don't have um I don't have it
around me right now with it I already
got the lipstick that I'm wearing so
yeah this is my ex soft matte lip cream
and I have it in the color London so
yeah this is a little mini one I'm
obsessed with these things I just feel
like they look so good and I also had my
lips in line with a brown look mana so
yeah that's what I had for my lips just
in case anybody is curious so I was good
this week from Samsa beauty of course
and this wig is old wing but it's
definitely definitely popping so this is
free trust equal lakefront lace deep
invisible elephant wig and style
Giuliana and I have it in a color for
now to me this looks like the color this
looks like the number two and I just saw
that this color will be more lighter
than what it is because I was looking
for more lighter brown color but I mean
it's still okay I definitely like the
wig but yeah this is what the picture
looks like I'm pretty sure most of you
are familiar with Juliana because it
definitely happened when it came out to
me it's still you know popping because
look how it looks oh and we all have not
already purchased this week y'all need
to go purchase saris a lot of
distractions in this video and I'm
trying to stay calm and just you know
film this video while I can I don't even
know what I was talking about but I
think I was talking about the color and
all I might have been talking about how
this is the older unit I don't know
either way this looks like the colors on
the tooth to me it doesn't look like a
number 4
I'm comment down below and let me know
what color you think this looks like is
it just me or my tripping but I
definitely think this is like a color
number 2 metaphor but this is a color
form 1 to the construction of this wig
so this week is a sad part in the part
is on the right side now this way it
comes with two combs one comb right here
and another comb on the opposite side of
the parts it also has a comb in the bank
was adjustable straps now I will say if
you have a smaller size here you might
want to stay away from this week because
it is big it is very big it's kind of
uncomfortable that's how big it is
because I'm not sure this thing is going
to stay on my head that's how big it is
I don't know maybe it's just me but yeah
this is a bigger unit so if you
do you have a larger size hedge this
will fit you
great I'm gonna say don't get if you
have a smaller size pit because there's
always adjustable shrimp and you're here
it might not be as small as mine so I
can't say that but if you do decide to
get this and you have a smaller size pit
I will suggest you using your I will
suggest you using your adjustable stress
and also using your comb if you use your
comb it's not that I would suggest using
I would suggest using bobby pins or
something just to make it secure and now
this comes with heartless this lace is
not stuff it's very hard so if you're
not a fan of hard least you might that
might be something you might want to
look into because the lace is hard
now the parting space is very very good
and I did go in and plus my part okay so
on to the texture of this week the
texture is a yucky texture and it is
really Yankee it has no shine so you
don't have to worry about using like
baby powder or dry shampoo to get the
shine out because it's no shine at all
this week actually looks really really
narrow when you first take this wig out
the tech it already really much is
already style you don't really have to
do too much to this week the only thing
I did was brush the way down with my big
brush and basically they just kind of
like forms the curls a little bit more
better if you do resent it just mix the
curls come together that have been
separate I don't know if they even
sounds right but yeah that's all and I
also went in and just snipped off like a
half of an edge right here in a big area
because it was falling a little over my
eyes and I didn't really like that so
yeah I did take a little bit off with my
scissors and that's basically it wig is
not hard to style at all I think you
won't have a problem with styling it you
know and the curls going every which way
but this is what the way it looks like a
closer you can definitely see the
texture and this way is really nice I
definitely love the lenses is about 18
inches 18 to 20 inches long so let's
move on to UM tangling and shedding okay
so this week does tangles I haven't
really got too much shut-in only when I
plucked apart and that was it now I do
get tingling towards that is the most
like the tagline is kind of like why are
you singling up on me to bed so I'm
definitely not really a fan of the
tingling it's like I can brush it out
and it's fine and then and like maybe a
minute overview of me moving around or
whatever it does to like when I run my
hands back through it it just gets like
Natalie like it's snakes um so yeah I
don't know it's not really too bad it's
just like it's a big tingly or the end
you could go in and cut it that looks
cute I might test it because it's only
like this is only like tools like right
here the rest is fine but still is
really not a bad wig and it's definitely
very affordable I forget how much it is
but it's very affordable so I'll make
sure I leave the price and everything
and my description box just in case you
want to purchase it the density of this
wig it's not really too thick or hot or
anything like that like when you look at
it it appears to be like really full and
thick but it's kind of like a normal
density it isn't all the hair to the
front oh yeah and I meant to tell you
one thing that I don't really like about
this is right here hiding hands this
little flip thing y'all know nothing so
like this guy's the bangs it all like
flows together but then on this side
kind of like has that one piece right
here and then the
it kind of like is doing this own little
thing if you do them saying so sometimes
like after a while when it long like
you're kind of stuck that little get
piece like how the hair summer Rae's is
that even sounds right so yeah maybe
it's just like this wig is defective and
maybe it's just this week I don't know
but yeah so I keep on just making it
like oh blending as one because you know
the tapes of family plan I'm so out of
breath sorry guys we had this is all the
hair to the front and like I said it's
really beautiful like I really do love
this wig it's really just nice and the
lift is a good good lift
so yeah I'm just going to turn around
