video is gonna be an update on my leve
hair week so this week is the kinky
curly machine-made wig
I don't know how leave it right here and
I bet everyone circled it of course I'm
just having like all types of
complications over here but anyway this
is gonna be my 3 week update or 3 weeks
I think it is so yeah I will leave Levy
hair company links in my description box
if you're interested in checking them
out also if you have not seen my review
on this week go check it out I will
leave the links to that week as well in
my description box so let's just get
going to this update because it's going
to be fairly quick okay so this hair has
been doing pretty well for its be kinky
curly hair because you know it's like
very coarse in tight but as far as like
detangling it detangles fairly easy I
just add like conditioner into it like I
always do if I count of units
conditioning water and just spray it in
the hair and just like you know brush it
out and do you get quite quite a few
strands of hair when detangling and when
on like a regular basis I really don't
get too much shedding because I don't
really run my hands through the hair
like that because it is like really
kinky and of course so you really can't
bring your hands straight do it but the
texture of this head is really soft as
far as tangling yes it does tangle
because again this is like kinky at the
ends and it's not so much the roots but
the ends are what's like really kinky
ish so yeah so when I first got this
this was a little bit
and I didn't cut it to shape it to fit
like my face and everything like that
but I will say it be careful when
cutting this wig if you do decide to get
it because um and like like certain
spots you think is longer than the other
like you cut it right and then you go to
like do this and like one side be
shorter than the other one like this
side is totally fine and then when you
get to this side I kind of like hecht it
when it came like right here you see how
this cut is long in this place like
right here yes so it's not really that
bad but I probably would have to go back
and I cut it I don't know um
but yeah overall this is really a cute
wig I do like it I'm just it's just not
my favorite from Lady hair but it is
nice quality the construction is
constructed very well like when I say
the part on this looks so realistic and
if you watch my first review on this um
wait you'll see that I was not really a
fan of this part I hated it but after
like wearing this unit a couple times
and figuring out what works best yes
it's the bone if you did not watch the
first video on its hair they give you
like it's like kind of like a fabric is
not even a soap base closure but it kind
of resembles it in a way but it looks
more like fabric than anything but I
guess it's sort of knots won't be
detectable but anyway I'm looking up
closer you guys can see but this is what
the part looks like I feel like you
wouldn't have to bring your edges or
some of your hair in the front and of
course that's what I did because when
you just have it like sitting right
there on your hand line it really
doesn't look real I feel like you need
to just bring a little bit you have it
don't have to be like the whole front of
your head but um yeah just to make it
blend in better
I'm like this piece it's my hair um
I didn't do anything my and my head is
pretty straight in the front kinda sorta
but yeah I'm definitely bring some of
your hair out and I feel like because
the part is a little on a lighter side
I took some concealer and added it right
here to my part um why didn't use powder
because I don't think powder would have
worked with this type of part but when I
put the concealer right there it just
blend like so perfectly with the part so
yeah like I said I really don't have
much to say about this unit I swear like
these chokers never stay on my neck like
I don't understand my neck is fairly
skinny but dagdu anybody else had this
problem like I swear every choker that I
like it's too big on my neck and I had
this one like the last night it's like
we're their neck small my hair small god
forbid about was a guy right I feel like
if you're into like big hair or like
that kinky curly natural type of feel
you'll definitely like this wig but yes
this is it for my video if you have any
questions feel free to leave it in my
comment section down below and I will
talk to you guys later
okay guys so I need your help I'm doing
well I want to do what I'm in the
process of doing a wig sale so yeah but
I have a question so I have so many wigs
that I want to put I'm on my website for
my wig sale but I have not done reviews
for those wigs yet I know that I'm not
gonna keep the wigs but I didn't know if
you guys wanted me to do reviews on
those wigs um before I put them up on my
website or do you guys just don't kill
you just like put them up on your
website regret I feel like some people
will want to see a review on their hand
before they buy it so I don't know
comment down below help me out because
that's basically what's been keeping me
from doing
Excel because there's a lot more wigs
that I want to review for you guys
before I add them to my site so would
you just rather me just put them on my
site and not do reviews for them or
would you guys like me to do reviews for
them before I post it up now I'm gonna
tell you it's like eight more wigs that
I have to do a review one so yeah if I
do reviews on these wigs then my way
style won't be until maybe two weeks
from now but if if you just want me to
like put the wigs on my site and not do
a review form then I'm thinking that I'm
gonna have my way Excel on the beginning
of next week I'm not gonna say a date
for show because I really don't know but
it would definitely be for sure the
beginning of next week
so guys please help let me know what you
think and yeah thanks for watching this
video
