not gonna be my typical synthetic weight
review so yeah I received this unit that
I went currently from wild African yeah
Wow African so yeah this is what the box
looks like that it came in so yeah when
you receive the box it comes in your
standards net that looks like this with
you know the plastic and everything yeah
basically what I'm wearing is the Kim
Kardashian barb haircut and this is
version Brazilian hair and it is a at
least week so it's basically lace from
here to here so it's just in the front
it's not like lace everywhere so yeah I
did actually get this way custom-made to
fit my head and um I'm a little if you
want how it fits my head because I did
have a nother week that was custom made
to fit my head and it fits perfectly and
I gave this company the same exact
measurements and it's actually a little
too small so I mean the wig itself is
gorgeous but just like watch out for
custom measurements because yeah so the
wig is definitely still wearable but it
is definitely too small in our mouth I
rather have my wig be too big than too
small because it's just better that way
in my opinion the hair texture is wavy
and the hair love is 12 inches and yeah
this is cat 7
glueless lace front wig so yeah yeah so
this is what the wig looks like and I
have to say this hair is absolutely
gorgeous like the hair is so soft I
haven't got any shutting out of this wig
or tingling so yeah I think I want to
pluck my part a little bit more to make
it more define because right now you can
like hardly see the part but yeah that's
what the part looks like so yeah I
definitely um I'm really feeling like
this short look like they got that cut
on point like it's really really cute so
this is not how the weight came when it
came to me it was wavy but it was more
wavier than this so basically what I did
is I took my fat flat arms and I just
put a little weight wash reading at
first and then I put a little weight to
it so yeah as far as like this hair
holding a curl um it doesn't hold a curl
for a long time Atlee fall within like a
day so yeah be mindful of that but as
far as like the company the people are
very very nice the wig itself is really
really really nice and such great
quality yes so my only comment was that
the wig fit a little small with the
measurements that I gave them which I
don't understand why why it was small so
yeah so like I said I received this week
from Wow African and well while Afghan
calm so go check it out I'll make sure
