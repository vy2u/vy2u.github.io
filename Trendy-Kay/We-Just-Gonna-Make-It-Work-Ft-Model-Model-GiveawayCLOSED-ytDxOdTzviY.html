know me I don't want them to miss me yes
I see the things that they owe me of
course and I'm back with in another
video so this video is gonna be on this
hair y'all so before I get into it this
is going to be a giveaway on this week
that I'm wearing so stay tuned at the
end for the details for the giveaway I
actually purchased this wig on my own if
you're interested in this week I will go
ahead and leave all the links hold on
let me get I'm gonna get this head
together y'all I can't take myself okay
so if any of you guys are interested in
this week I'll leave all the links in
the description box so yeah basically I
purchased this wig and then model model
actually reached out to me let me tell
you guys what the wig is this is my
model model and stuff or artist human
hair master mix I have it in the style
82 1/7 and it's in the color number 2
and the model on this picture is when a
ot9 IJ so honestly you guys I don't even
know what I was thinking when I
purchased this week and I actually
wasn't even going to do a video on it
until model model reached out to me and
it was like can we send you a wig and a
wig that they was trying to send me with
the wig that I had which is this one so
they was like well since you already
have it can we send you an extra one for
like a giveaway so this is how this
giveaway came about this is more of a
more mature older look you guys this is
definitely not me at all some people
that really might actually like this
style so I know you're probably looking
like that does not even look like the
wig I had to do some stuff to like make
it look kind of like me basically it's
your typical construction
two combs in the front of home in a bag
and adjustable shreds this also comes
with a Swiss lace so it's not any like
hardly so or anything like that this
week also comes as a middle part which
you can see the middle part right there
so yeah that's what it's looking like
and basically it's a nice short bob this
hair kind of reminds me of like that in
between stages of your head growing out
but it's basically like above but the
way the front was set up it was short
like it was like layered going into an
angle and then going into above if you
get what I'm saying but yeah I'll show
you basically how it looks as a middle
part once I'm finished with the video
everything like that just so you can
like see how it is but I mean it's not
that bad it's really cute it's just like
not my type of style and that's why I
never did a video on it but I figured
it's a free week and you know some of
you guys might be interested in it
even if you was like to do the same
thing I did and pull some of the head to
the front it would look right because
they give you the lace all around the
perimeter so it doesn't look fake if you
just like pull it this way because you
can still see like a scalp this wig is
tragic don't understand what was they
thinking like it's not even a real blob
yo what is this so yeah now the head
just wants to come in a fright and it
can do that cuz it just looks so much
better yeah
making my way down okay so I don't
really get any shut-in from this wig
well I haven't received any shut-in from
this hair it is really short so I'm
making sure he still does shed so I'm
guessing over time this week we'll start
to shake just a little bit but for right
now it does not do any Shannon tingling
it doesn't of course do any tangling
because it is really short so the hair
is like a silky texture it's not a
Yankee texture anything like that so if
you're not into silky hair you probably
won't like this one but it definitely
looks natural looking it doesn't give
off like a fake shine or nothing like
that the part comes nice like if you was
just looking for a week to put on this
will be the wig just to put on because
literally you don't have to pluck the
part I didn't add any powder into the
part actually I did pluck the part like
up in the beginning but it's not
necessary believe me like you really do
not have to pluck the part at all also
this week leaves so flats like you don't
have to put no heat to try to lay it
down or anything like that I'm and I do
feel like the wig cap is like universal
it has a good stretch to it so if you do
have any bigger size head I still think
that you'll be able to fit this week and
if you have a smaller size head just go
ahead and adjust your straps like I did
I had to basically like make a bang
adder out of this hair because it was
just so like adore inflate I don't know
it just did not look right to me yo so
that's what it's looking like I mean it
could go behind you
is if you like looking for that type of
look so your this one was definitely a
struggle for Mia this was definitely I
mean like now it's okay like I feel like
it's okay like it's doing something with
the law bang or whatever but this is
like not for me it's so plain y'all and
I'm not playing at all like I need some
oh I had to do want some earrings I I
don't really know what to say like this
is not a bad wig and this is like if
this is your style then this will be a
good wig for you but this is just not my
style so you guys if you interested in
