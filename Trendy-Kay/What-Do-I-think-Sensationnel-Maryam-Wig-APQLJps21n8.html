it something literally wasted oh man
you're bad were you wasting that me was
my hi guys so I'm back with another wig
review and this week what's this me from
this week so I'll be sure to leave
system links in the description box and
if you are interested industry it I'll
be sure to leave the direct link just in
case you want to purchase this week so
yeah this is the sensational impressed
late swing and this is therefore much
for so face this way I had in style
Miriam and this is a dr 30 and the one a
hands in my hand is calling number two
if you have a bigger size head I feel
like this week will fit you perfect
because my head is smaller as you guys
know already and I had a lot of room in
this week and I don't know it's kind of
like okay but for me I feel like I need
some extra security so yeah if you have
a smaller head and you really like this
wig and you want to buy it even though
it fits big I feel like you can put it
like bobby pins or something to secure
it down and you should be fine but still
watch out for the big leagues if you
have a smaller size take because they
tend to like you have like extra space
and then we have the extra space your
wig really doesn't lay that flat like
you wanted to so just be careful what's
there but yeah so yeah this is what the
inside looks like and like I said it's
it's a lot of remaining so if you can
sew straight out the peg this is what
the curls look like which they kinda
actually look the same like they're not
tight the texture of this is like a
slight Yankee texture but not really um
so yeah it's like slight slight slight
almost can be like a silky texture and
have a a dull look it doesn't have shine
to this week at all that's what makes it
look kind of Yankee I do see like a
slight slight is very very slight I
really don't know like this can't be
considered silky but the wig is not
shiny if you do finish like really dull
and look real but I don't know so yeah
I'm the density of this week is not to
stick it oh it's like your regular like
natural type of density it's not like
too thin with like you can see through
the hair but it's not sick either so
it's like it's in the middle so yeah
that's enough about okay so the part
does come in the middle but I shifted it
over to the side just because I'm like
really honestly not feeling this wig and
I don't know what it is about this week
that I just don't like I haven't figured
it out I think I know what it is but I
don't know for some reason I'm just not
like really feeling this one too much
and um so yes like the color is one
point of course you guys know I love
this color the limp is nice and long as
it were like 22 inches long or 20 inches
long so it is a lower unit I feel like
if you wanted to cut it you definitely
could cut it and also the dumper is only
at the top part in kind of like one size
and then the rest is just a whole color
even though it's not really that
noticeable but if you like your duck
route all the way around then yeah
you're not going to get that look this
week yeah I just had my part on the side
like I said I did go in and pluck the
part and that's all I did
now
the thing that kinda like the thing that
I don't like about this week is like
they give you like they give me like a
little bang school piece because you
know it's supposed to fall like back and
it's just supposed to be like you know
how we all like it how we like it to
slow back and stuff like that alright so
like this week does it but then it
really don't so like they give you like
this one little miniature piece right
here
they're like flips over on each side and
then the rest is like long so basically
it's like no type of shape like as far
as layering and all flowing together
it's just like there's one little piece
and then the rest is like curl back to
make it give it that feather effect or
whatever so I find myself having to keep
on brushing the curls back hyewon them
because besides this part the rest is
not really layered
so after a while it kind of like flipped
over like it kind of uncurls itself a
little bit and then it just looks like
this little thing like skirt and then
the rest is long I don't know if you
already understand what I'm talking
about
but I don't like that like I like for
the wig to all flows together and this
just doesn't so I think that's my main
problem with this wig I don't like the
little too little crumby pieces that
they give you them and the rest is long
I don't know maybe is just me it's not a
bad way it doesn't look that bad but I
will say you have to like fix it to how
you want it to be because they do give
you like them crummy two pieces like
what is they want to do um so yeah this
week does good was tangling and shut it
I did get a few I did get some shiny but
that was after I plucked a part and like
as far as
and this week doesn't really tangle and
it is a pretty long unit and I still
haven't had issues with this way
Pangolin so yeah this is like the wig is
good as far as like not tingling as I
plus the part and kind of like ran my
hand through it a little bit
the shedding went away so I will say
even though I had like been neglecting
this week and I hadn't been putting it
back in its package and just leaving it
in my bathroom it's been in my bathroom
while been in the shower like the steam
and just everything like I've really
been doing this week dirty but because I
don't really like it but I mean this
thing's been holding on like this
actually looks like I just nailed took
it out of the pack which I had I've been
trying to actually wear it so I can get
used to it so I can show it to you guys
but this way just get on my nerves and I
will see you in my next video and I love
you guys make sure you check out the
description box for links to Japan and
yeah I'll see you Mike</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
