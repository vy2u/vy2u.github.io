really trust nobody with all this joy
are you my roof on show got
damaged by the ball okay of course in a
big with a another video
so of course home is pretty so I'm
coming on camera a little different
because I've been getting a lot of
questions like what does your hair look
like underneath your wig what do you do
with your hair underneath your wig how
do you get your wigs to lay so flat so
I'm gonna show you guys what I do to
make my wigs flat even though it's kind
of cheating because my hair is straight
I am
natural for those of you who don't know
but my hair is not hard to manage and I
know for some people like if you have
more thicker hair than me what I'm doing
probably won't work for you so yeah just
keep that in mind okay so before we get
into all of that about my hair I will
sent this wig from my Sam's Beauty and
the weight they sent me is the melanin
queen poses by Brazilian French war lace
I have Anna style yaki 30 I mean what am
I was talking about I have it in the
style Yankee sleek 30 which I just
omitted the sleek word but whatever so
it's called Yankee sleek 30 and I have
it in the color ap1 be 30 so this is the
I can't even talk today okay so this is
what it looks like
so this is what the week looks like and
this is a lace front wig a synthetic
police front week so I definitely love
the construction of this week it gives
you two combs in the front right here it
gives you two combs in the front it
gives you a comb in the back and it also
gives you adjust bull straps I don't
think that this comes with any baby
hairs but this is what it looks like who
is this brother okay this week is my
main concept and yeah I guess is there
melanin queen collection
well why was it called melanin if this
is silky hair cuz this is definitely not
yet you've already this wig is a bit
tingly and I don't know it doesn't feel
the quality I don't know about the
quality it doesn't feel like good
quality hair if that makes any sense
like know should know like when you when
you stay awake or you feel the weight
you know if it's gonna act right or like
be wrong yeah I feel like this week it's
just like I'm gonna do me wrong so yeah
it's not a a Yankee wig is a Sookie wig
and the shine on it it does have a shine
so if you wanted to go in and take your
dry shampoo or baby powder you could to
just eliminate the shine so yeah okay so
basically I'm just going to normally if
my head was like natural like if it was
curly I would go ahead and just braid it
down but since it's straight and it's
land flat I'm not going to braid it but
on a normal day if my head wasn't
straighten I would read it so I'm just
going to brush it back and put it in a
lower ponytail
and literally oh this is all that I do
and the reason why I don't put braids in
my head when the street is because I
feel like when Frieza and then it just
it's it doesn't leave its flat as it is
now like literally it's still Flay so I
don't wear one stocking cap I wear two
just because of my ponytail in the bag
just let me get laid a little bit
flatter so I take my black stocking cap
and I just put it one like this and then
I just flip my ponytail in like that
and yeah that's basically how it looks
so after I have the first stocking cap
on I go in and make sure all your hair
is like tucked underneath and I just
slide it back and make sure my edges is
like in and then I put the brown
stocking cap over top of the black one
and my hair is like super duper flat
besides like this back part but that's
not even really a big deal so now I'm
going to try this on just so y'all can
see what it looks like before the lace
is cut off and already you guys this wig
is a big head friendly so if you have a
smaller sized head I would adjust the
stretch just because it's like and also
the hairline is not really that natural
but the good thing about this is it's a
lace front so if you wanted to go in and
pluck the hairline you could do that so
already I'm getting how cool to say
shingles what the hell so already I'm
getting shedding and tangling not much
shedding but I'm definitely I'm
definitely getting tingles just on the
bottom of the wing and also it starts to
like it's kind of like frizzy owner on
the bottom this is a long week it's not
that thick it's like a good density but
it's very tangled and that's a knot
right there
whew
okay I told you I caught that y'all I
knew I was gonna have some issues with
this this we all know the texture
samhitas it's funny um so this is what
the party looks like which the part
looks so good it's like I said this is a
lace front so basically you can put the
hair wherever you want in that part
looks so super natural so yeah I think
I'm just going to wear this wig in the
middle but as you can see it lays really
flat and even like no matter where you
part it is still lays flat so hold on if
you wanted to part it on the side you
could and look still lays so freaking
flag I don't know hum awareness in the
middle or on the side for you look be
alright let's see I think I'm away in
the middle but I'm going to cut off the
leaves and then I'm gonna come back okay
guys so I cut off the lease and this is
just what it looks like so now I'm going
to go ahead and adjust my straps just
because this way cap is huge
alright I'll give you some little baby
heads in a big but not in the front only
in a baby alright
you
okay I'll look when somebody from the
Addams Family
all right so of course like you can tell
that this freaking looks like a wig so
I'm taking my mousse just because I
don't know why I don't know if y'all can
see that but it has like a lot of
flyways so I'm going to go ahead and
kind of like lay it down
so yeah all right oh my gosh uh but this
week is no okay all right all right so
I'm gonna go ahead and head baby heads
into just the front part and then I'll
be back and we're gonna see how this
look so yeah this is what it's looking
like this so far um I might add powder
into the part I'm not sure but I'll let
you know when I come back okay you guys
I'm back in my frickin battery is gonna
dead I don't know why I left my camera
why I went to go fix his hair okay so I
didn't like pull out any or create any
baby haze for this week just because I
was kind of over it but I did some
finishing powder into my part I will say
one good thing about this wig is I like
the construction besides it being too
big but once I adjusted my strips it was
okay it still fits really big but it's
better also I love the construction
because it's a lace front which gives
you more options to style the wig also
it'll give you the option to pluck out
the hairline if whoa the hairline really
dude needs to be plucked out especially
if you're gonna pull it up into a
ponytail I definitely would suggest you
a pluck in the hairline
but overall I felt like it didn't really
need no baby hairs it definitely looks
natural now for the hair itself I don't
think that the quality of this hair is
really good it's just not doing it for
me I did go in with my flat iron because
don't you know how sometimes when
synthetic wigs get a little bit older
than you start to get like frazzled at
the end and kind of like you can feel
that it's like the hair it's not good
like feels like heart and plasticky
that's how this head was filling it in
and I just took my my straightener
went through it and it feels a lot
better so yeah this is what the week
looks like and I definitely came back a
different person sorry I didn't warn you
up but I had to take off my shirt that
sound bad but I took off my shirt
because you really couldn't get the full
effect of the wig and it was just to
like dunk everything and I didn't like
it so yeah I just took off the shirt so
you guys can see what the week looks
like it is pretty long I feel like if
you want to purchase this week you're
definitely probably going to have to
keep on straightening this week to get
it to X right or you can just cut it up
me I probably would like cut the ends
off just to like even it out with this
part right here but that's just me oh
this is okay wait these are the results
like I said it doesn't look good but the
quality of the hair is not that great
but still if you're looking for a long
way or you want to take your chances go
ahead and purchase our go ahead and
leave all the links in the description
box I'm going to turn around so you guys
can see what the hair looks like in the
back
you
so yeah also I feel like it could be
flam right here but that's from the wig
bin too big for ya definitely wish it
was Flair right here see how better than
looks from the side I don't know maybe
it's just me I'm really picky when it
comes to stuff like that but yeah it's
pretty once you like fix it up over that
one but if you're not subscribed to my
