cover skies army so my silence so my
side of swoon be mistaken
hey guys so I have another video for you
guys and he is this gorgeous wig right
here I might have to change my location
so my background switch up don't be so
surprised this week was sent to me from
Sam's Beauty so I will make sure I leave
Sam speedy links in my description box
and links to where you can purchase this
way across this is the Bobby boss
Shannon wig it says MLF 1 1 3 Shannon
and I have it in the color 99 J this
actually reminds me of the last week
they are just in reviewing which was um
what was that way I can't remember the
name follow me and I had in a non non J
as well this 9rj is definitely a lot
brighter than the last night on J that I
reviewed so yeah keep that in mind that
this like if 9 9 j and 5:30 had a baby
this is what it would look like so yeah
it's definitely brighter than a 9 9 j
and darker than a 5:30 so anyway let's
get one to this wing yo B this wig has
two combs on each side a comb and a bit
with adjustable straps I feel like this
week actually fits me perfect I do have
my strips adjusted adjust it basically I
do feel like if you have a bigger size
head you can get away with when this
week now as far as the texture is
concerned the texture of this week is a
slight yaki texture it's not as Yankee
as my previous week the follow me wig
but it definitely is a nice light yaki
um it still is on like the silky side
just a little bit but it's definitely
Yankee when you feel it you can tell
that it's Jackie
um when you look at it you can kind of
tell that is Jackie it does have that
don't look so you don't have to worry
about this wig band shine we'll say
difference between this week and the
previous week follow me that I just
reviewed I feel like the layers is more
layered towards the front the left is
still the same I'm the curl basically
the curl pattern is still the same
I definitely love this better so as far
as like the parting goals I'm not really
a fan of the part is so much handed part
that it really doesn't look like a part
so you have to go in and pluck your part
for sure this does I don't know if I
said this but this does come with soft
lace is not that soft but it's
definitely soft lace I feel like when
you're plucking the part you have to be
careful because I did um put a hole in
the part in area and then I just gave up
like I stopped so up here you can tell
that it's kind of plucked and then when
you get to like start getting back here
not so much if I added my finishing
powder and cute apart so it would look a
little bit more better and blend in with
the front so I mean it doesn't look bad
but I definitely hate this part I feel
like um the follow me part was
definitely better than this part yeah
this is the only thing that's messing up
this week for me is the part I mean I
guess it looks okay now but I did poke a
hole in it so I'm kind of like over it a
little bit but the phone is this week
it's very very full I feel like it's the
same fullness as the UM as the follow me
week I definitely feel like the curls
and everything are so bouncy so when you
first get this wig the curls are
basically already there I did go in and
finger comb the curls out just a little
bit but I feel like the curls are not as
tight and it like when you put it on
your head is like you really don't have
to do much you can just a finger comb it
and be done with it
so I feel like these curls are really
nice now
far as tangling and shedding I have not
received and I haven't received any I'm
shutting from this unit or even after I
cut the lace off and they do provide you
with fleece from any air that you have
to cut off so when I cut that off I did
not receive any shut in um and even if
the finger combing and everything like
shutting is good in this department um
yeah I haven't received any shut in now
I'm tangling it does get tangled towards
the end area like towards the end part
it starts to tingle right here but
besides the little like snags and like
basically they're snakes I don't get
anything else I still really really like
this week what I recommend this week I
definitely would recommend this week in
my personal opinion I think I kind of
like this wig um better than follow me
because I know I'm gonna get a lot of
questions on it so if you was curious
yes I would definitely suggest this week
over follow me for sure umm why only
because of the way the the front is cut
like the layers are the bomb I really
really like the layers in a front area
now I could do without the part like I
wish to part from the follow me wig was
on this week like they need the treat
but I mean the part is still you can
work with it and I'm just gonna do a
quick 360 so you guys can see what it
looks like
oh yeah you guys that's it for this
video um tell me what you think about
this way you guys do you like this color
do you like this week better than the
follow me week I would really like to
know what you guys think but I
definitely think I'm feeling this one
more than the full army wig the color is
so gorgeous
so I'm if you I haven't did this in a
while but I'm going to show you guys
what this way looks like in the middle
because I didn't show you what the
follow me wig looked like in the middle
and actually that way looked so good in
the middle but yeah I'm going to show
you what what this week looks like in
the middle and this is what the wig
looks like in the middle you definitely
can win in the middle that's for sure
this is going to irritate me though so
just keep that in mind but yeah so
that's it for this video um yeah this
hair is so gorgeous so again if you have
