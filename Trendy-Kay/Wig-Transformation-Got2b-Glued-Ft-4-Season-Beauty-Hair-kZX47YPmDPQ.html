for you and this week review I meant
this week was sent to me from Four
Seasons Beauty hair so I will leave
their links in my description box so you
can find them on Aliexpress basically
they are a store or Aliexpress they sell
bundle hair as well as lace wigs and
virgin hair and all that type of stuff
so I didn't get that bundle hair I
decided to get a wig just because I'm
lazy it's just easier for me to just get
a wig review a week instead of making a
wig out of bundle hair because it takes
up too much of my time but yeah they are
known for their bundle okay so if I'm
looking down I'm just reading umm what I
have in my head so I'm wearing their
Peruvian deep wave hair glue this for
last week and I have the inches 26 of
course this is not how the wig came
originally originally this wave was 26
inches long I'll get into more details
about why the wait looks like that this
but yes I had this in 26 inch more was
in 26 inches and yeah that's basically
it now I had a difficult time with this
hair so I'm going to insert clips of
what the hair looked like when I first
got it what a clip that I'm showing you
now is when the hair was washed I did
not film what it looked like before I
washed it I don't know I just let my
mind but basically the hair was just in
a curl when I first got it so I washed
it and everything because it
look a little thin in the middle so I
wanted to see if I washed it with a head
well with the head thicken up and it did
but I'm going to show you what the
weight looked like in the back because
it was thinner than what I liked it to
being before I forget I did bleach these
nights as well I did or really good job
on bleaching the nights only because I
don't think I left the bleach on a night
so long enough so it kind of bleached it
like a little bit but it could have been
better I think I only left the bleach on
for like seven minutes and it really
didn't do much to it I also went in and
I plucked out some hands in the UM in
the front of the wig like I plucked out
the hairline just so he can give me a
more natural hairline and I kudos to
whoever just sits there and plucks the
hairline to make it more natural because
let me tell you that's a lot of time to
be putting in so if you want to make
your headline look better I mean it is
possible you can as thousands of people
who do do it it's just very
time-consuming because you have to
really like literally pluck out all the
heads in the front to get it to look
more natural so yeah I started and I
mean I did it but I think that it could
be better but besides that um I was okay
with how it looked afterwards so I
noticed that after I washed the wig and
plucked out umm the hairline it started
to get really tangling on me I'm
especially at the ends it started to get
like really tingly so I'm like what is
going on so I started getting annoying
cuz I'm like okay so anyway I decided to
straighten the hair I figured it might
do well straighten verses it been
in its natural state so i tested i
tested like a piece out just to see how
it would do with heat so it did really
good and it straightened very well like
it straightened within like one one
swipe and i didn't get as much tingling
so I was like okay I'm just gonna do the
whole wig and just wait it straight so
after I straightened the whole entire
wig the ends look really just ready and
they were still like like you couldn't
really um you could you can really put
your fingers through it basically so
like if you was to run your fingers to
it it would be okay all the way into the
the end part so I decided that I wanted
to cut the wig into a ball because I
figured I couldn't go wrong and it was
just a look of so nice so that's what I
did and that's how I ended up with this
look now as far as applying this wig I
didn't use the got to be glue and I'll
um I'll make sure I'll post some clips
or show you guys clips of me applying
the glue and everything like that so
yeah I use the got to be glue the hair
gel and I also use the free spray and I
had my blow dryer so I'll just show you
guys what I did when applying it and yes
I did break my head down I didn't show
you guys my braid head rim but my hair
is just braiding a straight back into
like small braids they're not big braids
and they're going to straight back so
the reason I didn't do like a full-on
tutorial on or showing you how I applied
my my full lace wig with the got to be
glued I'm hey Joe and simply because
this was my very first time and I wasn't
that confident in doing a tutorial
because I really didn't know what I was
doing like this was my first time so for
my first time I think it actually turned
out really really good I really liked
the results and it really holds really
nice so yeah so after I applied the wig
I was just like okay I have to cut this
hair off it's just not gonna work
so basically I just split the hair into
two pieces and bring them over my
shoulder and just cut each side now as
you can tell I like to stop the clip
abruptly like I stopped the clip so fast
because I'm like oh my gosh like I
messed up on it so I called my mother to
save me to see if she can try to even
out the bow because when it comes to
cutting like I'm not that like I'm not a
pro at cutting new hair so I do make
mistakes here and there so yeah my mom
she tried to help me as far as like even
out the hair but it still was not the
way I really wanted it but if she
actually helped a lot so after she cut
it I went back and just took the hair
into a ponytail and then I just cut it
that way and then it turned out like
this and I just took my flat iron and
bumped the ends and this is the end
result and this is what it turned out to
be and this is what it looks like no no
that was a lot I'm like so in love with
this look you guys I think that this is
so pretty so I will turn around so you
guys can see the cut and don't judge me
you guys take it easy on me because like
I said I'm not a professional at cutting
or anything like that
but I do think that the way that turned
out really good
and it is still a little thin in this
area but as long as you can't really see
you know what's going on back there it
doesn't really bother me but I do wish
that this part was a little bit thicker
as far as the construction of this week
I did get it in a petite I think no it
might have been a regular size either
way the cap and everything fits really
good the wig is self and how it's like
made is really nice the hair at the ends
was the worst part
it did tengo awful lot and that's why I
cut it off now the wig is like bouncing
out of control like this wig is so soft
I have not received any shedding from
this week after I cut it and I have not
received any tangles after I cutted this
help for me was just okay but as far as
what I did to it I really like the end
result so if you was trying to get this
wig in 26 inches or 20 inches and 18
inches in higher no I would not suggest
this wig only because the ends of the
hair was so bad I guess from the
headband so long I don't know I really
can't justify why huh the ends were the
way that they were this week is just
okay for me I do like how it is now but
if you are interested in this wig I will
leave their links in my description box
and the direct link to this week in my
description box so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I will see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
