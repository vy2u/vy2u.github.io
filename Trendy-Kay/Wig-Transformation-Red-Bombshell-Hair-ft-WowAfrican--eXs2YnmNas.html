this understanding minor to the cylinder
had to cut him I've already swelling if
they give me a life with niggas gonna
build money made it work
Kane I'm back again with another video
of course and this video it's gonna be
on this gorgeous hair that I've been
right now all we can go so yeah this was
sent to me from wild African and our
answer clips of what the wig originally
looked like everything like that because
of course I did customize this way to my
liking and so I'm gonna go ahead and
clued clips of just what the head look
like in its original state and
everything before I made the changes to
this week so yes so let's just get into
the other clips and then we'll talk
about how I got here but yes this is
what it looks like now so I'm just going
to insert clips of what it look like
before I dyed it in curled it and not
make this stuff so this week was shipped
DHL and I received this way pretty quick
within like maybe less than a week maybe
like four to five days I'm saying I
can't really remember because I had this
week for a while now but it was around
that time frame so when I received the
way it was in a deep wave pattern and
this is 100% brazilian virgin hair I do
have this in the length 20 inches and
this is also a lace front wig and it is
in a natural color which is not next and
in the natural color anymore but when I
received it it was in the natural color
and the item number is FL w15 just in
case you wanted to look it up but like I
said I will leave the link in the
description box just in case any of you
guys are interested so that is the specs
on this hair I do believe that the lace
is light brown as well and the cap
construction is a glueless lace cap so
yeah also it comes with three cones in
the front I'll comb in a bag with
adjustable straps in the middle I don't
really like any of the cones that's in
the front of the wig but I did remove
the ones sitting directly in the middle
on top of my head I removed it I felt
like it gets it away from the wig
looking as flat as possible so I every
move that I will say that this week is
constructed very well because I had a
really hard time removing the week yeah
but that's I mean nothing week I did
have a really hard time removing the
comb so when I received this week I did
go ahead and bleach my knives I also
went in and what did I do
I also went in and plucked my hairline
because I felt like it could be a little
bit more natural even though you don't
have to cuz it didn't look bad but I
wanted to look as natural as possible so
I did go in and pluck my hairline the
wig already comes with baby heads but
from plucking the hairline I had to
recreate my baby hairs
now before I bleached his hair I did not
receive any shutting or tingling after I
bleached her hair I did get a look no
act I bleached the nuts
I got a little bit of shut-in but it
wasn't too bad and then after I bleached
the whole entire way I got a little bit
more shut in but it still wasn't bad but
it definitely did after bleaching
his hair also I forgot to mention that I
did leave the bleach on for about 15
minutes and when I say the hair turn so
fast you guys like I was so surprised
how how fast the hair lighting so you do
not if you plan on getting this
you plan on bleaching it you do not have
to leave the bleach on for forever
because this hair really lightens within
minutes so I only left the bleach on for
15 minutes and then I rinsed it out and
all of that good stuff and like I said I
followed up and use my own
semi-permanent hand dyed by a door and I
used the colors magenta and I use
intense red I used three bottles of the
intense red and one bottle of the
magenta and I still have some magenta
left over so you can see that I didn't
really use a lot of magenta so after I
did that I rinsed out the color and I
left the color in for maybe like 10
minutes I didn't leave it on longer or
maybe like 20 at the mix but it didn't
feel like I left it on for a long time
so after I rest day I wasn't really
pleased like I was pleased in some spots
um but I don't know it just looked crazy
to me and up and like where the laces
didn't really take well and it still was
kind of like blind so I found my Clara
box dye and this is a permanent color
and this is what it looks like so I
found this in y'all I had I don't know
if it has like that's my expiration date
on it but I had this for like over a
year but this is in the color blazing
burgundy so I just went in and used this
for the lace area where I didn't get it
like up in the root part in the front of
the week I used it up in that area and I
also used it at the bottom of the wig
some but mainly just in the roots and it
kind of just colored the week the same
color as the semi-permanent guys the
door died but after I use this box color
I definitely love the way this week
turned out so yeah it's basically the
same color as the door colors mixed
together that's how I feel
you can't even tell that I use different
colors but yeah it definitely died the
roots and where I missed some diet it
definitely covered all of that so I went
in here and rinsed it out and they give
you like this conditioner that comes
with it it's like called panty Provine I
think I'm saying it right but what is it
because I did save it because when I
watched his head again I wanted to use
that conditioner when I tell you that
condition I made this hair smells so
good even when I curled this ham it
still smelled like that conditioner and
it just made the head just feel so soft
and just more healthy sorry on my legs
hurt that's why I'm sitting up like this
okay so then after I you know washed out
the die everything like that I did let
this week edge right because I just
wanted to see if it would if the curl
pattern would be the same as it was
before I got it and it actually was so
it did it didn't keep its natural curl
pattern which is like the deep wave type
of look so then I thought let it air dry
it was still a little bit dead and I was
kind of pressed for time so I did go
ahead and use my chi silk infusion it's
like a heat protectant and I put it all
over the hair and I went ahead and blow
dried the hair straight just because I
didn't feel like waiting for that long
time and plus I knew that I didn't want
to wet in his natural state I just
wanted to see if it was gonna curl back
up to how it looked originally so yeah I
went in here and I blow dry the hair
after I blow dry the hair I went in and
just curled the hair with this and this
is my Hot Tools professional and y'all I
love this thing so much so I did go in
and curl the hair before I put it on my
head this is my second time curling this
hair the first time I curled the hair I
curled it on my mannequin head which was
a lot easier for me versus curling it
my head which I did the second time so
yeah I went ahead and curled it with
these curlers and I just took a small
section it's not really small yeah I
would say like small to medium type of
sections and I curled the wig I curl
each section going in opposite
directions because if I if I would have
heard the head going all in the same
direction the curls would all form
together and I didn't want that I wanted
that kind of messy type of curl look I
didn't want all the curls to be
uniformed if you get what I'm saying
so for each for each section I curl to a
different type of way if you get what
I'm saying I hope you all understand
what I'm saying
but yeah I use these colors right here
so then after that I did go in and a
spray on the head with my fuzzy hold and
spray and after I did that I just went
ahead and plucked out all the curls
which I just finger comb them all out
and this is basically the end result
which I really really love this color I
just love this style I love everything
about this hell okay you guys so yeah
this is what it's looking like
and I will say that this week looks so
natural I did go in and cut baby hairs
back into this week and this is what
it's looking like which I just really
really love I had been when his hair and
a ponytail as well and it looks really
natural and a ponytail too
so yeah I'm definitely definitely loving
this hey you guys it looks really good I
definitely love this red vibrant fabric
color so guys that's it for this video I
hope you guys enjoy and like I said this
is from awhile African I will leave all
their links in the description box just
in case any of you guys are interested
in this week and I will see you in my
next video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
