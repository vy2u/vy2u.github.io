you for birthday you don't assure me
that I'm feeling hi you not the one I'm
thinking of - nice may not be over you
but I'll try inside I'm still in now
hey guys so I'm back with another wig
review and this week Melissa's me from
elevate style so I'll make sure I leave
other way styles links to everything in
my description box so yes let's get
started the wig I am wearing is by brown
sugar and it's the soft with lace human
hair style mix lace front wig and I have
it in the style vs 2 to 3 in the color
numbers - now to me personally I feel
like this looks like more of a 1 B 1 I
don't really feel like it looks like a 2
it might just be me but yeah I would
like to see how it for look because this
really looks dope or maybe I'm just used
to win lighter colors now I don't know I
just feel like it don't look like a - oh
this is what it looks like and they do
give you some tape just in case you want
to tape and they do give you take just
in case you want to taste conditions and
if you give you tape just in case you
want to take and they do give you and
this week does come with tape just in
case you want to take down your lace
because the lace is so so yeah beware of
the soft lace just in case you want to
go in and pluck you apart because if you
Club too many heads at once you can rip
a hole in your lace which I did but it's
not that noticeable so I'm not really
worried about it now as you can see I
know you probably like that's not even
the same way it is the same way but I
just cut it into a book only because
I just was not fill in I mean it was
cute or whatever but I just wanted
something different because I did have
this wig for a while so I want it like a
different look so I cut it into a book
and I'll just insert some clips of how
it looks before and also how I cut to
achieve this look before I get into all
of that let me just tell you respect
someone this way so this is a synthetic
unit nad safe human hair but if this
human hair style mix which means it's
just blend it in with him and hair but
it's not him and hair it's definitely
synthetic so I guess when they say that
they just mean it gives you a more human
hair feel which it really does the
texture is a Yankee and it just looks a
still really nice is no shine to it it
definitely looks very natural
now this wig has two combs in the front
once I hit the comb in a bit and
adjustable shrimp I feel like if you
have a bigger size pit you definitely
can get away with when it's wig but if
your head is on a smaller side like mine
you can still wear this wig I do have my
stress adjusted to its tightest and it's
really really good this is what the
Parden space looks like and this week
does not come with baby hair but I cut
my own baby hairs and just kind of like
brushed them I didn't put anything on it
I just like scooped it over to the side
y'all I was so scared I really do like
how this turned out because I was scared
to cut this I didn't think that it was
going to look right but it actually
looks really good so but I'm not saying
it like the wig didn't look good already
how it came the only reason I cut it off
was because it was like the bottom like
the whole top part of the wig is lit
really good like it said this bag how
you wanted to even if you wear the sweet
one inside it still looks like extra
good so yeah the thing that got me was
like the bottom I felt like the bottom I
felt
didn't know which way I went ago I felt
like the head didn't know if you wanted
to go back or forward so it was kind of
like going every which way like some
pieces that about would be like a
feather and the other pieces will be
coming around here and then I had to
keep on combing it to how I wanted it to
be so I just said forget it let me just
cut it off so that's basically what you
see now is the result of you know me
kinda sleep and it definitely looks
really natural and fine at England and
shutting I have not received any
tingling whatsoever yet I'm pretty sure
I will start to experience some tingling
or snakes but I have not received any
tangle in it yet and as far as shutting
I have received a few strands of hay it
wasn't nothing crazy or anything like
that and then the almost shudder I got
from his head is when I cut the part and
when I also cut off the lino the lace
comes from ear to ear so you do have to
cut off the lace and like I said it is
it is softly now the only problem that I
really had with this wig is the fact
that the lace is like a brown color so
if you are like darker than me you
definitely can get away with the part in
space but in camera it doesn't look bad
but in person you clearly can see that
it's like the scalp is darker than my
complexion which I don't like but if you
don't like that either like if your my
shade or lighter you can just take some
concealer or some finishing powder
that's the same complexion is you and
put it apart but yeah that's the only
thing I wish that the lace was a little
bit on the lighter side but I mean it's
cool
cut it into a nice little bug and it
already came with layers so yeah
