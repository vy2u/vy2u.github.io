egg with a leather video in this week
was super me so I'll make sure I leave
all their links in the description box
in case any of you guys are interested
in between and if you care anything oh
my gosh it's my son casein chasing you
got to be quiet boy okay so um the wig
they sent me and sorry this is going to
be pretty quick I'm just trying to like
get all of this stuff out here for you
in plus is really not much to really
talk about was this week and I had this
look like every yard and I'm just
getting around to filming it for you
guys oh yeah this is by Vanessa I don't
think I ever did up I don't think I ever
did a video on their wings before I
don't know I don't think I ever tried
their wings before maybe I had and can't
remember but I'm pretty sure I haven't
but it's in the style Jenice and I
handed in a color and number two which I
feel like this color actually looks like
a 1b instead of a color number two so
that's something that I'm really like
even though it's not too bad because
when they don't have the two in stock I
get a one B but I definitely would have
loved this to look like a number two
instead of a one B but it's fine um so
yeah basically it's like that they call
it a seat top so basically the lace part
is supposed to go like in a c-shape and
this is synthetic for those of you who
are not sure this is the bigwig is not
human hair anything like that they don't
think that this is curling iron safe or
yesterday so this is also a heat safe
and it did come with lace to cut off and
the lace was soft so if you like soft
lacing you'll definitely love this wing
I just want to start off by saying the
part one this week I really
really really love and the way this
whole week just lays it lays so
unnatural
this way camp has two cones in the front
a comb and a bag with adjustable straps
now if you have a bigger size pin I feel
like it's not going to work for you I'm
because I do have my stress adjusted to
its tightest something like if you're
here is on a normal-sized mind you my
head is a bit small so if you he is like
small to normal regular size then you'll
be fine but if you have like a huge head
I wouldn't even suggest you even getting
this unit because probably going to be
really tight this wig is also a silky
texture that's one thing I'm really not
a fan of I mean I don't really have a
problem with still be touched your wigs
but when they're thin that's when my
problem that's what my problem comes in
it so this is on a silky side and it's
also really thin this which would be
really really pretty is it was thicker
but I mean it's not too thin with
somebody would like it's not too thin
with it's like see-through but it's
definitely thin so if you're not a fan
of like that then natural look then you
might not like this week so I'm just
want to tell you that it's not full at
all this is like all well not over here
but this is basically all the hair is a
natural identity I'm really not
complaining about it because I mean it's
okay this is what the part looks like
which I absolutely love this part you
guys in the way that it lays this wing
actually looks really really really
really natural when I say this way it
looks like like it's coming out of my
scalp I would say that this week is
around 18 inches long yet I would say
this week is around 18 inches long and I
will consider this in everyday week and
it's like really low maintenance the
only thing you would probably have to do
is cutoff delays and a plus the clock a
little bit which clucking apart was kind
of optional because I felt like when I
when I got it out some when I first
received this week the part wasn't bad
at all I felt like if you wanted to add
your finishing powder or concealer you
can do that without without needing to
pluck but though I have not received any
tingling or shedding from this unit
even after I plus the cut and cut off
the leaf I still haven't received any
shedding and I had to say that you can
definitely tell that the quality of this
hair like the fibers or something are
really really good because it's like not
snagging not doing any type of tangle
ends the way it feels it feels so soft
it just feels like some straight like
Malaysian hair or it just feels like
some type of virgin hair that's the look
that I'm getting from this it really
really looks natural and as far as the
shine like you don't need to put you
don't need to add any dry shampoo baby
powder or anything to this week because
the shine it looks it really looks
natural like it looks like some bundles
and your hair something like that's how
natural it looks so yeah this is what
the wig looks like and this is
practically this is basically how the
wig came when I received it and it just
has like the little bends at the end
which I feel like if you got tired of
this style and you wanted to wear it
straight
I feel like this wig was a soul bomb
just straightened and just I feel like
that it will be pulling out of control I
feel like it will just look so pretty
but the only reason I sit in on
I did straighten his hands because I
have another review at that plant on
screen and they had and I didn't want it
to be like a street head overlook for
you guys because I know some people can
just get tired of the same look so yeah
I want to switch it up i was like re
i'ma leave it alone but I'm coming y'all
if y'all do decide to get this week and
y'all get tired of this style I
definitely suggest that you of stringing
the tags it would look so cute you can
do that Terry Sean wasn't in the back
okay true but it was just sitting right
here where your shoulder
waiting for the time to pass you by
hopefully is the change to change my
guys that pretty much is this video
sorry is kind of like short and straight
to the point but it was really nothing
big it just kind of like a regular
everyday type of week but if I did leave
something out and you guys have any
questions about this unit feel free to
leave it in my comment section down
