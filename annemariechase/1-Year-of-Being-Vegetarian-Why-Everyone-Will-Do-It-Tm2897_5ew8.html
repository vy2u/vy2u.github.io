gonna start making noise so many noises
going on right now okay
hey guys Demery and today I just really
was not planning on filming and a lot of
factors are really counting against me
to film right now I've actually never
filmed in my room so far and it's like
November so that's insane I thought I
was gonna film all the times I've really
good lighting in here there are a lot of
noises going around and what else it
smells like vomit in here
that's just what you agree to do when
you're a college student with a roommate
but I'm here and I thought it'd be a
really good time to film my video that
I've been wanting to film on
vegetarianism or my experience being a
vegetarian I have been officially like
vegetarian slash pescetarian at a
minimum I'm not like saying that they're
like minimums I don't know what I'm
saying but I've been a at least a
pescetarian for one whole year now
starting last month so this is my like
year and a month of being a pescetarian
slash vegetarian I really didn't plan a
city at all as I mentioned like I wasn't
planning on filming today but I have
like kind of been thinking about this
video so hopefully I can like form all
of my thoughts into like a coherent
video so let's get started all right so
we're where to begin let me just go way
back okay so my dad's a doctor and one
time his office sponsored this vegan
workshop and before that I had no idea
what veganism was I went with my mom to
this vegan workshop I think it was a
couple they talked about veganism and
how it changed their life one of the
things that they did tell us that stuck
with me was that if you're not lactose
intolerant you're like a mutant because
you're only supposed to drink milk from
your mother as a form of nutrition cuz
when you're a baby you can't like eat
foods and that's the only time that you
should really be drinking well basically
every single person should be lactose
intolerant by the time they're like an
adult because it's just not natural for
people to drink milk otherwise and so I
was always interested in this idea of
vegetarianism because it just seems like
a really like healthy thing for me
personally like I think everyone has
their own opinion
what's healthy for someone's body but
for me like I thought that maybe
vegetarianism was like the healthiest
option for humans like in their diet and
another factor before my transition to
vegetarianism was that one of my family
friends in Alaska raised a lot of their
own meat that they eat they have
chickens that lay eggs and then they
raise their own turkey for Thanksgiving
and I don't really know what else they
raise they raise their own meat because
there are so many hormones and like
mass-produced me that it's just like
it's not natural apparently like if you
have like a chicken in a chicken farm
they can't even like physically
reproduce healthy normal chicken it'd
just be like a deep farm chicken that
like can't do anything can't walk or
anything and so basically just sounded
like really awful so that was all of
that was my basic knowledge about food
and meat and the meat industry and like
what you ate basically if you chose to
eat meat
and I was just never super inclined to
like go to a restaurant and get a steak
like I didn't like steak I didn't like
red meats that much I never wanted
burgers it's weird now cuz I always want
burgers now that I'm a vegetarian but
it's like I never wanted me triggers I
didn't really like meat in general but I
wasn't super inclined to it with all of
this in my childhood I came across a
vegan youtube video and I think it was
like freely or something and she was
talking about veganism and that is when
I think I really started to like
consider veganism because you just watch
these videos and it's like she's making
really good points and she's been vegan
for like a lot of her life and I really
think this might be a very controversial
statement but I personally think that in
like 10 years or at least like when my
generation is grown up and has like kids
as we move onwards in life the majority
of people will become vegetarian or
vegan at this point eating meat is just
a habit in our lives pretend I'm not a
vegetarian it's like I have been eating
meat for 20 straight years of my life
it's just something that's a part of my
diet something that I eat something that
it's a part of my routine and like my
health
meat is so
ingrained in our culture and like
lifestyle and diet right now that people
don't see it as being a weird thing but
I personally believe that once people
have more awareness of what goes on
behind like processing meat mass
producing meat people won't be so
inclined to eat it because I know that
when I like ate meat I had known if I
had seen the actual process of cattle
being turned into like hamburger meat I
would never eat meat I'd be so disgusted
I'm definitely someone who cannot do
violence or gorse like if I see it like
start to happen I just like fast forward
that part of the movie I'm not gonna
watch that there are a lot of
documentaries that cover that and if I
can't physically watch a cow being
processed into like hamburger meat then
I don't think that I should be eating
that mean if I get grossed out by the
process like I should not be actually
eating the product you know and I
actually didn't go vegetarian because of
animal cruelty I just did it for the
health reasons because I watched like
YouTube videos about the health benefits
of going vegetarian and then I watched I
think it was Forks Over knives on
Netflix so me just being like a selfish
individual I was like I want to try
beigan ism or vegetarianism for the
health benefits and to see if they
really make a difference now that I am
vegetarian and have been for the last
year if I'm walking through the meat
aisle of a grocery store like the slabs
of meat literally remind me of a dead
body like if you were to cut up me and I
died and you put my like limbs and meat
and like that in a grocery store in the
meat section like that's what it reminds
me of like I would just never want to
touch the meat because it was once a
dead body and it's just like sitting in
the grocery store for people to like
took people for people to grab and like
cook and it's just like so gross to me
now but even a month into my
vegetarianism now look at chicken
fingers and be like well I'm really sad
that I can't have that right now but
it's just because it's like not healthy
for me so like I didn't even go into
this whole thing thank you
that it'd be for the animals but now it
just seems so foreign and really really
weird to me that people actually still
eat meat and like I'm not trying to
offend anyone it's just something that I
choose not to do but that's a very
interesting thing that happened to me
like that's an interesting side effect
of being a vegetarian that I didn't
really expect so I think that once
people actually become aware of the
process that is behind like what happens
when animals become food I think that a
lot of people would be much less
inclined to eat meat also I think that
if the studies that are out there right
now that I've seen in like vegan
documentaries or like all that stuff if
those are true I definitely think that
veganism and vegetarianism are going to
increase like more people are going to
become vegan and vegetarian and this is
kind of backed by a statistic that I
heard 1% of my parents generation was
vegan or vegetarian 14% of my generation
is vegan slash vegetarian so I think
that as we progress in time like more
people are gonna be vegetarian
I just think that's like the future
watch me watch this video and like 10
years and be like wow so but yeah as of
right now with my knowledge into my
understanding like I really truly think
that like not eating meat and even
animal by-products is like the
healthiest possible diet you can have
and the most humane diet that you can
have I got a comment on this one time
thing I blogged about it where I was
like I've been trying to eat vegan like
I'm vegan 90% of the time and someone
got super super offended that I had
called myself a vegan for like 90% of
the time and their argument was that
people devote their whole lives to the
vegan cause and that I shouldn't call
myself a vegan if I'm not 100% vegan or
like haven't dedicated like a lot of
time in my life to veganism and like
animal cruelty basically the argument
was just that I shouldn't call myself a
vegan because I wasn't truly began' but
the problem with that for me is just
that I understand that
is a difference between veganism and
like a plant-based diet and I probably
should have said like I'm eating a
plant-based diet 90% of the time like I
agree with all the things that meeting
ISM stands for it's just that at this
point in my life like I've been so used
to consuming like animal products and
like yeah maybe I would like to get to a
point where I'm how to percent vegan and
don't have any like animal products like
leather and stuff like that but up until
like a year ago I just had no idea that
this was a thing in life and so the
problem that I had with that comment is
that veganism and like people who are
promoting veganism for me it was through
my video it's like oh I'm trying to be
vegan it shouldn't matter what stage
they are with veganism at their life and
it shouldn't matter that like I'm saying
oh I begin most of the time the only
thing that vegan activist should care
about is that people are making an
effort to progress and like learn about
veganism and become vegan or like become
vegetarian or just making those baby
steps to consume less animal products
there are tons of people out there who
just have no idea who eat all types of
animal by-products and like animals and
Mead so to have that person who eats
steak like for every single meal each
day three times a day
that's disgusting but like if that
person were to just take red meat out of
their diet
that'd be saving so much meat from being
consumed shouldn't matter what point
someone is with their journey as long as
they're making an effort and making
steps towards the same movement that you
agree with you know I was so annoyed by
that comment I think I commented back
niles like it shouldn't matter that I'm
like saying I eat vegan most of the time
like I'm sorry that offends you but for
me that means that I'm making an effort
towards your cause and as long as I'm
making an effort and agreeing with your
cause like that should be good enough
that's why I think that if I do become
fully vegan and like commit to that
lifestyle for like the rest of my life
or something I wouldn't admit it on
YouTube or like a public space where
other people I can see like what I'm
talking about because I've seen so many
youtubers tell their audience that
they're vegan and then every single
video after that it doesn't matter if
it's a hundred percent not related to
veganism or like
Jainism are animals at all it's like oh
I saw like your boots that you bought
like in fifth grade are you really a
vegan like if you have a boots so like
that's just something that I probably
will never admit even if I do go begin
except I am going to do a vegan
experiment for a month next month or
this month actually so I will admit that
on my channel but like there are people
and vegans who just kind of I think make
veganism less attractive to try out and
to be so I will personally just never be
one of those so yeah I actually asked
you guys to ask me questions about being
a vegetarian on my Instagram if you are
not following my sista gram I always do
my like Q&amp;amp;A or I always take my comments
my questions from Instagram so feel free
to follow me at Emory chase but yeah I'm
gonna answer some of the questions that
you guys had about being a vegetarian
for a year so let's see
Mallory asks what are the benefits oh I
actually wanted to talk about this
something that I have noticed is that
with veganism especially like I was
vegan I think for like a straight month
because I wanted to try it out with
veganism especially it doesn't matter
how much I would eat like I would never
feel like disgustingly bloated like I
used to like feel a lot or like
sometimes do with even vegetarian foods
plant-based foods especially are really
low in calories they don't take up as
much space in your stomach so like when
you eat a lot of it you just don't feel
as bad and then I just am never as
bloated as I used to be like when I eat
ate a lot of meat I remember one time I
had Korean barbecue like once every
other week and I literally puked after I
ate it one time that was last time I had
a Korean barbecue I haven't had it since
and I probably literally saving like two
to three pounds a year from just not
eating Korean barbecue but um yeah I
have actually noticed even though the
vegetarianism like I don't really watch
what I eat on a day-to-day like I don't
calorie restrict I don't really count my
like whatever like Oreos I don't know
what else you would do but overall I
just feel like
I don't feel as bloated and just
generally I know that I weigh less like
I don't weigh myself cuz I feel like
that's like also not very healthy and
like not good for your body image but I
know that I am like less heavy and I
just feel less heavy which is also as
important and then I have a lot of
comments on am I going vegan I think is
pretty much I think I answered actually
like all these in this video anyways
don't have any like solid plans on going
straight vegan but I do like try to eat
plant-based as much as possible also if
you are a vegan please answer this
question if you get offended when people
like just try begin ism for a month
because it's not really fully like
becoming vegan or if you'd prefer people
call it like eating plant-based let me
know cuz I honestly have no idea if you
guys have any more questions please be
sure to ask them in the comments below
I hope this is like not too jumbled and
I hope it was helpful for those of you
who are like sitting vegetarianism I
could definitely do a follow-up video
because I feel like this might have been
really jumbled thank you guys so much
