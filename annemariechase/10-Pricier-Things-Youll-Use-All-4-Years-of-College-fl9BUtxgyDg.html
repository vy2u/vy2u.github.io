with a hopefully very helpful video for
you guys a lot of people at this time
are searching for what to bring to
college I was in the exact same position
two years ago now so I actually have a
video of vlog all of that stuff on what
I brought to college and then the year
before that my sister went to college so
I have her entire list of things that
she wrote for me to bring to college so
I'll have those linked in the
description box below as well as the
college playlist that I've updated this
is kind of a stressful time because you
have to buy so much stuff and some of it
can get really expensive and you're just
not sure what's worth it or not since I
am an upcoming junior I've kind of had
some time to reflect on the things that
I brought to college when I was a
freshman and just things that I've
purchased over my years being here so I
decided what would be super helpful at
least to me as an incoming freshman is
to make a quick list of 10 things that
are more expensive items but that are
just really worth the investment of
purchasing these items for all four
years of college every college is
different so it'll probably be different
on each college you go to so hope this
is helpful for you guys and that's
always be sure to subscribe to my
channel for more college videos I didn't
want this to be the video that I
announced it in because I just was not
expecting it but we hit 100,000
subscribers on this channel which is
mind-blowing but I want to make a
dedicated video to that I just had to
mention it because there was no way that
I couldn't thank you guys so much but
let's get into the video the first thing
that I highly recommend are noise
cancelling headphones whether that be
Bose these are my personal favorite I've
been using them since high school or
like beats I just I am NOT a fan of
Beats for something especially for an
introvert I really like to create my own
space but living in an apartment with
eight people just being surrounded by
people constantly in college that's
pretty hard to do whether it be studying
in the library I'm someone who cannot
have like external noise while I'm
studying or taking a nap and then my
headphones have been really helpful for
me when I'm like really stressed out
doing homework just put on some really
upbeat music and then just like do your
homework while listening to music the
next thing that I would suggest is not
as high on my list of priorities to get
speakers whether it's getting ready in
the morning with my roommate or just
getting ready in the morning
by myself having nice speakers that last
your music is so helpful for lightening
up the moon in your room you want to
make your space comfortable in an
environment that you can really thrive
in you don't want it to be something
that's really important to you and
uncomfortable so anything really that
you can add that will help your
environment really does make a
difference and then this is also really
helpful for pre games if you're into
that so the next thing is so important
and I realize that now but I didn't at
the time when I was kind of shopping for
my college things that is just anything
related to your bed so when I was
shopping for my freshman dorm my mom
bought me like this really really nice
mattress topper she's very frugal and so
I'm very frugal and I was just like mom
that's really expensive I don't really
think I need that and she was just like
ma you know what try it out and if you
don't really think it's necessary then
we can return it I used it and it made
such a huge difference my bed is
literally the most comfortable bed sleep
is just so important in college and I
don't know I feel like this is just like
a no-brainer having a really comfortable
bed
so what I would do is out invest in a
good mattress topper if you're thinking
that your college beds might not be very
comfortable Becky right here this is my
blanket that I brought from home you
have like a baby blanket or like a
stuffed animal that you just really
couldn't live without
honestly just bring it now it's going to
judge you for it and you can hide it if
you think that people are so the next
thing is a good computer it's more
trouble to keep like having problems
with an old computer or just a computer
that doesn't work they're just buying a
new computer because in college you just
really really really need computers if
your computer does end up crashing it's
honestly heartbreaking and it's just so
stressful just be safe and keep all of
your stuff backed up with an external
hard drive and invest in a computer
that's not going to fail on you okay so
the next thing is kind of another
unnecessary thing but definitely a
really really good investment for me at
least and that is a vacuum I actually
brought mine down from Alaska in my car
when I drove my car down I think I've
learned from living with other people
that I am a germaphobe I'm not even a
super clean person I'm just like I'm I
need things to be sanitary also if you
have a vacuum with an extension like
mine has a little extension where you
can kind
you know get little nooks and crannies
and like bow cracks I actually stuck up
all my bugs with that there's literally
a huge bug on my chair right now and I
was literally sitting there i vacuumed
it up oh my god it might not seem like
it's necessary during freshman year but
especially we're going to use it through
all of your years it's definitely a good
thing to consider buying and I also have
like the handheld ones which might be
really helpful and a lot cheaper the
next thing I will definitely invest in
is either a coffee maker if you drink
coffee or an electric hot water heater I
personally drink a lot of coffee but I
also drink a lot of tea so my ideal pair
for this get an electric hot water
heater and then a French press then you
can use the electric hot water heater
for your teas and your ramens and your a
cup of noodles and like whatever else
you use that for and then you can use
your French press for coffee because I
just hate it when you're using like a
coffee maker for tea water and then it
tastes like coffee just all bad okay
this next thing really depends on your
campus but I would highly recommend
looking up to see what kind of
transportation people are using on your
campus when I toured USC I noticed that
everyone had bikes and for some reason
like the people transportation were like
oh you really don't need a bike no I
like use my bike to go everywhere cuz I
kind of have bad ankles and I'm like
lazy so I biked to every single class
every single day I use my bike all the
time you should probably wait to do this
until you're I or college maybe to find
out if you do need this for my campus
USC is really flat so I literally bike
everywhere but UCLA their campus is
super hilly so apparently no one rides
bikes everyone just walks ok so this one
is a little controversial apparently
according to my Hall like three four
years ago two years ago I don't know I
would highly recommend investing in a
good sturdy backpack and the reason for
this isn't so it looks really cute
well I win my backpack one time and my
mom's gonna get super mad at me but one
time I backpack with literally 20 pounds
so you're carrying this backpack that is
like the size of a small child around on
your back all day possibly that's not
that's just not good for your back so
plant don't get a cheap backpack that's
just super high-fashion you honestly
like it could give you back problems
like I notice immediately if I'm
carrying a heavy backpack that my back
hurts
the next thing I've mentioned this and a
lot of videos before and then is my
hydro flask water bottle this is a
phenomenon that I will never understand
but I don't know why every single person
doesn't have one and I'm actually seeing
it a lot more in California but this is
a very popular water bottle and Alaska
and Hawaii for some reason so Hydra
flask water bottles are just bottles
that will keep your hot stuff hot and
your cold stuff cold my friend Rachel
entered this like convention and they
said that they had ice that lasted two
days in these Hydra flask water bottles
you're going to be drinking water you
should be drinking water and you can
reduce waste
by using this instead of buying water
bottles on campus and Jacob I'm just
always surprised by how many people
don't have a water bottle to just buy
water bottles every day and that's
literally a waste of money so invest in
a nice water bottle and my favorites for
the last few years have been hydro glass
okay this next thing is definitely
geared more towards girls I didn't bring
this college my first week and then I
immediately had my mom send it over in
the mail because I was like I need this
a vanity preferably with a light on it
especially if you and your roommate have
different sleep schedules or different
schedules where you have to wake up I
usually do my makeup on my desk in the
room so I can just turn that light on
from the vanity instead of you know
turning on all the lights in the room
and then she doesn't have to wake up and
I can do my makeup in peace and see what
I'm doing the whole time much better
than having to like go up to the
bathroom turning on the light and like
looking at it real close while you do
your makeup cuz you can't really see it
so those are the list of ten things that
I definitely consider investing in and
college be sure to let me know what
other videos that you guys want to see
for me so that I can get started on
those as always I'm on Instagram Twitter
I've been tweeting a lot and
snapchatting a ton so if you want to see
what I'm up to be sure to scan my QR
code thank you guys so much for watching
and I will talk to you guys very soon
bye hello so we're gonna go right to the
video just so there's the seats
the first tip that I would have you guys
do on maybe like the first day of
classes actually you want to sit down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
