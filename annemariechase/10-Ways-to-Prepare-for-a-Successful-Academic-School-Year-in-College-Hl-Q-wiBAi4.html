not gonna be like with you okay hey guys
its Amory and today I'm with two special
one Boop
hello I'm Brooke I'm Kathryn so today
we're doing a really fun college
collaboration on my channel we're
talking about like the first week of
college and what to expect and then this
video is gonna be how to prepare for a
successful school year uh yeah if you
click over to me I'll be doing a whole
guide to college moving day so if we
worried about that I'll have a bunch of
tips on my channel be sure to check out
both of their channels and subscribe
after you're done watching this one
thanks alright let's get into the video
like transition yeah hello again so
we're gonna go right into the video just
so that this isn't too long the first
tip that I would have you guys do on
maybe like the first day of classes
actually you want to sit down with your
agenda computer for iCal or Google
Calendar
you're gonna write every single thing
down from your syllabi from all your
classes and just put every assignment
any due date any project date basically
anything that you see from your syllabi
you're going to transfer onto this
calendar and this has to be a point of
reference that you actually look at
often and go to otherwise this is going
to be pointless the cheapest method that
would probably work best for me is just
literally printing out calendars and
then writing this on those sheets of
paper a little bit of organization goes
such such a long way you're gonna really
think yourself later when you can just
see visually what you'll have to do for
the next month or next week or even the
next day
okay so right after you do your own
calendar you are going to make the exact
same thing with all of your professors
as well as your TAS office hours and
when I did this I think I took the very
difficult approach and I made like my
own calendar with like the little time
slots like I mean every single thing you
can enter this in Google Calendar you
can enter this in AI calendar you're
definitely going to want to include the
time their names just in case you don't
know them which is kind of sad but it
does happen
and then something that's really
important is to write down the building
and room number that they're in cuz I
didn't do this and let me just say I'll
save you a lot of trouble
telling you to write that in the first
place now I'm going to give you some
life-changing advice for when you're
actually like going to school and going
to class and the first thing is go to
class there are just so many reasons why
you should go to class like first of all
a lot of professors really just value
when people actually come in their class
no one likes to feel unloved and if
there's no one at the professor's class
he's probably gonna favor them and give
them tips for the finals or something
like that just go to class overall go to
class go to your office hours this is
actually such a life hack that not a lot
of people really utilize and it just
really doesn't make any sense
you get today professors better they get
to know you and if they're at cut offs
or trying to determine grade cut offs
they'll definitely remember your face
and remember that you came in also
they're the people who know the material
that they're teaching you best this has
actually saved me hours of time trying
to figure it out myself
first just going there for like 10
minutes and having them explain it in a
different way it's a little bit hard at
first because it's a little awkward but
trust me especially if you establish
this like relationship early on it'll
just be easier to keep coming back and
if you establish relationships with each
of your professors you'll have a big
pool of professors to come back to when
you need their help or reference for
something okay so now I'm going to move
into a little bit more study related
tips the first tip that I have is to
find a place that will be your study
space so my place is the library when I
go to the library like a switch has
flipped and I just know that it's time
to study versus when I come here it's
like oh like I could be studying or I
could take a break and then come back
and study and it just really doesn't
work out so have a place a designated
place to study this next one is like a
little bit weird but I would just
recommend making friends or trying to
make friends with smart people and this
doesn't mean using the Nerds or smart
people just genuinely like make
friendships with people that are
studious and work hard in class a girl
and my sorority actually was in my
finance class I think she did probably
like the third or second best cuz there
was this one guy who's just real smart
but I always sat next to her for class
and we always studied together and I
didn't like I didn't do as well as her
but she helped me learn
so so much better than if I had tried
learning it myself
so it's really really really beneficial
and it's just all around like a much
more fun way to study is with someone
else but you really can't do that unless
that person is really studious another
huge tip that I always could use give
yourself enough time this is the problem
that I always run into and I don't do so
well on a test or an assignment it's not
that I'm not smart enough it's literally
just that I am unprepared or didn't give
myself enough time which kind of makes
me like not smart in a way but also it's
just it's not that I can't do it it's
just that I didn't prepare enough which
also goes along with a comment that I
got on YouTube from my last video that I
posted as I do read all of your comments
but this comment was from Sonia and she
said how do you not get intimidated
being surrounded by super intelligent
people being by smart people in classes
makes me really intimidated even though
I have a 4.0 this literally used to be
me in high school I joined what was
called like the highly gifted program at
my high school where a lot of people
were in it since elementary school
because they went to a feeder school
into this highly gifted program in
middle school and high school but I
joined it much later and I just felt
like I kind of didn't belong I wasn't as
smart as these people I've actually
learned so much from having this
experience of not thinking that I was
good enough or smart enough surrounded
by all these like really intelligent
people first of all it's really okay to
feel this way and I think that as time
progresses and as you grow up you'll
definitely learn a lot from it but I
think the biggest thing is that you'll
learn that you were really foolish and
silly to think that you weren't smart
enough to be surrounded by these smart
people or that you weren't as smart as
these people if you truly feel like you
don't belong and this kippur people just
fake it until you make it and this
sounds like such a cliche and it kind of
is but this is such a great tip for all
aspects of life someone that you think
is really smart might think the exact
same thing that you're thinking that
they're not good enough to be around all
these smart people so you just never
know and never assume that people think
you're dumb because I can almost
guarantee you that no one thinks that if
people do in fact think that you're dumb
and don't belong there
let them I love being underestimated
because have you guys ever heard the
quote haters are my motivators yeah I
take that quote very seriously I think
that it's really easy to take that
motivation from those people who don't
think that you can do something and turn
it into something really productive and
just prove them wrong it's perfect but
don't make that your like life goal
because then you just like cultivate a
lot of hate hatred and it's probably not
healthy for you now I'm going to move
into the mental and physical health
aspect of this because this is just as
important as all the other things that I
talked about the first thing is
something that I sometimes have a hard
time with and that is if you have a slip
up don't get discouraged there are just
so many times where I have like a little
slip-up or a grade doesn't go as I plan
and I'm kind of just really really
discouraged from it and just don't
really don't revive it that is not the
thing to do see this as your opportunity
to make this your project and succeed at
it and then the second thing that I
really want to touch on is that
overexertion is not cute and we should
not romanticize it you need balance in
your life you need to exercise you need
to sleep enough and if you don't for a
certain week or day then you need to
catch up on the weekend or whenever you
can over exertion and overworking
yourself is just not cool it's not
sustainable so let's just stop
romanticizing it and the last tip that I
have before my battery dies is to be
optimistic that you will have a great
year because this will just point you in
the right direction and set you up for
success for actually having a great year
