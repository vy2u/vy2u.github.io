decided to film a beach makeup tutorial
and I thought spring break would be the
perfect time to post it so hopefully
some of you guys still have spring break
ahead of you because i'm currently in my
spring break and this is kind of late
starting off from using my Neutrogena
facial moisturizer with an SPF of 25 I
don't know everyone likes to burn
themselves but that's not good for your
skin like bad for your skin so use
sunscreen the jack black chapstick that
I really like to use also has an SPF of
25 which is nice for going out in the
Sun and then I'm going straight to
eyebrows and gelling them down because
before I shaped and wax my eyebrows when
I got home so they looked a little bit
crazy so when I get super hot my whole
face gets really read as you guys can
see so I'm using this hello flawless
oxygen while foundation from benefit
which also has an SPF of 25 and this
just evens at my skin tone a lot and
this foundation was super super light so
I really liked it for the beach
something just fell your body looks mad
that's my new favorite chat-up line if
you guys want to watch my TMI tag i
talked about chat up lines but this one
is my new favorite one so then i'm going
over with more foundation using a real
techniques a real techniques foundation
brush in order to get a fuller coverage
because my skin just gets really really
red when i'm hot and then i'm setting
this all with a setting powder mostly
focusing on my t-zone in order to reduce
the oiliness and shininess to fill in
the sparse areas of my eyebrows i'm
using the darkest matte shade in the
two-faced natural eye makeup palette it
is called sex presso and i really like
bringing this palette to vacation
because you can never really go wrong
with a natural look but it also has some
darker more dramatic shades if you want
to dress it up a bit then i'm applying
my mac cream color base pearl frost
highlighter and this is something that
I've been raving about for like the last
two months I absolutely love this stuff
so I'm applying this on the highlights
of my cheekbones and then kind of
blending it out as best I can and this
looks so great when the Sun hits your
face because it's just like a little bit
of shimmer without being too sparkly or
glittery or anything like that so this
is so pretty to put on when you're going
to sit under the sun and i'm also
applying this to my brow bones next i'm
using my Mac Paint Pot and bear study
and I'm just applying this as an
eyeshadow this is something that is
super super simple to do and I just do
it whenever I don't feel like spending a
lot of time on my makeup and then i'm
using my NYX jumbo eye pencil and milk
and I'm applying this to the inner
corners of my eyes and then probably
like a third along the lower lash line
and then I'm blending this out with my
fingers and then over top of that i'm
using my mac eyeshadow and shroom and
this is also something that I've been
obsessed with this is the perfect inner
corner highlight color because it's just
so natural looking and over top of the
NYX jumbo eye liner pencil it just looks
so good and makes your eyes look so
awake
and then going back to my too faced
natural eye palette i'm using the color
Velvet Revolver just really lightly to
accentuate my crease and this just gives
a nice holistic complete eye makeup look
instead of just having a bunch of light
colors all over for my eyeliner I'm
using this make up forever aqua eyes
waterproof eyeliner this is perfect for
the beach where or just like sweat wear
because it is waterproof and I also
really like this because it's really
blendable so I'm going for a natural
makeup look and that's just perfect for
this I got this as one of those birthday
gifts that you get if you're like signed
up in the Sephora system and I really
really really like this eyeliner a lot I
use it every single day as always I'm
finishing up the eye makeup look by
curling my lashes and for mascara I'm
using the Maybelline the mega plush
volume Express mascara this is
waterproof which is really nice for
beach wear button terms of anything else
like it doesn't really lengthen or
thicken the appearance of your eyelashes
it just adds that dark shade and then
finally i'm using the NYX butter gloss
lip gloss in the color apple strudel
after awkwardly waiting for this guy to
walk by it's really funny because you
don't realize how weird making YouTube
videos is until you're out on a beach
filming yourself doing your makeup or
until you try to explain it to someone
who's over 30 so that is you completed
makeup look I really hope you guys
enjoyed it and found it helpful I know
that it was a little bit late for spring
break at least for my spring break but I
thought I would put it up anyways
it's a filming
ever
so I hope you guys are having or had or
are gonna have an awesome spring break
and I will talk to you in my next video
bye all the time and these fuzzy socks
that i got from costco ever been in love
yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
