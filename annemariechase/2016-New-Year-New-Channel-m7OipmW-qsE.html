have no idea what this video how this
video is gonna be or turn out or
anything but I know that I wanted to
film and post video today as you
probably may be able to tell I am
actually in a hotel room cuz I spent my
last few days in Hawaii so I spend the
new year here what did I could do oh I
was the only one who didn't fall asleep
in my hotel room man and I also spent my
birthday here so it's been a really
really good good relaxing week in Hawaii
but I knew that I wanted to make a video
post it on my main channel because I
have not posted a video and so long I've
neglected this channel so much so if you
guys have been with me for a little
while you guys know that new year's
resolutions are my job like I love them
so one of my biggest ones is to start
posting more this channel because I do
love you tube and the community that it
gives me and it's just such a cool place
and I always have the coolest ideas for
videos but then I just never do them and
that actually really annoys me so one of
my resolutions was just to post every
single week and it doesn't matter like
what video it's gonna be if I feel like
it's not good enough I'm still gonna
post it and even if i don't have an idea
for it kind of like this one I'm just
gonna post something so I thought I
would start off my new year's a right
and actually continue with my new year's
resolutions of posting on this channel
Oh yesterday was my birthday is January
fifth me and Kalin went parasailing
those first time Callie went and we just
had a blast like the views were amazing
and on my birthday I got like all the
birthday messages and texts and tweets
and stuff and it just made me feel so
grateful for the people that are in my
life I am like very lucky to have the
relationships that I do oh we also we
also swim with turtles and I got cool
footage of them and we swim with them
basically so my life is now me if you
guys want to see some of the adventures
that I've been having here I'm Wiggly
blogging but I did daily vlog every
single day of the summer and I didn't
even tell you guys on this main channel
because I haven't posted a video in that
long so I have I did vlog miss all on my
channel so you guys might have some
videos to catch up on if you want to and
I've also
posting a lot of Instagram photos
because Hawaii is like Instagram goals
so so even though this video is probably
gonna be a huge doubled mess I just
wanted a post video because I thought
that this trip to why I was really
symbolic of how I want 2016 to be and
how know it's gonna be full of new
adventures with a people that I love and
hopefully I can capture some or all of
it not all of it but some of it on
videos and make some really really cool
videos for you guys to come along and
watch with so here is a little montage
is that what they're called of the
adventures that I've been having so far
and what I want the rest of this year to
be like so here's to 2016 all right
thank you guys so much for watching i
love you guys so much and i hope you
guys enjoy this little montage if that's
what's cool huh ok bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
