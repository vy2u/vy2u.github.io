with a fourth of July collab with beauty
shop 15 and Christina rose both girls
from the Beauty smartie showdown so
today I have the very wearable day to
night transformation fourth of July look
and outfit and nails and hair and
everything be sure to check out their
channels when you're finished watching
this one and I'll have their links below
and they annotate it throughout this
video because both of these girls are
amazing at makeup and have amazing
quality videos so go check them out and
subscribe to their channels so I hope
you guys enjoy this video you probably
noticed that we were all going for the
red lip so before I even put on any
makeup I always use this lip balm from
Jack black because this stuff is amazing
and it also has an SPF of 25 for these
hot summer days so this step is pretty
important especially if you live
somewhere where it's really really sunny
every single day for summer you should
definitely be applying a moisturizer
with SPF or just sunscreen so I wanted
something really lasting because it is
aids day to night transition so I want
it to last all night long through the
heat and whatever so I used my Revlon
Colorstay because this stuff is amazing
for a lasting where and it's also really
buildable which is what I like so here
I'm showing you guys what one layer of
the Revlon Colorstay looks like and then
I'll show you how buildable it is by
applying a second layer and then I use
my marshmallow puffs and bounce it all
over my face for a very streak-free and
flawless finish lately I've been getting
these awesome dark circles under my eyes
because of my lack of sleep and messed
up sleeping schedules so I've been using
this Laura Mercier duo concealer palette
I've been using the lighter color which
is a little bit too light for my
skintone and then going over with the
darker color and I found that this makes
me look much more awake than just going
with the darker color that matches my
skin tone a lot better and then I use my
marshmallow puffs of bluntness to
together
next I filled in my eyebrows using my
typical two-faced eyebrow and beak it
I wanted bold eyebrows to make this kind
of a statement look but if you want this
to be more romantic and softer look then
you don't have to make your eyebrows
bowl
I used my NARS Laguna bronzer in order
to give my cheekbones a little bit of a
contour I put what I had left over on my
brush to the temples of my forehead and
also just blended this out to settle my
foundation I use the loose powder and a
putnis mostly to my t-zone where it gets
a little bit more oily during the summer
I've been wanting to try this for a
really long time and I finally found a
baby urban decay setting spray so I just
sprayed this on after I finished
applying all of my face makeup for those
of us who are not planning on going
all-out with their makeup for the fourth
of July I just decided to do a simple
winged liner with the red lip so I just
used a really soft eye liner and then
kind of manipulated the wings a little
bit with a brush and I think this is the
easiest way to do winged liner by far
then I brighten my eyes by using a white
liner and the inner corners and lower
lash line
next I pulled my lashes and applied my
very favorite mascara which is they are
real by benefit and then I finished off
the eyes with one of my favorite
products this is lanique lower lashline
mascara and doing this step really makes
your eyes appear a lot bigger I added a
highlight to the places where the light
hits my face very naturally which is my
eyebrow bones and my cheekbones and then
just blended this out with my finger the
next thing I did was apply my red
lipstick and this is Revlon's number 29
in red lacquer this lipstick is super
long-lasting so it'll definitely get you
through it 4th of July parade up until
the fireworks to make the lips a little
bit more fun and flirty I use this bare
minerals marvelous Moxie and ring
glitter and this is definitely my
favorite lip gloss before using any
heating tools for my hair I use a heat
protectant spray which is really
important especially during the summer
because your hair is already kind of
getting fried to the Sun so be sure to
protect it with heat protectant and
moisturizing renew your products so as
you can see I just spread the heat
protectant and then brush it out and my
system of straightening my hair is I
just take a hair and then throw it to
the back and then repeat until I'm all
done but this doesn't really work out
when I have a whole new layer of hair
because I have a ton of hair so I kind
of just straighten whatever needs to be
straightened so the look that I was
going for with a little part with too
little side twists and to do this you
just test out which areas of hair you
think would look good being pulled back
and then once you do that you just set
aside some hair at the very front divide
the other part of hair that you have
into two and then start twisting by
setting aside that part of hair at the
very beginning and adding it only after
you start twisting it gives the twist a
little bit of volume instead of just
being flat on your head
for now to hold it into place I'm using
bobby pins in an X and you can also
finish the hairstyle like this and have
them meet together like a little bit of
a halo but I feel like this doesn't last
as long for my hair because my hair is
really thick so what I do is I just
twist them a little more to bring them
together and then I like to clip it in
the back I really love this hairstyle
because it's really girly and feminine
and very bold but it's also really
really easy and simple to do and it
takes like less than 3 minutes the
hardest part is definitely making the
two braids look symmetrical so I'm going
to show you guys my day-to-night outfits
and usually on the fourth of July it's
July so it's pretty hot outside so I
decided to go with a hotter outfit so
this shirt is from Charlotte Russe and
it's a crop top and then the back it has
a kind of a bow thing but my brother
didn't go all the way down so I just put
a bando on and that bando is from airy
and then I have some pretty short
high-waisted shorts and these are just
from Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch cuz Kelly got a
job there and there are super discounted
and on my feet I have the all star
converse that everyone on YouTube seems
to have in a Cepheid I didn't have too
much blue so I decided to paint an
accent finger blue and then for jewelry
this ring is from a know and then this
bracelet is from Nordstrom and it was
like $7 alright so this is my night
outfit and basically the base thing that
I changed was this maxi skirt from
brandy melville and I also pulled it up
a little bit higher than the waist just
so it's more flattering and also this
little slit shows more which I like and
these spiked sandals are from Charlotte
Russe and they also have like a gold
spike so it matches my bracelet that has
like little gold embellishments - thank
you so much for watching guys I hope you
guys enjoyed it make sure to go
subscribe to beauty shock 15 and
Christine Rose because they're amazing
