moment ran it back
kind of matches my shirt a little bit
hey guys Samri welcome back to my
channel and for those of you who are new
subscribers are new to my channel
welcome there is currently someone
drilling a hole in something outside
beautiful so one of the things that I
absolutely look forward to literally the
night before like before and falling
asleep is eating breakfast I was lucky
enough to be blessed with a mother who
loves cooking and its really good at it
and she made me breakfast all the time
going to college next semester where
I'll have to cook for myself which is
not something that I'm to say so I
decided to make some very easy and
healthy breakfast options for you guys
if you are looking for something to eat
in the morning I hope you guys enjoy and
if you try the breakfast be sure to like
tweet me pictures of them if you do and
let me know how you like them in the
comments below so let's get into the
video first breakfast that I'm going to
show you guys it's super super simple
but it is one of my favorites and that
is a yogurt parfait so what do you need
you need some chia seeds chia seeds have
so many health benefits I had no idea
then some yogurt this Honey Greek yogurt
is my absolute favorite
I could seriously eat this for every
single meal some granola I'm using some
homemade granola that my mom made and
then I'm using some berries for fruit
but really any fruit works so the best
thing about this breakfast is that you
can make it to go really easy and pro
tip if you put it in a mason jar it also
just looks really trendy and cute so
breakfast goals so like I said this
breakfast is super super simple to make
so the hardest part I guess of this
entire thing is deciding how much of
each ingredient you want to put in your
bowl I like to fill it mostly with fruit
in order to get my daily fruit and
take-in for the morning and then I like
to put the yogurt next and here's me
eating from the tub don't tell Mom I'll
usually try to stick to the serving size
of yogurt in the parfait and then I like
to top it all off with granola mixed
with chia seeds and chia seeds are like
the recurring theme in this video
because they have a ton of really
important nutrients which make them a
really healthy and easy way to get these
nutrients into your diet so after you
pour the granola and chia seeds onto the
yogurt it's pretty much good to go
okay so the next one is avvocato toast
and this is also one of my favorites and
this breakfast is just like surprisingly
good like you wouldn't expect it to be
so good but it is I promise
so for this still need some bread I have
the Dave's killer bread power sieve
because again it is full of nutrients
half of an avocado some arugula and if
you like them grape tomatoes also I add
salt and pepper in the end so the first
thing you can do is pop your toast in
the toaster and while you're doing that
you can mash up an avocado into a bowl
or just directly onto the toast when
it's time to put it on so I just use
half of an avocado and that worked
really well for me then I'm just cutting
up like four grape tomatoes cuz I really
enjoy these and I think they make a
really good touch on this toast so in
mitosis don't toasting I just spread my
mashed up avocado onto the toast and
spread it out real nice and even just
like that beautiful and then I put salt
and pepper on top of the avocado and
then on top of that I put some arugula
on it
arugula mixed with avocado mix with like
salt and pepper tastes so good so I just
like to pile like a big handful and then
I put grape tomatoes on top of that this
kind of looks like the least appealing
or like used appetizing breakfast option
but trust me try it and I think you guys
will love it
okay so here's another toast option if
you weren't feeling vegetables in the
morning so again super super simple so
what you'll need again is some bread
some peanut butter a banana and chia
seeds all I have to do is spread your
peanut butter onto the piece of bread I
decided not to toast it this time next
you just cut up a ripe banana and then
put the banana pieces on top of the
piece of toast and I decided to put some
honey on top of the bananas and peanut
butter because I don't really eat honey
that often so I thought this is a good
opportunity to get some honey into my
diet and finally of course I just
sprinkled some chia seeds over the top
of everything and that is it super super
fast and easy
this next one is for you meat lovers or
those who like a hearty or breakfast and
that is just a breakfast burrito so for
this you will need some wraps I got this
spinach wrap egg whites or just regular
eggs sausage or bacon whichever you
prefer cheese and salsa so I'm just
heating up these sausages on the stove
and then at the same time I like to cook
the egg whites so after everything is
done cooking and warming up we just put
the egg whites on top of the wrap and
then the sausage or the bacon or
whatever you chose to use and then I
just like to put some cheese on top of
that and then top it all off of salsa
and like the salsa really completes this
so that's like a must for me next you
just wrap it up like a burrito like the
burrito that it is and this is kind of
like the hardest part honestly for me
just wrapping it up into a edible
burrito and then I like to just pop that
in the microwave so that all of the
cheese and everything will melt together
so after that's all done I just like to
cut it in half and look at how delicious
that looks so good and then it's done
I need loving loving I needed now so
this final breakfast option is for those
people who don't really like to eat
anything in the morning I know a lot of
people like fat
so this Chia juice is a really good way
to get nutrients into your body to start
off your morning and all you'll need is
one cup of your favorite juice 1 cup of
water and 3 tablespoons of chia seeds
the first thing that I'm doing is
combining the chia seeds and the cup of
water so you'll just want to make sure
that you mix this really well afterwards
so that the chia seeds are not clumping
together and then all I have to do is
add the juice so I'm just adding a cup
of juice filled every single time I've
tried making this so far I'm just so not
talented in this area could you be bad
at pouring things apparently also if you
want your juice to be sweeter
be sure to add some more juice because
juice usually has a lot of sugar in it
so I would add 1 to 2 cups depending on
how sweet you want it to be and that is
seriously it after that all you have to
do is put it in the fridge for about 8
hours so if you make this the night
before this would be perfect and good to
go and then when it's all done it turns
into the weirdest consistency I cannot
explain it it's just like you have to
try this in order to understand what I'm
talking about so definitely try it and
this is a really good alternative to
just drinking like juice in the morning
just add some chia seeds the night
before and you'll be good
and I gotta get one little taste
