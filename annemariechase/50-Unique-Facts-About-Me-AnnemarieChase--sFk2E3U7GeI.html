filming the 50 facts about me tag for
some reason I just started watching
these on YouTube and I've really been
liking them so I decided that I would
come up with 50 unique facts about me
and really not a lot of people know
these facts about me and I had a really
really fun and very hard time actually
finding these unique 50 facts so I'm
gonna just get started really fast
because I don't want this video to be
too long so yeah let's get started
my name is anne marie with no spaces no
capital letters at all one word but on
my birth certificate
it's and marie with a space and a
capital m and this was seriously the
weirdest thing ever
it's kind of like you're a different
person with a different name it was so
weird even though it's the exact same
name like I just couldn't get over it
but I still go by Anne Marie I live in
Alaska my mom is full Korean and my dad
is half Finnish and half German and
Irish and I don't even know so that
makes me like a little bit of a mutt I
am the youngest of two I have an older
brother his name is Dexter and I have an
older sister her name is Callie my two
older siblings are basically my biggest
role models in my life but they're
completely completely different so
they're role models and completely
opposite ways so I think that I'm
inherently a very introverted person but
since my sister is extremely extroverted
I've kind of learned to fake being
extroverted so I'm comfortable being
extroverted but I'm naturally
introverted I'm currently in a
long-distance relationship with my
boyfriend you know which not a lot of
people know right now um and she is in
Finland right now it was my best friend
he was my first like super serious
boyfriend well not super serious I don't
want to like creeped him out and he's
just like an amazing person overall so
he set the bar really high for like a
first boyfriend so yeah he's a really
good person good person my family I was
on two dogs and I've named them both
I've named them sparkles and Daisy and I
had no intention of naming
these names it just came to me like I
was like you are sparkles or like you
are Daisy
yeah I'm pretty creative the first
concert I went to was in Atlanta Georgia
about two years ago and it was Edward
Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros and then
it's super hard to say and I met with my
sister Callie it was in the Tabernacle
which is on Vampire Diaries and I don't
watch that show but my sister does so
she told me that I used to be a super
super chubby kid growing up it's just
something that I'm kind of actually glad
happened because now I'm always somewhat
conscious of like what I put into my
body and I'm a pretty healthy person I
absolutely hate clothes shopping I don't
know what it is I don't like going out
into like stores and going shopping and
I don't like online shopping because I
feel like I can't try them on and stuff
like that so basically my sister Callie
does all of our shopping and we share
all of our clothes occasionally I'll go
shopping with her too usually on
vacations but in Alaska like I really
don't go shopping at all so I just let
her pick it out although I really hate
shopping for clothes I do really like
fashion and I want to force myself to
buy clothes because I think it makes me
feel really good about yourself and
that's just one of my goals for next
year when I lived in Washington I really
really wanted to model so I told my mom
and she got it all set up with an agent
and stuff like that and we went in and I
was super psyched to start modeling and
I was like oh yeah I'm gonna start
getting calls and stuff like that and
then my mom and sister started getting a
bunch of calls and modeling jobs and I
got one job as the gap kid for a school
in Seattle it was like an advertisement
for a school like a private school yeah
I tried to keep my YouTube channel a
secret but it didn't work at all like
all odds were against me on that one and
so now everyone I know knows about my
YouTube basically and it's super weird
thinking about who watches my videos I
used to play the piano until the ninth
grade and then I realized I wasn't very
good so the only song I can play now is
the thousand mouths by Vanessa Carlton
when I get hungry I get super grumpy
I think breakfast is super underrated
it's definitely one of my favorite meals
of the day I mean there are only three
but it's very much on top of it on top
of the list and I just think it's a
great meal because you can eat as much
as you want not really feel
bad about it because you are just going
to work it off through the entire day I
don't know I feel like it's so
underrated and I think people should
really appreciate breakfast more I am 17
and my birthday is on January 5th I am a
super morning person it's just like a
completely different feeling being up
before anyone else it really just feels
like you're awake before the rest of the
world
I'm extremely indecisive especially when
it comes to ordering food
I hate being tickled and I'm super
ticklish
I'm an army brat my dad served for 25
years and he retired from the army
already said army every time someone
yawns I have like the urge to stick my
finger like in their mouth but mostly
just to people I know I hate scary
movies and I don't even like watching
rated R movies because I'm super scared
that someone's gonna knife someone or
something and I actually even got scared
during the Harry Potter movies what
Voldemort came out so yeah I get really
scared during movies speaking of movies
I've never cried during a movie I tried
to make myself cry during when Dobby
died in the Harry Potter books because I
felt super sad knows like this is a
crying moment but I just couldn't make
myself cry I tend to be really
subconsciously selective with the people
that I hang out with so I don't have a
ton of friends at all but I do have a
few really good friends a lot of people
that know me don't actually know this
about me but I am a huge perfectionist I
really don't think of it as a very good
thing I mean it's kind of good in some
ways but I really think it's a mental
disorder one example of my perfectionism
is like I have to do extremely well on
every single homework assignment that I
turn in no matter what I have had so
many nights where I stay up to 3:00 in
the morning
just trying to perfect homework
assignments or learn how to do every
single math problem like I have like I
just remember being up at 3:00 in the
morning and falling asleep on my
computer or something like that I have
to get straight A's or else it just like
really bothers me and I actually got a
four point eight GPA for my junior year
and that means that I got all A's in my
junior year and I took five weighted
classes I think this is due to my
perfectionism but I can get super super
stressed out and see
anxious another example of this
perfectionism anxiety and stress is that
in my freshman year which was probably
my hardest you're just because of the
transition and like all these personal
things and stuff like that
um I've hit my cuticles I mean I bite my
cuticles whenever I'm like doing
homework or like doing tests or
something and I don't even notice it but
I bet my cuticles so much that people
thought I had warts all over all over my
cuticles like surrounding my nails
because I would bite them and then they
would scab and then I'd bite them again
so they'd build mounds and they only
went away during the summer time so yeah
that was pretty disgusting but I kind of
got over that and I'm getting a lot
better at containing my stress and
anxiety I have a really hard time
memorizing lyrics to songs I literally
don't know the full lyrics to any single
song even if I listen to it like a
hundred times I still do not know the
full Earth's to any song I have a super
savory tooth so I would take a bag of
chips over a bag of candy any day I am
extremely fascinated by marine life
especially octopi and squid like they
just really fascinate me but I I don't
want to be like a marine biologist
because I want them to remain a big
mystery to me but I want to learn more
about them so I don't know I'm kind of
conflicted
speaking of marine biology I work five
days a week taking care of little
animals this is kind of like a recent
thing it kind of got a little bit like a
promotion or something but I take care
of reptiles like snakes bearded dragons
turtles snapping turtles alligators um
sea stars seen enemies sea urchins and a
crab some crabs actually so yeah that's
pretty cool I have worked since I was 13
years old
it wasn't even legal for me to work at
13 I just really wanted to gain some
money so I kind of forced my dad to let
me work at his office because he has a
practice of his own so I worked there in
the summer of the age of 13 and 14 and
then when I was 15 I got a job at a
natural health food store that
my friend owns and that was really cool
because I got to work with my friend
from those two jobs I definitely learned
what it was like to work really hard so
now that I have my job that I have now
which is like taking care of animals and
stuff like that and before that it was
like running planetarium shows and and
then and just doing other like really
cool stuff like that really science
oriented I really appreciate the job I
have right now and I don't know I just
feel like it's a good value to learn
hard work during every single one of my
summers for three summers I've kept a
summer journal so it's really weird
looking back on what I did like this day
of last summer and every single summer
I've had so far has been completely
different I'm really sensitive to smells
and touches if I had to choose I think
that my favorite class in school would
be math but only because of the super
accomplished feeling that you get after
you finish a really hard math problem
otherwise I really just kind of don't
agree with math like I have spent so
many nights up until 3 o'clock in the
morning trying to learn math before a
quiz or something like that so yeah but
it's really accomplishing I'm definitely
more of a homebody and snuggly cuddly
kind of person my family is super super
important to me we've been through so
many stressful hard times that I think
that a lot of things just don't really
affect me anymore that kind of don't
matter in the long run which I'm really
thankful for so not many little things
in like high school and drama and stuff
like that really affect me as a person I
have a freckle on the very tip of my
nose and I remember like when I first
started getting it it was like around
the fourth grade or something and I was
like I'm the freckle on my nose and it
got a little bit bigger but it stopped
growing so you might have seen it I
don't know but it's there
I am super into pillow pets I don't know
what I want to do when I get older but I
think I want to be like some type of
business owner or entrepreneur and I
think I might want to go to school in
California or just on the west coast I
cannot sleep a lot often and I think
it's because of my anxiety I love to
travel and I also love turbulence on
airplanes like not super
turbulence but just like a tiny little
bit of turbulence and it really helps me
go to sleep on airplanes and I also have
like an attachment to the people in the
airplane with me like I feel like we're
all united in some way just because of
lost and I feel like if our plane were
to crash like I kind of like already
like sit around like thinking like oh
you look like a fun person to hang out
with hopefully we survive I don't know I
take my commitments really really
seriously therefore I'm not good at
multitasking even like for large things
like if I have to do school I'm not good
at YouTube and I'm not good at like
little multitasking things to like I'm
not good at like texting and listening
to a person talk or something like that
I just can't do it I have a hidden pair
of toenail clippers because my dad has
an incurable fungus that he got from
when he was serving in Iraq my dad went
Iraq and came back on my birthday so
obviously I'm a pretty important person
in my family and lastly I read every
single one of your guys's comments and
what I see when people like my videos or
take the time to comment on my videos it
just kind of gives me like this super
excited feeling that people are actually
like watching my videos and appreciating
my videos and stuff like that so that's
what really keeps me making videos and
wanting to make videos and stuff like
that so I really appreciate all of you
guys who do that and I just wanted to
thank you guys because it really means a
lot so those are all my 50 facts I hope
you guys learn something about me or got
to know me a little bit better and if
you guys have any facts about yourselves
that is interesting or just random or
something like that leave it below and I
think it'll be fun to read for all of us
so I will talk to you guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
