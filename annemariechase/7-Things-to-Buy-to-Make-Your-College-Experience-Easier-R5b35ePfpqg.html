channel so for the last like three years
that I've been in college I think I've
done something what to bring to college
related I would say that those videos
are still super relevant and super
helpful so if you haven't seen those
videos I would watch those definitely
I'll link them all below but with this
video I decided that I would do my last
and final kind of what to bring to
college video and this is a list of kind
of just things that will just make your
college experience or your college life
easier on a day-to-day basis
oh also by the way I'm doing vlog I
swear I vlog every single day of August
it's been really fun so far you guys are
really liking it so definitely go
subscribe my blog channel but I feel
like I've mentioned this in a few my
vlogs and maybe some my videos actually
no I think I've ever mentioned this in a
video ok blessing that I would recommend
getting that my mom just gave to me but
I found very very useful our mesh bags
for laundry you might be like this
doesn't seem like a very useful thing
like I'm not too particular about my
laundry anyways it's literally for your
socks like in my freshman year the first
time I did laundry I lost three half
pairs of socks and unless like someone
is playing a joke where they like pulled
out half pairs of socks like I think the
launch machine just ate it now it's a
little easier because I have my own like
laundry machine in the house and I'm
living at but it's still really helpful
because like they're so small they just
get lost you know okay this next thing
you probably saw something you like your
college to pack list you know like that
bed back me on provides or whatever
probably us in a few videos or hauls
profiles in my hall but it is this
little back pillow rest thing if you're
a person who spends any time in your bed
doing work if you already like that even
if you're like trying to spend more time
doing work outside of bed chances are
you'll probably find yourself doing work
in bed and this is just like the most
comfortable solution to like your head
hitting the wall behind you or you know
just like being to sludged over but if
you're not really someone who ever does
work in bed like I would not suggest
this this next thing is also something
that I feel like I've brought up a ton
of times either my blogs or my main
channel videos simply
very simply life-changing for college
and even like maybe non college I have
invested in many of these IMAX so this
along with an earplug combo is extremely
useful for if you like to nap like
during the day or you know if you live
with the roommate you can't really
control what time they have to get up or
time they go to sleep even if they're
like trying to be careful like even
opening the door of the bathroom just
like floods you're faced with light you
know so in those situations I masks
they're so helpful so the next thing is
something that I probably wouldn't have
suggested like my freshman year and I
don't use them that often it's only like
a few places a few times a year but that
is command hooks these can be really
dangerous if you're a college dorm and
you strip off the paint on your wall
colleges charge so much for that but if
you learn how to take them off correctly
and there is like a right way to do it
and it's not as hard as like I thought
it used to be command strips and mostly
hooks are just like insanely useful so
here's what I use my current command
hooks for now this thing is called like
a metal command took States by command
hook I think so I was going to group it
into that category but they're just
really really useful like weirdly useful
I used to hang my mugs off of these in
my freshman dorm so I found these really
useful for just creating a lot of safe
space okay so this next thing is more
for if you use hot tools for your hair
this is my kind of hot tools holder
first of all it saves a ton of space if
you don't have a lot of counter space I
just keep my straightener hair dryer and
my hairbrush which is not even like a
hot tool I keep those all in there so
I'm not really continuously getting out
but it's like a lot of real estate is
saved by having that this next thing
again something that is super nice when
you actually have it but something that
you would never think to buy gloves I'm
even though that Playtex major looks
like whoo who would have thought every
single year multiple times a year I have
found myself in the situation where I am
cleaning a communal space and it's just
like disgusting when you have gloves on
it kind of makes it okay to clean just
disgusting stuff even if you're grossed
out because you have like that layer of
protection that you're just like alright
this is
not on me like I don't have to freak out
and I've also found that even just
washing my dishes outside like in the
kitchen outside if you use one dish and
then one fork and then you like forget
your cup you're like oh I have to wash
this Cup even though I like how'd you
wash this dish wash my hands dry my
hands and then it's like a whole process
but I found with gloves like you just
slip them on you wash your dish you
don't even have to get your hands wet
and then your dishes are done like this
seems like such a simple thing but it's
seriously like a huge difference and my
mood while washing the dishes my mood
while like washing disgusting thing it
makes cleaning nasty things like much
much easier so this next one is
something that I feel very passionately
about it is a hard drive an external
hard drive so I personally have always
had external hard drives just because I
make youtube videos and they take a lot
of space in your computer it gives you
that whole extra amount of space for
your computer just in this like tiny
little thing I have mine right there I
just don't feel like getting it to
things that I've heard in college a lot
to the point where it's how concerning
is one your computer has crashed and
you've lost everything from the whole
year on it which is like always
heartbreaking like I have been there I
know how it feels it sucks an easy
solution is just to backup your computer
on an external hard drive but the second
biggest thing this is too clumped into
one is either you have no space on your
phone we all know like we can get
thousands of photos on our phones and
then the second problem that I come
together I phones or phones is that
people either break their phone or lose
your phone this happens all the time you
hear this all the time in college and
I'm sure you hear it anywhere that like
our age group is together people are
like I'm so upset not because my phone
broke and I have to pay like hundreds of
dollars get a new one but because all my
photos and memories and stuff were on my
phone what I have started doing is I've
been dumping all of my old iPhone photos
onto my external hard drives it clears
up like tons of space like I've had
photos on my phone from like like high
school and because I like restore it as
like that phone so it's just like always
there and that always takes up my
gigabytes and so I've started just
dumping all of my iPhone photos to my
external hard drives and then just
deleting them all
and if you don't know how to do that
just like Google how to transfer your
iPhone photos to like an external hard
drive super easy so the last thing that
I'm going to mention is something that I
mentioned in like a few my videos like
this exact brand - it's a quality water
bottle quality water bottles are like
just so incredibly useful especially
nowadays I feel like the technology for
water bottles is on point like my
favorite is Hydra flask I heard small
water bottles are good I don't know i'm
all about hydro flask invest in a good
water bottle because that is something
that will literally last you for years
then this last thing is something that i
mentioned in my last video again not
really something that I think about when
I'm like college vacuum it's a vacuum
and the life changing aspect of this
part or like the super usefulness part
of this is specifically a vacuum with
like an extendable arm hose I don't know
what those things are called like
evacute like you can take it off and
then like suction like anything with
this like a little hosing you know what
I mean I think it's called hose maybe if
you are terrified of bugs
then you need a vacuum with a like
extendable arm or whatever because it is
so handy like if you are too scared to
be in a room with a bug you need a
vacuum to vacuum it up
that was my list of things that are
super useful while you're in college
that will make your everyday college
experience or a life a little bit better
but are things that you might not think
to bring to college I hope that this was
helpful at some points during this video
it really just added like me talking
about random products and I was like
what is this video what is the point of
life keep in mind this is also a very
very subjective video don't just buy all
these things you like because I had told
you to definitely leave any
recommendations that you guys would have
to add to this list so that I can read
them and so that my other viewers can
read them don't forget to subscribe to
