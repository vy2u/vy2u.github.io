as you guys can probably tell from the
title of this video you're probably like
what is this video is kind of a random
I'm actually doing vlogmas on my vlog
channel so that's vlogging every single
day of December and I realized that on
my main channel I don't post nearly as
often as I do on my vlog channel so some
of you literally might not know that I'm
doing vlogmas which doesn't make any
sense in general my blog channel is just
a really fun way to get to know me and
my family and what I'm up to like you
guys can see where I am right now we're
traveling a lot in Asia so I wanted to
show you guys kind of an example of just
a random vlog mess so I decided to post
it as vlog miss on my main channel for
that reason so you guys can get a taste
of what vlogmas is kind of like and if
you guys like it and are interested in
my blog channel or just my life in
general you guys can head over to my
vlog channel and subscribe for the rest
of vlogmas or for allof log myths if
this is your first vlogmas that you're
seeing so I hope you guys enjoy this
video and I will talk to you guys soon
it is our last day in Hawaii how do you
feel about that good and you sneeze how
do you feel about it mmm now we're in
the airport
in Honolulu it's 207 and we are flying
Japan air to Tokyo where we have a 22
hour layover and then we were going to
go fly to Seoul and meet our brother and
dad but right now we're having a little
bit of an issue and I feel really
annoying for vlogging this because
everyone else is really stressed out but
I'm really not doing anything to help
anyways because I don't know like what I
can do so I'm just sitting kind of
watching but apparently Japan air won't
let you fly to your destination unless
you have a flight out of that
destination because Japan air will be
liable if we flew there and then Korea
immigration turned us away so they said
that they won't let us get on our next
flight unless we have another flight
outside of Korea like out leaving Korea
our flight to Tokyo is at 3:20
currently 210 up
Cali is very antsy right now
the urgency is real folks and everyone's
getting good is weak how are you feeling
mom
Japan air should really tell you that
you need to do that ahead of time
instead of waiting an hour before your
flight I'm gonna understand it yeah
that's probably why just mix it
how do you feel right now Kelly
got them flush cheetah think they're
alike I didn't know what to do it was
like a typical food here being demanding
and I said I step out my my the bags are
on the belt
okay that's good thank you very much
the holding getting hit
and we start 42:55 obviously we made our
flight or we're going to make our flight
where did you book a flight to Singapore
I thought it was really expensive it
probably is but we're gonna cancel it
later
oh are the cancellation charges well
she's doing it on miles
so the Oregon
oh well that works out then the focus of
this vlog is now going to be primarily
on the airplane because we have a
nine-hour flight to Tokyo and then a
twenty two hour layover and I don't
really know the times that are going to
be in the u.s. so I'm just gonna make it
so that each like day is like a day in
my day you know for this vlog I decided
that it'd be really fun oh I thought you
wanted to be in this to do a what to do
on a long flight
first of all Callie has a really cool
finding that she recently found out from
Jacob what is it that she's really mad
about can download content on Netflix to
watch offline for all of the TV movie
lovers out there so that's the first
thing that you can do on a long flight
and then the next thing that I'm going
to try doing well I'm going to edit for
half the time and then I have a bunch of
audible books that I've downloaded
because I mean I could have read a book
right now but I usually use audibles for
like in-between my walks and like drives
but now I have a bunch of them just
saved on my account so I'll show you
guys which books that I have this is how
not to die apparently Arden Rose the
youtuber went vegan after she read this
book so I wanted to hear what he said so
far I'm only a few minutes into it but
okay it's just like a self motivation
book you know I love those ones this is
by Charles Duhigg who wrote the power of
habit which like is a great book I
literally reference that book every day
and two of my different interviews and
they were like oh you're some good at
applying what you learned so that was
helpful so I'm reading that one now by
him because I just like him as an author
I want to listen to the power of
vulnerability by brené Brown
somin has a TED talk on the same topic
and I was forced to watch it for class
but it was actually like a really good
talk so I wanted to get her audible too
and just look at all the time
differences between all these things
oops marker it's just crazy but all of
these I just purchased with my like free
audible credit Oh
because someone gifted me a free Apple
credit or actually two after I got my
own free one if you guys want to done
that a free audible book for your
troubles I'll leave my link below and
then I'll get you one free one just make
sure to cancel it after um 30 days
because then it'll charge you Andy ollie
knows how that works cuz you didn't just
cancel it I was charged like not good
cause it was on her account
hahaha that's what I would be doing and
also editing and then we'll we'll have
some more fun stuffs on the plane will
we
yes or sitting together
everyone seems to be doing stuff but
like do I have enough room in my
backpack there
I don't know like I put my backpack up
but I kind of want it kind of want it
you know it's in this store oh I went
around asking if we wanted champagn for
orange juice and Callie asked for both
to make a move
delicious and I got back jewel they
think of everything I have slippers they
passed out a toothbrush
I have IRA freshers an eye mask I can
already get the comment
stupid Americans don't know how to
travel
I already got that one covered so you
don't have to leave it there's more
unnatural letting in here now so I'm
giving a little for the
please thing foot going area I think
this Apple comes back into a recline
chair all of the little compartment have
to figure out what this stuff is
lounge chair Callias this also massage
chair that is just crazy it's gonna be
this light
I started listening to
murder fester
better and
my log it's really
as they made me move my bag up there and
so I didn't really have anything
Kelly
you know I'm not the only reason why
minty flavor
no one brush their teeth
that's like kind of a reward for
brushing your teeth so that you're
actually reminded to brush your teeth
every day
have it what should I be like
just like keep it very well
do it
you
you should listen to my gap
watching the movie
well it's so much cheese
we have a past
you got them
oh good exercise
Callie and I have been getting a lot of
food and drinks
talking about fat Americans
yeah we've ordered our normal food by
accident eat that much of it than we
ordered a cheese plate for her
I've been nibbling on cookies here and
there
and I got it done
I'm excited about this
and we're just trying to make the most
farm this
I would say that this is pretty
worthless
lay down right now
about two hours left in our flight and
I've been
preoccupied listening to this audible
book
and editing my blogs and videos that
like I have it I don't think I'll be
able to sleep but the auto posting too
right now chapter three literally goes
over
quite like it watch the process
then eventually
gone into the ocean
like different processes that were going
on
of like this emergency situation but
basically I was listening
is light while I'm in a plane
over the Pacific Ocean as they went into
the
any goes
is that terrifying as a horrible idea on
my part
so entertaining I wish his side was
lager so I could take a nap on this year
I really wish I had not
like say oh wait
sauce
is really comfortable while editing
it's really really restrictive otherwise
but this
the last seven hours of
that I'm going to
my camera batteries I hope you
learn ideas on what to do during one
flight I was super entertaining for this
but it might also to be
I'm like sitting
I'm having the time of my life right now
for watching
when you'll be sure to give it a thumbs
up
if you're excited for Trump
this feels like suede great
jingle bell jingle bell jingle bell rock
