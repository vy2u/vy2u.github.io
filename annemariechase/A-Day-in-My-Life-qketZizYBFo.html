let's go under ready let's go my good
crack hey guys so this is day 2 of the
scooter tour of Shanghai yeah
so we are at the center of Shanghai
this is Yana expressway right here
throughout the French Concession in the
south in the north the river and the
second tallest building in the world
just caught up in the clouds over there
is this thing I Drive by this thing all
the time
gee honey I paused 66 on the tallest
buildings in the world these glass
modern super structures and they got
something out of 1880s Austria you know
what the hell is that doing here
I'm not quite sure what it is I think
it's like a hotel or like a gentlemen's
club now but yeah it's a pretty unique
feature to the city
it's hot actually
is a brand it's like a boutique brand
and the designer is actually my roommate
it's his own brand called raised in
China
Deven lived in China for 17 years he's
an artsy guy he decided to dedicate a
brand to to kind of art type which was
like third culture kids I grew up
overseas Chinese prints this isn't
explained makes sense why I love
are you ready yeah okay I know I've said
it a lot of times but I've said it a lot
of times the reason why I love the city
so much is it's got everything you know
it's not your gritty China your old
China it's got beautiful modern
structures probably nicer than any other
city in the world at the moment and it's
also got that British you know that Art
Deco the nineteen thirty of the eighteen
late 1800s Early 1900s architecture
hello
well I love Shanghai so much as the
history and the uniqueness of it and
what makes the city so unique is that
it's got everything you want in close
proximity and it's never more evident
than in this about 200 meters right here
so we're just gonna scooter here we're
gonna start in the gritty China you look
around you know this is kind of what you
expect to China the little shops here we
are you know a couple hundred yards away
you got these ultra-modern office
buildings right here and you got
tomorrow's square won't you know the
brand new Marriott and the best part
about it is that the old British clock
tower right there so in this proximity
right here you got gritty old China
ultra-modern Shanghai
European influence Shanghai all within
200 meters and that's what makes the
city I think the cool city in the world
always a struggle scooter parking you
know you think parking in LA is bad for
cars scooter parking here is artichoke
oh there we go we got a spot
where is gone in here so I can use the
bus actually my favorite place for
afternoon tea of Shanghai to get
afternoon tea often notice once twice
but what's so cool about this building
as you can see this used to be the
grandstand for the the old racecourse so
now there's people Square which is which
is kind of an iconic point now China
it's a part it's got a lot of museums
and stuff but it used to be when when
this used to be the British zone of the
British concession this used to be a
racecourse a horse race track and this
was the grandstand so we're gonna go to
the roof we'll check it out
and you're
go to the
to drive turn it turn the right one
turn it down yeah you got to keep your
speed up okay but you can't you can't go
slow you got to keep
making faces
like
there
how'd I do yeah I mean we're still alive
so Lisa is good it was good maybe like
five miles
don't know why it's called the rock bun
this Kabul Street very much resembles
like somewhere in Central Europe you
know the China government stood a lot of
renovation projects to keep its unique
history so this is somewhere they would
they put money obviously a church here
this was part of the Old English
concession back in the day so this one
Street particularly they've kind of
renovated to to make it look like
exactly what it look like in the 1920s
1930s which and I was the Paris of the
east is this that so you know you can
see some mansions here and stuff but
yeah let's check it out
they probably the most photographed
street in Shanghai always people doing
their wedding photo shoots they are like
fashion photo shoots speaking of what
uploading shoot
but
the icon of Shanghai it is what the
world knows
and that is well I'll talk about
and if you don't think the bund if you
ever get a postcard of Shanghai that is
probably what you'll see both cards of
the bund and if you get another postcard
Shanghai that is also what you'll
probably see so I know I've talked a lot
about the contrast and the uniqueness of
the city but never more can you see it
at this exact location an iconic
location of Shanghai and the Bund where
you've got the ultra-modern the
beautiful glass scape skyline and COO
dome on the pudong side and then you've
got the old Bund here when the French
and the English came and set up port
here when China first opened up you know
in the late 1800s none of this existed
20 years ago right there second tallest
7th tallest 17th college actually
Shanghai has most number of skyscrapers
and the in the top 100 list in terms of
height
that produces the largest TV screen in
the world at night they'll turn into a
big like screen by commercial all on one
riverbank what more could you ask for
so nice hotel on the first ever like
luxury hotels and Shanghai I actually
stayed here in 1997 when my family first
moved here because this was like one of
handful of excuse me what a handful of
like five-star hotels you but this place
is like a timeline you come through here
it's like 1925
cool
what's that but this clearly declined
make a difference in the world
networking there huh that's what I do
did you get some of that that's gonna
kind them so I just got a business lead
at the hotel I have work in sponsorship
for sporting events and we're always
looking for barter deals for life we're
not bar deals but deals where we can
