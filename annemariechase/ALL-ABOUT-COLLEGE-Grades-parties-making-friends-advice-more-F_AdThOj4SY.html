on Instagram and I said hello followers
so I decided to do a Q&amp;amp;A and I realize
that a lot of my questions are very
college related so I just decided to
make this mostly a college related Q&amp;amp;A
so this is what it is be sure to follow
me on instagram if you want to
participate in the next Q&amp;amp;A or let me
know what your favorite like platform is
for me to ask you guys to ask me
questions not sure if that made sense
but we're going to go with it so let's
get into the queue NACE how are your
grades in college is it easy to get a
4.0 pays and B's mostly B's kind of
bothered me like the first year that I
was here that I was like a B student now
but it honestly for some careers and
some tracks it kind of just I don't want
to say it doesn't matter but it doesn't
matter to a certain extent if you're
pre-med or engineering or like pre-law
or I'm sure there's a ton that I'm
missing your GPA is more important but
that's not me saying to not care about
your GPA
maybe I'm just saying this as like a
defense mechanism for being like no my
GPA is okay okay
you know I feel like that was very
aggressive I'm sorry if you hadn't gone
to USC where else would you see yourself
being happy I would probably be at Emory
because I was gonna go there up until
like my senior year did you ever
consider going to medical school this is
a good question that I get sometimes
from like my friends and people who know
me because my dad's a doctor but I
literally have never considered going to
medical school
I can't watch like some pg-13 shows by
myself because I get really scared
especially if there's like violence or
blood of any type I'm like absolutely
not into that it really disturbs me I
like have really weird dreams let me
know if you want to hear like a story
time on like dreams or have you guys
heard of sleep paralysis because I've
been talking about this recently to some
friends and first of all like a lot of
people have never heard asleep paralysis
and a lot of people don't lucid dream I
don't know if that's like an interesting
enough topic but it's like really
interesting conversation like when
you're actually like having a
conversation about it
let me know but yeah pointed out
was is that if I watch like a scary
movie or like a gory movie even just
like someone cutting someone's skin I
get like really disturbing dreams so I
just don't like that negative energy in
my life I just never considered being a
doctor because I can't deal with that
stuff like it just grosses me out
and it's may be in my genes but just not
you know so I've never considered being
a doctor or going to medical school
being a nurse PA whatever like anything
in the medical side of the world no
thank you
I'd be like a business how has a
relationship with your high school
friends changed since going to college
in high school are like a lot of
hometowns you're kind of in obligatory
relationships with people that you don't
really care about because you grew up
with them or they're friends with
friends or like everyone's friends so
you kind of have to hang out with them
and if you don't like you don't you know
like there's gonna be drama or like
you're gonna exclude some people that's
a really good thing about college is
that if you're like in those obligatory
relationships and you might not even
know that you are you can escape them
and you can just kind of like for the
people who don't matter you don't really
have to hang out with them anymore but
for those who do definitely try to make
an effort to stay connected because
those are important people I'm filming a
video Jacob do you attend a lot of
college parties are the same as in the
movies I honestly do not attend a lot of
college parties my dad's actually an
alcoholic good delivery that's literally
how I tell people like it's not as
dramatic as people think that's why I
like tell it like that but some people
think I'm like really like messed up
because I say it like that but I'm
actually gonna do a video on this
sometimes I'll go out but just I don't
know I just feel like it's not healthy
like mentally or even physically just to
go out so often I think it's definitely
a good outlet but especially for me
since I do like have alcoholism in my
genes it's just not something that I
want to spend too much time doing and
I'll make like a video on this so ask me
questions about that if you want at
least at USC they're usually like the
same as college parties and videos or
movies yeah cuz there are like frets and
stuff best thing you like about college
I guess you do really really learn a lot
and it's not even it doesn't have to be
in the classroom Oh
I really like how as a student you can
really take advantage of a lot of things
for example just meeting different
people who I really hide up in
industries because you're a student and
you're like hey I really admire your
career I'm a student like I'd love to
learn more about you you can have like
an informational interview with them and
they're not just like oh you're just
like talking to me because you want a
job for me you know so there's like a
lot of leeway with being a student I
feel like people help students out more
because they're just like you're young
like you're learning versus like if
you're not people are just like you like
want something what's it like making
friends in college what's the party
scene like what changes have you seen in
yourself during your time in college so
far I honestly had a really hard time
making friends in college and I think it
was really really really attributed to
the fact that I lived in a really
isolated dorm on campus that's probably
honestly one of my biggest regrets in
college because I think I would have
made I would have had the opportunity to
make a lot more friends if I'd lived
like in a more social part of campus but
I still had like it's not impossible to
make friends you just have to try a lot
harder to go out of your way to make
friends and I also just met the weirdest
people like my first year like the
weirdest possible people if the people
that I met was representative of the USC
population which it was not but I kind
of thought it was at the time like I was
looking at transfer I really was I just
met the weird people what changes have
you seen in yourself during your time in
college so far I'd honestly say that
like I've always kind of been like this
but I'm a very strong person in my
beliefs and like my morals and I think
being in college it's kind of a place
where you might be easily swayed to do
things or try things out that you don't
like want to but I've kind of kept my
ground and I feel like I'm I know myself
a lot better than like some other people
my age do over some of your cons going
to college out of state honestly the
only con going out of state for me was
that like my parents are in Alaska and
my house is in Alaska I personally just
knew that I wasn't gonna go to college
in Alaska and I had never planned - in
your opinion what is the biggest
difference between college and high
school there are so many differences off
the top of my head you can really do
what you want in college so in some ways
you have to be like very self-motivated
if you want to like do a lot
Highschool you're kind of like guided
along this pathway and then in college
it's just like do what you want you know
um like whether that be like a good
thing or a bad thing happen I know can
you give some tips to students who are
going to college next year if you're
interested in getting involved in
extracurricular activities do it the
first semester for me I just didn't
really know that there was so much going
on in campus cuz I like I was very
isolated I think my mindset was just
like oh I'll adjust to college because
it takes a while for me to adjust the
things but that is honestly not the move
if you want to get involved it's easiest
to do it your first semester so if you
want to get involved like just apply to
everything that you want your first
semester and then from there you can
like pick and choose what you want to
drop and like what you want to focus
your time on what motivates you in
college um I want to make like a big
impact somehow I don't know in what or
like how but I think that kind of
motivates me I don't know it's coffee
I made a cold brew yesterday I don't
know if I made it right
mmm-hmmm what are your favorite and
least favorite things about USC there's
like a lot of materialism and like
superficiality honestly like I can say I
don't think that USC is for everyone but
you can definitely find like your place
at USC regardless of like who you are
but overall like there's a lot of that
my favorite thing about USC it's
probably the diverse people that you
find here and there are always like
there are very talented people too just
like with any you know top school you're
gonna find some really smart like really
talented people so you can definitely
find that here but you could also find
that like anywhere pretty much do you
watch any of the USC athletic teams play
do you support them I try I'm really not
that in this football I'm gonna try to
go to more football games um but I'm
honestly like naturally I'm not inclined
to go to like athletic events Oh Jacob
says why are you so beautiful how do you
get promo codes like this sunglasses one
I don't really know what this is asking
the picture is of me wearing these
sunglasses this is not sponsored I
promise I'm just on a free trial right
now but you guys can be
same so these are Burberry sunglasses
and I think they're originally like
three hundred two hundred dollars but
the cool thing about shop ditto is that
for me at least I can never find
sunglasses that I like so even when I
buy sunglasses like I have sunglasses
where I think I like never wear them
because I'm just like I have no idea I
don't think I like these but if you're
similar or you just don't want to commit
to sunglasses definitely check this
company out there is nothing to lose
because I have a free promo code you
just use Emery chase I think it's all
capitalized I don't know if it matters
but that will supply you with one free
month of a trial with shop ditto
so you can get all these different types
of sunglasses they have really expensive
ones and you can keep switching them out
so you can basically just keep trying
different sunglasses for an entire month
for free let me know if you do end up
checking out shop ditto um because I'm
just curious or you can let me know what
sunglasses you think would look good on
me cuz I honestly just have like I have
such a hard time with it
what you advise against owning a pet
mainly a dog in college like in an
apartment type setting don't get a pet
in college like this is one of the
things that pisses me off so much
especially at USC I think maybe you
could do it and another college like one
of my friends Chloe has a dog at NAU and
she like loves having her dog there um
but at USC I have seen so many times
like my for example my roommates got a
cat I'm allergic to cats I don't like
cats I'm sorry for those cat lovers like
they're cute but I just I'm not a huge
fan of cats but I am like a
compassionate person and um I felt
really bad for this cat so I'd like kind
of like pet it whenever I couldn't give
it attention because I think that's what
it wanted and then I have to like go
shower cuz I was allergic everyone was
like oh yeah like except for me of
course like everyone's like oh yeah I
like really wanted a cat like it'd be
perfect cuz there are so many people to
give it attention and take care of it
but I felt like an entire apartment gets
one cat no one takes ownership for it so
everyone just kind of like puts its
duties off for the other person even if
you get a pet like as your own in
college especially like at a social
college or like a busy college where a
lot of things are going on and you're
not gonna be there for your pet or
you're just a busy person like if you
think that you're gonna be held
I could buy your pet you're not going to
take care of it you're not going to give
it the attention that it needs
and our cat was literally going
psychotic like thankfully my roommate
Nica took the cat to her grandparents
house it's just horrible when you get a
pet and then kind of let it exist in
your apartment for like four months and
then decide that you don't have the time
or resources to take care of it and then
you just kind of give it away to the
next person who wants it and then
they'll do the same thing and I always
see in our free and for sale section
like people leaving for the summer and
they're like can anyone watch over my
cat for the summer or like does anyone
want a cat I'm leaving or I'm graduating
and I can't take it with me
just so annoying so unless you know that
you have time for it and you have like
money to spend on it and you're just a
very responsible pet owner I do not
think that you should get a pet in
college is something that I'm very
passionate about just make sure that you
think about the animals perspective and
like the animals well-being and life
don't let your consideration of how much
you want a pet like overwhelm the
well-being of the animal what is the
most interesting thing one of your
professors have ever said I recently
took a class a business communications
class so this professor was really cool
because I feel like she really cared
about his students and providing the
best advice and like education that he
could for them like real world advice
the biggest piece of advice that he gave
like that he Jen you genuinely wanted to
get across I think he had three things
it was like be helpful be thankful be
memorable in that he was like be a hub
for other people so like be the person
that connects people with other people
as a business student you're kind of
trained to be like very competitive with
other people but I'm just not a very
competitive person I think that everyone
can win not one person has to win so
I've been practicing this a lot example
Katherine here on YouTube or like
Katherine she's one of my friends from
USC but also like a fellow youtuber her
internship plans fell through and I like
watched her vlog about this and I had an
internship that was very like social
media related and up her alley as well
because they like wanted me because of
my youtube experience and I was like you
know what you don't have an internship
do you pretty much do the same thing as
me so I connected her to my now boss
and I was like a hub for her getting an
internship because it's really hard to
find an internship sometimes especially
like super late in the game that's like
one of the most interesting things one
of my professors has said and I feel
like it's like a genuine piece of advice
I feel like that's one of the best
qualities as a friend so that's
definitely something that I've taken
away from one of my professors best
advice to avoid Freshman Fifteen
exercise because I feel like at least
for me when I'm exercising I tend to
watch what I eat more and also don't eat
after like 10:00 p.m.
cuz that's where you do a lot of binge
eating and like dren cheese or whatever
and try eating as many fruits and
vegetables as possible a lot of people
are saying where do you want to be and
up in ten years I want to have like a
job where I feel like I can make a
difference in the world that seems so
cliche like weird but I'm just like very
confident that I try to do the right
thing so I feel like I want to be in a
position where I can you know like be a
source where people come to if they need
help or just like I don't know if that's
gonna be like as a person in a company
um or as like a person or like even like
YouTube or something I just feel like I
want to be like a positive influence in
my job or career that I have alright
thank you guys so much for watching this
video those are all the questions that
I'm going to answer because I can
literally talk forever I start doing
those like live things so I can do these
without having to like edit it later
just answer a bunch of questions cuz I
talk so long that it kills me when I'm
editing and I'm just like be sure to
follow me on Instagram if you want to
participate in any future q and A's um
