separate intro from the rest of the
entire video but I filmed this video a
little while ago and I wanted to just
bring a current-day perspective into it
so hello a lot of things have changed in
that video and I fill in that video like
probably a few months ago by now and you
can probably tell like my hair looks
different a lot of stuff about this this
situation is different I also wanted to
mention that I was editing that footage
over again and I was like why am I
wearing this shirt it looks way too
small on me and I was literally just
trying it on that day like I still
low-key how to tack on it and I just
decided to wear it for the entire video
and it looks freaking awful on me so I'm
Loki gotta listen on Poshmark so if you
want to buy it my mom also has access to
my Poshmark account now so shop it below
not gonna lie this video is kind of
crazy so I just wanted to mention that
so we're acknowledging that but I think
it could be helpful so let's just get
into it
this is a sit-down and talking video
about what a lot of you guys have been
asking me to explain or like at least
acknowledge or mention or talk about and
that is my breakup from
or with my boyfriend ex-boyfriend Jacob
I apologize if my camera is super
overexposed Ivan used this camera and
over like two years it's my old old
camera so I don't even know if this is
in focus I can't really see it I've not
only planned out this video but I've had
a lot of thoughts of what I want to say
in this video I just thought I would
film it and not really plan it out and
just have it be very real and raw I've
never worn this shirt before and it
looks like it's really not doing too hot
so yeah as you guys can tell Jacob and I
have broken up we broke up a little bit
before Thanksgiving and I think a lot of
you guys guessed it pretty early on and
like honestly props to you guys because
this was something that I really wasn't
expecting to happen so soon
I don't know why I'm wearing this okay
so I'm not gonna go into too much detail
but I also just want to talk about kind
of the implications of this breakup in
college like my situation and how like
I'm kind of dealing with it I wrote out
like in this whole little like kind of
diary entry of things I wanted to talk
about but I reread it and I was like
what's he writing about this but maybe
I'll start with that maybe it'll take me
somewhere so I guess like the biggest
question that everyone has is like why
did you guys break up so first of all I
just want to say that like I a hundred
percent respect love admire Jacob so
much still he's an amazing person like
psychotic right now okay
okay Jacob mine got along really well we
were best friends like I loved spending
time with him he literally shaped me
into the person that I am today
honestly like our relationship was
really good but I think we had like
major personality differences and that's
kind of like what we'd always fight
about it was like him like criticizing
me for my personality and me just like
not understanding his personality
because of these differences it really
stressed me out but he was just always
someone to be like no we can work
through this and I do think that you can
up until a certain point but I think you
also have to recognize when like your
personality differences are really just
like too different so when we broke up
it was kind of it was it was honestly
like out of the blue we got into a very
very very small fight like very minor
compared to like any of the other like
fights that may have like sparked a
breakup so when it did happen it just
really happened very randomly and kind
of spontaneously and it didn't really
seem to make sense I think but after it
happened I was like this is the most
fair thing to do for him and for me
because if I just prolonged it or maybe
like took a break or like whatever else
I think that I knew well enough deep
down that you know I would have just
been prolonging all this pain so yeah
that's kind of like the overall breakup
story kind of where I am with this whole
thing as I mentioned like I obviously
have friends that I care and truly
admire and love and like I'm thankful
for and I have my family who I like
really feel like I was able to lean on
during this process even if they don't
know it but but something that I knew it
would be really difficult for me is that
I would feel very lonely because he like
was my best friend and like someone I
spent all my time with so that's kind of
where I got my like social life I don't
know I spent so much time with him and
his friends and so I knew that this
would be really really lonely for me but
I think something that helped that I do
agree with that I wrote was yeah I knew
that I would be lonely and I was I knew
that I would feel like I had no friends
and I did and I probably knew that
have no one to do things with that we
used together and this is maybe a little
true at least it was at first but now so
good stuff but now um that feeling is
slowly going away with each time I feel
a deep connection there's someone out
there and told everyone that I was that
me filming at this time this is awkward
this is how I look at it because I have
to so basically what I started doing is
I started like working out a lot more
going to yoga because feel like working
on your physical fitness is something
that just naturally makes you happy it
gives you endorphins it makes you feel
better about yourself makes me more
confident so I started doing that a lot
whenever I was really feeling lonely and
sorry for myself I just started reaching
out to my friends something that I
wouldn't usually do because I'm just
like oh like if they want to hang out
with me and they'll hang out with me but
no like this is so cute okay I'll just
read you guys like what I wrote my
little bi everything so I decided to
look at it this way and approach this
like break up this way because that's
how I had to this is how I'm deciding my
story goes and it's not gonna go oh sad
girl feeling sorry for herself I have
horrible handwriting then becomes a
freakin mess feel sorry for herself once
again know what my story is wow she's
really doing so well she's really
changed she looks really happy she's
really focusing on herself she's really
opening up showing herself and her
personality to others all stuff that I
would not do before being and growing in
this relationship
Aaron is like a week ago I keep adding
two dudes for you anyways I was writing
this kind of like to myself but also
like an address to Jacob but my
conclusion and this little paragraph you
helped me realize Who I am so for that I
thank you I literally can never pay you
back so they gratitude ideal for you
yeah that's pretty much my story I feel
really awkward on though there's someone
outside cuz I thought no one was here
and I'm sure whoever it's outside can
love you hear me but well yeah basically
where I'm at now is I'm just trying to
keep myself on a positive trajectory and
I think he's also trying to do the same
thing so we're not like really talking
to each other or hanging out which is
also very hard because it's like all of
a sudden you lose your best friend and
like someone that I used to hang out
with go to for pretty much everything
like if I had time between classes I'd
be like hey what are you doing but I do
think that like this has been a time
where I've grown immensely and I feel
like I'm taking this very well and
taking this opportunity to be like very
productive and grow myself which I'm
very proud of myself for so that's kind
of just what I plan on continuing to do
and so that's the story you guys can
stop asking now and of course I really
hope that you guys like respect his face
like I know some of you follow him and
love him so please respect his face
don't like bother him in any way I don't
know how you do that but are why you
would do that but just wanted to say
that and
yeah that's pretty much all of what I
need to say I think or I'm going to say
there's still someone standing outside
they're being really quiet that so they
can probably hear me so thank you guys
so much for watching this video and
supporting my channel and for supporting
me and being like that community that
I've always wanted and dreamed of yeah
thank you guys so much for watching I
will talk to you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
