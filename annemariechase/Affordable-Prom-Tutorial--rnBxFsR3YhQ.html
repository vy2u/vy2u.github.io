absolute favorite youtubers so I think
you guys will really like them so click
the screen now to go check their
channels out or you can find them in the
description box below the collaboration
video that we decided to do is an
affordable prom look because it is prom
season and I'm really proud to say that
nearly every single one of these
products are drugstore products so this
is basically something that's really
accessible to everyone and very easy to
find at any drugstore you guys this is
an affordable prom look I just wanted to
give a few quick tips if you are going
to prom on a budget first of all when
you're looking for a dress you also have
to consider that you have to get shoes
with the dress potentially jewelry with
the dress and you also may have to get
the dress altered if it doesn't fit you
I think a lot of people forget that you
have to consider all of those things I
had to get my dress altered my sisters
cost $60 mine costs $30 and it's just
not really something that you think
about when you're getting your dress
however much it is also I wanted to
mention that the dress that I'm using in
this video it's not actually my prom
dress I'm going to be showing you guys
that later because I want to make it in
a separate video because it's kind of
unrelated you may also be wondering why
I'm sitting in front of a bunch of
balloons and I actually tell you guys
why in a future video that's going to be
posted really soon so stay tuned this is
actually the first of three videos that
I'm doing so I'm starting this little
prom series and that's all I have to say
for now so I hope you guys enjoy this
prom makeup look and let me know if you
guys found it helpful in the comments
below so to give you guys an idea of the
color scheme I'm going for in this
tutorial here is my
dress and this dress is from
nordstrom.com this is a super pretty
short strapless dress in tan by Audrey
onna papel and it was 158 dollars the
first thing that I'm going to do is wash
my face so here I'm just putting my hair
up into a ponytail and then using this
homemade headband to keep my hair back
from the water I'm using my Clarisonic
to deep clean my face to really get off
all the makeup and dirt so that I can
start with a clean fresh face for new
makeup and I'm just going to use these
Neutrogena makeup wipes and remove all
of the darkness around my eyes left over
from eyeliner and mascara and then I'm
going to moisturize my entire face using
this Clinique
moisturizing face lotion next I'm going
to be painting my own nails the color
that I chose to pair my nails is this
pretty tannish gold color called fast
track by Tran uglies and a really good
tip for saving money and not going to go
get your nails done is to just have a
girls night the night before prom and
just do each other's nails my sister
does not want to have a girls night with
me so I am just doing them by myself and
I'm just going to fast forward all of
these clips from doing my nails because
I don't want to take up too much time
just doing my nails but if you guys want
to know a typical nail routine just
leave a comment below and I will make a
video on how I do my nails for a smooth
and even application and to ensure that
my makeup is going to last all night
long I'm using my L'Oreal magic
perfecting base
for my foundation I definitely wanted
something that was long-lasting so I
chose this 24 hour Revlon Colorstay
Revlon also has a photo ready foundation
which is actually what I recommend
because it doesn't have any SPF in it
and on prom night you're going to be
taking a lot of photos and SPF does not
do as well and flash photography next I
use my Maybelline fit me concealer to
conceal my under eye circles any pimples
and blemishes that I have and any
redness now I'm using my Revlon
Photoready pressed powder in order to
set all of my makeup and it was
surprisingly hard to open and I applied
this to my t-zone to make sure that my
face was shine free for pictures next I
used the Revlon Photoready bronzer and
this was surprisingly easy to open
compared to the other one and I just
used this by applying it to the hollows
of my cheek bones and also of my
forehead and then just blending it in
with a big fluffy brush
and here I'm using my favorite chopstick
to moisturize my lips in preparation for
the lipstick I am applying later and as
always before applying any eye shadows
just be sure to primer is especially for
this look and I'm just using Urban
Decay's primer potion for my eyeshadow I
uses Maybelline palette in taupe
temptress the first thing that I did was
applied the shimmery white color all
over my lid and then I used the third
purplish grayish color in the palette
and applied this right above my crease
line in order to create that fake crease
next I'm using my color tattoo and
barely branded in order to create a base
for the inner corner highlight and then
I'm just applying the white shimmery
eyeshadow over that so the final step of
this makeup look is to take the darkest
color and apply that to be a fake outer
V that you created with the fake crease
if you created a fake crease and this
step just basically requires a lot of
blending and reapplying of the color
when I'm blending out a really dramatic
look like this I like to use a bunch of
different blending brushes so you'll be
able to tell that I'm switching three
different blending brushes and the main
thing you want to look out for is just
to try to make both sides as identical
as possible
and when you're completely satisfied
with your blending just take the white
shimmery color again and apply that to
the brow bone as a highlight next I'm
using a pencil brush to apply the three
colors in the first middle and outer
part of my lower lash line going from
light to dark for me false lashes are an
absolute must for this look false lashes
dramatize the entire look and plus they
can really make any eye makeup look
great in pictures after the lash glue
dries you can curl your lashes and then
apply generous coats of your favorite
volumizing mascara so to avoid any
mascara leakage throughout the night I
applied this waterproof mascara on lower
lash line using this cool eyebrow pencil
I just filled in my eyebrows so that
there are no visible sparse areas
to finish off the entire look just use
your favorite lip gloss for some shine
on your lips and just be sure to stay
away from any dramatic colors because
the eyes are really the focal point of
this look
the next step is optional of course but
I just decided to add a tiny tiny winged
liner just to make the false lashes look
a little bit more natural so now that
the makeup is complete I'm going to move
on to my hair the hairstyle that I was
going for was kind of like a messy but
very cutest look and I think that I
achieved it pretty well
after brushing up my hair I put it all
to one side of my head and then I made a
part where I wanted it to be then I just
use this hair band to keep all of my
hair in a ponytail while I started my
fishtail braid and using a hairband
while
fishtail braiding makes the process so
much easier and if you're going for a
messy look like I was it's really easy
to just take it off afterwards and it'll
still look good
next I pulled out some hair in the front
to give the hairstyle that messy look
that I was going for and also to curl
later so here I just wanted my fishtail
braid to look like it started higher up
than it actually did so I just looked it
inwards which actually gave the exact
same effect as a fishtail braid without
actually being a fishtail braid and then
to pull the entire look together and
give it a little bit of elegance I
curled the front parts of my hair away
from my face
alright guys thanks so much for watching
be sure to stay tuned for my next two
prom videos that are coming out for this
little prom series and I will see you
guys very soon bye
