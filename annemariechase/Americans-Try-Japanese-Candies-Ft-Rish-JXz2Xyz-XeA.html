so today I'm here again with rich I'm
rich this is I'm one of my best friends
at USC and he's been in a lot of my
videos you guys know British if you
watch applause hopefully hopefully I
made a little impression right now so
today we are going to be filming a what
is this video today we're gonna be
filming and trying Japanese candies
slush snack so we decided to do this
because I got sent this box called Japan
playing great and there's like not a
sponsored video at all they just like
sent me this box like once and then
they're like this sent you this box full
of money to play I'm very into like
boxes full of Japanese no I'm like into
like trying like make some different
cultures because you realize that
there's like better stuff in other
places but you still love America though
right exactly
and then like it was a good excuse to
buy a bunch of more Japanese candies
because you don't have to get this so
Japanese candies you can go to like the
Asian market but this is the official
title market area so apparently these
are delivered monthly yeah are you
getting these everyone them
I don't think sizing is legal on that we
made a stop to the thumb market in
Koreatown Los Angeles yeah so let's get
started with the Japan creates a box
okay so here's what it looks like and
how this little paper explaining like
all the stuff that's in it they're like
a couch with eyes or we got the premium
mini plus original box because we're
high rollers I'm not very good
like seaweed to throw away is Jeremy
what ladies chip with seaweed like
flavoring literally gonna taste like a
normal way of Demand seaweed flakes give
these chips an unusual crunch that's the
usual fun to me
I don't like it she goes from a range of
that's like a mile discussed and then a
little more is I think not good I guess
that's good it's not like absolutely
disgusting but it is kind of gotta do
better than this
they have my Korean ice cream
Wow very graceful done thanks really
cute that's one thing good I want the
swimmers leave this whole place and
that's all I have to say about that
I saw after these new try know when I
was there sweet corn flavored rice those
are pretty good they're gonna be a
popular stick but they're like more
snacky plus of the dessert enormous
snaggy
a snack I put in a notch about the rolls
gold you know rold gold pretzels if you
don't impress some of that this one
looks really good looks like a stick of
butter I wish that first obviously the
chocolaty side doesn't kind of like
vanilla filling
there's nothing in the oh well
how's moratta good man but for all you
breaded chocolate connoisseur is about
what you expect it's good I like you
like hockey
this is lemon the squash but like it's
like glue is feels like very strange
lemon squashes a name for a lemonade in
Japan read your lemon squash right out
of the bottle of the bottle
thank you have to cut it really nice he
does not have scissors
forget them yeah I would not buy that
again yeah this is some kind of toilet
themed wow this is like very elaborate
I'm not sure what I should be thinking
about this if we're eating this out of
the toilet got three powders and we put
it in the toilet somehow it's like a
baby bottle pop but the bottles the
toilet better glue every other matrix
records by the way yeah I don't
I seriously understand you're supposed
to add like wire baby the science the
toilet candy would be the name of this
video
it's just I don't really like drinking
out of the toilet oh oh yeah this would
be eat it oh this is kind of cool this
is like something that you would puke up
thank you 10 dozen worst in the day do
you true truth it's really good it's
really good but I get like five bucks
five out of ten
next thing these look really good you
say full Gert on that take some of this
today
anyone
like coke bottle but it's like a
lollipop it has a face in the middle
like stuck in the middle and then it has
stuff in the straw - can you see that
yeah I mean yeah anything been actually
good in this so far this one was really
nice
and how's the calories it's in English
and it's squishy and I'm excited
there's Crossman it smells so good
well like dive it down feel like down
attempt to sink robitussin hand medicine
this is where you could definitely be a
medicine I hope every up these little
sugar candies I don't think I'll be up
bad yeah literally just it's like I'm
eating sugar okay ingredients for sugar
candy sugar what stuff is all in here
this was really cool yeah no I have
sugar let me sweeten their mouth and
they start laughing when this part hurts
no we're like something in the middle of
it yeah it's like a weird chubby buddy
no disgusting
here's about if you guys don't like
somebody get that one cuz it's like way
harder I do not recommend that though
because it makes you feel really bad I'm
literally crying there's Matt can you
stop dropping things in the middle of it
well maybe warn me okay these I think
are gonna be really good it means really
good milk based candies yeah how many
how many do you said that
there's no explosion about zero but milk
chocolate yeah no times in that box no
those are all the candies and snacks
that we tried quite painful in some ways
I think I think the flavors a lot yeah
not like the execution like definitely
not trying to play it safe I mean but I
don't know if I want my candy makers did
not play safe I'm like why would you put
Kanyon a toilet first of all heavily
longer can you try to kill me please
anyway it was an interesting experience
some of those were very painfully by
this this stuff and you know like your
mom or your like friends it's probably
the best oh this is the worst thing but
tasty some of them yeah it was like good
before that thank you so much rich for
being in this video if you guys want to
see more of him you can tell or he'll
probably be in somewhere moving videos

thumb up that's ready put your thumb up

different types of candies like from
different nation or if you have any
other video ideas for my personality we
