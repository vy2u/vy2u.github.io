have my dad
dr. Colonel Robert Allen walk us through
how I do my makeup so let's get started
I just got out of bed and this is what I
look like when I get out of bed not too
bad hi guys
alright so I'm going to get my hair out
of the way so I can start working on my
face so we start with the moisture free
sunscreen all even though we don't need
the SPF in Alaska because we never see
the Sun and we put a little bit here and
it looks like a bird just pooped on my
hand and rub that into my face and we're
gonna rub and rub and rub and I hope
that I'll get blackheads and pimples
from this stuff I have to use that stuff
to pull back my eyebrows because they're
all over the place and put on will be
this see what happens now don't look any
different I look just the same it just
gives me
foundation for all the pains I'm going
to put on my face now we're to see if I
can look different with this you know
it's tough this up my nose to protect my
nose from the stuff going on my face and
I have a little splash of vodka first
put that in there that's why the video
yeah this will do great there right
there get me through don't feel what mom
know that I'm drinking this and we're
continuing to rub stuff into our skin
that is going to give it in problems
later on and we're going to put this
foundation on the foundation and get
more foundation and we have summited off
with the vodka turning around he gave up
you noticing it doesn't look like your
makeup cuts off right as the outside he
goes on the inside it gives you a good
complete look now we're going to try
this dark circle eraser we're going to
get some of this stuff around our eyes
is we're not quite happy with the color
we have yet and I'm just undoing
everything I did the last stuff so
they're just the layer upon layer scary
and we need to smooth that out some more
try not to poke my eye out we get big
eyeballs and we're just going to finally
use our fingers which we could have used
before so that's uh yet more stuff so
you can't see the veins in my eyelid
which are popping out and we're gonna
try to hide it and there's get some more
stuff actually we could use a little law
with that but we use a brush this time
and I'm gonna try it out to see this is
I think this layer six we're putting on
our face now here comes seven and it
smells good that's why I put it on we're
gonna put a little bit there up there
screw that up that looks like war paint
that's what camouflage my dad put on his
face when he's in the army sitting
Halloween we're gonna try to brush that
out again we're making more blackheads
so I can get more zits tomorrow that was
good and now we're gonna put yet another
coating on all this stuff on my face my
neck is starting to hurt I can still see
the veins in my lids I gotta get rid of
those
there you go they're gone now that means
I put enough on put it up on so you
don't see the veins in the eyelids
anymore and now somebody just
interrupted me and that's my mad face
but now I'm happy because I got this
plush toy cute she's cute
I'll add that to my plush toy collection
I am a whole lot let's see how much it
cost good I like that
if you better if he just gave me jewelry
though more stuff on the eye again
you're not seeing those unsightly veins
or stuff since left their yard you get
to work on that a little bit more and
we're going to smooth that out and wipe
that off on our pants once we're done
I'm wiping off there keeps it now I'm
going to torture myself with this
eyelash curler which I really don't need
that hurts most hurt the other eye too
ouch and we're going to pull a couple
eyelash that with that and
it's by the fact I'm going to use this
to trim my nose hairs either get to see
that now we're too hot again
I plucked out some nose hairs that's
them on the end and I'm going to try to
touch my eyelashes now even though I
just tried to curl no I'm gonna color
and I dropped that on this one we'll
edit that out more stuff on the eyes on
the I left lashes the moon come on this
is a lot of stuff on I should get him on
the end and now we had to go for the
eyebrows
highlight the eyebrows and they can down
turn a little bit like a much more
severe glare and Jacob one-on-one -
we're going to be exactly like now we
need to go for the lips little bit red
we'll try to even that out it's sort of
clownish looking I was like Heath Ledger
under those Joker and I'm going to take
that off and try to get in my teeth we
go for something more subtle now I'm
gonna get my hair back so this time now
that that's done and now I looked
operating ready to go
and that's what it is
thank you
I'm going to waste that all on Jacob you
can probably cut that out though alright
