excited to show you guys my first ever
DIY video on this channel mostly because
I'm done with it and it took so long I
had no idea how long DIYs took to film
edit and then do voiceovers for like
trying to explain things like while
you're it's really hard so I'm not gonna
show you guys how to like cover a pencil
with washi tape or how to make your own
notebook or binder cover cuz I saw a lot
of really awesome ones of those but I
tried to make my DIYs really affordable
and fun and I tried to make them so that
you can enhance the things that you need
for school and that you already have for
school or it can help you make a pencil
pouch or an emergency kit that I have
back here yay so if you guys like this
video please give it a thumb up to let
me know that you guys liked it and also
to let me know to do more DIYs like this
in the future so I hope you guys enjoy
this video and let's get into it for
this project you will need some quilting
squares some velcro and some glue I got
some tacky glue but I mostly just used
my hot glue gun I wanted to lie on the
inside of my pencil pouch as well so I
chose two fabrics so the blue one is
going to be the design inside my pencil
pouch figure out how big you want your
pencil pouch to be I want it to be able
to like fit a scissor in it so then I
did the same with the blue fabric except
I made it like a quarter of an inch to
half an inch shorter on each side I put
the outside fabric facing down on the
table so the outside of it is on top of
the table and then the inside one is
facing up so just make sure it's as
symmetrical as possible on all sides and
then just hot glue the edges down now
we're going to glue the extra like Slap
of fabric over the top of the blue
fabric but only on the sides of the bag
for now so you want to make sure that
you have an exact and straight line
because when you put it together like so
it's going to have to line up perfectly
before gluing down the flaps of the top
part of the pouch we're
to cut the edges of the fabric out about
a 45 degree angle I was gonna say tidy
and then we can glue it down for the
velcro I would say to definitely sew it
on before gluing the slop down I wasn't
able to because I wasn't home and didn't
have my old needle and thread but you
should definitely sew it on and if you
can't just use a bunch of hot glue
because it will stay with a lot of it I
randomly found this like sequiny string
thing in my bag of crafts and I thought
it matched pretty perfectly so I kind of
was like oh I have to glue this on here
so I just glued the sequins on at every
inch or so just to get it on there at
first and then I talked to the extra
inside of the fold
because you know I'm all about that bass
bout that bass no treble I'm all about
that bass bout that bass no treble so
for this project you'll need a paper bag
some tape some stencils are optional and
also some paint are optional and then
you will also need a paintbrush and a
pencil or a pen okay so I just found
this USC bookstore bag and I thought I
should use it since I'm going to USC
next year so the first thing that we're
going to do is take off the handles if
your bag has them some probably won't
and then you're gonna use the line down
the middle as a guide to tear the line
to turn the bag down the middle and then
you're going to cut all of the edges of
the bag so that when you're done cutting
it it can open up flat so it's basically
just not a bag anymore so we're cutting
the bag leanness away out out of it so
the next thing you're gonna do is you're
going to cut the part that sticks out of
the bottom the little flap that has like
a bunch of weird folds and stuff so
you're kind of just left with the big
piece of paper so be sure that you have
the logo side of the paper facing up I'm
folding the slop of paper up because it
already has a crease and we need to do
this anyways and then after that I'm
going to line my textbook with the
bottom of this fold and then draw about
three lines at the top of the textbook
so that I know where to fold the top
part of the paper so that when you're
all finished folding the folded paper
bag will be the same height as your
textbook I'm positioning the cover so
that the ends of it align and after that
we're going to fold the flaps over the
front and back covers of the textbook
and the next part is what I think is the
coolest part we're going to actually
insert the cover into the folds that I
made earlier so that the entire textbook
is covered completely from front to back
and side to side and then finally to
secure the cover I just taped along the
top and bottom of the new cover on both
the front and the back to seal off the
little gap and the opening that is there
so this is what the cover looks like and
you can stop here but of course I wanted
to decorate mine so I found this stencil
book and my sister's closet and it's
just called a lot of gems daughter
stencils I'm a very big fan of stencils
because I'm really terrible at freehand
painting but if you're good at that I
would totally recommend that
because it would just make it even like
cooler and more unique so I just pick
this weird big oppa Lee thing that
reminded me of a lily pad mixed with the
flour mix with the sunflower sea star so
of course I had to use it and I used the
martha stewart paints that i got at
Michaels and the colors summer haze for
the blue and then antique silk for the
pink so here's what it ended up looking
like and I was a little bit messy with
my stencil but it's okay because it
still liked it and then I decided to do
some of these little dots on the bottom
and the top so I just did that in pink
and that is the final look for the cover
for this third DIY you'll need some
pretty scrapbook paper some bedazzle
ease Mod Podge a reasonable plastic cup
I got mine from Starbucks for like 2
bucks a brush rear Mod Podge and a
marker or a sharpie some glue would be
helpful but if you don't have any then
your Mod Podge also acts as glue so you
may be wondering how I'm gonna wrap this
paper on this cut because I was a little
bit skeptical - all you have to do is
have a friend roll the cup across the
paper while you trail behind it with a
pencil and after that you're gonna fill
in your line if you had any mess-ups and
then cut along that line that we just
made so to cut off the bottom part I
just stuck a pencil inside the leftover
paper cylinder and then I traced the
bottom of the cup from there so you'll
see that it makes a pretty similar line
except it'll just be smaller so you kind
of have to draw in that extra part and
then I just cut the paper off so you're
probably gonna have a little bit of
excess paper so I just cut mine off in a
triangle shape which works pretty well
and then I covered the back of the paper
with some Mod Podge and wrapped it back
up around the cup and then I left it to
sit for about half an hour
so once it was all dried I decided that
I wanted to personalize my cup with a
big a so I just looked at some different
fonts on my computer that I wanted to
copy and after I drew the outline with a
pencil I filled it in with a sharpie
marker and then of course I wanted to
bedazzle my cup by adding these little
purple jewel but deadly things and you
don't have to use a hot glue gun because
Mod Podge will act as glue but I just
thought it would be easier to do with a
hot glue gun
there's actually a modpodge that's
dishwasher safe so that would definitely
work best with this project but be sure
not to modpodge anything that directly
touches food or drink that you'll be
consuming because it's not food friendly
okay so for this last DIY which I
thought would be a really cool emergency
kit or just a makeup bag we're going to
be doing the same thing as the pencil
pouch except you're making this bigger
and better so the steps are gonna be a
little bit different so instead of
having a velcro opening this emergency
kit or makeup bag is going to have a
little flap so here's what its gonna
look like it's gonna be like a little
pouch with a flap over it so I think
that's really cute we're eventually
going to fold and then glue all the
sides over and then do another fold just
because of the harsh lines left from the
scissors but first we have to sew the
velcro on you can sew the velcro on to
just the outer layer so I would
recommend taking the inside layer out
because I totally sewed them together
and it's not fun restarting
so now we're going to glue the inside of
the fabric on top of the outside piece
just like last time and we're also going
to glue the extra fabric over and on to
the inside fabric and then of course
we're going to cut off the edges at a 45
degree angle for the sides that we're
going to fold and then glue over next
we're going to sew the other piece of
velcro to the flap and I decided to add
a button which definitely completed the
bag for me
be sure to sew the velcro and the button
if you're adding one on before gluing
the flap down so that all the ugly
thread that its gonna leave is going to
be completely covered when we glue this
little flap fold over down in order to
make sure that I glued it down in a
straight line I just stuck some pins in
it so that it wouldn't move and then I
glued it and then took those pins out
finally although we have to do is glue
the sides down and then we're all done
and the bag is ready to be filled so
here are some of the things that I carry
around in my emergency kit I always have
extra pads or tampons because you never
know what someone's gonna need it or
you're gonna need it I also like to keep
some tissues some chopstick I've really
been liking this Nivea once and I always
carry around a mini hand sanitizer and
there's some smells really good and a
mini lotion because my hands get so dry
especially in the winter time and lastly
I like to carry on blotting sheets
because I tend to have oily skin and
these work better than powder to avoid
the cake face
