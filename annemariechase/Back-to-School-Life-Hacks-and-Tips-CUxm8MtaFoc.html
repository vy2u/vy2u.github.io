you can probably tell I'm in a new
location yet again so I'm not good score
now I go to USC as you guys probably
know I'm starting the fourteenth grade
actually I started last week so non are
being back to school I thought I would
do some life hacks for school so this is
gonna be the first of a two like part
video series type thing also I'd like to
give my good friend rich a little bit of
a shout-out because he actually offered
to help me film my video and he made his
first debut in this video also I'd like
to mention something that I'm extremely
excited about as you guys know from my
last video the sister tag with my sister
Callie I've been trying to get her to
start a channel for literally four years
how long haven't been on YouTube three
years two years I don't know she finally
agreed to start one with me so me and
Callie have started a combine channel
and it's gonna be dedicated to DIYs
because she's an extremely crafty person
and I am just so excited that she's
starting a channel I was like I will
literally do whatever you want me to do
I think she's like a little bit nervous
about starting a channel just because
the YouTube is like not her world but I
really want to make it a part of her
life and I think she's excited so if you
guys would do me a huge huge huge favor
and go subscribe to that channel just go
shower our first video and her first
video with a ton of love comments and
like thumbs ups I would really really
appreciate it and I know that she went
too so go subscribe and I think you guys
will really like it yeah without further
ado I'm just gonna get into the video
okay so the first life hacks are gonna
be for getting ready before school
starts so I don't know about you guys
but whenever I have to get up super
early in the morning I'm just extremely
sensitive to noises black
so what I started doing good morning is
listening to playlists with really happy
and upbeat music she's okay so this is
just a really easy solution that
honestly just makes the start of my day
so much better another tip that I saw it
makes meringue scale like a hundred
times easier is to pack every single
thing that you need into your bag the
night before this way you're not
scrambling the morning of and you won't
forget any assignments at home because
that's the worst when you actually do
that and this to get them at home and
don't believes you then in the morning
you can just grab your bag and head out
the door well class the only thing
neither living nor nonliving is your you
so fall asleep is obviously not a good
thing to do in school some teachers find
it really offensive when you fall asleep
in their class so in order to prevent
this here's a list of things you can do
to keep yourself entertained instead of
falling asleep so the first thing that I
pretty much do every day is write in my
agenda or write a to-do list on a paper
or a sticky note this is also a pretty
productive thing to do because then you
know what you have to do for the rest of
the day
I also really like to save my breakfast
lunch or snacks for glasses that you
know are gonna be boring if you're
allowed to eat in there cause I feel
like you like can't fall asleep when
you're eating and obviously you can
drink some coffee but if you don't like
coffee one of my favorite alternatives
is green tea with brown rice this stuff
is delicious or I really like the
Starbucks refreshers and they actually
have little packets where you can take
them to go so some other life hacks that
I have for in class are to take your
notes by hand this has actually been
proven to help you memorize things
better and it's also a better way to
take notes like versus your computer
where you might get like text messages
or just like by habit open up your web
browsers and another thing that I found
really really helpful in high school was
recording lectures you technically have
to ask permission but I kind of just
snuck recording some lectures sometimes
my chemistry teacher always told us
exactly what she wanted on the lab but
she said it way too fast for anyone to
copy down so I had it recorded and I got
a it's on all of my labs my next line of
hacks are for tests
so I used to get really really nervous
for tests and I didn't have a good way
to calm down beforehand
and then I started blasting music in my
car while I was driving to school if I
had a test that morning or I would
listen to music really loudly on my way
to that class in order to get like
really pumped and just relaxed for that
test
streets born
so I don't highly recommend doing that I
think it's really helpful to cool your
nerves
another huge tip I have is to not cram
and I am so bad at following this advice
there are no benefits to cramming you
remember less you probably stress out a
lot more and you get less sleep so I'd
recommend try to just plan out your
tests write them out just know when your
tests are and be sure that you have time
to study beforehand so some last tips
that I have for just being in school and
especially in high school get to know
your teachers and your counselors
because most likely you're gonna want to
talk to someone at some point in high
school or you're gonna want a
recommendation letter and if your
teachers or counselors know you that's
way better than having someone write
something about you who doesn't even
know you so the next life hack is to not
care about cliques or social standing
because this literally will not matter
after high school and you'll eventually
realize that it is a huge waste of time
so the last life hack that I have that
is very obvious but so important is to
sleep I have had times where I sacrifice
sleep for work and I end up getting
really sick or not remembering anything
that I studied just get enough sleep and
you'll probably be good to go for school
so thank you so much for watching be
sure to give this video a thumbs up and
get excited for some DIYs on our
combined Channel and for the next video
