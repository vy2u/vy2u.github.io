my sister hey and we just got back from
uh no stove yeah so we have a few items
that we wanted to show you it's just a
mini haul for our back-to-school
shopping our school start six-month I
just filmed my makeup tutorial thing so
that's why I have so much makeup on and
I just did an interview so that's all
I'm looking all professional yep okay so
let's get started okay so this is the
first thing we got this is a pink
knitted shirt it's pink and orange and
it's ombre so I'll breathe in dark in
color and the back is really cool
because it has like a really cool um
knit seam in the back which I really
liked
and this isn't it's also really like
baggy loose so just gonna hang on there
I mean your body oh yeah
so this is really cute and someone asked
me to do prices to so this was 34 maybe
yeah I was originally at $64 so it's a
good feel so I thought this is really
pretty
we got it from TBD TBD okay
oh and this is this whole these are all
nurse driven items for the noise room
and versatile
so what I got was an oversized cardigan
and it's really gray and has a lot of
details on it it's rubbish that's the
brand it has like little stripes on the
ends of the hands and a school I have a
pretty laid-back South it's like
sometimes I get really caught up in
classes and this would be perfect to
look casual and comfy at the same time
but also it kind of cute because it's
just like an oversized cardigan so you
can just put on some like leggings
throwing up yeah just brood on you just
look so cute this was 37 90 all right so
the next thing that we picked out was
this blazer blazer it's like it's really
a deep purple kind of like a purpley
brown color maybe burgundy Burgundy and
I was gonna say that I was like I'm
gonna take my time um it is this the
brand Frenchy Frenchy
for VP yeah from BP it's I like it
because it's like it's not stiff it's
really loose I'm really bad at
describing clothes yeah so far of a
casual blazer not a formal yeah
okay and this was 4190 for the
anniversary sale
so the next thing I got was this Steve
Madden crossbody bag there was a lot of
clothes I wear like the orange I don't
know maybe and I like this because there
was two different sizes moment kind of
small and this one was kind of bigger so
I can definitely use this around like
going downtown somewhere but I could
also use it for school like I believe my
books in it but I could fit a lot of
like my calculator or my pencil so I can
just wear it casually like anywhere it's
big enough and it's a crossbody and
Steve Madden it was about $98 and inside
is really cool has a really pretty
stripes in it and pockets okay are these
boots well okay they are super cute
we've been winding boots like these for
really really like since last winter
especially living in Alaska you kind of
need these and they're really like nice
because they have fall colors like
purple and tan and pink salmon oh yeah
they have an assortment of colors they
do there they're really fluffy on the
inside yeah they have faux fur oh yeah
yeah faux fur and then the shoelaces are
like pink and tan yeah oh and they also
come with white shoelaces so that is the
end of our haul

you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
