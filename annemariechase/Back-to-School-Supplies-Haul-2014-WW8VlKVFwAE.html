hey guys it's Amory as you probably all
know because this is my channel and no
one else is ever here today I'm going to
be showing you all my essential school
supplies that I have been using since
like my freshman year or before so these
are all of my absolute favorite school
supplies be sure to check out my
back-to-school playlist that I just set
up it's on my channel so I will link
that down below and I actually made a
very similar video last year but you
guys wanted updated one so here it is
let's get into the video the first thing
that I got the thing that I'm probably
most excited about is I have to get it
my backpack so this is my new backpack
that I got and I think it is beautiful I
got this for half off so it's fifty
dollars for me because my cousin's
boyfriend works out at North Face these
bad guys are really really nice and they
last for a really long time um for
example this is the North Bay streak on
backpack that I've been using for the
last four years my brother has been
using his since his freshman year in
high school and he's gonna be a senior
in college you're really not spending
that much per year like I use this all
four years and I'll use it more but I
just couldn't resist this like half off
offer of this beautiful backpack and
also if your backpack is really heavy
then you can always put these straps on
it really distributes the weight so that
you're not like it's not all in your
back so I don't know I would just say
invest in a good backpack now and then
you won't have to do it later
the next school supply essential is my
laptop there are a lot of which Ebro
laptops but I also use mine to edit and
upload videos and I just needed like a
fast processor but I'm pretty sure Apple
makes their products last only like four
years because every four years my
computer just like stops working
basically it'll like start overheating
and like the fan like turn on and just
be like ah the next thing that I like
overly excited about oh my gosh
so I found this that target and
basically what it is is it's a weekly
posted planner and I'm someone who's
always like trying to like be as
efficient as possible and I like my
lifestyles not efficient like whatsoever
but I'm always like trying to improve
and organize my life this just looks
like the perfect thing to do that and it
was so colorful and aesthetically
appealing whoever planned this marketing
is just like they knew how to get girls
like it has different sections whoa not
cool so it has different sections but of
course I'm not gonna have mom Cole Scott
or Lilly use this and I think this will
be really helpful for videos especially
cuz I'm trying to post twice a week but
then I always I'm like oh I have this to
do or like oh I need to do this instead
of this that day bah blah blah so I
think this will be really handy in
organizing my weeks so I'm basically
just gonna organize it by like YouTube
works cool blah blah like whatever else
my next absolute essential is my hybrid
five-star note binder I got this at
Target because Walmart didn't have it
and this is like the only color they had
one second I've been using this for all
of my high school and I'm going to
college but I still feel like I'll be
using like the same school supplies and
I will be doing like an organization
type video slash like how to do well in
school I also already have enough so
check out that playlist kind of going
along with that I don't know why I
scattered all this stuff this is my five
star like pencil case I just use this
like on the outside so it doesn't take
up any room actually this is pretty cool
like with the white so I'm kind of like
not too mad about the white I've been
using this like combination for the last
four years and this pencil case for last
like six years these are the items that
I put inside my pencil pouch so I like
to switch it up so these are my two
favorite mechanical pencils it's the
Paper Mate one and then the big velocity
pencil and both of them are the same
length size because then you can just
keep using a load that's in here and
it's really handy and convenient and I'm
not really someone who loses their
pencil very often because I have a
pencil pouch so you know um I can keep
my pencils for like years it's kind of
weird this is my favorite
Parise are these are the retractable
erasers I said that really weird
sometimes I feel like I have an accent
like but I don't I don't know and this
is actually a really really handy pen
you know sometimes you see like cool
pens and the ink like sucks or something
but this is really nice if you like use
this stylus instead of like using your
finger it's less obvious it kind of just
looks like you're doodling not like
actually on your phone if you just look
like you're doodling like how do not get
caught texting or looking on your phone
in high school this is a huge huge
essential for me my voice just cracked
I'm just like a 13 year old boy okay
this is a huge essential for me planners
this is a little Pulitzer agenda and I
got one of these for me my mom and my
sister and I think this is the medium
sized don't get the jumbo size I got
that for my sister it was too big for
her to carry around in her purse so she
said that she didn't use it as much as
she would have if it was smaller I am
actually not gonna repurchase this I'm
looking at a different planner that you
can customize and they said that they
would send me a discount code I'm not
working for them or anything I'm really
not making a profit in any way but it's
just a really really cool concept you
can customize your cover your back cover
and then the stuff that goes in it so
I'm gonna try that out and then I will
get it I'm just too late like I don't
know what I want to put on the cover I
kind of want to make a collage but you
guys should let me know what I should
put on my cover definitely invest in a
planner if you want to stay organized or
if you don't want to buy planners for
some reason like you just hate them I
would recommend getting stickies I like
to use both by the way Walmart had the
best prices on stickies by far of any
place I went to at Target they had
different kinds of stickies but they
were like six dollars and these were all
one dollar each so just the heads up but
I was super excited about these stickies
these are really handy for like marking
and then writing on top of them and then
I just got these stickies from Target
because I like to mark the page in my
textbook that I'm honest it just seems
like a lot of time every single day I
used to mark them with these ones but
these always rip so these are a lot more
durable and I feel like I will just use
them a lot more for stuff like that
everything that I didn't actually get
because I think I'm just gonna get it
when I go to college
so that I'm to carry around with me is
an expandable folder as you can tell I
have one from every year no that's not
true cuz I'm missing one as you can tell
I have one from every year and this
almost hit me in the face I keep all of
my old work from old classes and this is
really important to do I have found this
super helpful and so many cases so I
definitely keep all my old work I could
totally sell some of this work for a
profit like I'm not even kidding people
would buy this stuff but I'm not going
to I'm just saying like this will come
in handy at some point or another and
then my last school supply essential
this is my ti-84 plus to her addition
graphing calculator and these are like a
hundred to like $120 but this is a
really good investment if you're going
to be taking like any type of advanced
math for like a long period of time I
used it from freshman year and algebra 2
to precalculus calculus and then stats
and I'm going to be using this
throughout college math classes -
definitely worth the investment if
you're going to be taking advanced math
classes and this one is adorable it's
pink and I think that's all of the stuff
that I got for my school supplies I hope
I hope you guys enjoy this video and I
hope you guys found it pretty helpful
and I will be making some more back to
school videos very soon so leave me any
requests that you want to see and if you
like this video please give it a thumb
up do you like how I sets them up
because a lot of people say thumbs up
but it's a singular thumb so I was like
why do people say thumbs up so yeah if
you liked it give it a thumb up and I'll
see you guys later

don't want to hear this but it is it's

airplanes in the world I know that's
