excited because I am here with like a
back-to-school essentials type video
haul thing this video was extremely
popular last year like I posted this
video last year and I think it's the
number one viewed video on my entire
channel so I was really excited to make
it and make an updated one because you
guys seem to really like these videos
alright use my school supplies
throughout the entire year and I don't
really find myself having to like go and
get school supplies every single year so
a lot of these things that I picked up
are actually stuff that I don't need so
I decided to pick up these things for
you guys so at the end of this video I
will tell you guys how to enter this
giveaway but most of the things that you
will see in this video are going to be
up for grabs in this video so let's get
started the first thing that I said in
my last video is my computer a lot of
you guys asked me like exactly what
model I had when I showed my last
computer so I didn't really answer what
kind of computer I had because it wasn't
billion wasn't important but then I
realized okay my other computers right
here do you see this difference in size
this one weighs so much if you guys are
looking for a macbook and want my
opinion I would personally get a 13-inch
unless you want the really fast
processor for some reason I don't know
it's cheaper and you don't really need
like a giant computer you don't need to
be lugging that around everywhere so my
computers are not gonna be in a giveaway
but pretty much everything from now on
is so the thing that I got that I pretty
much get every year is this five star
hybrid note binder I actually have a
video on how I use this in high school
and I can make all of my back to school
my back school playlist below you can
find that in there but I will be doing
an updated one this just keeps me really
really organized simple fresh clean I
feel like I'm just grabbing a fruit yeah
to go along with that I decided to pick
you guys up one of these three whole
paper
punchers because I have one of these and
honestly like I just feel so cool
whenever everyone else is to get up to
use the whole punch and I'm like sitting
at my desk
you don't even have to leave your desk
so I just thought this is a nice
addition if you guys like keeping papers
in your binders or if you just want a
hole punch I got that for you guys so I
got your backs um pulls hole punches so
the next thing that I got are these two
notebooks and I personally got one for
me I got actually a few of these things
where I got one for me and then one for
you guys so this is the one that I'm
going to be giving to you guys and I
thought the color was cute and it's also
college-ruled
I really could not do anything else it's
just like not possible you can see me in
the background it's a little bit is it
weird
is it creepy it's abstract you know the
next thing that's an absolute essential
for me all of every single year actually
that's not true
usually what happens is I will buy an
agenda I'll use it for like a good month
or so and then I'll stop using it and
then for the rest of the year I'll use
it like for one day and then like not
it's really funny I don't know why I do
this and I don't like you buying them
I've tried a lot of planners I've tried
the Lilly Pulitzer one I tried this one
and then I'm actually ordering the Erin
Condren one side no it's really annoying
if you order Erin Condren because it
literally takes like three weeks just to
start their shipment I don't know they
must be like really busy or something
because I ordered mine three weeks ago
and it hasn't shipped yet so if you want
like a popular agenda you might want to
order it very soon but this one is the
tools for wisdom 2015 planner I don't
know I didn't like the everyday function
of it like everyday layout because it's
like by the hour so yeah I would highly
recommend planners but you really just
have to like know your preference and
planners and like look around and see
what planner suits you best I show this
in my last haul I actually tried looking
for this for you guys and I couldn't
find one that was very similar to it
because I love this one because it has
two pockets I hold all of my pencils and
like no cards or flash cards and this
this is like the reason why I don't lose
any pencils or pens and then the next
thing is my absolute favorite I got this
matching so it might give away I will
have one and then you guys don't have
one I really just got to matching
journals mostly as an excuse to get
another journal oh it's just like have
this mindset
that I want a journal that I write in
like very often so this is already
picked this on out I like this one way
too much to give it away so this one's
gonna be my right and then I'm gonna
give this one to you guys
this one says right I think this one's
really adorable - I just wanted a bigger
one yeah well no I'm just like selfish I
think that this will be really nice for
like goal setting ideas like lists like
anything you can write anything in here
but I really want to get into the
journaling not necessarily like writing
out my feelings or anything but just
like keeping track of things these are
my favorite pens pencils and erasers and
I'm super particular about these so I
decided to like get my favorite ones and
then give them to you guys okay so the
first one feel like these are the
typical like paper made pencils I don't
really know what my mindset was behind
getting only one I think it was before I
knew that I was gonna do my giveaway cuz
I didn't really need this and I was like
why would I get two so that's why I only
got one I'm not just being really cheap
well this is my favorite pencil and then
my favorite pens are these pens on my
roommate introduced me to their the
energy L pen tell pens and I just really
like these because they're really fun to
take notes with and they don't bleed
through papers which is like my biggest
pet peeve like pen you had one job so
for the giveaway I'm going to give you
like one blue and then one black pen
who's calling me thank you hello hello
hey I'm filming right now yeah I'm I'll
text you when I've been rude uh okay so
the next thing is I got so colorful in
my last video I said post-its or
stickies and people were very upset
about that not really but like they just
I was really funny
I don't sometimes people say things I
don't know I'm a huge fan of post-it
notes I use them very often for to-do
lists and then I got these so I use
these just like especially when I have
like English homework and you have to
like read a book just stick these all
over the place and write all over them I
am someone who cannot write in a book
yet I was just taught not to do that and
it feels like morally wrong so I can't
do it even if it's like recommended now
in college
the last two things that
I got for this giveaway were these
racers I'm actually gonna be super
you'll get like two of them oh these are
my favorite erasers I just remember
calli had these and it works really
nicely but I really like these ones but
if you're not like into these type of
racers I got this one for you just in
case but I'm gonna steal one of these
you're gonna get two of these two of
these because I kind of want one of
these so thanks and then the last thing
that I got was just some gum because I
was in target and I was like I want some
gum so I got you guys some gum - it's
pretty much the end of the story so
those are the things that I got for this
new school year and now I'm moving on to
the giveaway like entry rules I guess I
haven't actually thought about this so
