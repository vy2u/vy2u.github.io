excited about this video because first
of all this is a back-to-school video
the first back-to-school video that I
will have on my channel second of all
it's a giveaway so I'm giving away
everything that you see more on that
later if you're not already subscribed
please hit that subscribe button right
now for more back to school videos this
is my favorite type of series to do on
my channel so I'm going to be posting
twice a week starting today and it's all
gonna be like back to school and college
related because I will be a u.s. see
junior I'll be a junior whoa time flies
by the way if you guys want to see more
back-to-school related videos I have a
playlist that I just created and updated
so I will have that as like one of the
first links in my description box but
today we're going to do back-to-school
essentials
school supplies haul I thought I've only
done this once to my channel but I
looked back and I've done it for the
last three years if you guys have
watched any of those previous hauls you
will see that one of my favorite school
suppliers school supplies suppliers is a
5 star you guys probably noticed that I
really loves 5 star and actually 5 star
notice that I really love 5 star if a
company reaches me for my platform it's
literally just because of my viewers
watching so I wanted to give back and
hopefully give all these school supplies
away to someone who really needs them so
I'm excited to do that but without
further ado I'm going to stop talking
because I'm talking too much and get
into the hall so I am gonna try to cover
all of my school essentials so of course
the first thing is my laptop this is a
macbook 15-inch i actually still get
tweets from people asking me what size
or like what computer i have honestly it
doesn't really matter what computer you
have as long as it works but I find that
the Apple computers are just really
compatible with every like device that I
use I would say unless you have the need
for a computer with a lot of like ram
memory and a fast processor I would
definitely go for the smaller one
because whenever I carry that around and
I have to carry it around every single
day it's really heavy and it weighs my
back down so I would definitely go with
a lighter option if you can unless you
like need it for editing or just video
games or whatever you need those things
for
if I had use for this I would actually
keep this I'm sorry but I just don't
because it is a tablet stand notebook
case that means that this will only
really be useful if you have a tablet
which I do not have it looks like this q
su q IC basically what happens I'm
assuming I've never used this but this
is what it looks like is going to happen
you set this up on your desk and you
have your little tablet right here so
you are looking at your notes on your
device or your computer and then at the
same time if you have like a tablet you
can take notes and the nifty thing that
I've noticed about this is that you can
take this notebook out and um keep
replacing these so this never like gets
old really so that's cool we have this
little guy whoa whoa bear no I kind of
felt stupid opening X I couldn't but you
just press down this button you have
these little mesh pockets for different
things this pocket this pocket and this
pocket softly lined padded pocket stores
and protects laptops and tablets now
this definitely Mike like a size scale
thing you know would not would not fit
but maybe if you had a smaller computer
Oh external cord port for listening to
music or charging that's pretty cool
where's that Oh
nifty you can stick your cord in there
and these next two things this is my
floor and I was kind of dusty just tell
you I need a vacuum so these student
notebooks are like my notebooks I feel
like I've just talked about them so much
that I really over killed it if you want
to see how I organize my flex binders
did I tell you that it was a flex binder
I always think they're called something
different these are hybrid note binders
if you want to see how I organized all
of my schoolwork and everything and just
kept really really organized I will link
the playlist below but also in that
playlist you'll find like my
organization tips I love this design
it's like very it looks like very techy
pixel you know it it look panel looks
animated I'm just really at a loss for
words here it's just like mind-blowing
this is a one inch binder and this is
actually the one that I recommend in my
organization tips video this is a one
and a half inch and this one actually
has more paper too so these are just
like
honestly my favorite binders I don't use
any other type of binders so these are
like the reinforced ones that have like
the things that are harder to rip which
is actually really nice if you do use
loose leaf paper I don't anymore I used
to in high school I just started using
notebooks after loosely paper notes in
college these work a lot better I can
kind of just keep one notebook per class
and then just whenever I go to class
I'll just write down so it's also very
chronological and I just feel like it's
more organized and easy to kind of
review because a lot of classes in
college you like tests by sections like
midterms so I have a white green lime
green and then a purple one yeah so in
every single one of my videos I have
featured an agenda I try the Lilly
Pulitzer agenda not only did I get the
Erin Condren agenda I also got a ton of
stickers from Etsy for that agenda and
guess how many times I used it I used it
zero times my problem is I think that
I'm scared of like making something ugly
so I used to literally never even write
in a notebook with pen I decided to like
face my fears and buy a journal to write
in for myself I'm really proud of this
and then for you guys first of all I
picked this red dream one because I feel
like it's pretty inspirational and I
don't know it just looks really cute to
write in my vices crack and then if you
watch my last year's video you'll
recognize this so this is a prime
example of me never wanting to write in
a journal to not make it ugly like I
didn't even erase anything this is just
not written in like does anyone else do
that where they like buy a really cute
journal and then never write in it it's
like not gonna be cute anymore let me
know I also don't have cute handwriting
like just not something that I have I
have had my old pencil case my five star
pencil case since sixth grade or fifth
grade and I still use it all the time in
my last haul I mentioned that I was
really sad because I was looking for a
pencil case to give to you guys last
year and I couldn't find one that had
two pockets five star hook you guys up
they have this little pouch right here
that you can stick your pencils in this
little pouch right here and then there's
more this thing just expands endlessly
oh they have little examples of what you
can Oh
you can easily store this in your binder
apparently so you can figure this out
once you get it yes this is awesome I
got you guys my favorite pencils I got
three individual ones which let me tell
you are a lot more expensive
individually than just buying like a
pack of four and then me splitting it up
but the thing is I wanted you guys to
each have like your little lead and
erasers like you're welcome
if you do have these like lead and
erasers these can last you so long for
pens I have found that I just like these
classic pilot g2 pens because I can
write in like a pretty notebook and they
will not bleed and they're like really
sharp like fine point pens so these are
not my favorite pen these are the pen
tool erasers I've changed my favorite
erasers from last year but I've just
found that these are just consistently
great erasers and then these were
unusually expensive like I did not
expect these to be so expensive so I
love to use these more durable tabs for
my like book marker and textbooks is you
know you have like a huge textbook you
just want to flip to the page so I just
stick this on the side and everyone who
I ever show this little trick to always
copies me so I think these are really
handy and then I have these post-it page
markers I find these really really
helpful and any classes where I have to
read books these can also be used for
page markers but I like writing on these
and then sticking them in books if I
have like an essay kind of similar our
flashcards and I feel like everyone
could just always use flashcards
randomly
okay so I think the last two things that
I have our mini staplers for some reason
and my last haul I was like here's a
hole puncher you can be the cool kid not
having to go up and punch your holes in
your paper and I was like what the heck
oh I haven't punched any holes in my
papers lately so I did not get another
one of those there's literally a huge
book on my chair right now and I was
literally sitting there I vacuum it up
oh my god
I ran out of space on my camera and then
I got up and then just looked on my seat
with my favorite blanket my source of
comfort and joy and I saw this giant bug
and honestly did not look that big but
it was big and check this shirt out like
it doesn't have a back so I was probably
like it probably came from my backers
one link now I feel like there are bugs
everywhere this is what you get we go
clean your room I got so many text
messages during the filming of this
video someone also use my uber eats code
uber eat says thank you for spreading
the love thank you for having over eats
my code will be linked below I've been
eating it every meal okay as I was
saying you're just going to be really
cool in class if you have if you show up
with a stapler okay those are all the
things that I have purchased and
received from five star first of all I
honestly think it's so cool that five
star reached out to me so I want to
thank them even though they sent these
for me I really don't need them because
honestly like I can show you I can grab
my belt binders and I've had them for
years and I don't need another one so
I'm willing
however Sam willing to give all of this
away I really want this to be a giveaway
for my subscribers who have been there
supporting me and have grown with my
channel grown with me with my channel
but I also really want these things to
go to people who actually really need
them actually use it and that's also why
I'm not going to give it all away to one
person because there are a lot of
doubles I decided to do this into four
different giveaways because I feel like
I have like so many school supplies and
so many repeats so this way four people
can win for my subscribers hopefully

anyone like choose I'm just gonna kind
of divide it as I see fit and then go
