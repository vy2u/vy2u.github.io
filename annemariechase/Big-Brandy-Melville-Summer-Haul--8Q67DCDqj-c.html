a really long time since I last filmed a
video I've been sick for the last week
or so and then I've had AP tests and
stuff like that so I'm just been kind of
busy but I'm feeling a lot better except
for like a little cough here and there
so I should be posting more videos very
soon so this video is my like pretty
large summer brandy melville haul and
before I started I just wanted to make a
quick like little announcement slash ask
you guys a question I have been getting
a ton of requests I think it's my number
one requested thing to have a know who
is my boyfriend who was in my last two
videos or so I don't know he wasn't it I
don't know so we were thinking of what
videos who wanted to do and we
definitely wanted to do something
because it is his last month here but we
weren't really sure which video we
wanted to do um so we were thinking like
the boyfriend tag or something like that
I wanted to know if you guys had any
questions specifically for a no um or
like for me and a note or anything like
that or if you guys had any requests
that we do for videos and so if you have
any requests or questions just leave
them below and I'd be really helpful I
don't have a brandy melville anywhere
near me um but whenever we go out of
state we always go to the brandy
Melville if they have it and my mom was
in California this weekend and she spent
a large majority of her Saturday morning
I don't know afternoon going around
brandy Melville and sending pictures to
me and my sister about what we would
like um for her to buy it's like one of
those things where you're just like wow
that is really embarrassing mom I mean
only moms would do that so that was
really nice of her so I have quite a bit
of things from brandy melville so I'm
just gonna go ahead and get started also
a quick disclaimer is that I do share
like all of my clothes every single
thing that I own with my sister's so
that is why I have like a bunch of
repeats kind of and similar things I
don't think I'm gonna put prices because
the price tags always fall off like I'll
show you guys our prices if I have them
but they always fall off like I don't
know these price tags just they I just
find them around my room and then I
don't know which goes to where so I'm
just gonna show you them for the ones
that haven't fallen off yet so the first
thing that
have from my little pal that I have here
in no particular order is this gray
sweater I love their sweaters they are
so comfortable and they're adorable like
you know how you're always just like I
want to be one of those cute girls in
the hoodie with like no makeup on and
sweats and stuff like that go to brandy
melville get a brandy melville sweater
and then you can be one of those girls
because these are adorable they look
good on everyone um and they have I
don't know they're just there my phone's
ringing another guy that I don't even
know how to explain them I just love
them so much they're cute they're super
super cute and casual so I love them
they're sweaters and this one's just
really plain but I also like how they
kind of go off the shoulder of the race
slouchy and just really really
comfortable and super soft so this is
just one of the sweaters and the price
tag for this one has already fallen off
so I do not know the price for this one
but I have a bunch of other similar
sweater so I could probably tell you
guys a price so the next thing that I
got or that I'm going to show you is
this super super cute tank top with this
little design on it I'm not really sure
what kind of design like brandy melville
goes for because they don't have like a
certain logo i i i don't think but it is
really cute and brittany manuel kind of
has this like style i don't know what
you would call it though it's kind of
like tribal issue but i'm not really
sure
so i thought this is really cute and
this is also like one of the really
slouchy ones that just looks really
adorable and it's just just a pretty
plain tank top but it's really cute and
nice for summer and very casual all
these things that i got our super casual
and this is $22 I kind of feel bad
because there's no order for this but
it's just a big pile of clothes the next
few things are the sweaters that I was
talking about so they were the exact
same type of sweater I think but they're
just different designs so this one is
like a tie-dye um it's kind of like
blueish and then goes black and gray
this one's like the one that I picked
out um and I think it's really really
cute I thought it was very unique and
very different and this was 33 dollars
and then the next sweater is the one
that my sister
doubt and I actually really like this
one too because it's adorable on
so it's this sweater and this is also
very casual and adorable but it's like I
feel like this one's more casual than my
casual one like these are two completely
different moods like two completely
different styles but they're both really
cute and I really like both of them you
can kind of tell that it's how slouchy
it is with this one because this is the
sleeve and then it ends right here so
your shoulders like somewhere up here so
I really like that about these sweaters
and brandy melville sweaters is that
they're just really slushy and they just
fit so well because they're just they
just hang there they're not like stiff
and like big and bulky like the sweaters
that you find in the stores are just
really nice and soft and and feminine I
think the next thing that I really
thought was adorable is this skirt and
this is a floral kind of miniskirt I
just thought this was super pretty and
feminine and very cute and very nice for
summer so I'm really excited to wear
this and it just looks like that it's
very flowy and pretty and very girly and
this skirt was 20 to some price tags
some of the price tags have like four
numbers on them so I'm have just one so
I don't know what this means it was just
$22 and that's it okay so the next tank
top that I got is just this super super
simple white tank top but it has a
really cool back it's not really a tank
top it's kind of more like a sleeveless
t-shirt and then here's the back so it's
just like a backless sleeveless t-shirt
that's really light and just kind of
nice just to throw on a really hot day
which I probably won't in Alaska but I
might go somewhere hot and then throw
this on and this was $26 and then we got
three really similar shirts and I will
show you that right now these are all
long-sleeved kind of high-rise like very
short shirts so this is just a striped
one and then as you can tell it's kind
of just it kind of just ends like right
about like where your belly button is
you guys can't tell her
no cuz it just lowered it but that is
this one and this one does not have a
price tag and then we have this very
similar one except this one has like a
little bit of a color and I think it's
actually shorter than the other one so
that is what this looks like this almost
$20.00 and then the last one of that
kind of type of shirt is this great one
it's kind of like more of the first one
it's shorter it's not that short but it
is shorter than normal shirts and then
this is alarm sleepin just great and
this one was $22 so I'm kind of assuming
that the first this one was $22 as well
but I don't really know cuz they changed
your prices with different parts and
styles and then this one is really
really really super cute this is a super
maxi skirt with a little slit in the
side you guys probably cannot see this
at all cuz I'm just not holding this
upright but you can kind of tell that it
has a slit in the side so this is a slit
and then it's just a really really long
black skirt but and I thought this is
really really pretty and this also does
not have a price tag so I'm sorry about
that and then we have this little skirt
it's just a very small very comfortable
skirt it's like a different material
it's kind of heavier then this one is
this is more just like the kind of
material that they use for the sweaters
and stuff and this kind of feels like a
little bit like suede or something I
don't know this is definitely different
and then we just got these plain
leggings and I also do not have the
price tag for these they're really
comfortable and really thick but they
still feel light so they're not like
leggings where they're you can actually
wear them as tights or pants but these
you can sew this tank top that I'm going
to show you is a little bit weird so
this is what it looks like it cinches
not at the waist it kind of centers
under the bust and then kind of lower
towards your hips so that's where it's
scindia's and then this is the back so
it has an open back
I tried it on earlier just really fast
and I did not like it but I'll see I
don't know still open so this is kind of
what this shirt is um this is just a
really navy blue button up and then it
has like you can make quarter sleeves so
I just really love this shirt it's super
cute and super comfortable it's really
light so you can just basically wear it
over like even your bathing suit I know
that one we went to Hawaii and went to
brandy melville clothes I got a similar
to this but it was like a different
material in a different color and she
just threw it over her bathing suit
every day because it's so light and so
like versatile and very cute and casual
so I'm really excited to have this for
my wardrobe and this also does not have
a price tag it fell off so I'm sorry
about that so that is it for this video
I hope you guys enjoyed it and be sure
to leave any requests or questions that
you have below and I will talk to you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
