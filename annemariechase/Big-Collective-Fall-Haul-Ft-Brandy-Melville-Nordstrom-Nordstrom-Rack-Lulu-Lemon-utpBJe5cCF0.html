the exact same thing as my last video
it's been like 20 minutes since I last
film that video but sometimes they do
this thing where I just film like
multiple videos in one day if they're
short easy videos so this is going to be
my kind of collective fall haul one
thing that I forgot to mention in my
last video was that I'm in a different
room and I don't know how I forgot to
mention this because it's like my
background this is my sister's room and
it was really weird because this room is
completely clean and empty and weird
because Kelly is really not super clean
person so when she wasn't here living in
this room it was just really empty and
weird but I just like having this room
occupied um so I asked her if it would
be okay with her if I could set up like
a little filming area in here and she
said that would be completely fine so
that's what this is for now on I'm going
to be filming in this room and i'm
actually redoing some of it so this is a
desk right now and i'm going to replace
it with a vanity that i actually have
already I just need to paint the walls
i'm going to think the well plutus this
is my new little area that i'm going to
be filming in and i'm really excited to
have my own space because it's kind of
hectic to film in your own room it's not
really that big of a deal but just nice
to have like this only for filming so
I'm definitely gonna be doing a tour
when I set up my vanity and like when I
paint my room and stuff so I'm really
excited about that but I'm going to go
start with my whole mouth a lot of this
stuff is like really old and a lot of
this stuff is really really knew I got
it in santa monica when i went to
california so i'm just going to start
with the new stuff because i'm most
excited about that and I'm kind of not
as excited about my old stuff because
I've been wearing it and also another
thing for my old stuff I don't have my
price tags anymore I'm not sure if
people usually show price tags in their
halls but I will be sure to do that for
all of my future Hallows after this one
it's just I've been where I needs for
school like every single day so for the
old stuff I just don't have the price
tag anymore and I don't know where they
are so I'm gonna go ahead and get
started with my new stuff this is a Marc
Jacobs purse this is my first ever purse
and I've never really thought that I
really wanted a perso
until I got this purse santa monica
california has ten percent tax which is
redonkulous and alaska anchorage has a
zero percent tax no sales tax so we sent
this by mail to my address here in
Alaska and it was no tax so I say forty
dollars from not paying tax and I was
fine because it came two days later in
the mail but I'm really really excited
about this I've never had my own purse I
don't know I will have my stuff in here
forever if I want it to be so I get to
keep my stuff in here and it's a great
feeling so I'm super excited about this
and a good thing about this one at least
is that it is definitely going to be
trendy year round because it's I don't
know just it fits with every single
outfit that I have tried it on with so
far like this one definitely my favorite
purchase of the entire year which is
really saying something because it's
October maybe my vanity is well because
I'm really excited about that but this
is very close to my vanity or their time
so I'm really really excited about this
and I basically film this entire hall
just to show you guys cuz i was so
excited and yeah so i'm gonna go and
just keep this on my lap and then go
show you the other things so also when I
was in California I went to brandy
melville of course because I never get
to go to brandy melville unless I'm out
of state and I realized that brandy
melville is so popular in California and
it's obviously popular in California
because it's from California but it's
just no one knows about brandy melville
in Anchorage that I know like I'll see
the occasional person wearing something
from Brady or like something that I'll
have but basically other than that no
one knows what it is so i'm going to
show you guys what I got there so I was
in California I actually saw a lot of
people wearing this dress but I wanted
it for a really long time and no one
wears it where I live so I did not feel
that bad getting it so I'm sure you guys
have probably seen this dress in
someone's videos and this was thirty
dollars so thirty dollars at Brandi I
actually went to two brini Melville's I
went to the one by UCLA I don't really
know what area that's called one by UCLA
was tiny and I thought like I was like I
don't know if Oliver any stores like
this
so when in Hawaii isn't that small but
it was just that one because the one in
santa monica was enormous and i actually
have this one in the smaller one it's
very feminine so it's a very nice
feminine everyday thing to wear and it's
the material is like the same as my
favorite braggy hoodies or sweaters so
I'm really excited to wear this and it
looks very cozy and I think it's perfect
for fall I think these are dandelions
but I'm not really sure they kinda look
like flowers but then they also kind of
look like dandelions um and then they
tie up here and then it's just like a
simple superb this is really flattering
because it's not a bulky sweater it's
just a really nice girly and very thin
sweater so I'm really excited to be
wearing this this fall the next thing
that I got was this maxi skirt because
Callie took the other Brandi maxi skirt
so i really have been wanting one for
since cali left and i really like this
one I was actually gonna get a lighter
one um and then I sent a picture to my
mom and sister of what I looked like on
in the dressing room it was like
completely see-through so you wouldn't
be able to wear any underwear with it if
you were going to wear it out um so I
got a darker one and I'm assuming that
the other one a see-through just because
it's really really light material this
is not heavy at all I mean some of them
are heavier than others but this one is
just really light um I think this is
really adorable and perfect for fall as
well I'm some of the brandy skirts
flared out and I tried them on they did
not look good on me at all was not
flattering so I'm glad that they have
this kind of material because it's not
gonna like go outwards a bunch this
skirt was $32 so that's a pretty good
deal for a maxi skirt in my opinion I
was looking for a kimono or kimono I
don't know how to say it but I really
like them and Brady has really popular
kimonos like you see a lot of people
wearing them one of the girls working
there was wearing like a peach kind of
colored Komodo with like flowers on it
and I loved it and I was looking
everywhere in the store for it and I
think it was from like another season or
it just they stopped selling it or
something so i was pretty heartbroken
that I couldn't find
at one so I didn't actually like any of
the other ones as much as I like that
once I was just like I'm not gonna get
one this time but i did get this really
really long sweater which kind of
reminds me of a kimono so i'll show you
guys this goes down like this is really
really long so it'll go down basically
to almost your feet like your ankles or
so and then the sleeves are like kind of
non-existent like they're not really
sleeves they're just kind of like things
where this ends and i think i'd rather
have this thing's a little bit longer
but i still really like this so this is
what i got instead of a kimono or maybe
this is a kimono i don't know if you
guys know let me know in the comments
below but this was thirty nine dollars
and I think that's all clothing I got
from Brady Melville and then I got some
jewelry so this is the ring that I got
for my sister and I and its really
pretty and it fits on my thumb which is
what I like about it so I'm really
excited to give it to her and I sent her
a picture and she was really excited so
those were four dollars and I just
wanted a bracelet so I picked this one
and I think that this chain obviously
goes lower so I think this would be
really pretty and that the last thing
that i got from santa monica were these
um Lululemon's yoga pants I got the ones
that are skinny at the bottom I didn't
get the yoga pants that are flared or
the bootcut ones because I don't know
these made my legs look really nice I'm
even try on the bootcut ones I also just
want these to exercise with and I feel
like I personally like um the skinny
ones better than the bootcut long bell
bottom ones so I just got these ones and
these were 82 dollars but I feel like
Lululemon has like a pretty good
reputation and their clothes are really
good quality and I'm really excited to
have a good quality yoga pant for once
pants okay so I got this a super super
long time ago um it was when Cal I was
working at Abercrombie um oh I guess I
can show you guys now so this is what it
looks like I think it's really really
adorable um it kind of reminded me of
something you'd wear in the rain so I
started wearing it when I was raining
and it's not waterproof it all like
whatsoever it completely soaked
her because it was pouring outside and
then I wore it to school and then I was
really wet for the rest of the period um
so one thing that's cool about this is I
don't remember how much it costs but it
was really unexpected a sale retail
price but they discounted it apparently
Abercrombie just has super random sales
where they mark like things that fifty
percent off for like sixty percent off
so that's when I got this but i just
want to show you guys how pretty this
one is for such a small price but i
don't remember the price so this is not
working out very well but i just really
love this it's really adorable um for
the fall but it does not work well in
the rain but it's still cute nonetheless
and yeah i'm excited to be wearing this
and then the next thing that I got was
when I went to Georgia and it was this
peplum shirt I'm really obsessed with
the peplum style but I don't really have
that many peplum things so I was really
excited when I saw this shirt so I got
this at Nordstrom and I actually went to
nordstrom in santa monica and this is
definitely on sale now so if you guys
are around Nordstrom and like this shirt
then you can snag it for sale one thing
that i got from nordstrom rack was this
plain shirt basically it's just not like
a t-shirt I don't even know what this
material is and it doesn't say but it's
kind of like a nice of material than
just like a regular random t-shirt so
that's why I got it and it just makes
outfits look a little bit more put
together but it's still just like a
plain shirt so I really like this and I
really love the color of it and then I
also got these workout pants from mr.
rag and I haven't worn them so I don't
know why the tags aren't here but I
think I was going to wear them and then
I didn't um I think I mentioned in one
of my videos that getting new workout
clothes kind of motivates me to work out
and I've been working out a lot more
than I have this year than I did last
year so I got to me workout clothes so I
also got some new workout shoes and I
really love the nike shoes these were
from nordstrom rack and there were sixty
five dollars and I think they're really
pretty and then I got this shirt from
aerie and I really like this for a
workout
because it is really light like I always
wear t-shirts but they're just random
t-shirts that I've gotten from like
random places like volleyball camps and
I'm not just completely random places so
it's just nice to have a plain t-shirt
or shirt just for working out and this
is really baggy um so it's just really
comfortable and it's super light and
it's not like suffocating to your body
when you're trying to work out so it's
really flexible and movable and I just
really really like having this shirt to
work out with and it looks really good
if you have like a design sports bra or
like a colorful sports bra because it
sticks out a little bit but not too much
so I like the shirt a lot and I got this
from area and it was ten dollars I don't
know I think they're having some kind of
sale but I got it in the sale section
for ten dollars the last thing that i
got from nurse your mac is not in order
at all was this whatever and I don't
know this isn't like particularly leg
attractive or anything I just really
like the sweater because it's so
comfortable the material is so soft and
I just wear it when I'm having like a
lazy day which is often during school it
looks good like it doesn't look like
you're having a lazy day I think it's
better than wearing like a hoodie or
something but it's still just as
comfortable it's actually really warm
too so that's what I like about this and
it's just nice to throw ons I also got
some converse at nordstrom rack but I've
been wearing them like crazy and they're
dirty already so i'm not going to show
you guys those and they're also
downstairs and i'm too lazy to get them
so i got those a nurse for mac for like
forty fifty dollars so yeah that's
basically all the things that i got for
this fall so far i will probably be
doing some more halls um because i like
these are like the only clothes that i
have in my wardrobe now so let me know
if you guys want hulls like whenever i
get a small amount of things or if you
guys want collective halls I feel like
collective Paul's make more sense for me
because I don't really go on like big
shopping sprees I just get stuff every
now and then so yeah let me know and
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you guys
this video and I will see you guys later
be sure to leave any requests for any
fall videos and yeah any comments that
you want to stay high so I'll talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
