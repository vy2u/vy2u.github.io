you guys are all super surprised to see
me because usually like my post time
this has been a month between posts but
i will be posting twice a week and that
is either going to be on this channel or
my vlog channel that is my new schedule
and i hope you guys are excited because
i am so today i'm going to be doing a
haul and this is like my big summer hall
as of right now because I got some stuff
a little bit earlier and then I also
just came back from California like
yesterday and I got some stuff there so
I'm not sure how much time I love to
tell but I didn't really like tell me
that I couldn't say anything so i guess
if this is like saying too much and they
see this a little contact me and i'll
just take this video down but i was in
California because i was working on like
this video series i don't really know
what to call it just some videos with
walmart com I guess I'll like share more
about the experience like once it comes
on I'll be like hey go check out this
thing on walmart.com and then I'll talk
about more because I'm not really sure
how much I'm allowed to say or if I'm
like restricted on say anything so I'll
just talk about that later but for now
I'm going to be doing a summerhall and I
don't have the price tags on some of
these but I do for some of them so I'll
just like share the prices if I have
them so the first place that I'm gonna
show you guys is lilly pulitzer this is
when my mom and sister we're coming back
from Georgia because my sister goes to
college in Georgia so the first thing
that I got is this Lilly Pulitzer romper
and it's just like a really cute design
and it has like a little tie thing so
you can tell like a big bow on the front
it's just like a tasteful romper and
sometimes it's hard to do with rappers
because they are kind of just like a big
baby soon I don't know whenever I think
of Rampersad just think of like going
off to explore and like a big onesie but
not a onesie do you know what I mean
does anyone else get that feeling or
such as me yeah so that thing that I got
is or than icing that they got is this
t-shirt and it just sounds like a bunch
of octopi on it and at first I didn't
really like this it's just really
comfortable and I always get like a
bunch of compliments on it even though
it's just like it's very unique but I
feel like it's not something that I
would pick off the shelf but my sister
got it and I'm
I liked it I probably wanted a lot more
than her so far so that's that to shirt
and then my sister just picked out um
two different Lilly Pulitzer shorts it's
just like cute with little what is this
cold like scalloping on the bottoms out
his golden really new and then these
shorts so these were $68 so those are
really cute all the next stuff I got all
on my california trip one of the things
that was like really interesting and
kind of weird about this trip was that
it was extremely last minute and I found
out that I was going at 12 55 am like
after I had seen a movie that evening so
I've got back from the movie it started
at eight and I got back from the movie
was probably like 10 and I mom was like
okay we're leaving at 1255 a.m. and i
was like what are you talking about I
didn't even pack so I didn't pack jeans
on my trip and I needed like clothes to
wear at this shoot so I have to go get
jeans and these are the jeans that I
found these were from free people and
these really $68 but I am already in
love with these jeans these are so
stinking cute like I'm I feel like I
really found like a good pair of jeans
because it's so hard for me to find
jeans they're high-waisted and I've
never had like legit high-waisted jeans
so these go kind of like up to my belly
button or like right below it and I know
it's just like it's really slimming in a
way because I've gained a few pounds
it's just like kind of uncomfortable to
like have some extra poundage ha's and
extra fat on me but this covers it all
so that's also really nice about these
but I know that if I lose that weight
it'll also still be really really
flattering actually have a picture on
Instagram with these and I wear them
like with every outfit on set and i also
have a picture of me on set so i will
insert these pictures you can follow me
on instagram if you want to like keep
updated with my life ok so the next
thing my god was from urban Urban
Outfitters um I really like that's
probably one of my favorite stores but
the only thing I could really find that
I really liked is this and it's just
like a nice like playing tank top and
then it has this cool like metal
detailing it's basically just like you
know what's on the back your bra straps
that's what's on the front and it kind
of ways it down a little bit but I still
really like the detailing of this shirt
tank top I got to victoria secret bras
and Marla sure
show these they had their like sale and
so this is only thirty dollars and then
I'm wearing the next one so i got the
like really nice expensive one that was
like $55 and it does like you can take
the straps off and make it strapless or
you can like addresses job so it is like
cross back you know like everyone knows
what i'm talking about i think if you go
to victoria secret it's that one like
super versatile bra and yeah i've been
loving these bras we don't have a
Victoria's Secret Anchorage so it was
really nice to just like pick up some
fresh new bras and put them on right
after so yeah I'm not sure if that's too
much information but whatever the next
place I went to was Express I don't
think I've ever shopped and expressed
but one thing that I've noticed is that
either their stuff is really really
cheap or really overpriced this dress
it's really really adorable it has like
lace sleeves and then it's very
form-fitting and very flattering even if
you've gained like 10 pounds like I have
but um this is only 30 or liked it was
in twenty to thirty dollars i thought i
had the tag on it but i think it fell
off and i was just really happy to find
this and i'm really excited to work it's
very very flattering so the last door
that I went to of course was brandy
melville I pretty much went there back
to back and I'm almost positive that
they switched a lot of their things out
and so I got some more stuff um I got
this halter top and it's just really
playing this was fifteen dollars so I'll
talk on it um yeah so that's what it
looks like at a fret and this is what it
looks like on the back and then I got
this tank top I've worn this a few times
since I've got it and I got it dirty
apparently there's like a marking on it
I don't like this color kind of regret
buying this because I mean it is kind of
sheer so you can see like all this
business underneath but it does have
this little strip of like fabric to
cover like your bra stuff like that but
you can definitely tell when this fabric
ends when you're wearing it because it's
like oh that's all covered and then it
gets like more sheer on the bottom kind
of do regret buying it especially since
the next day I went back and I found
this black one but has that fabric but
it's also just like it's black so you
can't see it anyways but I really like
the black one and it's really nice and a
very good basic to have for my closet
and this was $15 so I'm assuming that
the exact same one and blue
was also fifteen dollars and then my
sister wanted like a long t-shirt this
is eighteen dollars is like a peach
color this doesn't look very good on me
I tried it on because I think I'm a
little bit more pale compared to like my
sister but it'll look really good on her
she's like very golden bronze e and then
my mom picked this out for my sister but
I'm definitely gonna wear it I'm just
this plain knit light blue sweater I
thought that was really cute and this
live $35 this sweater is actually made
out of wool I think they're flutters are
like usually made out of cotton so it
feels different from their brand new
sweaters and it's a lot heavier but it's
also really good for like Anchorage
because it's still cold and anchor Gina
summer or it can get really breezy I
just really love the look of their like
casual clothing so I was really happy to
find this and I wore it on the plane and
it was really warm and just really
comfortable and looked really cute
alright so those are all things that I
have to show you for this hull be sure
to leave any of your like questions for
the boy advice video because I'm gonna
be filming that this weekend if you want
to email them to me to like if it's like
too personal or you don't want your name
associated with that question you can
email me them um my like email is down
below in my description box so just
email me them or just leave them in the
comments or leave them on Instagram and
I ask that I'll probably be asking like
soonish so that's all that I have to
share with you guys and I'll talk to you
guys very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
