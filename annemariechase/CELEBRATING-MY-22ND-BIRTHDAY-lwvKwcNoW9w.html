[Laughter]
thank you is January 5th today it's my
22nd birthday I'm at my sister's
apartment in Washington DC my birthday
always falls during winter break I hated
planning my birthdays and so this is
actually kind of like my ideal birthday
is just being with someone that I feel
love and not having to like really make
a big like deal about it in high school
I made Kelly throw me or I didn't make
her she offered she was like I'll plan
your surprise birthday party and so we
actually planned it but she dealt with
everything because I was like I don't
want people to get mad at me for not
inviting them I don't want to have to
plan anything I deal yeah today going to
the founding farmers yeah I really
haven't explored much at all because
it's been really cold out and so I
pretty much just been in here here's
what I'm wearing I don't know if I it's
okay I never wear yellow so I wanted to
wear it and I kind of liked it so we got
the shirt it's from brandy melville but
it's actually from norstrom which is
really nice because brandy melville has
a kind of a bad return policy but norm
has a great one so then these are my top
shop jeans and then weird story with
both of these my Topshop jeans my black
ones that I wanted to wear today cuz I
thought it would make this outfit look
good we cannot find them anywhere I
think it was my only casualty from
traveling to so many different states
over the break up into Alaska Hawaii New
York we're vlogging life but not live
from New York is the Tribeca area and
now DC and I knew I've just been like
I'm gonna lose something and I think it
was my literal favorite pair of pants I
just like the black ones cuz they fit so
well and they go with everything but I'm
okay okay but also these boots we got in
New York because Alaska Airlines Lost
Callie's bag they didn't lose it they
were just delayed I got there two days
later when they lose your bag they
reimburse you and since it was like
literally storming there we got to pick
out like a whole outfit but we also got
an air mattress
so yeah that's like the update of the
last like week and a half
pretty busy we can have not really I
guess yeah really done anything also
super fun I think we're gonna try to go
to core power my favorite exercise if we
do we're gonna die because first of all
you didn't get that much sleep I've
gotten a lot of sleep every day but
we're gonna eat and it's probably gonna
be like not that healthy food and if you
guys have gone to yoga sculpt do you
know that you can die real fast oh you
should bring your look you should put
your electrolytes in the bottles okay
tonight I think we're going to some of
Kelly's friends pre games and then going
out I don't know her friends are all
super nice I would send for that it's
like fun meeting new people I've met so
many new people on this trip I literally
just found my jeans as we're leaving to
go it's a birthday miracle I haven't
lost anything that I know of so far
scallop risotto probably what you get
maybe pot roast
we are currently in cuz it's cool it's
literally freezing already tried to vlog
outside but I was so cold
hi we stopped in Starbucks to take a
walking break and then we are in
Nordstrom Rack right now before we got a
core power the food there was super
heavy it was the kind of food that kind
of made me like a little bit didn't
finish a lot of it but I think it's cuz
I don't like scallops and I just told
myself that I do but I'm really scared
I'm gonna it's just gonna come out
during yoga so wish me luck it'll be her
first I lose I did bracing myself for
the cold say so cute down for
[Laughter]
how was it
you liked it did you actually we just
got back to Kelly's apartment and we're
going to go out with some of her friends
one of her friends is like throwing a
house party or whatever it's like her
word friend so it's probably probably
better than a house party
are we yeah those are not bad
maybe yeah well obvious we're all black
but basically I'm leaving tomorrow
morning my flight leaves at 9:00 so we
have like an hour and a half to shower
get ready eat a little bit of dinner cuz
I that lunch like how much was that
where'd you get it
it was Nordstrom Rack like it was
actually $400 during yoga sculpt I drink
too much water and I indeed did kind of
a little bit it was really disgusting I
have to like swallow it all down so
we're just gonna get ready and cook
dinner real fast
I told Callie that she should blog cuz
you guys really like her and so she
might while she's cooking or well it's
my birthday so she has to so she'll show
you like what she's cooking and stuff
and I'm gonna take a shower
and then try to get ready to impact so
we can leave on time okay I don't know
how this camera works so I can show you
some pictures I took my cellphone
accident I'm Callie for those of you who
don't know and savouries birthday today
so she's here in DC we're going out I'm
making her dinner so actually just
turned that camera off on accident God
am i her so ugly hold on right now
hi guys i am callie and i look like
cuz i just got back from core power with
her that she like dragged me to but it
was really fun she
asked me to vlog what I'm making her for
dinner I just started doing keto and I
absolutely am a fan of it so if any of
you guys do keto let me that every know
how you like it I really really want her
to try it out for like at least four
weeks because she has like a lot of
problems with like sleeping and just
having a lack of energy and it tackles
that really really well and I like
regulates your hormones and if you want
to learn more about keto make a comment
below and if you want amber to try it
out also make a comment below because
I'm trying to get her to do it I think
she's like curious about it but she's
not like fully convinced anyways I'm
making her salmon and mashed cauliflower
because she loves mashed potatoes salmon
has olive oil salt and I mean pepper and
salt on just like slapped around
it's getting really smoky in here I
don't know what to do but I left the
door open microwave this for about six
minutes then stir it up and then
microwave it again for another six
minutes now I'm gonna put some goat
cheese and then use this immersion
blender to blend it all up into mashed
potatoes oh and like garlic it salt
pepper and stuff I would tried to pack
as much as possible I think I'm good but
like it went Cammie made us she actually
cooked this is like cauliflower mashed
cauliflower this kind of stuff I only
get at Trader Joe's it looks so good
tastes better than the one from Cheerios
yeah I'm not so crazy she's like a real
mom lady her I could think I could but
like I don't really
Oh blueberry crumble you know you tell
them out kitto would you ask love
whatever you're gonna do a big about
kitto yeah oh I could do like an
experimental video like yeah I'm calm
cool we're supposed to have left by now
but I wanna show you guys my outfit her
work friends party that we're going to
is New Year's Eve themed or New Year's
like themed but I don't really want to
wear what I wore to New Year's because
we're going out afterwards I have this
top but it's freezing outside so I kind
of don't want to wear this because I
don't think I'll ever take my jacket off
and then I have my black jeans from
Topshop these are literally the best
jeans I have purchased in the last like
two years and if it's so well
they're super flattering they're just
mm-hmm and then I have suede boots that
were really not not a good idea to wear
out and then I'll wear my red that's
like hello mom
[Laughter]
you have to explain it like so close my
face this is my drinking game basically
this game I've never played it have you
played before I never you take a piece
of cardboard and then you would toss a
coin and then wherever you land you
write a rule so some of these year old
