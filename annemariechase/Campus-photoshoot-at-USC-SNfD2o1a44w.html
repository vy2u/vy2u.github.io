and guess what I'm wearing I am wearing
what do't gifted me yesterday for
vlogmas or dopeman i don't know if they
have an official name for it
but i'm getting ready to go to core
power yoga sculpt and i love this
instructor he's definitely my favorite
like i'm literally always sore for like
a week after i go to his class but I'm
honestly a little bit scared because up
until last week I literally could not
finish the whole class so I kind of like
this happens it's like designed to like
make you exhausted pretty much so yeah
usually I have to stop like sometime
towards the end and just kind of like
stand there and die a little bit and
then continue but last time I didn't
have to do that I went all the way and I
felt so good and strong but for some
reason I couldn't sleep until like 4:00
a.m. so I'm a little scared that I have
had very little sleep and I did not eat
that much yesterday like at all like I
am usually a hungry girl like I never
have the excuse of like oh I'm too busy
to eat but like yesterday I don't know I
don't actually was not hungry so I did
not eat that much so I ate a protein bar
in hopes of like getting some calories
and like something that my body can
actually burn instead of just me
toppling over so I'm gonna see how this
goes I'm excited to go exercise because
I always feel really good afterwards but
again a little scared to be honest this
is the shirt that I got from don't blog
miss I'm obviously not gonna wear these
pants but it's very very form-fitting
and I'm just very excited they like
really are picking good gifts that I
want so yeah I was predicted I very much
did die there were a ton of people in
the class because it's dead week so like
no one has class and so there is a lot
more people than usual all right least
heard like four people say after the
class like I almost passed out we were
like that was really rough but it's
honestly just impressive because like
everyone feels that way afterwards but
you can't really tell during the class
because everyone's just like persisting
and like dang in the exercise but the
guys just like literally my ideal yoga
instructor
so motivating and then help you like you
may be tired right now but this is where
you build muscle and it's so motivating
cuz it's like that's exactly how I'm
feeling right now
I study like I did a lot yesterday like
I did a lot of work and I did do a
really good job balancing I'll show you
guys how my schedules ended up so I kind
of stopped after 1:45 but I kept working
after I realized I wasn't able to sleep
but as you can see I had like two hours
in my Excel class I cleaned my room I
worked on oh I have an assignment due at
12:00 actually I did my vlog miss and I
just need to make a thumbnail upload it
and then I actually worked on my essay
quite a bit I think this method the
Pomodoro method is really good if you
need to like bounce or timing between a
lot of stuff I should stop blogging
because I look disgusting right now I
just turned in my assignments all three
of them luckily I like did some of it
yesterday I had to like put it all in a
consolidate in place basically because
I've already done all the work and it is
now 11:58 I just turned all three of
those in so really good timing I'm sad
because I don't have a calendar last
month I really was not on my workout
game to be fair I think this was like
Thanksgiving so I don't know I just have
not but today was a really good workout
and I'm just glad I did it and I need to
print a December calendar even though
I'm gonna leave but I still just really
like having these up it just is a really
good way to document or just to make
sure that you're doing things that you
want to be doing and like keeping your
habits I told my sister about this it's
called the Seinfeld method and she was
just like so excited because she came up
with like different uses for it whether
it I forgot what exactly what she said
but she had a very very particular habit
in mind I think she wanted to like do
something like I don't know like if you
want to take your vitamins every day and
you want to mark it off or like make
sure you drink enough water hers is very
specific I think it was like she wanted
to keep track of how many times she was
drinking a month because she just
started her full-time job and they
always have happy hours so she wanted to
like keep that in check and just see how
often she was drinking because sometimes
you just like don't realize it yeah
that's pretty much I'm gonna jump in the
shower so I stopped blogging I know
everyone me
that tosser on campus because we both
have to take pictures also look at our
outfits like guys people fully walking
by me while I was booty poppin full year
that was impressive honestly she was
like she was like getting the angle for
people we like also this I don't think
this is that aggressive and people would
get me so yeah honestly people they're
either checking you out or just looking
hey I was watching that guy watch us
well I watched him proud of us yeah we
got our pictures in like two seconds you
know and actually I might have you take
one more this might fall real dangerous
please fall in here
what is a look at it all the loggers for
all these vlog cameras hit zero yeah you
can say hi to mine as well
December is just a weird time for you to
this man are you hi Tasha
so we're taking pictures for Tasha again
we just ran into Justin Escalona when
people ask you if you're friends what do
you say I don't really know him
I just had a new breed salad delivered
and my uber driver texted me ahoy
this is master Harrison your ubereats
delivery Jedi hitting Lightspeed now
from simply salads with your notches so
you better be hungry ETA 17 minutes and
so I set that to like a few people cuz I
thought it was pretty funny and I just
replied yeah thank you with like the you
know hand emoji and then I was like kind
of actually nervous I was like what is
this guy gonna be like in person for
picking up my food and I met him and he
said looks so good I got one for myself
too and I like really tried hard to
think if that was really funny
because I think he was trying to say a
joke and all I could think to say was oh
really like in a very genuinely curious
way and he was like yep
and now I'm just debating over whether
that was a joke and that was meant to be
funny or if he just got the same salad
because he thought mine looks so good
this is what it looks like I mean it
looks okay I don't know maybe I'm really
overestimating his ability to actually
be funny and I just thought he was
actually funny and he's not really funny
let me know your thoughts like what's
going on here I'm gonna eat this now I'm
so hungry
and I can type an entire chapter out
it's really cool and people don't even
notice necessarily the mortgage they go
a crack it's different then I will pair
it to this keyboard
I'm a theatre God
my friends
hey guys okay so before Tasha left she
asked me if I had opened my dote day for
gift her blog miss and I was like no I
actually kind of forgot about it
even though I wasn't raving over my
shirt all day
I think it's cuz I felt like I opened it
today she was like okay like wait for me
to get back and then I was like well now
that you've provided me I really want to
open it oh that's so embarrassing
dr. research is I'm sorry at least I
caught it haha sometimes I'm just like
watching youtube videos and like they
have like something on their face and
I'm just like poor girl I know that she
was editing this and noticed that but
kept it in anyways good for her but yeah
I was like well now that you told me I
am really gonna want to open it and she
said she'd get back in 30 minutes and
she's taking a long time so I'm gonna
open it sorry Tasha
but I also hurt what I got bring the
real comfy clothes now I actually have
these really nice Lululemon pants on I'm
really debating so I'm very
sleep-deprived or at least I'm very
tired and I'm debating whether did you
just go to sleep really early so I'd be
like at 6:04 hahaha no I just got the
most annoying request ever and it's like
completely okay anyways that gives me a
like flashbacks to my crash and me
honking at this guy who crashed into me
but anyways the insurance person did not
answer after I called her back Oh
anxiety okay so um oh I'm debating
whether it's okay so it's 6:05 and I'm
really tired and I just know that I
won't be as productive so I'm debating
whether to just go to sleep like now
like take a few melatonin so I'm
actually go to sleep but I think I'm
also gonna go to sleep cause I'm very
tired and then wake up super early
tomorrow or if I should study a little
bit tonight maybe not be as productive
but at least like get something like
some studying done today and then
tomorrow I really have no idea Tasha
catcha I was literally vlogging and I
told my vlog that you're taking too long
so I wasn't gonna wait for you you open
it no I was literally in the middle of
talking I was telling a long story I
guess
okay I'm thinking it's gonna be like
some sort of makeup product we're like
some like a little break here yeah I'm
getting like a eyeliner or a good
eyebrow but what is this little bulb
it's like really small this makes you
more nervous like that you're here even
though it's not you didn't give it to me
yeah I hate some people open five nice I
gave diamonds I know I was wrong it's
like a politically or mindset thing
sounds like a yeah I feel like Cleopatra
let's see what cute note I got today
Oh xoxo hey guys it's me again you may
have noticed that there was no intro
today and now this outro has no music
and it's because YouTube keeps
copyrighting me and I'm running out of
time I hope you guys like this video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
