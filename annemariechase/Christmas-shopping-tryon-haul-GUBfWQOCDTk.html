like for three I spent some time editing
my vlog it was snowing earlier which I
was very excited about and I suppose he
keeps knowing but it stops snowing but
here's the evidence
I was so excited it looked so pretty too
but then it just stopped
hey guys okay so I'm editing this vlog
that you're currently watching right now
and I realized that it's like an odd
transition because I was gonna put this
little try on haul from what I got
shopping yesterday and yesterday's vlog
but it ended up just being way too long
so I decided to just switch it over to
today's vlog so that's why there's no
transition so okay I hope you guys enjoy
I thought I'd show you guys like kind of
what I got because I feel like I had
some really great finds and a lot of the
things that we found from Nordstrom
we're actually on sale so if you guys
are looking for things for yourself I
was kind of doing some Christmas
shopping for myself or a few guys like
are looking for gifts to give these are
actually really good finds and I've been
looking for outerwear and like jackets
and also jeans and Topshop has really
good stuff on sale right now so I
thought I would show you guys just in
case you guys are like looking but also
just because they're pretty good deals
so um yeah I think is like the first
haul I'm doing and probably like ever so
okay so the first thing that I got I'm
sitting on my coffee table right now
hopefully that's okay this first thing
is a jacket and my not my sister my
roommate Sydney actually had a really
similar jacket and I saw it during
finals and I was like oh that's a really
cute jacket and this was $60 originally
125 so I thought this is a great deal is
this
Topshop jacket and it's like really cozy
inside it's not lined all the way so
doesn't make it super warm looks like so
just like super super cozy
and I don't know I just really like it
it's like a bigger pit and I tried
finding this on North's room - link
below if you guys aren't interested
because I feel like this is like one of
my favorites but I'm not exactly sure if
it's the exact same I think it might be
but that one looks a little smaller like
on the actual torso but I tried looking
up the exact name at least on my receipt
and I couldn't find it so hopefully it's
the same one I'm not positive but I
don't know so that's what this one looks
like I think it's really kind of like
lumberjack II but like also cute um
so I'm really excited about this and
this has been really nice for like
anchorage but not really cuz it's just
too cold here so this next one is
something that i could definitely wear
out this one's a faux leather jacket is
what it looks like I didn't really know
how I felt about leather jackets or like
faux leather jackets because my sister
was like always really into them but I
feel like they're just so easy and like
versatile that you could wear them with
anything pretty much so this would be
really nice to go out with versus like
that jacket
I could actually wear this if I'm going
out and have like a warmer weather top
out I could also wear it with this and
like actually stay warm for LA and this
one I found the exact one on top shop
and this one is also $60 so really
really not bad let me see how much this
was originally originally $95 like it's
really cute pen and the last one's from
Topshop we're just I needed jeans and I
really needed black jeans and just like
normal colored jeans that I wear I can
wear like every day and I had always
heard that Topshop jeans were really
really comfortable and just a really
nice fitting so I tried some jeans on
when I went shopping and I absolutely
loved them so I'm wearing some today and
I've been wearing
a lot since I've been home because
they're just like super simple plain
black jeans and then I also have like
very similar ones but I think the other
wants are on sale so these ones were not
maybe I'll put you guys down lower this
is what these jeans look like they're
just look super comfortable and really
form-fitting this is probably the worst
day to show you guys we just started my
feminine issues but it's always nice cuz
like usually before I start I'm like oh
like I'm so fat I've been exercising and
then I'm like oh okay that's like these
are also high-waisted which is nice you
guys can see and I know they're super
comfortable they don't feel like jeans
at all so let me go check with these
ones they're called these ones I'm like
hunched these ones are called black
Jamie jeans and then the next one I got
on sale they pretty much fit the same
now and they just look like plain denim
jeans these ones are called the Sydney
jeans and these ones were $45 discounted
from like I think semi set so I was like
shopping around and these were also on
sale but I was shopping in the shoe ship
shoe section with my mom if I'm not sure
about something because these ones I'm
the ankles are really skinny but I think
I still like it but if I'm not sure
about something I usually just like
FaceTime or text my sister and she
didn't answer who knows like well fine
so I got them anyways and then she
called me when I got home and she was
like did you call and I was like well I
was just asking about these boots but I
already got them said never mind
and then she checked her text messages
and she was like darn it I was in the
shower guy wants them for myself so I
think right after this I'm gonna go try
to get some for her but actually they
have like this new thing I think Norma's
like a very innovative company where I
think you can buy it online so I can
like get it immediately and then pick it
up in stores so that's a really nice
because I hope that they're still
available so I'll show you guys what
they look like and these ones were $60
okay so they're just like these really
Oh No oh they come off they're just like
these really really simple plain black
booties but I've really been meaning
needing to get like just playing some
black booty I'll show you guys what they
look like and then I should get on
buying my okay ready I was unsure about
how skinny the ankle is but I think
they're kind of still like it I'm really
like I have no idea if you guys can see
these are not don't give you guys in it
anaesthetic little background yeah
should probably pick that up how did
that go my foot yeah see we're basic
that's cool yeah so hopefully you guys
could see that but that's pretty much
what I got at Nordstrom I'm super happy
about all of these purchases cuz they've
literally been things that I've been
meaning to get for so long but just
happened and I pretty much found it all
in one like shopping trip which is very
rare for me so it was super excited I
will link everything below that I got if
you guys want to look at them or get the
same ones cuz I think they're really
good deals like these boots were only
$60 which is like a pretty good deal for
Steve Madden boots rate so yeah I hope
you guys enjoyed this little try on haul
I don't do them very often so if you
guys did definitely like this video or
let me know in some other way in the
comments or something so I know how to
do more of them whenever I go shopping
but I forgot to show you guys the
sunglasses that I also got I got some
Ray Ban sunglasses sunglasses are hands
down the hardest thing for me to shop
for because I think my face shape is
just so weird that sunglasses look
horrible on my face I had my other ones
but I returned them
because I didn't think that they were
everyday sunglasses and I really need
those these are still kind of like a
little bit out there but I thought they
looked pretty good let me know what you
guys think
or which once you guys like more these
ones are the ones I decided to go with
which ones do you like better I think I
like these ones better still I think I
made the right choice but let me know
what should do you guys like more I
think I like these move them especially
with the Christmas like light in the
background okay bye
I'll try to link these in the
description as well if I can find them
I'm not really sure if I will be able to
but I will try to open my don't walk
miss gift this is the fuzzy sweater that
I'm wearing today it's real real fuzzy I
don't like the shirt I'm wearing at her
head so I'm not showing you guys this is
don't blog mistake 20
history in the background my stomach's
really bloated I'm having a really hard
time sitting like this it's a very
obvious
Wow
this looks so weird
I'm so excited to use this I honestly
have no idea what what it is I think I'm
pretty sure I put it in my favorites
list just because I was like what is
that
filming wrapping rubber masks improves
skin elasticity to reduce the look of
Aging
this just looks so great Wow I feel like
I need to do this right now but I'm
going somewhere um is this a Korean
product I can't tell dr. jart made in
Korea yeah I know what I'm doing tonight
okay cool this is lowered air tonight oh
gosh it's cold it's like in the car
can't really see it
you can't
we're going to this little city market
it's called Mesa Gaia's to get some
ingredients for dinner and I'm also
gonna get a copy because they have
Kalani's coffee which is like the
Starbucks of Anchorage yeah better
yay what you're getting
this is where I had lunch sometimes in
high school
not a lot though I didn't go out what
you gonna do this a lot of people the
breadsticks that's why so snowy probably
not the best for my camera go up stairs
have to get cheese oh okay so I went all
the way downstairs I got shoes and now
I'm standing outside right now I'm under
this little roof thing because I'm
trying to get my camera wet but it's
finally snowing and I'm so excited I
absolutely love when it snows it hasn't
been snowing for the past like three
years a lot but part of the reason why I
love snow so much is because it's very
reminiscent to when I was in high school
doing my homework and I would always
have like late nights cuz I've just
always been like a late night early
morning person and I would just be doing
my homework and watching the snow
outside and it was just so relaxing and
so cozy here's what it looks like it's
really dark out actually it's about the
time when the Sun sets but I thought I
would show you guys anyways cuz I just
love snow okay well you guys cannot oh
you could you can kind of see that it
snowing yet
look at that try not to get you guys wet
my happy place it's so pretty outside I
love being on this roof usually in the
summertime because it's just a really
nice and relaxing Anchorage is very
different from LA in that well clearly
but there's just something about
Anchorage that is just so relaxing and
it's so pretty I'm actually kind of
freezing now but
it's actually darker than my camera
makes it out to be because this exposure
that's actually doing really well but
it's just so pretty I hope you guys like
snow as much as I do because this will
be a very boring vlog if not I'm gonna
go in now what I might return okay so
I'm literally just showered I'm going to
try this mask on now because I feel like
I found it too and now I probably never
will and this is actually not my safe on
my favorites I just checked I think I
just recognized it from like either
style come on
or like CIFOR or something I just
there's a very distinctive face that you
do not forget once you see it I kind of
feel like it's not going to look like
this so I'm gonna try it out now so step
one is the ampoule pack intensive
firming and pull pack I don't know if
I'm saying that right
probably not but this is just like this
is what it looks like very soft
get all the poop all over there
I like this scent of the step1 stuff
Korean beauty products all kind of smell
like this it's really really really
light and very refreshing and it just
smells so good Wow
I just got a text message with a
snapshot of my video there's like a
caption on it and you know that's never
done like a screenshot of a snapchat oh
the smell
okay I'm gonna go to these are all steps
and now I wait for 10 to 20 minutes to
40 minutes leave on for 15-20 minutes
been removed gently and massaged
remaining may be left on to 40 minutes
for maximum hydration so here's a little
comparison
this is like really good advertising for
this because you think you're gonna get
this and its really cool but it's miss
but so cool oh I just bought a Kindle
yeah don't make me laugh you should have
done this mask with your big old face
you should have done this mask with your
big face anti-aging
and this reminds me of like a skin that
I could peel off okay it's trying to
take this thing off it's actually making
me pretty cold now is he cold to you oh
yeah it is yeah I think it has some sort
of a spearmint peppermint maybe
I'm sure either you had a skin flap
is a way prettier yeah with me
anti-aging do you look younger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
