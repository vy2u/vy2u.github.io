officially moving because today is the
day that I moved in I just got off of
work though so it's literally seven
o'clock and let me just update you on
all the things that we are having to do
it's our eighth month the bursary so
I've been dating for eight months
as of today which is not the highlight
of this video just kidding you Jakub
literally helped me move out of my
apartment and he's gonna help me move
into my apartment
no no so first of all I just want to say
that all of the society6 stuff that
you'll be seeing in this video if any I
don't really know I'm going to be
showing in this video I'll link it all
below just in case you want to buy the
same one and I have a 10% discount code
with the code Amory chase so that's just
like for convenience because I'm going
to be doing a video with their stuff
later on so I don't really know what I'm
including but for things like this like
if you want the same thing I'll link it
and then we're going to start moving
everything in so
will be a very interesting blog first
time I start moving stuff to the house
oh my gosh you already started I told
you that what a sweetheart
dude got a guy ok we just walked inside
of the door here is what it looks like a
good education actually yeah but there's
no table so this is like also our table
which is not that big you know I mean
our table is really crappy oh you see
yeah we do day she is important yeah
it's right here I think oh my god this
is so small okay
honestly I don't even think it's bigger
than my old apartment oh really
yeah oh yeah this is much nicer than you
know this is T if this is broken why do
I want it it's like also like this is so
easy to take off whatever this booger is
this is so easy to clean I just I mean
like we're literally paying for this
house like why can't they clean it all
the way you know they look so good nice
to look
all of the endgame
oh nice sounds good by one cool so means
I will share this what's dresser yeah
for sure
this is going to be where we live and
there Michelle said she brought all of
her kitchen stuff so that's good
a nice big thing you get the deep sink
for your laundry yeah I don't know if I
want to show their rooms I guess it's
like empty this is oh they're all so
small Oh her bathrooms nice I like that
got some blue just a similar sized
closet open then the last two rooms this
is going to be well that's nice little
space use of space this is a shared
bathroom between them that's gonna be
her room Michelle's so Shirdi moved in
so I don't want to show it and then this
oh my gosh
Jago come look at this room I don't know
how I'm gonna do this your step here I'm
gonna start piling everything it
literally this is not even all of our
stuff my stuff just take a few things
that are outside of this room that I put
up I think it looks like a lot of stuff
when it's clustered like that when you
start organizing it I know but I still
need a fit like a bed in there that's
crazy
now I'm just gonna try to move in like a
little bit put some stuff away so let's
hop all in the way but yeah this some
this house has like zero storage outside
of these tiny closets so if we have any
extra things they go in the corner right
here
we're computing
we had traumatic experiences
of it you kind of really not on purpose
and if with man's are
Valka
you
day three or like really two of moving
in I just got off of work so it's like
6:30 right now basically I spent all my
break time at work
texting Zoey so we really don't have any
storage space so I was trying to
brainstorm ideas with her to create more
space and I was like I think we really
need like not lofted bed I don't know
what they're called just like beds that
are raised so that we could either store
stuff like in the drawers under the beds
or just like stuff stuff under the beds
is right now we just have no space for
storage even for like suitcases hello we
decided on like matching bed frames from
Walmart they're like $80 for a twin and
it's elevated like 11 inches off the
ground so we could stuff stuff
underneath and then yesterday I was
trying to get a mattress but he's
selling it with the frame and a mattress
and he doesn't want to sell them
separately or else it's just harder to
sell the frame so I reached out to
another girl who I thought was just
selling a mattress cuz she's selling it
for 45 and I was like okay that's like a
decent price but she's actually selling
it with a frames like I don't know if I
could just leave it there or if they're
gonna want me to take it you know cuz
yeah well I asked her cuz I realized I
was like oh wait can you send me like a
picture of it and then she got like
really annoyed she's like really you're
asking this now and she's like a lot of
people have asked me for this mattress
and I've been saying no and I'll do yeah
I just wanted a picture of it so I'm
gonna buy anyway it's only 45 dollars
it's not that much for a mattress yeah
you have a topper just yeah and I was
like I was talking to Catherine on our
way back and I was like is a year Oh
like an old mattress and then she's like
whoa I've been sleeping on my mattress
at home for 18 years and I was like oh
that's so true do you want to get to
breathe tonight sure I've literally okay
so I called this I think it was my main
channel on my last main channel blog I
was like everyone to get new breed's
because they're $20 right now so you can
order $20 with the food and then I was
like they're gonna lower it back down to
$10 and they did I'm so smart but it was
the hugest disappointment in my life
like I was so sad my office is just so
much more than $10 and now you can't get
like a whole free meal you can only get
like a boba you know but right now I
have some $20 codes how to use those
but it's been like a lifesaver cuz I
don't have anywhere to like cook right
now and I would usually bring food to
work silliman Beverly or I work in
Beverly Hills and it's really expensive
this is why my blogs just go on forever
cuz I just talk so much I'm gonna stop
now but basically basically we're gonna
get uber eats and it's gonna be real
good okay bye guys
okay so we have his car pretty much
packed up with my stuff we're gonna add
this and then we have my car packets up
and now we're gonna head over when I was
leaving for work me and Kathryn carpool
today stinky Zoey hello hi what's up
yeah I am but I'm just gonna buy the
mattress and like just throw it with the
frame away or I don't know cuz I just
kind of felt bad here's the room in the
light if it makes a difference
I honestly remembered it a lot smaller
just so so amazed at how small it was
so maybe this is an improvement I just
talked to the girl that I'm buying my
mattress from and I told her like I
don't really need the frame and she
replied with you don't have to pay full
price
I'll sell it to you for 30 some yeah
okay we're gonna we're gonna help Jacob
move down right
but if you just like hit your head or
something you know you got on camera
okay so it was kind of a fine story when
we got here we went to seven one which
is across the street from the actual
place let's just show you this little
area that they have this is what we
pulled up to just like a bunch of
furniture kind of thrown around but then
I called the girl cuz no one was coming
out and I was like hey we're here and
she was like oh I'm actually across the
street from you so that's funny but
here's the mattress it wasn't too bad
like it wasn't like this or not yeah
yeah and I'm gonna put like a mattress
cover protector and then my mattress
topper so it should be good we move the
bed and we put it like just laying it
there for now because we're trying to
see how two beds are gonna look in here
um so we're gonna basically do like an L
shape because I saw this little photo on
tumblr and I was like this is pretty
much probably the only thing that's
gonna work for this bit cuz it's pretty
small so we're gonna have a bed here and
it's gonna be like slightly elevated
like a foot off the ground and then over
here okay so there's not a whole lot of
storage space in here other than this
thing so I brought this cube see this is
so loud like can you guys hear how loud
that is you think that'll be annoying
let me know so this is a cube that one
of my roommates left for Jacob and he's
not using it but she actually put the
top on wrong so okay so honestly I'm
just very overwhelmed with choosing what
to move or unpack it's just like it's a
lot so I think I'm going to open my
society6 package because I have like all
of my stuff but I haven't opened it I
wanted to move first but I'm just gonna
open this one this is a little bit
heavier so I'm excited to see which one
it is
have a very sharp knife these are my
middle price that I got is a lot of tape
these are apparently new on society6
this video
not sponsor I just wanna show you guys
actually I'm gonna show you the other
one I actually had no idea what to
expect with a metal print I don't think
I've ever seen a metal print before like
in any I don't know I feel like I've
never seen one let me tell you guys you
have no worries of these breaking cuz
they're really well packaged wow this is
so cool this is so interesting looking
gosh that is so cool I actually got this
color because last year anyone knows
that blogger I'm talking about on my
blog channel let me know because that
means that you've been watching for at
least a year so um actually it's
probably like six months but I toured
this place and the girl who previously
lived here in me and Zoey's room
actually like she wouldn't let us see
her room she was really really mad that
we were trying to buy it and that we
were looking at it she's just super
angry she's like this is really rude of
like you to let people into my house and
she's talking to the leasing manager who
I think is like really rude because she
just tries to trick everyone into buying
stuff from that vlog I took tiny little
snippets of this kitchen I saw that we
had a fake closed fireplace and so
that's why I got green I was thinking
that this would look kind of good so I'm
going with like a rose gold and gold
kind of thing but this might be like I
don't know how this will look with the
other Gold's is a very distinct gold
I'll just I'll open them to find out I
guess
oh it's really cool I'm really excited
about these mouth prints that's not like
cool hopefully they all look good
together but I'm gonna I'm just like not
really focusing on one thing I'm gonna
I'm gonna stop with this cuz I'm
starting to sweat and move on to
something else
update I also just don't know where to
start um I started facetiming Zoe if you
guys didn't know I'm gonna be living
with Zoe again who was my freshman year
roommate and actually my sophomore your
sophomore year roommate but then she
ditched me and went to study abroad and
I didn't
so that's kind of laying but um we
signed a lease together so she is going
to be my roommate again the real reason
to bring a vacuum to school this is
Zoey's duvet
so I've been moving for like a little
bit taking breaks and like facetiming
Zoey to see like what she thinks about
things I wanted to walk you guys through
all the free stuff that I got either
from people mostly just people leaving
their stuff because I started this in my
last vlog or on my blog of moving out
but this entire lamp a free this desk
this storage unit is so nice and that
was free - this lamp honestly a ton of
stuff probably the majority I would say
might have I probably got maybe from my
old apartment while this lighting switch
which is just crazy to me it was crazy
got a lot of comments on that blog you
guys want to check it out feel free to
watch it it's an interesting blog
the morale the story is that a student
housing just tries to screw over college
students because they're like oh these
people don't know how to take care of
themselves are not really adults yet so
why not
