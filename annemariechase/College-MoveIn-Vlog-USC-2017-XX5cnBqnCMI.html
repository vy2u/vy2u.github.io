Marie and if you guys are new here this
is the first video that you've ever seen
from me and then you guys should
definitely subscribe and turn at the
notification button on this will be my
very last year at USC the University of
Southern California I'll be a senior and
I decided to do my last and final
college movement vlog so if you guys
know from my vlog channel you will
probably know that I am NOT really in
fact moving anywhere so I'm not really
sure if I can call us a movin vlog all
of my housemates every single person
even for my roommate well I don't have a
roommate anymore but they're all moving
out and a whole new group of people are
moving in because I used to share this
room with my roommate I never really
spent a lot of time here it was really
only primarily a place for me to like
sleep and get ready but now that it's
kind of just my own space I have enough
room to get a desk new furniture so I
hope that you guys like this video and I
don't know I'm just so excited to move
in and like get my space all ready for
the school year I'm excited to be able
to do homework at my desk and just like
hang out in here
it's gonna be great so join me on this
movement vlog if you guys want to and
let's just get started
so I'm just gonna kind of take you guys
through like what my room looks like now
kind of do like a little before maybe if
I have a good after this is my bed area
I bought this bed from my old housemate
I'm kind of getting sick of this duvet
cover just because it is like more
decorative it's just like a little too
busy but I'm still not sure if I'm I
like make that investment this is
actually Jacobs he's been staying here
this summer he's gonna move that out so
I need something to put there this area
it's kind of a big jumbled mess this
desk is not mine so I'm going to get a
new desk I like to do work at home and
this is just not enough like table space
for me I would like this desk otherwise
but I just really need more room to like
be able to spread out and then I really
like putting sticky notes up on the wall
it's just like a nice visual so I think
I need to get stuff to like be able to
do that maybe in a more like organized
way the next wall is just this wall that
you guys see behind my videos this was a
very cheap dresser that I think we got
for like $30 I think I'm just gonna keep
that honestly it works I am thinking of
making this space a little bit cuter for
the background of my videos just because
this is pretty
much always my background it could look
cuter if I can change it up in a cute
way then I'm definitely willing to and
the last thing is just this little
broken mirror
so yesterday Jacob and I went to Ikea
and I bought a standing desk which I'm
super excited about I also bought like a
bedside table and then I bought a mirror
which you can see right there but I
think I'm gonna try to put the standing
desk together because I feel like
that'll be like the focus of my room and
once I have that done and in place then
I can like do everything else so we are
going to attempt to build the standing
desk now let's do it thing that's all
I'm gonna do for now so Jacob just got
off of work and he's gonna help me build
the rest of the desk we're just gonna
move some stuff out and then we're gonna
move my old desk
out now
here's my standard - that's awesome I
like it yeah I think is a worthwhile
investment yeah I'm like pretty excited
about it
nice yeah hey guys okay so I feel like I
haven't updated you guys in a long time
and it's because everyone else has been
moving in and since I'm already moved in
I kind of like had them have priority
like with the outside building stuff so
I actually haven't really done much in a
few days so I thought it would be good
to kind of update you guys and then kind
of start on the process again my room I
feel like it's coming together very
nicely I do have some things that I just
want to do to make this space like
really feel like my own having a single
is already so life-changing so I think
my first next steps in this process is
to build my side table
yeah I finished say hi Ruby
this is probably immensely like way more
entertaining that what I've been putting
in is like literally only just be
building furniture so far I actually
bought my mattress and my frame from one
of my housemates I had sat on the
mattress but I never slept on it and I
realized that like the mattress actually
was not comfortable like it was really
just not a mattress
I enjoyed sleeping on but then about a
week ago from today
one of my friends reached out to me and
he was like hey are you still making
videos I know the CEO of a mattress
topper company and I just wanted to be a
hundred percent like completely honest
with you guys but like I've been offered
a entire mattress before like a whole
free mattress if I put it in a video but
the thing is like I only talk about
product that I've been able to try and
genuinely love and with the mattress
it's really different if you don't like
it you kind of feel obligated to you
know like put it in your video anyways
cuz it's like a fricking mattress like
it's huge so when my friend reached out
to me and he was like would you be
interested in a mattress topper I was
like wait my mattress actually suck so I
could be interested but then I was like
I only review products positively on my
channel if I am able to try it and loved
it so I was able to try it and I can
genuinely say that this has made my bed
ten million times better like so so much
better this one is from sleepyhead and
they actually gave my viewers a 25%
discount if you use the code amory chase
some cool things about sleepyhead as a
company is that for every 10 mattress
toppers that someone buys they donate
one to a homeless shelter they have free
shipping and if you don't like it you
can return it within 50
it's for a full refund this is genuinely
a great match to topper if you guys like
super soft like pillow like beds you
guys can see like it's pretty thick just
want to share that with you guys you
guys are looking for a mattress topper
but otherwise I think I'm just gonna
finish making my bed it's a pasta move
in time frame but I'm still working on
my room so we're gonna walk to target in
the UV I kind of want to get a big
calendar - yeah and like write the dates
my assignments are due and like just
events that I have so I can like see it
all let's go I also have gift cards from
my co-op we would do the walking Club
and then get gift cards and so I have
like 4 $10 gift cards to target me and
my move-in vlog I know so late it's
actually more cuz I moved into a long
ago hello okay bye e did you want like a
paper 100 I've had these before and I
don't use them if you actually used it
that'd be really nice oh cardboard
really debating this is pretty big too
how do i gate if I need mystic not so me
and Tasha just got back from Target and
I ended up getting this bulletin board
even though it was $22 because I was
like oh I have a lot of gift cards but I
didn't even end up using my gift cards
because I forgot I used to have trouble
doing work at my house but now that I
have like this entire set up it's like
actually a really good place to do work
the reason why I wanted a cork board is
because I have a ton of like sticky
notes like I usually just keep it like
on my desk over here and then it's just
like I never see it again
so that's kind of why I wanted a cork
board just so I can like centralize all
of these little notes to myself a ruler
so you don't have to like yes how to put
it off
I mean it's not like cute but like okay
so here's the final product like we said
earlier it's not that cute but I think
it's really functional
I keep by Trader Joe's receipts I didn't
keep my last one and I forgot what I got
and then I also hate wasting food so I
just cross it off whenever I'm done and
that's actually a really helpful way of
like keeping track of what foods you
have in the fridge but something I'm
really excited about is I'm replacing
these with new ones from society6 and I
just got them in yesterday so I thought
I would vlog it so I'm gonna unbox it
from this big thing these two art pieces
that I've had on my wall have been here
for like the last year I got them from
society6 and I really like them but I
feel like you know they're really random
really a bear my mom spent hours picking
out new prints to put there so I'm gonna
show you them they're here Tasha is also
here this one's like the campus print
it's not metal it's like nice and cozy
that's good like I just love the metal
prints are so cool okay hey guys so you
guys probably don't know this but it's
actually like a few weeks into the
school year now and I'm still filming
this movement vlog but I think this is
the last day that I'm going to be
filming since I pretty much have
everything done I feel like in this vlog
I just did a lot of like buying stuff
that's also kind of interesting for me
and definitely like a transition for me
because I had never really purchased
like any furniture new before I don't
think in my life obviously I was reading
a lot into this like urgh anomic working
situation all of the ergonomic like
articles tell you that your monitor or
your computer should be at eye level to
you when you're sitting down fine was
always lower so I was always
looking downward so my upper back would
hurt and so I got this little stand it
raises it so that it's at an eye level
position yeah I'm really really happy
about kind of just the purchases that I
made in the process of moving into my
new room
I really am loving these prints I think
they look really good it just like was
perfect timing that all this stuff came
in today so I could show you guys
hopefully this was like somewhat
entertaining I know that it was just a
lot of like furniture shopping and
building but I really feel like this was
different this year because it was so
personalized because I literally got to
choose every single thing that came into
this room yeah I'll just go through like
a little bit of an overview once again
because I did change like a few things
since I lost film that before so let's
do it
so bed space didn't really change you
guys saw me build this thing this is
kind of like all of my letters and my
extra exam books some scratch paper for
some reason I have a ton of tape and
here I have like all of my electronic
equipment and then my ear plugs on top
of the desk I have my 5-minute journal
which has been actually so helpful and
just creating a better mindset you know
I don't know if I did this before
I showed you guys or after but I used to
have like a huge bin of makeup hanging
out and I actually just moved all the
stuff that was in here to the drawer
below and then I made my own makeup
drawer so that was nice and like all of
my palettes are so accessible no I used
to have like forget about them all cuz
they were just like lying on top of each
other just cuz I've already raved about
it super excited about this now I won't
lose my stickies and then I can keep
track of what I'm eating I'm gonna drink
this kombucha next I switched this from
this closet the inside and this is
actually really nice because I can just
really easily grab my bags my closet and
I put stuff that I grab a lot all mine
espresso pods cuz I literally don't have
room in my drawers outside anymore
not really sure of what I'm gonna put or
if I'm gonna keep these in here but I
kind of like this so far all the extra
stuff in the closet otherwise it didn't
really change much
I don't know if this was here the last
time basically my boyfriend got a new
huge TV so he gave me his old little one
which I'm very happy about and then the
nice new prints beautiful then lastly I
just have this nice new mirror I always
get weirded out when I see people's
filming equipment I actually never use
this thing but I was trying to hold it
away from my face but I just watched
over my footage briefly and I did not
hold it away from my face so this is
useless that is it for my moving vlog
finally posting this up so I hope you
guys enjoyed it and if you guys did
please give it a thumb up and leave a
comment tell me what your favorite part
of my room is if you guys liked any of
it if you guys think any but it's cool
or if you hate it if you guys are
looking for a discount code for society6
I will try to provide one in the
description box ASAP because I know that
they're gonna give me one for my video
so just keep looking out for that below
thank you guys so much for watching I
love you guys so much and I will see you
guys in my next video very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
