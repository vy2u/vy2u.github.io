channel
so I'm really excited for this video
because it is going to be a college room
decor haul so as you guys can probably
tell from just the background of my
video I finally switched out that super
random bear and green metal print into
something that I think is really
adorable which I'm very excited about
and these are actually from society6 and
this video is in partnership with
society6 and if you don't know what
society6 is it is basically a website
where artists can post all different
kinds of designs and where people like
me can go on hundreds of different art
pieces and then find really unique art
that both benefits you because you're
finding something really really cool
that no one else really has but you're
also paying an artist who you know needs
to make a living you can get metal
prints canvas prints paper prints but
you can also get like duvet covers
pillow throw blankets floor pillows bath
mats like bath sheets what that's not a
word laptop sleeves travel mugs mugs
it's a really cool way to find very
unique art which is the coolest thing
about this website for me is that I can
literally pick art that I know no one
else has but I wanted to tell you guys
that society6 also to my viewers up with
a 10% off discount code as well as free
worldwide shipping if you use the code
and Murray which is honestly insane I
feel like shipping can get so expensive
so that's really cool I will have that
linked in the description bar if you
guys want to check that out and use my
discount code
feel free to and other than that I'm
just gonna show you guys what I got okay
so obviously the first thing that I
picked was this metal print and then
this canvas print I actually spent about
four hours or so with my mom going
through the pages of society6 because
there is such a huge selection it's
actually kind of hard sometimes to get
things that look good together from
different artists so I'm actually very
proud of this little duo that we decided
on and I think it looks a lot better
than the
random bear that I had him back on my
videos funny enough I didn't realize how
random that was until someone commented
on it and I was like yeah that is
actually extremely random another duo
that I was quite proud of with this
combo I was trying to like do the same
thing I was trying to like pick stuff
that looked really good together so this
is the metal print and I just had to get
this I thought it looked so cool
and it looks really good on metal just
because of the like very contrasting
colors I tried to pick something that
would look good together so I picked
this thing kind of a lot is going on in
both of them but they have like really
complementary colors I'm not sure still
if I think that this looks good together
it is a lot going on but I just love
these two individually so much so I'm
excited to see like where I can find a
good place a good home for them but yeah
I just think that these are two of like
the coolest most out-there art pieces
that I own but I am also very open to
the idea of like new really cool art
this next metal print is actually for my
boyfriend Jacob he's really into like
the Gucci looking designs so I think
that kind of what inspired this I think
it's really cool I personally like the
simplicity of it and I think it looks
really good on metal as well but this is
what he's gonna do with that and his
room is actually filled with society6
stuff that he got on his own like his
housemates really like the society6 art
they're all dudes but they actually like
really care about like their rooms and
their art in their rooms I've noticed
that like guys seem to be more into
their rooms than like a lot of the girls
that I know which is pretty funny so
these last two prints that I have are
actually two mini prints and they're
just like the paper prints and these are
actually my roommates that she picked
out for her room so her room doesn't
have any art so far in it so she wanted
to pick prints that were kind of like
statement pieces so I thought she did a
really good job because like these are
definitely statement pieces you like are
very drawn to this and you just want to
look at it so I thought these are really
cool and this kind of just shows you the
huge variety of things that you can
choose from on this website so if you've
watched my movement blog you probably
remember how I was talking about how I
didn't like my other duvet cover anymore
because there was just too much going on
it was it was a lot to look at so I
picked a new duvet cover which I really
like it's very simple it kind of starts
off with this like really nice light
blue color and then it goes into an
ombre and then it like reveals like kind
of ocean waves yeah I really like the
simplicity of this like you can't even
really tell that they're like waves that
much so I think that this will be a lot
better than my old duvet cover that was
just like way too much to look at
these next things I'm going to show you
are probably the coolest things in my
opinion that I got and I think they're
all so new and these are floor pillows
sometimes in college like most of the
time I have like no friends over but
sometimes I have a lot of my friends
over and there's just like nowhere to
sit and like no one wants to sit on the
floor but with floor pillows like it
makes it actually fun to sit on the
floor so I thought this is super cool
and I really like the design for this so
I like the kind of tapestry looking
designs on these floor pillows and the
floor pillows were so cool that
literally my mom and my sister and Jacob
made me pick one for each of them so I
will show you their pics I'm actually
sitting on Callie's so this one is the
one that my sister picked out super
comfy to sit on that's why I'm sitting
on it now oh my gosh this one is for my
house in Anchorage Alaska as you can
tell we have the salmon theme going on I
feel like if you're an Alaskan you just
like pick Alaskan looking stuff for your
house like I don't know but I'm excited
to put this on my patio because I don't
like sitting on the ground on my patio
so whenever I want to sit outside in the
Sun I'm just gonna put this on and then
sit on it and then this last one is
actually one that Jacob picked out I
think it also looks really cool and I
just love how it says stay home I just
imagine if I'm sitting on this on his
carpeted floor like I'm not going
anywhere so I thought these were super
cool and then something that I also
wanted to do for my sister it was her
birthday recently September 9th and also
she just moved to DC to start her new
full-time job she just settled into her
new apartment and my
mentioned that she like doesn't have a
ton of decor or like necessities so I
picked out a few things for her as well
which I will show you guys the first
thing that I wanted to get her were
throw pillows so this one is actually
the DC flag which I thought was a cute
idea that was Jacobs idea and then also
this kind of to match it I don't know I
didn't want to get two of the same
pillows I also picked out some like bath
towels this is the design of it it gets
really cool though do you think it's
just like normal stripes but then you go
further and you realize there's like a
little ripple in the waves and then you
see like a boat or a ship or whatever
that is I thought that was super cute so
basically I just got these set with two
hand towels and then two body towels so
it's the same thing but just bigger
there's the boat and then I thought this
bath mat was really really cute they're
a bunch of whales
it has the no stick like backside which
is like I think really important because
I slept on mine sometimes and then after
I picked out her towel I picked out a
towel for myself because I don't have a
beach towel and I thought this was like
the perfect design for me I think I have
a thing for like bears but basically
just like very California and then the
last thing that I have is actually for
my mom and my home in Alaska again the
Alaska theme basically this is a
extremely soft throw blanket but an
invasive like species in Alaska is the
fire weed plant and I think that's what
this is I really cannot find the right
side of this oh I think we have it
upside down yes okay so very mountainous
we have the fire weed yeah but this is
also like extremely comfortable like I
really really like their throw blankets
like I kind of wish that I had picked
one out for myself and then moving on
from just like room decor in kind of
like house decore I guess this is
actually kind of dusty court just
because of the way that it's sat on my
desk but it's also something that I'm
definitely going to use and it is these
notebooks
so this one says work hard and be nice
to people and then this one says
underestimate me that'll be fun so I'm
using these four kind of like it's like
similar to to-do list but not really
like I can tell you guys more about it
later but I think that having like this
nice little message is actually pretty
inspirational because this is like my
workbook and having like little things
like this kind of just motivates me
that's also why oh god I just spilled
coffee that's also actually why I got
this laptop slave dreams don't work
unless you do like my laptop is a place
of work for me I do all of my school
work my YouTube work like pretty much
everything there and so if I have this
little laptop sleeve that I have to pull
my laptop out of every single time it's
kind of just like a little reminder so I
thought that was really a cute idea for
like your work things but on top of that
I also just picked like out a cute
laptop sleeve because I really like this
design they also have foam cases and I
like this design so much that I picked
the same one in a phone case and then
for my sister's birthday
I picked this case because it's called
Kali ka Li and I literally don't see
anything ever with that spelling so I
wanted to pick this out because it's
literally just her name but I also
thought it looked really cool I was
gonna get her like a whole painting of
this but I was like honestly I've no
idea if she'll like this because we have
very different styles so I just picked
out the phone case Wow
I'm going through this stuff so fast so
the last things that I have to show you
guys are just these carry-all pouches I
think these are so cute and I'm not sure
if I'm gonna use these for like pencils
yet or for like my purses like with
makeup or something or I feel like it's
gonna be like a good feminine products
holder for your purses or backpack but I
think these are really really adorable
and I have like a lot of fun picking out
the prints that I wanted for all of my
like school / work related stuff so that
I can all match so those are all the
things that I picked out from society6
I'm super excited about a lot of them
and I'm really excited to give them to
their respective homes I truly just
really love society6 products just
because they're so unique and so
different and you can really find
something for everyone so definitely
check out the
code if you use emery you get 10% off

say it but I don't worldwide shipping so
that will be linked in the description
box below and other than that I hope you

design you guys liked or if you guys
would ever pick this Alaska design or if
that's just like truly an Alaskan thing
