hey guys I did a college weekly vlog
last week and I posted it on my main
channel and I do these very often on my
vlog Channel I got a lot of comments in
like oh my god you should do more of
these or I just found you and I love
this like blah blah blah I just decided
to do another college weekly vlog I just
got back from Thanksgiving break as you
guys could see with my suitcase I
unpacked everything I got in very early
this morning and I was gone for like
almost a week I think I left on Tuesday
it was a really really nice long
much-needed break but I did absolutely
nothing no schoolwork like whatsoever
and this is I think the week before
finals week I think this is my last week
of classes because it's the end of
November and I think yep what that means
is that all of your teachers like
realize that they have to give you all
these assignments all your final
projects are due and so I have literally
so much stuff due this week like I have
a quiz I have a paper I have two
presentations for some reason I have two
videos and two different like group
projects so I'm just like a ton of stuff
to do this week and I didn't do anything
and honestly like I don't like I'm
really just not beating myself up for it
because I think that I really needed to
break but this week will be a tough one
but I'm excited to be weekly vlogging
and I'm excited just to be back I guess
and to kind of get over with this week
because it'll definitely be one of the
most challenging yeah so that's pretty
much that was my intro to this vlog
welcome back thank you guys for tuning
in and if you guys do like these weekly
vlogs weekly college blog be sure to let
me know in the comments below and give
this video a thumb up because you know
like I do these all the time but like
should I post them here do you guys like
this style better let me know my class
literally got out at 214 and it's
supposed to get out at 3:20
I'm just sitting outside because it is
so beautiful and the weather is so nice
sweater weather I'm gonna sweater and
okay so awkward walking on campus you
have no idea so as a business student we
have like so many group projects and
honestly I do not mind Gore projects I
always have a like decent time working
with other people and it's a really good
way to like meet people that you might
not have otherwise or just interact with
different people that you don't or like
normally wouldn't not because like you
wouldn't talk to them it's just like you
know strangers yeah I don't mind them
usually and actually the only time I
have ever not gotten along with someone
is someone that like I've known since
freshman year he like decided to pick a
fight with me just based on our working
styles I confronted him in class because
he was just being a douche bag and I got
to the point where like our professor I
think noticed so he asked me about it
afterwards and was like is this person
like giving you a lot of trouble is he
bullying you and I was like no I'm fine
I can stand up for myself but it's funny
because I have two group meetings
tonight and one group I just absolutely
love it's Kristy and Megan like we work
so well together and then my other group
it's just like this one person just
makes it not fun to look forward to it
doesn't bother me because if he's like a
douche bag to me I know that he's
probably a douche bag to a lot of people
it is so much more fun to be able to
work with people and like working with
people I just saw the guy the delivery
guy through the like cracks of my shades
my hair looks disastrous I just
literally products house making my bed
but I just saw him drop off a huge box
and it's from do't for vlogmas they're
sending us a gift to open every single
day and so I think that's what was just
dropped off and it is such a cute idea
it's so generous and kind and just like
so sweet of them and I'm literally so
excited and then also we're doing this
thing it's called the best weekend ever
and a bunch of youtubers are coming to
LA and we're all like staying in an
Airbnb and like spending the night there
I know that Tasha and I are going
Gretchen
Brooke I don't usually don't know be on
that but like a bunch more people are
going it literally sounds like so much
fun and it's kind of in the middle of my
lake finals so I think it'll just be
like a really really fun break in the
middle of like the stress but um yeah
I'm just gonna show you guys this
package this is a ginormous box but it's
pretty late this is so cute even the
wrapping paper is so cute oh my gosh of
that in with everything else I'm
literally so excited if you guys want to
subscribe to my vlog channel that's
where I think I'll be doing vlog mists
although I might like I don't really
know we'll figure that out I'm so
excited it's gonna make my files so much
like more exciting and fun I just like
I've never had anything like this so
thank you so much to dote that was so
nice of you I'm already so excited for
all of the goodies like anyone would be
yeah this is the only job that this guy
has they're a whole group project yeah
we just can't have it living over our
heads this is my group bottleneck so far
to dinner would you do your voiceover he
didn't I I know it I knew it
where's our there Cheetos you know what
your job should be to go to Target get
spicy Cheetos a few moments later big
getting's tater tots brawl of age yeah
yeah yeah this is my assistant it's
actually like a really really efficient
process so like basically since it's all
just graphics I've just like tell your
what graphics I need and then she's like
just sending me that with super
efficient follow you on Instagram yeah
I'll put it like right here well I will
show you guys our stacks oh my gosh
Bulova but you forgot the Gio's the wine
the body bags
[Laughter]
hey guys okay it is Tuesday it's 11:13 I
have been up since 7:50 when I woke up
for my 8:00 a.m. it was a literal waste
of time I just like I hate when that
class is a waste of time
because it eats into my sleeping time
and I really really value getting enough
sleep so I'm trying to figure out when I
could nap because I didn't get that much
sleep because I was written and then
video but now me and Tasha are gonna go
to this HBO event that's on campus
before class and it looks really cool so
we thought we would vlog it and Tasha is
also doing another College weekly vlog
so we're gonna head over it is 11:15 I
have class at 12 and then I have another
group project she's lucky outside and I
have another group project due tomorrow
and then tomorrow I also have a quiz so
that's what I'll be doing for the rest
of the day we're here walking on campus
this is what it looks like Tasha has is
nifty skip the line and get a free swag
path but I don't so I would be waiting
in that line and there are not puppies
hello I literally just woke up from a
nap and Elliot called me I'm not bid on
here and so long that's my camera that
you who are destroying how've you been
I'm good all right I'm pretty slow right
now
you know this sentences are like the
humor is not spot-on yeah I thought
you're like sincere because and I said I
don't care anyway so we'll talk to you
guys just kind of why
la mano a stick these were $1 each
but it's what it finds how did you find
this deal I go to this place all the
time
I just eat all the time my friends are
always shy
good deal okay we're gonna do now okay
Tasha she's my roommate trash look like
right now so we're both doing vlogmas so
subscribe to her tail if you want to see
her so she worked with doe and I already
explained that don't like is sending
over gifts every day I blog this and
we're literally just so excited to open
these gifts but we're like they had to
have set the same gifts because like
that's so much work to send
individualize yes and we're literally
gonna compare our day ones we're not
gonna open it right now cuz it's not
vlog - but we're gonna see you like yeah
okay come here
yeah different yeah yeah cuz it's mine
oh maybe they just have different boxes
that they put in we're gonna open our
first one together so stay tuned for
that I want to know Oh yours is like
happier than mine really all right wait
close your eyes and I feel the size C
this one feels heavier okay that's you
but I thought this one felt heavier
earlier
oh yeah yeah oh oh they're different
yeah so this is what we're gonna be I
don't know man I need to know yeah I
know
okay hello everyone it is Tuesday night
I don't think I even showed you guys
like I have so many group projects this
week it's kind of ridiculous cuz you
need to meet and it's like it's so much
easier to meet in person but I just have
so many that gets overwhelming and it's
like I always have to be here at a
certain time and I don't have time to do
like work on my own and so it's just
like a lot of work but I should write
out like all the stuff that I have to do
because this weekend is also gonna be
really busy it's hard with these weekly
vlogs because I have so much to say but
like I don't want to like make these
vlogs too long but basically is their
last week of classes and then we go into
dead week where we just study for our
finals I'll be blogging doing like
weekly vlogs for this week and the next
week but then vlogmas also starts over
the weekend me Tasha and actually a
bunch of other youtubers off the top of
my head
there are more Gretchen Rickman CEO
Danielle and honestly I don't really
know who else but I know that there are
a lot of like other people going we're
all doing this thing with dough it's
such a cute idea and I'm so thankful to
them because they're just like bringing
all these people together who don't
really usually have an opportunity to be
together and it just sounds so much fun
so we're doing this thing called the
best weekend ever and we're basically
it's like a sleepover they're taking us
to catch LA which is like summer me and
Tosh I've been dying to go and they
rented out like this really cute Airbnb
they're gonna take us to dry bar and
I've never been a dry bar even though I
know that I would love it doing a photo
shoot it's gonna be so much fun
um but I just have so much stuff this
weekend and so I really I'm gonna have
to buckle down and prioritize over the
weekend because my first vinyl is
actually my the class that I'm
struggling in most so I was hoping that
would be a little later so I'd have
extra time to study but I don't so
that's just kind of like an overview of
my week and I'm also going to need to
edit and post this vlog before this
weekend because I definitely will not be
have time to do it so yeah that's pretty
much my week it's super busy but I'm
just making sure to fit in time to like
relax and like exercise and not take
anything too seriously because honestly
I think that's just the best approach
like it's gonna happen anyways you can't
always control every little thing so
just might as well try to be as positive
as possible
good morning everyone it is eight
o'clock on Wednesday I have a quiz at
10:00 and I honestly I always forget
this
I've always liked being up really really
early or really really late but
yesterday I definitely am glad that I
just got up early instead of staying up
late because my productivity was waning
and I had a headache and I was just
being really slow at everything and
instead of just kind of pushing through
and like forcing myself to do work last
night and kind of just wasting time in
between and not being as efficient I
just went to sleep and that was kind of
like sometimes the dangers move
especially if you're like doing your
last minute like cramming and learning
stuff but I'm honestly so glad that I
did that because I knew the material
pretty well or better than I thought and
I'm just like so much more efficient
especially like when I'm running up
against a clock and sometimes it's very
necessary for subjects that I just like
don't really care for or like doing so
I'm glad I woke up early I already feel
pretty good it's 8:30 and I have to go
at ten sometimes I'm like Krim until
last minute doing this but I mean we'll
see this is my last quiz thankfully
because I am just pretty over this class
so that's what I'm doing today this is
what I wear when I'm real busy shows
you're trying really hard I got my quiz
done and now I have only three group
presentations to go hello guys I got
back from another group project meeting
I have another one three it's two 22 I'm
really tired I don't have time to nap
though and I just want to shave my meal
mmm because this is all I have in my
fridge right now but it's actually
really good it probably is gonna look
disgusting and I did not expect anything
of it but here it is got some veggie
chicken nuggets and then some white rice
he I was expecting be like have to just
like kind of force it down but it's
pretty good and also the best combo is
like the dissolvable
like the pink one and sprite it's such a
good combo okay I'm gonna go sit here
and eat and listen to my podcast this
11:04 I have no idea what I've logged
I'm so exhausted I woke up super early
to study for my quiz which I was happy I
did but then I had three different hours
where I tried to nap like one just for
one and like a little bit of hours and
then the second one for two hours
because I only got like three hours of
sleep but I literally just could not
fall asleep so I am so tired like my
eyes just feel like they're not a part
of my face and I have no idea what I
lost logged but I have to get up for a 7
a.m. practice presentation which
honestly I don't mind getting up early
so I don't care but I was like I'm just
gonna sleep now because I cannot think
like or process anything so I have two
presentations tomorrow one I'm just
gonna wing because it's like a little
bit more casual of the class and the
other we're getting up to meet at 7:15
so I was to get up earlier to just kind
of like go over my lines a little the
best approach to presentations for me is
just to not stress about it and like not
over practice I've never actually over
practiced that much so maybe that would
lead me to very different results but
usually I'm just like whatever like just
don't spend too much time thinking about
it oh this is a horrible vlog I'm so
sorry I'm awake and really greasy I
realized that the reason why I had such
a hard time falling asleep yesterday
because I have like a tiny little
scratch in my throat and so right before
I'll fall asleep I like will start
coughing and so that was literally my
night it took me so long to fall asleep
and then I woke up like coughing and so
that was my sleep but I feel like
relatively well rested and I'm just
excited to get this presentation over
with and then my next so that I can go
to sleep
good morning everyone
no one is awake right now because it is
so early
that's pretty though
okay so it is 10:15 I just got home like
15 minutes ago our presentation went
really well I think we like honestly
have one of the best presentations in
the class and I'm not just saying that
cuz I get was ours but like we looked
around cuz it was like pure or like our
groups or our class graded it and like
we just noticed that we had the highest
for a lot of groups so that's really
nice but now I only have 15 minutes to
eat I made myself a very quick breakfast
before I get on a call I'm doing this
interview with Teen Vogue
I met a writer for Teen Vogue during my
trip to Ibiza with top-deck you guys
haven't seen that I can make it blow I
feel like a lot of you guys haven't seen
it it was on my blog channel she's doing
an article on youtubers College
youtubers so that should be a lot of fun
but I have another presentation that
literally have not even thought about at
12 so I'm gonna finish that and then
head over to campus like ASAP after that
- like prep for that but it's it's not a
huge deal because I have like that's the
class that I've really high grated and
so I'm just not gonna worry too much
about that but it's not gonna be it's
not gonna be amazing so for the like
buzzwords like you're able to block a
lot of like disable or just prevent some
of the comments from popping up on your
channel so like if you get it like if I
had a list but I always got like
criticism or hate for that I would just
type in the word Lisp to my blacklist
and just never look at it again you know
so that's like one method that I've done
is like I type in like all the ugly
words and then I'm like okay like that
prevents a lot of people from being able
like you can still see their comments
but you don't see it like when you go
through your comments every day which is
I think pretty helpful so if you're like
particularly sensitive to like some
feature that you think is flawed then
maybe just like button so you don't have
to read comments about it but otherwise
like it is hurtful and like it does make
you think like oh like is this feature
about me weird I guess just like really
believing in yourself and not allowing
like other people's opinions of you to
just change the way that you think of
yourself
supposed to be at my meeting to practice
presenting on influencers and my
interview on influencers went kind of
along I mean it wasn't long but I'm just
crunch on time so my group is gonna hate
me time to present yeah you guys are
gonna be in my weekly vlog twice now
hello everyone I am finally done with
all of my school work all my
presentations and all of my quizzes for
the week and I'm literally so so tired
my face I can like feel it in my face it
just does not feel great I kind of
realized that a lot of this vlog was
just me coming back to my house and like
updating you guys real quickly before I
went to the next thing and there is
definitely one point where I just
completely forgot to vlog and forgot
what I had vlog so I apologize if this
is a very boring vlog I thought I would
be able to like get everything in like I
did the previous week where I didn't
really have a problem just like blogging
in between things this week was honestly
probably the busiest week luckily like
I'm actually really glad that a lot of
my things were group projects because in
some areas like I was like really
slacking where I had done a lot with my
group before so like they were happy to
like pick up the slack but I just had a
ton of stuff to do and just it was a lot
busier than I thought it would be so a
lot of just me talking to you guys here
and then vlog my starts tomorrow so I'm
starting vlogmas on my vlog channel I
think starting tomorrow you guys can
head over there I literally I don't know
how this month came and went so fast I
had no idea that the start a vlog miss
was tomorrow it's gonna be a lot a lot
of stuff to do so yeah I'm gonna go nap
now and I think that I'm actually going
to end my vlog here I need to try to
edit this tonight so I can start being
