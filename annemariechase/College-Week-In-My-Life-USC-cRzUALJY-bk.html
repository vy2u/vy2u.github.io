but a giant Matt your bananas in there
to really wait say hi to my vlog it was
so I was dead a weekly vlog Sydney
literally looked like an angel
well keep it class she looked so cute in
just night I don't know what I'm saying
every time I go
[Laughter]
I've missed her because no shade to the
other roommates but we are the only ones
who clean in when she's gone I notice it
yeah yeah yeah I I appreciate you okay
I'm gonna make coffee now oh no it it
looks really good I hope it looks yeah
this is a good combo let me know good
job I was also up like pretty late got
my coffee and my today I need to finish
my part for my group project and I know
that it's gonna take me a few hours and
I have class in two hours so I need to
just like focus on that
it's 136 I have class at 2:00 I am
listening to this audio book it is so
good it's a recording of a speech by
brené Brown it's on the power of
vulnerability she did a TED talk every
single chapter so far or like session
has been so fascinating and like so
relatable to my life that I know for a
fact that I'm gonna listen to this whole
thing over again after I listen to it
one time through and then I don't know
it's gonna be like a staple in my life
so you know okay
when we can't do something and
conversely it's about saying yes when we
really want to do something and the
shame gremlin is saying you would really
should wait five pounds from now to do
that you should really wait to try that
Nia class with your perfect go-to for
Tia classes when no one's looking then
go to give me a class of your friends I
it's a chapter of my dissertation I am
on chapter 40 of this audio book speech
and there's 56 chapters and I literally
listened to 40 chapters all yesterday it
is that good I will link the name of it
below in the description box as well as
a free one-month trial to audio audible
but it's a subscription-based service so
as always just be sure to know the rules
and cancel if you guys don't want to
continue paying for the subscription so
link will be in bio I just got out of
class and I went back to Trader Joe's to
get lunch ingredients because I'm
copying her she's outside her exact
lunch quinoa pasta kale cashew and basil
pesto from Trader Joe's I'm also gonna
cook like a vegetarian vegan sausage
because they're also really good from
Trader Joe's YUM
now I really really want a nap I might
nap
I don't know I don't know that's the big
debate should I nap or not definitely
feel more tired than before it's 5:30
now I'm going to eat some food I think
just my leftovers from lunch then I'm
going to drink a lot of caffeine but
then I'm going to head to the library
because I have a lot of work what I need
to do yeah I have other people so I can
lock you what's your name
George Sam main channel I'll go study
but we don't know where they closed the
fourth floor of the library at USC this
is what campus looks like at night it's
a lot cuter during the day but you know
too scared to vlog during the day huh
this is where I miss brené Brown speech
hate myself
this is duct tape Tommy Trojan right now
I want to get it but I don't want them
to see me filming like you just you're
taking a picture they do not hear you do
it yeah can you get some commentary to
okay I don't know that explanation okay
fine I'll do I'll go David David David
do you wanna be my blog tell them what
this is what are you doing so we are
trojan night they're about 20 of us here
right now but they're like 80 of us
total we spend the week guarding Tommy
than anything else who do you protect
him from so yeah I should have clarified
so probably starting in the 40s USC and
UCLA had a pretty infamous prank war so
during the week that UCLA and USC
football play each other we camp out
here in guard Tommy or
like a literal people are playing Mario
Kart over there us he brings us a lot of
food they feed us dang so it's real nice
yay thank you
it's 2:30 and tomorrow I have an 8 a.m.
and in order for me to actually be super
productive in my morning's of ATMs I
have to wake up early enough where I can
eat breakfast so I don't have to come
back to eat after my 8:00 a.m. because I
have another class at 12 so I like to
take 2 hours in between the two hour
break and go to the library or do some
work so I'm gonna really try to get up
early enough so that I can get all ready
and go eat breakfast and like be in and
up and then I'm comfortable being in for
the rest of the day so that I can be
much more productive so maybe like
vlogging will help me do that maybe I'll
wake up earlier because I'm like oh I'm
gonna vlog this so if I get up and I
vlog tomorrow then that means that I've
gotten up on time
I just took a nap it's like four and I
know that me and my group are gonna be
working super late on our group project
so I wanted to get some better rest in
because I only got like four hours of
sleep last night so I think I slept for
like probably two hours our group
project it's just like so depressing
because we had a like pretty solid group
we had three people myself included who
just clearly didn't know what we're
really doing like we try hard but like
this excel like class just has not come
naturally to us it's basically just
managing a ton of data and some people
just have better experience with it or
more experience with it than others and
we had one guy who like clearly nobody
was doing so we were like okay like
whatever we will get through this and he
left our group so he left three like
just dummies to just spend for
themselves and these groups are like
made of I think three is the minimum and
then there's just one girl who like
literally just doesn't do anything so
there's basically just three of us and
most of the groups are made of like six
people yeah that's where we're at so
we're all gonna try real hard but I've
kind of hoping hoping for the best
expecting the worst with this one and
I've kind of just accepted it so that's
pretty much where we're at
my group is all in class but did I stop
by yeah I came by and got some food I'll
show you what he gets cuz he has free
Dining Dollars he was a fan of vitamin A
I like vitamin water that much also
these things lately these are pretty
good
they're awesome hello everyone it is
12:00 a.m. and I just got back literally
just walked in from my group project
meeting I actually thought it would take
a lot longer so I'm kind of happy I'm
gonna write up the paper like explaining
everything that we're gonna do in our
presentation and then tomorrow we're
gonna meet up at 8:30 or 8:45 and then
just go over the presentation hopefully
it all goes smoothly I'm down to my last
six minutes of this audiobook of this
speech I listened to it a lot yesterday
when I was cleaning my room and
rearranging it which I still need to
show you guys so hopefully I don't
forget and then I also listen to it too
to in from my classes and like in
between my classes and then just washing
dishes so that's like literally one of
my favorite things to just kind of
unwind to which is really funny is just
like listening to stuff and washing my
dishes if it's not this audiobook their
podcasts but yeah that's pretty much
what I'm gonna do today not that
exciting so I don't know me and Tasha
are at Morton's food we're vlogging on
campus in public and we're so awkward
and uncomfortable like truly awkward but
we want to take pictures here and they
also have really I don't know it's just
like really fancy looking and oh you
look so cute
this is what we're dealing with okay
ready Tosh is also doing a weekly blog a
week in my life of college
go watch hers links below it is after
all of my classes my group project went
really well I mean as well as it could
have gone I think it went well
better than I expected I got a little
sleep because I offered to write our
paper because I felt like I needed to
contribute more I think we all did a
good share of equal parts except this
one girl who literally didn't show up
and now she's texting us where we are
she's like how did it go because she
literally did not come to class how did
it go it's a group presentation like you
would think that you'd need to be in the
group our professor was like where's
your other group member and we were like
we don't know and she was like alright
well I guess I'm gonna count her is not
doing anything and we were like yeah
pretty much I did that and then I hung
out with Tasha at Martin big we took
some pictures later there was like
literally he had it out for me like he
did not like me for whatever reason he
took so long so I was late to class but
I got an an my paper I started writing
about YouTube because we're supposed to
write about like the space like spaces
are just like careers that were we have
experience in and I was like why not
everything about it is so symbolic from
like the camera to like the actual space
so it makes it really really easy to
write about and I keep getting A's on my
YouTube papers it's awesome cuz I never
get A's on my writing papers for writing
classes literally the best thing after
writing a paper or doing a project I'm
gonna close all of these tabs oh my gosh
these are literally all for that one
project earlier this morning not even
gonna see it
whoa loves Champa thanks nope I'm so
surprised my computer just did not
completely crash so funny looking back
on this process okay I think that's it
it is 843 I took a nap
because I got like four hours of sleep
again I was really tired and I was
supposed to wake up for yoga and I
actually woke up on time but I've just
been sitting in my bed since because I'm
so tired I don't think I'm gonna
exercise tonight which I'm kind of
annoyed about I also forgot I felt my
parents are so we get down hmm and I
also have a quiz tomorrow so I might
just study a little bit and then go to
sleep early and then wake up early I
just got this in the mail which I was
pretty excited about I've been waiting
for this for a while and I think I'm
going to put it right here because I
rearranged my whole room and it's
actually like I loved it it was Jeff's
idea and I didn't think that I would
like it as much as I like truly truly
really just love this new layout it's a
little bit messy right now cuz I've been
busy okay before my biggest problem was
I never had I have so many remotes that
I need to keep track of and it takes up
kind of a lot of space and I just love
them very often
so I thought to get like a little shelf
and these ones are cool because it
doesn't require like any installation
it's literally just a command strip so
I'm gonna see what it looks like right
there
hopefully it's not hideous but I think
it'll work really well it's funny
because before I like had my own room I
literally spent like zero dollars into
investing in my room but now I like have
been buying a bunch of stuff it's just
like so crazy to me that I can change
anything in here and it's just like it's
all up to me so great
you just it's like comes off the wall
hello everyone happy Thursday I went to
class at ADM definitely did not study
for my quiz but I was like okay
opportunity cause I'm exhausted this
quiz is worth like less than two percent
of my grade and so I just took the El
but maybe I did well maybe I guess right
I don't know you never know but either
way don't run carefully and then I went
to yoga and then I literally just got
out of the shower I have to rush to
class I did not wash my hair even though
I sweat a ton quickly this is the most
underrated thing ever dry shampoo is a
life changer really like the batiste
brand I'll try to link it below if I can
find one I'd like hate feeling greasy if
I look or feel greasy
I used to shower every day or wash my
hair everyday
then I just like cannot I just that's
all I think about so dry shampoo has
been a life changer so much time has
been saved from not washing my hair and
like drying it and stuff like that and
also just I don't know it's just an
all-around ten out of ten great product
oh yeah I really need to go to class I
don't know what I'm talking about this
so much ok ok Thursday I think the last
time I blogged I literally had just
gotten out of the shower from yoga but
after that I went to my last class and
then
hang out with my parents cuz they're in
town again then we literally just sat in
traffic for a little while
and it got Jacobs car there's a biker
watch out here some right now it's
actually conquest this is just the week
where we play football it's an Ewell
like we yeah I showed Tommy Trojan who's
all covered up like so we're gonna go to
like conquest this is such a cool shot
with this guy this is weird there's so
many people coming in this area that is
usually a pretty boring area like you
just go study right there
just arrives no huh
who's he gang he's gonna do the
blues
and he's crazy
what I need to say
we got front-row sides
my question is like it's little time but
just watch the clock aflame
that's my that was literally my question
that I had look at they're all just
standing there
you've never been to
you need to calm down you're gonna die
you're gonna get run to see me but I
can't see them my god
I'm keeping this in my blog my wife
she's Craig oh my gosh you need help
they looked up
that was not me
oh they're all getting pushed back look
at this
oh my god that is so scary why do people
do that
oh my god
what time's the charm are you scared
okay
the people running this ferret builder
is literally the most inefficient people
this is our fourth time going around and
they're not it's like it's actually so
inefficient that it's kind of
frustrating me because I feel bad for
everyone else waiting because did they
have no rival reason their line was like
chicken so on camera now I know I know
they literally are just doing this
randomly that's our fourth time around
like a little like we tried we're trying
to get off at this place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
