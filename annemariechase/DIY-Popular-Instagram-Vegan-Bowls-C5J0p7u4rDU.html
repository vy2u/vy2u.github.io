channel so for today's video we're going
to be in my kitchen for making some
really healthy vegan Instagram full stop
comeback story is that I felt like I was
struggling to eat healthily I just
wasn't feeling good about my body which
caused me to like not care about not
eating healthy my best friend's Rachel
came to visit a few weeks ago
rachel is vegan as of like years ago how
in a healthiest person I know she's like
very very healthy when I go to this
problem she recommended that I just try
out these three super easy vegan bowls
because they're healthy but they're all
Virginis so I couldn't really know I
also realized how these bowls are all
over Instagram but kind of just makes
them more fun to make to be honest but
also it's nice because if you run out of
whole ideas you can like to hook them up
and get a lot of inspiration this video
is sponsored by dried market but as you
guys know I only work with companies
whose products that I've actually tried
and loved so I'm happy to be sharing
this with you guys and also really happy
because they pumped all of my viewers up
with 20% off and free shipping off your
first box so go thrive
here for now so in case you don't know
what thrive market is is basically an
online grocery store that sells top
healthy and organic products for
twenty-five to fifty percent off
they do this by essentially cutting out
the middleman and working directly with
brands so that you the consumers don't
have to pay like all the extra hidden
fees I just like Sofia's of having an
actual visible store and instead they
send it straight to your door
dry park excels pantry foods which are
foods that like don't spoil fast which
is very important for costumes to have
around because sometimes I legitimately
to come tofu to my fridge and on the
website they categorize things so if you
are looking for just vegan foods you can
click that but if not they also have 98
other categories that you can choose
from so they're offering a free 30-day
trial but after you continue to excuse
dried market you would pay $60 an annual
membership fee which I feel like is
usually a turn-off for college students
but on average members make their money
back within the first two orders and
they also have a guarantee that your
membership and pay for itself within
your first year or they'll give you the
difference in credit and if you really
with them so basically they have a
guarantee that like you pretty much will
not waste your money the real last thing
is I want to mention my nails look like
this I'm so sorry I got gels on it's
really hard to get off for you to pay
and I'm not down so just one visit
disclaimer alright let's get into the
vegan Bowl okay so the first recipe that
we're going to make is the as Rachel
calls it basic be bootable you can
pretty much throw whatever that you have
in your fridge or leftovers into this
bowl but here's what I have as
ingredients I like to put rice as a base
especially with all of these meals about
a handful of kale I have broccolini or
like broccolini and avocado a sweet
potato and then here I have tahini sauce
or his teeny dressing and sesame seeds
the first thing that we're going to do
is preheat the oven to 400 degrees
Fahrenheit we're going to start off with
the sweet potatoes because they take the
longest so you cut them in half and you
will then with some olive oil you can
also cook this whole with no oil for a
healthier alternative but we're just
going to place them face down on the
sheet
six years in the oven after about 10
minutes we're going to take them out
flip them over and then add the
broccolini with the sweet potato pop
them back in the oven for another 10
minutes next and last of the veggies
we're going to simply ask the kale and
then pop these in the oven with the rest
of the veggies for about four to five
minutes so after that we'll be all done
with the veggies but meanwhile as you
can probably see the chickpeas in the
back are done because we can work on
those while the veggies are in the oven
here are the ingredients that you need
so we have a chickpeas that are already
dried one teaspoon of cumin 3/4 teaspoon
of garlic powder 3/4 teaspoon of chili
powder 1/4 teaspoon of salt and pepper
with medium heat and one tablespoon of
oil we're going to hook up the chickens
on the stove and the flavoring honestly
makes a huge difference we're going to
cook this during pretty regularly for
about 10 minutes or until they're nicely
browned and a healthier alternative to
these is just to mix these up with the
spices and then pop them in the oven and
I found the fat actually makes it even
crunchy err so it gives like a little
crouton for you which is really good so
once your ingredients are all done that
all you pretty much have to do is put it
together and plate it put my kale on one
side sweet potatoes
so here is the final product and I'm
going to have my handy taste tester come
it's really hungry so we're going to get
his true opinion this is Jacob excuse my
boyfriend take your veal
get a few bites yelling got like a
little boat on to the next one so this
is the sushi bowl and it's probably my
favorite because a it's super refreshing
and very light and B doesn't take any
cooking except for the rice and then see
this Asian food and I pretty much grew
up eating like this combo of food all
the time so that's why for our
ingredients we have cucumbers carrots
and this would look way more aesthetic
if I had a shredder but College problems
I don't mangoes I didn't think that I
would like to set first but mangoes are
so good in sushi bowls because they're
really sweet and nothing else pretty
much is so they're like amazing if you
haven't tried it definitely try it
cilantro edamame and then we can add
some avocado again this will be kind of
spring mix we have seaweed
more sesame seeds and then my favorite
ginger soy sauce and sriracha sauce
we're getting at
here for this one he'll perfect rule
let's do this I'm really bad at plating
stuff so this will out look like it came
off of Instagram but it could have I'm
going to put the lettuce first like a
more holistic bite when you put the
lettuce first and then the rice
carefully keep coming BRR
carrot
and a mummy
and then me so much Chuck parsley
actually
now it has been smart we put the the soy
sauce and the rice but I like a lot of
sriracha some but a lot this can go
around very fast so I've seen people do
lots of different ways of the seaweed
will put it around just pretty aesthetic
of it this will be the ones good looking
things
come I like lots of ginger so I'm doing
voila
a +4 plating am i right
okay so the last and final Bowl that we
have is the messy Bowl obviously a
Mexican inspired goal this is a really
good goal for a lot of flavor and I
think it's very Hardy and filling so for
these ingredients we have obviously the
right a staple we have some black beans
and then we have another free mixed
lettuce combo thing some cherry tomatoes
corn and then some bell peppers we also
have some a good a guy oh and some guac
add timing on completing a little Bowl
this time creating fold you halfway
you walk and um good girl all right so
here's the final product and then
obviously I feel like natural that you
all right guys that's the end of my
video those were three really easy
healthy Instagram of bold vegan recipes
