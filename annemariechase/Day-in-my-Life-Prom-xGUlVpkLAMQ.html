vlog and I thought that that was a
really good idea because I'm planning on
doing a get ready with me for prom
anyways but that really only includes
like makeup and hair and then like the
final product but really a lot goes in
or a lot more goes into prom than just
doing your makeup and hair so I thought
that that was a really good idea and I'm
just gonna start it right now
so I am kind of annoyed because I'm
going to work right now and I had to
park like on top of this JCPenney
parking lot instead of the parking lot
at my work don't want to walk over there
cuz I have flip-flops so annoyed and I'm
also going to be doing a get ready with
me so that'll probably be after this
video
mmm that I got on my car and like walked
to work now it's like seriously my
obsession at work thank you
oh there you go Raphael okay so I forgot
to vlog but um here's what my nails look
like you know I'm getting packed up to
go maybe spend the night at my friend
Devon's house but it's kind of funny
because I have to ask my mom even though
I'm an eighteen year old adult adult um
so it kind of all depends on my mom's
mood so we shall see but I'll I'll just
block it anyways the reason why this is
like a struggles because I'm sleeping
over tomorrow night on prom and I don't
know my parents like to have me home
pretty often even though I don't really
go and spend a night that much so we'll
see hello this is my problem
um anyway so can I get it done so um
well they want a house to go over
because we're gonna do stops the morning
anyways okay bye I don't get it I love
you so here in Alaska whilst you're
driving through the neighborhood's this
is gonna be so boring for like the
people who know me that are watching me
but I love this okay there are two
here's one right there and then that's
one we're about so I don't know they're
pretty nice like peaceful futures but um
just joined we're gonna go now
Oh
what are you doing you're getting crack
cocaine you show me your nails I forgot
to do that okay I don't know each other
vlogs I was like first starfish ring
yeah she was going to cry now
it's prom day yeah and we're getting
breakfast
it's control I'm cutting that out you it
just makes it hard for me to edit any
butthole you can't see the effort easy
like other work I don't know that's not
my audience is like 13 to 18 year old
girl
telling him that well I don't want to so
I'm like a mess right now I'm going to
my hair appointment because it's at
12:30 and it's like well 20 right now
probably update you and I like have my
hair done I think I'm just getting curls
because I really wanted to get an updo
but my dress is backless and I'll show
you guys later um and like I have the
worst hand line in the world so I think
I'm just gonna put my hair down so that
it kind of covers it so we'll see how
that goes
okay so I just got my hair done and then
I got some false lashes because I forgot
to do that and then I realized at the
hair place like one of my friends kind
of was there and she's actually like
someone who I think I'm gonna like room
with for college which is like cool and
they're talking for a while and we both
realize that we forgot boutonnieres for
our dates that they're both going with
dates

also gonna do my makeup right now and
then do my friends makeup so we'll see
how that works
