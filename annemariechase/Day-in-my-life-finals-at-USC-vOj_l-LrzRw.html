vlogmas your bum looks so good no I will
thank you I started just doing a twist
I think I do sometimes looks good well
thank you
I literally just woke up but we're gonna
open our vlogmas gifts together yeah
this intro doesn't have any music
because I'm getting copyrighted and I
can't tell what it's for so enjoy it
looks like like a DM but it's like no
it's not the afternoon this is okay my
look it's okay okay guys we're gonna
open our vlog miss don't say five Tasha
is telling me for her blog that so it
was like oh it doesn't look like thank
you like this tube top would you tell
that if you didn't like something you
can do this in your vlog hey guys this
is my box
I bought the section Tosh is like a
expert on like thanks wait mine look
jingling oh wow look at the back oh this
is a really okay I like this I have
nothing in this color this is a fool oh
that's so pretty
rasa oh really nice yeah I think that's
nice it's like it's like you can be
dressed up you look classy - yeah I feel
like this would be really nice for like
work - because I never really this is
like what you would wear for work okay
so basically yesterday I was super tired
the whole day I was like should I
happened like just couldn't happy it was
like a repeat of something that happened
like a week ago
and so I was talking to Tasha I was like
you think that I should study now and
it's really hard for me to study because
I'm so tired or should I just go to
sleep early and she was like well you
might not wake up that early and I was
like no I will cuz usually I have no
problem getting up early but I fully
slept for 12 hours and just woke up well
I got 10 or 9 so this is how my day is
going and I have
first final tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. it's
my hardest final so I pretty much have
all day today to study but I feel like
if you're just on top of things and
prepared for your finals like that's
just not that you're not every so I'm
pretty much probably gonna be sittin in
my room all day just studying for this
final um and my room is literally a
disaster so yeah that's what today's
gonna look like it's just gonna be a big
study day cuz like this is crunch time I
know that I'm actually gonna get a lot
of studying done but it's just gonna
suck I have been sitting here for like
nine hours ten hours and so I just
raised it so I can stand here for that
long
looks cool though right now it is now
12:43
and i have been working for a pretty
long time like pretty consistently
because is the last day that I can
possibly study so here's not my little
schedule looks like
I hate studying for this class and it's
even like a ton of work actually like
physically studying before I'll show you
guys it's my Excel class and you
literally always have to have a ton of
windows open so that's super annoying
just to navigate through all these
windows I like this class only because I
really like my professor but the content
and actually doing the learning is a 1
out of 10 for me and also I don't know
how you would do this without
unmonitored because like I tried doing
this one time just with my laptop at the
library and it was just so much harder
because you can't see that much unless
you have a giant laptop screen or just
don't work on a laptop yeah I think I
also realized over the course of the
last weekend finals and just being like
very having a ton of alone time is I
think I'm not really addicted to my
phone because whenever I take a break
I'm just like I haven't been going on my
phone because it's just it's like a
slippery slope you just can get really
into it and I like actually have
feelings of withdrawal and like my life
just seems incomplete and it's actually
so terrifying so I've been trying to do
other things while I
take my like tiny little brakes and
usually I'll just like end up sitting on
my bed and then just kind of sitting
around and being like why do I do
it's so weird I've never really thought
of it until recently like I didn't have
this actual epiphany that I think I'm
addicted to my phone so I turned it off
so other things that I've started doing
to take breaks is literally just like
sit and breathe and that just feels so
weird because I'm usually up my phone
during those breaks and then I've also
literally been writing my essay and the
breaks just because I'm like I don't
know what else to do with myself or like
I want to screen in front of me and my
favorite while I'm like in this mood of
like just like so annoyed with like
studying and just sitting for so long
I'm actually standing now it's to take a
shower it always like relaxes me so much
and I just love taking a shower so I'm
gonna do that now I just showered and I
actually feel pretty like relaxed and
sleepy now does anyone else when they're
in the shower and really stressed out
and just sad and like just sit in your
shower with hot water running and it
feels so good but then you're like what
am i doing and then you just kind of
pretend that your life is a sad movie of
you sitting on your shower floor what
have you guys heard the new ed Sheeran
and Beyonce duet so it is 746 I'm about
to head over to take my final I feel
like I've gotten over like the really
frantic like nervous feeling before
taking files like sometimes I'll get it
like right before I take my test or like
right when I start but at this point in
my life it's not worth it to like stress
over it and I think I've realized it's
really easy to just say that and it's
harder to realize it but I've like taken
so many finals now I'm such an old wise
person I'm a senior I've taking a lot of
finals and really know no matter what I
what happens on my finals it hasn't
really impacted my life that I know of
extremely negatively it's just kind of
like a big stress at the moment but then
it just kind of goes away I think just
as students we like think this is like
the most important thing ever but it's
really really not so yeah I'm gonna go
and I'll talk to you guys when I get out
just took my test didn't do the whole
last page because I ran out of time but
it sounded like there are some other
grounds in the room too so maybe I don't
know no one left early at least
thankfully yeah so I have two papers
ones like a group paper so I'm gonna
finish that up or whatever is left to
finish up and then I'm going to work on
my creative writing paper
the professor's super super cool and he
doesn't really have a strict due time so
it's like technically midnight tonight
but he really doesn't care as long as
you like get it in within like the
morning I guess so that's what I'll be
doing but I'm literally just gonna sit
here and like do nothing for like an
hour - it is 1:30 now and I did a little
bit of sitting probably like an hour -
and then I was on my phone and I I think
I confirmed I'm like actually addicted
to my phone and it puts me in a really
bad mood I don't know when it like when
I noticed me starting just use my phone
a ton more I'm also really hot because I
was laying in my covers and I didn't
realize that I was getting so hot cuz I
was originally really cold but yeah I
think I have like an actual phone
problem so I'm going to do a lot more to
work on that the first thing that I did
I downloaded this thing called moment
which tells you how long you are on your
phone for and I've been unknowingly
looking for this for such a long time
like if someone had told me about it I
totally would have downloaded it so I'm
telling you guys but okay this is
honestly embarrassing on Sunday I was on
my phone for a total of four hours and
17 minutes like that's where all of my
time goes well I watched so much YouTube
in that time this app plays in the
background of your phone so if you do
just have it open it'll count that as
you being on your phone but if you close
the lock screen then it doesn't count
but if you like pick up your phone and
like open the lock screen I think that
counts as like a pick up I've been using
it for about two weeks and I downloaded
it secretly on my
phone because he spent a lot to and then
also on Callie's phone but I didn't do
it secretly I just told her and she said
like she does a really use her phone
that often but I think I really have a
problem that I like just didn't really
notice before I just thought I spent
like a very small amount of time because
I would just do it in between everything
but it's like consuming my all in
between everything so yeah I'm gonna
start paying attention to that it was so
weird yesterday I was like actually
having withdrawals cuz it's like I'm not
gonna go on my phone and it was I just
like I was like I don't know what to do
I sound kind of crazy but like I just
realized this and I'd not really noticed
it before so I thought I was gonna be
super tired after my test cuz I did not
get a lot of sleep but I was kind of
planning on just like bumming out all
day and like not doing a lot and then
finishing up my creative essay and
finishing up my group paper but I think
I just finished my group the rest of the
group paper
I'm not tired and I'm not gonna go to
sleep right now and I've been doing a
lot of just like sitting around and like
I spent so much time in my room I
apologize for any of you watching this
who are like really bored of the scenery
when I'm stressed out or like sad or
like just down I tend to spend a lot of
time by myself like ISIL 8 and then I
spend it like a ton of time by myself
just in my room so that's kind of what's
been going on but I think today I'm
going to like clean up a lot and try to
get my life together and then I also
start my last final I thought I would do
some little time lapses of me getting my
life together and show you guys like
kind of what I do it's funny because
when you're studying for a test or you
want to do is like clean and do
everything that you can't do at the
moment because you feel like you need to
study but then afterwards you usually
just don't do it anyways but I'm gonna
do it so let's go
Spotify just told me that my top plate
song with supermarket flowers by Ed
Sheeran and then grows old by a
third-story those are both good songs so
I can believe that but like I don't
actually know that that's kind of cool
so tackling my bed next and that is a
monster
the good thing about having a standing
desk when I don't want to get my tripod
out I just try to fix my hair it really
did not work so we're just doing this
big bunch thing I need to brush it I
think I'm gonna open my dope gift for
today because that is honestly one of my
favorite things getting me through
finals this year very backlit let's try
this angle day six Happy Holidays the
dough to you
thank you speaking of sirens there are
insane fires going on in LA right now
like I just saw videos of the fires and
they look horrifying this is awesome
most like energetic and productive I've
ever been after a final no what's going
on
this one is very well wrapped yes I did
wear the sweater yesterday thanks for
asking
okay just so exciting oh whoa
I do not know what this is intimately
free people is it like literally do you
wear it like this
I don't mind things have been that like
a Miss could be cute
woo thank you so much don't I'm really
looking forward to trying this on and
definitely go follow me on dota if you
haven't already and if anyone has used
their site or has used my $5 off credit
let me know because they are awesome
okay Derek shot just came into my room
out of nowhere she hasn't well she's
been really really busy with finals for
a week I probably spend 36 hours in the
bus wait I follow her on five my friends
and I like every single time I would
check it because for some reason like I
check it often like you people don't
check it often apparently but it's like
my favorite thing to do you are always
hot levy I wasn't even at like 2:00 or
3:00 a.m. like you were always last
night oh my gosh yeah that's amazing
food oh yeah but she asked me if I'd be
up for the Dubs so hungry but I didn't
want to go to myself so I was like yeah
yeah okay what's your name
we're at eating at a new restaurant in
the village like namajunas look at the
caterpillar I always look here and right
you can tell but you're supposed to look
maybe you try it try it look at three
different lasers like spear and then
fight on top and it didn't get ready by
yourself
oh this camera makes it look really bad
this is the best possible ugh no one
could see oh well I'm buying toilet
paper I need a thumbnail like this oh my
god
perfect twenty minutes of looking
through my video may I show yours I did
toilet paper and we're buying matching
pajama pants they're really good
actually very very world wow etosha
filming process so we just got back we
all for some reason got ice cream I
think it was a yeah I feel like Tasha is
just every single day she's like I want
some ice cream
I usually just want like chips and stuff
but I got the haagen-dazs ice cream
that's coffee and they haven't tried it
and so it's like the best really I just
feel like if you like coffee it's like
the best possible I assume you could
possibly eat my face is so bread yeah I
try my ice cream yeah you will whoa I
expected that hey guys okay so it is now
757 and honestly I've been kind of
chilling for the last like five six
hours I've had a good time doing nothing
and cleaning and like getting my life
together and eating and stuff but um I'm
starting on my essay now and it's a
creative essay so it's not as difficult
as like having to like I don't know like
really focus it's very very very
creative I was taking a really long time
and I was like wow this rate I'm really
not gonna finish very soon that I
remembered that my favorite yoga
instructor is teaching tomorrow at 10:00
and I was like I have to go and I have
to be like well rested enough because as
I said before it's really tiring at
least for me so that literally gave me
motivation to work faster and I've
already gotten a pretty good amount we
got to pick her own like pieces that we
wanted to ride off of or mirror
basically
and some people I just picked one page
and minds like kind of to single-spaced
pages and so it's actually a lot and I
literally could have picked an easier
one for myself but I just didn't so now
I'm having to write a lot I'm gonna do a
study with me if people really like
these but you're not studying I'm
writing an essay
so it's now 1009 and I've taken like at
least a break or two and I'm honestly
like super super close to being done and
I'm just so confused because usually
writing takes me so long and all I had
to do was have motivation to go to yoga
because I really want to go to yoga
tomorrow I'm just like blown away I'm so
confused I thought I would be up all
night doing this I still might go to bed
like kind of soon and then just get up
really early and just like check
everything over make sure it's all good
but I'm gonna finish it tonight and then
go sleep but I'm so impressed today it
was like so much more relaxed than I
thought it was gonna be it is now 1120
