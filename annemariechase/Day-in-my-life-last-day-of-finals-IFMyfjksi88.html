day 12 so it is 7:40 in the morning and
today is my day of finals I don't know
I'm so excited I think it's just because
I'm like so ready to be over with all my
finals I feel like I've been I have been
in my room for like the last five days
so I'm finally excited to just like get
it over with I do have some like
last-minute studying to do and I have my
final at I have one final at like 12 but
he made it earlier at 11:30 and then at
4:30 I think or four so yeah I'm gonna
be taking you guys along for a day of
finals with me it is 11:15 I'm walking
over
my bike was stolen it is a toasty 77
degrees out it's supposed to be 80 and
I'm planning on just staying on campus
until my other final at 4:30 because it
takes a little while to walk and I could
just study on campus
there's like two tears the shade yeah
these are this is our final food I think
there is oh this is your last final it's
so lucky so happy this is our final that
we've taken well we have to do like a
little reflection but look at this of
you we're on top of the Fertitta
building right now what you doing girl
that big do you guys want to be in it
you are this is our final you just
finished our finals I am now in a study
room and there is no one occupying any
of these sitting rooms which I'm kind of
surprised because there's still I think
one more day of finals this whole
building so empty but I have my final in
almost 4 less than 4 hours so I think
I'm just gonna study here ate a lot of
pizza so I don't have to like go
anywhere and get food feeling really
healthy so that's my update
for the file that I'm studying for I've
logged on my blog channel last time but
our professor like showed us a review of
the final in a review session but he
ended up putting the exact same
questions from the review in our midterm
so I was like midterm review in the
midterm and then just all of the
questions that we had already had on our
quizzes so there was like only five
questions of new questions that we had
never seen out of like 50 questions and
I'm pretty sure pretty sure he's gonna
do the same thing and if so I'm Way over
studying but if not that's why I'm
studying so yeah I actually don't be
like studying at all okay so I've just
finished my finals it was really just
weird
like he had some very like on topic
questions and then as I expected like
questions that he already gave us but
then he literally asked the weirdest
questions up for sure we're not in the
reading so confused but oh well
I think I took this a long way you can
go this way
this is my last time on campus because
I'm leaving tomorrow morning I feel like
I haven't spent that much time on campus
though like I've been spending a lot of
time I usually spent a lot of time
studying at the libraries but I haven't
been going to the libraries cuz I don't
know I just got back to my house it is
5:47 and I'm actually going to dinner at
like I said 6:15 maybe I'll I move it
back I was walking home and I was like
yeah 6:15 works so I need to get ready
for that
it's actually like a nicer place to so
like probably won't dress up still not
sure if I'm gonna vlog it so we'll see
but oh I could open my dope gift I'm so
tired
it was weird cuz one of my finals my
first final I literally didn't even have
to really go like you literally could
not have gone and he would not have
noticed cuz you just really didn't need
to be there so I kind of wish I just
slept in more but I didn't know that so
aim high old and I need to pack and then
I don't even know I feel like people are
doing stuff tonight so I might go out
but I'm actually just so tired I don't
know if I will my room's also a
who mess I don't know what I was gonna
say so we'll see if I get to cleaning it
okay mmm took a little while but I got
up um don't flog me don't day twelve I
am actually so tired I did not realize
how tired I would be today cuz I thought
I got enough sleep but I realize it's
because I got like no sleep the night
before I just realize my face is like my
room is trashed I got it made no
difference yeah
oh my god these are pants I love pants
they're really really oh my gosh this is
so nice I should have opened these
earlier for finals I was literally
living in my Lululemon pans that are
very similar to this I love these so
cozy they're just like really basic
sweatpants oh my gosh I could have lived
in these during my finals oh yeah I love
these I always like wear these when I'm
in the house like that's the first thing
that I do is I just change in like
comfortable pants but you know these are
not like the tire ones are not that
comfortable so like the loose ones are
definitely the way to go that is a great
gift thank you so much dote again if you
guys want $5 off like all of these
stores basically places I guarantee you
that you already shop at and click the
link below and then don't forget to
follow me because I'm making my lists
and I think they're kid stuff is that
I'm gonna muster up the energy to shower
now not shower okay hey guys okay so
it's 1253 now I just got back and
showered real fast and I'm accompanied
by a giant major pimple apparently now
on my face I'm exhausted I'm so tired
and my flight is that it leaves that
five I am I haven't packed still because
I pretty much just like went out
went to dinner right after my final so I
think I'm gonna take a nap for like one
and a half or two hours and then just
wake up and pack and try to make sure
that I have everything for the whole
break and then leave by like 3:30 and
just hope that it's not super busy I'm
sure it won't be it's 3:30 in the
morning I don't think that's a popular
flight time but just with finals ending
I don't think that like it'll make a
huge difference but I could see it being
like a factor that I'm just not
considering I guess that I am
considering but not taking like
seriously enough I don't know
I'm I'm just gonna leave at 3:30 but wow
it's been a long day not excited at all
to get up I know I'm gonna be exhausted
when I get up because I know I'm gonna
fall asleep within like five minutes so
sleep-deprived right now but hopefully
I'll be able to pack everything that I
need to tomorrow morning I'm going to
sleep now I hope you guys had a great
finals I'm so behind on blog with you
maybe I'll catch up on the airplane if
I'm not sleeping and I'll see you guys
in a few okay it is 3:13 and I found the
dope vlogmas four day eleven that I
thought I already did so I'm just gonna
open this both because I'm dumb and I
also am running out of space to pack so
I thought okay here are the packages
follow me and don't if you haven't
already also follow me for five dollars
off your first order since there's a
shopping mall online shopping mall app
Oh stores you guys like comment shop at
I know a lot of the stores ready so
that's it
Wow these are like tattoos they're all
arrows okay third like tattoos are
stickers of some sort I really I don't
know what they are honestly and I don't
really have time to figure it out but
that should be fun when I get back and
then this one's really heavy it's really
small this is for day eleven the one
that I thought I already open but didn't
and then look for it and then realize it
I had no no oh my gosh oh my god I'm so
excited about this yay I love fragrances
and this one is a eucalyptus spearmint
stress relief aromatherapy fragrance oh
my gosh I'm so excited to try this these
are the refills I don't exactly know I
guess I just like by the base of it yeah
I'm super excited okay well good thing I
didn't bring those talked because I'd
much rather have those here so thank you
guys so much I don't definitely go
follow me on the app if you haven't
already and what time is it now 3:15 I
think I've like packed everything but
I'm at that point where I'm like
actually it kind of always is like this
I always pack last-minute and it always
just seems to work out and if I didn't
pack something um usually it's fine I
just go without it I think I'm all good
that was actually a pretty fast pack I'm
surprised I'm so tired okay I got to the
airport in literally 15 minutes my lyft
driver was
I think that was like the fastest and
after her driven to the airport and my
flight it's Cory team now my flights at
5:30 so it departs at 5:30 for some
reason I really thought it was five and
I was like oh maybe I am cutting it
close
but I still have 42 minutes until abort
so I'm like really good on time
yeah it's or 18 I'm just gonna sit here
for a while on my flight board I think I
remembered everything though I like
thought of some things I thought I
forgot and I checked in my head them so
that's good
this is the gate and there's no one
there so I can't tell them just really
early or what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
