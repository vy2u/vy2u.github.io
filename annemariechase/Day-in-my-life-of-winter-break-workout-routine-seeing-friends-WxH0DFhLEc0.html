320 I said may 20 day 20 so today is
actually my last day in Anchorage that
went by so so so fast I think I spent a
week over a week here honestly that time
went by so fast I just slept a ton ate a
bunch exercise it was a good time but
today I think I'm doing some fun stuff
actually let me just take a moment my
first vlog at home I was like uh like no
one's really gonna want to watch this a
lot of you guys actually commented and
we're like where are your vlogs like we
want to see your blogs from home and
that really warmed my heart so I posted
that and then I got a ton of comments on
that I was not expecting that much
engagement because usually I don't know
when I'm just home doing like not much
it's like I just don't expect many
people to watch it but you guys were so
cute you guys were like talking about my
parents and you guys were wondering
where Callie is so Callie doesn't go to
college anymore she graduated last year
so she is a full-time job so she does
get vacation days but she is meeting us
later cuz she doesn't have as long of a
vacation but I will be spending the rest
of like Christmas and then up until the
new year and then till my birthday with
Callie so I think we're gonna go to
Hawaii and then she lives in Washington
DC we might go there or to New York for
New Year's because she has a lot of
friends there and so we might be able to
like find some rest day so I'm super
excited about that but you guys were
wondering where she was then she'll be
in my vlog starting tomorrow I've had a
really good time at home and I'm I just
cannot believe that I've already been
here for over a week that's insane I was
gonna be my vlog miss don't blog miss
gift funny story is they asked us where
we were gonna be and I told them I was
gonna be in LA in Anchorage and then
Hawaii and so they sent a package to
three different places and we just
called the hotel to see if they had the
Hawaii one and they don't so I don't
know where that is but
that's all right I feel like I'm worried
it's been spoiled with enough gifts they
were like yeah we don't have your
package we we would return it to the
sender if we don't or we don't know
recognize me I don't know so I don't
know where it is I haven't heard
anything okay so I think it's like one
of those rap necklaces that I definitely
don't know how to put on but it's kind
of cool I could wear it no except I
really just don't know how to put it on
that's cute
I like it I'm gonna figure out how to
how to wear it I'm gonna film right now
me opening this one for tomorrow's vlog
miss so we're gonna do that I got a lot
of Mac stuff Mac pepper and prime I was
literally gonna buy this so yeah we're
gonna do this right now
thank you dote for this Mac from prime
this and also the strobe cream I'm
actually wearing it right now we're both
things a dozen to buy it myself so thank
you so much to dote it's just like you

you but I really appreciate it this is
just like so thoughtful and so nice and
how much love to note oh if you have not

of like do it however you want you know
make it short or long yeah but then what
do you do with those things I look like
too much of a diva with this well take
it off for now but it's cute I like it
this is downtown Anchorage real good
stuff
this is what the roads look like when
they don't plow them properly
that's Fifth Avenue um
a hotel that's the courthouse some
people asked me to show that what the
city looks like or the town this is what
it looks like it's much prettier when it
snows so it's really pretty now
Sandton lighter yeah and brighter this
is a really cute street right here yeah
they have little fishies so the fun
little road the bike down because you
don't have to do anything it's not fun
to bag up though it's not that bad
though you know you always think it's
gonna be fun
it's not hahaha cuz I got that trade one
of my good friends used to live around
this area so I've spent a weirdly large
amount of time down here it's like a
train
what is this called mode you call it
it's like it's kind of what you call it
but to call it
it's dustry old yeah just real it's like
the railroad is here it's not even
downtown though it's just like oh yeah
but there's not much down here except
the railroad and then there's a loofa
yeah there's a new glue factory
the railroad and then there's a little
what does that called this little thing
that's for you
so the port yeah there's a port down
there this is a cute little bridge with
some body fish yeah you can fish their
ship quick Oh Creek that's what it was
called I was like it's not a river
really good descriptions here there it's
if you go to the down to the port it
doesn't really look like you can go
there but you can and it's a really nice
view of the ocean
but you always feel weird go in there
