hey just wanna see what you were doing
you do time right now it's private just
me and the mic yeah yeah really good you
know
hey guys it's Amory and today as you
guys can tell them the title I'm gonna
be doing a day in the life of my
internship a lot of people always ask me
like what I'm doing for the summer it's
really hard to explain what you're doing
in your internship so I'm really excited
to show you guys basically every single
thing that you guys would ever want to
know about what I'm doing at my
internship this summer so the company
that I work for is genius brands
international I'll call it an
entertainment company but they also do a
lot more for my job I just have to know
about like the digital aspect of it so
it's like content the thing that really
attracted me to apply there was their
company motto which is creating content
with a purpose I on my channel
really stand by that motto when I think
of a video and when I post a video if
it's not serving some purpose that
stands behind like what I want this
channel to do I just won't post it so
that strongly spoke to me and it's just
a really really cool team and
environment and the CEO of the company
was a producer for like Inspector Gadget
and strawberry shortcake and just he has
like a huge list of movies that he has
produced so yeah it's a really awesome
company but that is not really what I'm
gonna have the focus of this video
beyond the focus is going to be about me
and what I do in that company and the
big project that we're working on as
interns is space pop which is their new
web series on YouTube that just launched
last month so space pop is about five
princesses from outer space who have to
flee their home planets because of an
evil Empress named Kela fat Eclair
myself your new all-powerful
and these princesses all get together
and try to think of ways to you know
regain their planets and along the way
they form a band called space pop we
in order to spread messages of female
empowerment start something big yeah
basically just all good messages so
that's what's face off it's about and we
actually launched last month go
subscribe to space pop and say hi to me
and I will reply to every single one of
you and be sure to like the videos as
well and subscribe to the channel for
more videos from me and just web series
and I will tell you that the music for
space pop like it's really good and it
will get stuck in your head if you
listen to like one's once it's just
bound to happen
it is constantly stuck in my head so
that is basically what space pop is and
now I'm going to go through a typical
day in my life as an intern so I usually
start my day around 7:00 a.m. and then I
make sure to leave my apartment by 8:00
in order to make it to work on time
because I lived in South Central LA and
my internship is in Beverly Hills which
is super super super nice no complaints
there everything is beautiful this is
like the type of LA that you see like in
the movies the zip code for my work is
literally nine oh two one oh very very
nice area but LA traffic is real take me
like 40 minutes - sometimes like longer
in order to just get like seven miles
it's amazing oh yeah so I walk in the
door and luckily me company attire is
pretty casual so I can feel pretty
comfortable just wearing like jeans and
no one judges me there so as soon as you
turn the corner you have the perfect
view of the intern corner or intern row
which we call intern row this is Parker
hey he is actually the only guy intern
working this summer and then this is
Kathryn or Kathryn as many of you guys
probably know she also has YouTube
channel and she also works with me at
genius brands on space pop and we both
make videos for the channel but usually
it there
are for space pop interns we're all
girls and then there's Parker we were
able to kind of brainstorm with each
other and collaborate and bounce ideas
off of each other and kind of just like
support each other so we're having like
technical difficulties I didn't like
that and it's actually really fun this
way because one of my favorite things
about working here is the amount of
collaboration and just social
interaction that I have with all the
other interns and I definitely come up
with video ideas or just ideas in
general for things that I definitely
would not have come up with on my own so
I really really really love that aspect
of my internship and then from there my
job and actually Catherine's job too is
basically to just make any of the videos
that's on the YouTube channel that are
not the webisodes
so I basically spend my entire day
either editing recording voiceovers
testing testing testing planning
brainstorming okay let's talk videos all
right I'm seeing maybe a vegan when I
eat in a day does mukbang so popular and
potentially pencil in a Kylie Jenner lip
kit review summer essentials summer
essentials what to do in your board in
the summer what to do in the summer time
what you're going wrong in the summer
what to do in the winter before the
summer of the winter most of the time my
internship is spent just editing on my
middle computer I feel like a lot of
people don't see what goes on into
editing a video you just see the final
product but there's so so much more that
goes on in editing a video and I will
show you right now this is the musically
tutorial kind of campaign thing that I
did so as you can see there are a lot of
layers and that just means that for
example like this footage is just like a
camera so that's like the main layer but
since I'm creating this video basically
from scratch everything that you see on
the screen has to be envisioned and then
you have to put it there you have to
visualize what you want to create before
you create it because it's not just like
me talking to a camera you have to
provide all the
files that will be on screen so these
these layers can get huge they can get
so so confusing and big it's basically
like a big puzzle but it all fits like
really really tight and then if you have
to make a change one little change will
affect all of the rest of the big
picture so it's really hard but it's
actually very rewarding when you like
finish a video because you know that you
literally have created the entire vision
that you put together from start to
finish some of the videos I've done so
far in this summer my first video was a
summer essentials video where I discuss
all the princesses summer essentials
Katherine's in a really really fun video
that I really like the editing on and
that would be an emoji quiz and you guys
can take the quiz after you watch the
webisodes a few times because this is a
little hard if you haven't watched any
of them so I think I showed you and told
you pretty much all about my internship
my summer internship at genius brands
with space pop if you guys can do me a
huge favor go on all or any of the space
pop videos I they'll be linked below and
comment hi just feel like a Marie and
subscribe to their channel for more
videos from me from Katherine and just
from space pop you also might see some
other youtubers talking about space pop
you out the summer and then you can come
back here or on the channel and be like

snapchat I've been snap chatting a lot
