even know what vlogmas date is some are
you behind welcome to vlogmas day seven
hopefully I'll catch up on the day's
soon I literally just woke up and uh I
don't know last last night I said I was
gonna get up at like five definitely
just turn off all my alarms but it's
8:30
I feel really well rested and I think
I'm just gonna probably get up and make
a coffee and then um finish the rest of
my essay and then turn it in so judge
rule hey this is my view right now got
the window with the Sun coming in and
it's so bright in my room I don't know
where you guys are from but I grew up in
Anchorage and so all of my middle school
in high school days it was so hard for
me to get up cuz I don't usually have a
problem like I know some people really
really have a problem getting up early
and sometimes I do from really tired but
in Anchorage I would get up and it would
be so cold which made it even harder and
it was so dark so just felt like you
were the only one up in the world and
while it's like cozy sometimes it's just
so much easier to get up when it's sunny
and so I mean granted there are
definitely days or it's like really
bright and sunny outside and I'll still
stay in bed but it's just so much nicer
to like get up when it's actually bright
outside I feel like I already like woke
up in a good mood
usually I'm only good so much to do I
think it's cuz I'm just excited that I
I'm like pretty much done with my finals
for now and then I'm going to yoga I've
never been more excited to go like a
young class this class is just so good
and I just know I'll get a good workout
Oh looking good I'm gonna get up now
it's so bright up good morning well it
is sunny
Tasha got this mug for don't blog miss
and we all share mugs and it's not
focusing but that's what I'm using today
it's so cute and pretty so I really
really do not make that much money off
of YouTube views but YouTube always
Flags my videos as inappropriate or not
suitable for most advertisers and it is
so annoying I'm sure you guys have been
hearing this and I've been complaining
about it a ton it's just so incredibly
annoying because it's like the most
benign content it's like so PG and when
YouTube like Flags your video they don't
pay you for what you would have made
even though my mind's not a lot it's
like it's in the few thousands of views
not dollars but they still don't pay you
that just doesn't make sense to me cuz
it's their mistake for flagging it
wrongfully and I think that they should
like compensate for that but it just
gets really confusing with Adsense cuz
like it's different all the time but I'm
sure they could find a way to figure out
how much they owe you
but yeah it's super super annoying and
Tasha's videos just started getting
flagged and she was so frustrated and I
was like homie this is what I've been
telling you for like the last few months
like this happens to me every time I
upload a video so yeah YouTube it's
nine-thirty I just submitted my essay
and I'm so excited I think I'm going to
get ready real fast and I want to try to
get electrolytes cuz the one time that I
had so much energy and was not dying
I drank of my whole bottle of water and
I remember my mom gave me like a little
packet of like electrolytes and so I
think that might help a lot I'm excited
for today I actually got a ton of sleep
I'm in a good mood I'm vlogging this
will be probably my first vlog where I
actually like go out into the real world
yesterday when we were getting food I
was like I think this is the first time
that I've actually gone outside of the
house to do something other than like
class to take my final and like a few
days
yeah
there's a big recycling thing behind our
house and it's like a little sketchy and
like kind of awkward to walk to but I
just feel like no one recycles enough
and especially if it's like available
like why not so I'm just taking like all
of the boxes from our house right now
I'm just putting them in the recycling
carrying over from the trash to
recycling
my god
it is 2:22 now I don't really remember
what I lost logged but in the time that
I haven't seen you guys I pretty much
just showered and then hung out so I
think me and Tasha are gonna go downtown
to this cute coffee shop that she's been
telling me about for so long so she's
been waiting for me for like 20 minutes
like over the time I said that I was
gonna be ready I'm sorry Tasha if you're
watching this someone also asked me if I
watched Tasha's vlogs or if we watch
each other's logs and I feel like we do
sometimes but not all the time guy see a
lot of her filming and just I live with
her so it's like I watch people that I
don't really know cuz it feels like I'm
like catching up with them but I
definitely do watch her like when I
don't see her or if I'm just curious
like what she's up to but I usually see
her everyday so that's kind of what goes
on in my head I don't know how she
decides to watch videos but today is
vlogmas day 7 and i'm so excited to open
my daily gift Tasha she always wants to
watch me open my gift it's so funny okay
I was a woman gonna be on white oh
that's so you know I think I got in my
favorite or I had like the cactus one my
favorites yeah yeah that's adorable

it's 5:30 and my freezer sucks it just
decides to like randomly stopped
freezing so all of our food gets like
unfrozen and then frozen again so this
is what I'm dealing with I should
probably have water Tasha just went to
go get a burger and then we're going to
film us putting up the Christmas tree
because I have one and I haven't put it
up yet and it's real fun and festive so
that's what we're gonna do and here are
what my eyebrows look like I absolutely
love the place that I go to you guys
always ask me well I can put her in here
it's called rubra Rupa's brow bar or
brow lounge
I always forget how was your guys's
smiles going I'm honestly kind of
chillin until like the next crunch time
comes and I have to start studying but
I'm just gonna take my time studying
very slowly I have so much time to study
for my next finals and then I'm going
home on Tuesday or actually Wednesday I
guess really early in the morning I'm
excited like I'm super excited at home
hello I we're putting up our Christmas
tree and Tasha was really like wondering
like where is this Christmas tree gonna
go and I was doing the dishes and she's
like how big is it I was like it's like
this big and I meant like cuz I was like
it's small it's only like this big and
so I was like and she thought I mean
like the whole stand and then I mean
they both were like yeah that means the
whole stand but I was like no I said it
so whatever so they're lovely surprised
now I have to be same cream purple I was
like this is a really put like small
small tree yeah you were like you should
put our presents under and I was like oh
maybe
oh here the for the batteries dog juice
makes a good stand for it
yeah let's keep it there Tasha what are
you doing Christmas presents that's
bigger than you you should wear this
outfit to the airport it'd be like the
perfect mirror outfit okay guys we have
an atrocity
not really don't take me seriously so we
both went to Target yesterday that's
probably my last vlog miss and we both
got mac and cheese and I was making my
mac and cheese cuz I was gonna go to
sleep well it's eight o'clock so I have
to stay asleep away and sounds like I'll
just make back in cheese and I went to
Target today to get my electrolytes and
I passed by this shelf because it was a
dollar when we went and it was 60
something says I mean I got 70 cents and
I was like that is so cheap like why did
it drop in price even more and it's
because they're expired so I was making
this expired December 2nd so they fully
knew that they were expired because they
just marked the price down that's crazy
and we're appalled because like how long
does it take for this to expire this is
probably like a year old Maddox acted by
Dave it doesn't even matter but this is
illegal and we could rightly sue that
let's sue them did I eat it yeah I was
just gonna eat it anyways but she's like
we should go get a new box no we
shouldn't still down to eat it no I
don't I back actually probably doesn't
expire it yours
cuz I'm sure it's so good cuz like they
have to be really careful when they're
putting like expiration dates on to make
it in advance just in case people yeah
oh I get that yeah I need it I guess
yeah but I'm still appalled that they
are we're actively selling it
my fended target I forgot to end this
vlog but thank you all so much for
watching I love you guys so much and
don't forget to follow me on Instagram
because I am about I'm like two
followers away from 10k and it'll
probably go down so go follow me love
