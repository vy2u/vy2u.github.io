this is my first whole day in Alaska but
I got here yesterday at 1:00 I was
exhausted because I only got like an
hour half of sleep and before that I had
finals I had not gotten a lot of sleep
then either and so I think I slept 12
hours we're going to snow city cafe
it's one of my favorite restaurants to
eat breakfast because I used to like lob
breakfast foods still do but I don't
know the obsession is not as big anymore
but I will bring you guys along mama say
hi to my blog we just wear our jackets
around in here because it's so cold just
kidding just put mine on
I like how to can't believe how cold it
is all the time it's not that bad yeah
it's not bad for now yeah last I think
last year was like in the teens or like
in the single digits yeah and this year
it's like 40 a heart attack on a plate
hashbrowns
the I didn't know
yeah they shoot on my bacon bits I ask
for the on the side basket sriracha
I've never tried that yeah it's pretty
good I will try it
we have a yummy burrito

like I think cut it in half
we try it do you like it this is also a
half work
my mom is so cute she got my kale chips
and all of I don't know if this is all
for me pretty sure it is mmm adorable
it is now my pickle looks so big
what time is 3:30 I'm really tired and
really full but I think I'm gonna try to
put the ornaments on the tree so do a
little time work
work without eyeballs did they always
not have eyeballs they're really super
old
I'm done I only put ornaments on the
front of the tree because you can't see
the back anyways I'll show you guys up
close got the little fire so toasty
these ones are funny really try that
hard x-ray space I feel like our
ornaments are really ugly do you guys
have pretty ornaments but all much or
are your guys is kind of ugly - it's
like an ugly Christmas tree party or a
contest okay well it's not focusing but
you go like what is this you're number
one in my book okay
so random

oh these ones are really funny good
morning everyone I would say welcome to
vlogmas day 18 but I haven't really
posted I was planning on continuing
vlogmas when i got home but honestly i
haven't really been doing much all I've
been doing is sleeping a ton eating a
ton and then also exercising so that's
pretty much literally all I've been
doing I haven't even seen anyone here
yet today we are supposed to go
snowboarding don't bring slush skiing
you're getting ready to go in the road
to like Alyeska is closed because of
mudslides or like probably snow slides
rock slides I don't know so that's
pretty terrifying because that road is
beautiful but very dangerous so I guess
I'm glad it's closed because I don't
want anyone getting hurt but yeah I
haven't been vlogging for vlogmas and a
few of you have mentioned like are you
gonna vlog while you're at home like I
want to see these vlogs so even though I
probably won't be doing much I thought I
would vlog anyways just for those of you
who wanted to see it so thanks for
leaving those comments if you did I
don't really know what our plans are
today now that we're not going skiing /
snowboarding I want to go shopping
because Alaska has or Anchorage has no
sales tax and so I've already done some
shopping but I want to do some more
shopping just because it's probably
cheapest here okay so we're getting
ready to leave to go to lunch with some
family friends that I haven't seen a
little while so I'm excited but I
thought I would show you guys what it
looks like outside first and then show
you guys the dope Walkmans gifts that
I've gotten for the past few days
because I haven't shed those anywhere
but first of all lookit this is what it
looks like outside and there's still it
still hasn't snowed it just looks
freezing cold okay onwards to the dope
vlogmas gifts that I've gotten

day that I kind of stop vlogging this
