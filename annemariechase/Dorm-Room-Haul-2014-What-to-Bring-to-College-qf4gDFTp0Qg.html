hotel room in California because I have
move in tomorrow so I decided to dorm
room hall because everyone's been
requesting it since I did on to my
sister last year she's actually the
cameraman right now um so yeah I'm just
gonna film this real fast so the two
places that we shopped at we're
basically just Target and Bed Bath and
Beyond the first thing that I have is
really heavy this actually broke my hair
in the car because it like hit up
against it after a little bump so this
is um a 9 cube organizer and I've seen
this like in places like an Ikea before
I just really wanted one so this is
super heavy I'm not sure if this will
actually fit my dorm so I might be
returning it but I got from Target and
then I also I think it's like the cutest
way to have a storage system and also
I'll be using it for the next 4 years so
you know a little bit more expensive I
thought it was a good investment
oh here was one of the fabric drawers
that came with it these are like 10
dollars each or something so I got one
so I'm going to like try to find some
cheaper ones on Amazon but I think these
are really really cute to put inside a
little organizer and then also from
Target we just got some Clorox wipes
some q-tips literally some parchment
paper I think that's from mom right
um I have some cotton balls and then I
have I bought acetone it is I got a
loofah I got some why would you put on
the floor I got some bleach and I also
have a bike lock because everyone at USD
apparently bikes so I brought my bike
like via airplane so I just got a bike
lock for it well what other video would
you use biking what he said via airplane
it's all like you owed your bike dad oh
yeah UPS ok
um I bought some coffee filters for the
coffee machine that I'll show you that I
got for that's not from Target I got
some tad ultra whoa really no muscle
whatsoever so Callie just looked up on
Consumer Reports and she said that tad
plus ultra stain release is the best
like number one laundry detergent yeah
so yeah so we just got that from Target
peers in the acetone that I found also
from Target for nails and stuff I got
some bleach for white clothes and maybe
cleaning but probably not I also have a
step wastebasket being my roommate
decided to just make our room seemed
like really colorful so I have like
blues and Pink's and stuff because those
are my favorite colors um so I have a
duvet this is actually a comforter this
is like the warmest or like the coolest
ones there's more warmer and warmest and
I got this from Target for like $25 is
really cheap I got that because I bought
a duvet cover for Harmon Outfitters this
long was like was more than my comforter
was like 60 or 59 or something here's
what it looks like I got a queen size
one because I don't know I was going to
get the extra long twin size one but I
want it to be like cozy and have my do
they hang over the edge so that I could
store stuff under so hopefully I
actually do have it like low enough to
store and have it hanging over so that
if I do want to it can cover all the
storage underneath my bed okay and
lastly from Target I got this what it
like or ottoman ottoman um yeah
storage Ottoman so there this is cool
because you can store stuff in here oh
here's my receipt
and you can also store stuff inside I
just put my duvet covering and you can
also sit on it so it's really
multifunctional and they had really
really pretty colors I really liked this
tonight blue one and I think it'll go
well with my like no theme color room
and a lot of colleges you're able to
raise your bed so if that's too high for
you you can use this isn't stuff I think
that's a called--it engine yeah I'm
gonna move my boat down oh you did yeah
I don't look at all
so do they cover like flying over the
edge of the sky dia conquer yes most of
the other stuff is just from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond I will start with my favorite
purchase I just like flipped on this and
rolled all over it in the car to dick's
it's so comfortable I'm definitely gonna
take this on like car road road trips
car vouchers cameras a drooler like
didn't happen until this year don't know
what's going on but this was they had a
ton of different colors even had like
USD colors and they pretty much have
these everywhere so you can get them at
like Target or but about me island or
whatever I got this mr. coffee maker
this was 1498 because it was returned
but we went to Target we saw the exact
same on for $15 didn't we it might have
been like a different one but I'm pretty
sure it was full with different one yeah
maybe it's originally $30 but I am
definitely a coffee addict so I will
definitely need a coffee maker I got
this three-tier stacker stackable hood
shoe rack it holds nine pairs of shoes I
don't have that many shoes so let's be
perfect for me
it looks like this so you can put three
three three and then sandals or small
shoes on the bottom for a pillow I just
got one and I got this claritin premium
out anti allergen pillow mostly it was
just because we were like gone through
at Bed Bath me on like feeling the
pillow hardness and I like this on the
best like I didn't really care about the
allergen anti allergen stuff about it
but this one was like super cozy and
I've actually never had a new pillow
like all my pillows have been like years
and years old like probably decades old
so I'm really sad
that's so good if you think about it
like are you like you've had that like
I've had the same pillows for so long
yeah and you're like yeah okay okay so
you can't be rattling over there you can
hear it on camera sorry for hangers I
got these real simple solutions fifty
like pink hangers I might get really I
don't know I want to pink because I
thought it would be cute like for my
colorful themed room but I might like
get sick of them I'm not sure can I got
black last year you like the black
though don't you yeah I just have two
more bags then I'm going to go through
real fast
Oh ffff eons they were like giving you
snacks and water and like thank-you gift
so I'm gonna call this okay so in this
bag they give you four command strips
woo this smells so good um - oh these
are actually like really nice shampoos
to to shampoos Pantene and Herbal
Essences essences one Herbal Essences
suits body wash and then what is this Oh
another shampoo oh this one's a
conditioner okay and they also give you
a press 3d white like mini tooth paste
so that's what's in that bag then in my
bag I got a pop-up to compartment sorter
um Callie said that then I should get
this one because you divide like your
darks and your whites so this does that
really easily yeah so you can know when
you need to do a whites oh yeah oh
they're all mixed up them all on the
same thing like you don't know which one
you have to do mhm yeah oh these have a
little like pockets too so you can store
like some extra things in there and then
next thing that I got yeah so I got the
pure beach drinking it Twix
long sheet set these I got this I got
two of them actually yeah I got great
and then I got white I was told to get
two because if you're doing laundry you
want to have one in the laundry and then
one you have about like a fresh pair of
sheets is it pair um so I got like gray
because my ID Bay cover is great
then from Bed Bath and Beyond I have a
towel I also have another towel and I
have real simple solutions slim line
scarf fingers to match my pink actual
hangers and I also have the hanger clips
so that if you want to like hang up
pants or like skirts or something you
can do that so let's all go together and
they all match and that's cute and then
from Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond this is like
terrible packaging someone like rip this
open this was on sale for $15 and it's
just the Yankee Candle Beachwalk we were
not allowed to have candles and my
sister told me that I could do it
anyways and just like break the rule but
I'm like too scared to for like the
first semester so until I know for sure
that I can like get away with having
candles I'm just going to use this reed
diffuser also I met Batman they had like
a bun they had pretty much everything so
we also picked up a razor and my mom
really likes the boy once if she told me
to get the boy ones so I got the
Gillette matched three turbo and then I
also got the rasilla bull pack so there
are eight more of like the blades since
I let me California now I decided that I
should probably get some sunscreen so I
grabbed this L'Oreal Paris 30 SPF one I
don't know what I was reading and I
thought I would give that a try and I
also got this Neutrogena deep clean
invigorating facial scrub I use this
like all the time at home but I just
didn't bring mine coz mine had a hole in
the top for shampoo and conditioner I
got the Pantene smooth and sleek shampoo
and conditioner
I got a bigger shampoo station he's more
shampoo and conditioner this is so weird
how I got this all of it Bethany on like
you would not think that you would go
there to get like beauty supplies but
I forgot it's a tent it's a tan I also
got some it's a 10 miracle leave-in
product and this is so I can protect my
hair if I curl it or straighten it and
it's gonna pretty long so I should like
really start using that sometimes I just
don't I just like forget um and I also
got some act anti cavity fluoride let's
