Callie and this is actually the last
video that she will be in for a while
baby was Uncle Buck yeah she's going to
college and I am still in I'm not going
anywhere you're go back home yeah you're
going to college I guess not before we
are very cool Asian whatever so right
now we're in our brother's dorm room
because he is an RA because Kyle hasn't
moved into her dorm yet we move in
tomorrow yeah so he is a residential
advisor so he moved in like a week ago
or so and he's like he's the person who
helps everyone yeah out almost realize
doing training and stuff so he likes
moved in he gets a huge room I compare
them what else that's free and he gets
like food on top of that no stuff so
yeah good perks but so that's why we're
in this room this is actually his dorm
um not too exciting yet cuz I'm at Savoy
yeah but we are going to be doing a dorm
hall for Callie's dorm what do we have
like specific things that we thought are
more helpful than like the average shelf
yeah so we're gonna be sharing guys that
and then of course she has more stuff
but we're not going to show you like the
really boring stuff
Callie made an entire checklist of all
the important things that she needed to
get um while we were shopping around for
hours and hours she checked off every
single thing that she got like literally
everything everything so that'll all be
in the downbar so if any of you guys are
going to college or dorm shopping right
now then you guys can go and check that
list out and see if you forgot anything
or if you wanted to add anything to your
own list I would have like food in there
too yeah so thank you to Callie yeah and
they'll be helpful for like me when I go
to college next year actually made it
for you yeah
not for you guys but so we're going to
get started now we divided it all into
sections so we have like kitchen first
and then we have bathroom
yeah madam and why Jane and then dorm
and organization okay let's get started
my am the source we went to were IKEA
that Bed Bath and Beyond and Target and
we'll try to remember to tell you what
we got from where and if we knew the
price for those one of them have the
prices on them but I don't know and I
went shopping with them the entire time
I was there for every single trooper
purchase so I can haul this too
okay so this is the first thing that not
the first thing that you got the person
that we're hauling oh it's a personal
blender that comes attached it's like a
travel sized cup and like this is will
help you stay off the freshman 15
because you can make smoothies out of it
and protein shake yeah and veggie shakes
the unique think of a thing about this
that she mentioned but not that much is
that this is actually a cup so like when
you're done blending you can just take
it to go which is cool this was $20 at
Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond note 15 okay and it
was a target target okay hello summer
Miller said that this was really
important to get because he's been here
for like two years now Oh Britta you
just said it's really important to drink
water and Cally's in Georgia right now
and it's much hotter than Anchorage yeah
I'll just don't drink enough water in
general and like on top of that we're
living in a really
climate she Gaga's purple one yeah and
this is actually on sale it was buy one
get one half off any Britta on the shelf
so target has the same cells everywhere
that's what I miss um so you guys are
looking for a Britta she got one of the
Dexter got one eye brother and then she
just got these filters because one of
the goals that she had during this
shopping trip was to eliminate trips to
the store yeah because she doesn't have
a car
she doesn't really have a way of getting
around except for a buzz corner maybe
friends if she makes any so we just try
to get her as um what's it called smells
yeah yeah okay so the next thing I got
was some dish soap and I picked this one
out because it's method and method is
really good brand because it's like
biodegradable like healthy and stuff
yeah and it is also pink grapefruit
flavor
I mean scented so that was pretty
exciting so for the dishes I also got
some sponges and I got these really cute
dry cloths and they comes in a packet
too when they're really pretty and
they're actually not so the next thing
that she got was this um baking soda is
to clean things with yeah but baking
soda is like essential for everyone
while shooting because it you like
literally clean anything with it and
natural cleaning for your whole kitchen
yeah and also um Colin's like carry a
lot of water balls around and if your
water bill or smells gross you just want
to bring a few carry a water bottle and
you start to smell bad just put a
teaspoon of baking soda in it and then
some water and then microwave it for
like 10 seconds and it'll take away the
smell yeah and then we got this it's a
paddle from Ikea nose yeah it was Mike
yeah it's just a cutting board for
battle yeah I thought this is a really
good idea because I want to keep on
eating vegetables and fruits
want even though I
a limited meal plan so this is helpful
and go along with it I got a knife
you just got a few utensils or one set
of utensils and a plate in a bowl and I
so I got these the deeper tools
separately at Bed Bath and Beyond so I
got the just one set and then she got
these at IKEA
yeah they have so many really pretty
plates and cups and bowls and everything
in IKEA and they're all really really
cheap so I just picked out like one kind
of each these are glass so those are
nice yeah and then this is when actually
talking about it has a sleeve over it
and so $6 at that that's beyond me and
then I picked this up for her
they're people of all but um so this is
from Ikea and Kallie super Indyk my
mom's homemade granola and wooden free
it was just like rolling around in our
trunk in a bag so she has this to put
her cereal or gonna love it's a good
idea to keep your NOLA because if you
ever all go and you're like agree it's
so good I think I might do like a recipe
for that guy channel because it's really
good if my mom wants to okay so that's
it for kitchen stuff we're gonna move to
bathroom and hygiene stuff I have a
suite which has like one shower for four
girls but are you talking like this what
you're like basically required okay so
basically I was sweet for four girls and
so we all share a bathroom but I want to
keep my stuff separate so a silicone
shower caddy um so yeah this is really
helpful for like anyone who's going to
college yeah it individualizes your
stuff so if you don't want to share your
like expensive shampoo and you have to
like go across the hall to like get the
shower oh I'll just go to the show okay
so the next thing we got was exfoliating
gloves I didn't get it it's hers so I
mean once a week just use these here
you'd be surprised at how gross your
skin gets like if you ever go on a
shower and then start like rubbing like
your neck or something it's like
it's open you should try it disgusting
so we also go out these new cubbies
uh-huh I also got these Turbie twist
hair towels and these are really cool
cuz it comes with two so we can be
watching one and using the other one
that's which and it's less damaging its
microfibers so it's less damaging and it
helps your hair drive quicker than a
regular towel and like stays in place
because it has this little like you loop
it around a bit of button yeah I'm
trying to intercept to this for Anjali
so also to eliminate trips head to the
market um okay in the market to the
sundry so like on dream good - so I got
some dish soap and a packet of refills
yeah this is really yeah this is so cool
this is that I can refill your method
soap up to three times this whole thing
can be refilled three times but she got
like different flavors or cents or
whatever they're called so that's weird
well I just we got our own if you
consider one two mandarin mango so yeah
I thought that was really cool and this
stuff smells really good they have the
peppermint kind during the holidays and
I literally just like smell it all day
do you remember that someone was like oh
here's just a bunch of other random
miscellaneous things that are
necessities that you have your pads and
just like cotton balls and facials strip
waxes and toothpaste and yeah okay I
give these razors yeah um did you put
these in the list below yeah these are
all the list below so check that out
and so we're done with this box so next
we have my dorm room stuff like dorm
living decor or dorm living
so we got a go mini steamer because this
is way easier than
like a ironing board and iron and in
order to keep it till I go meet what's
it called laundromat yeah no that's not
the dry cleaners yeah um so this was
tiny dollars at Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond and
Dexter actually it was really happy that
we got him one too so these are nice for
girls and boys with nice clothes next I
got a little sewing kit because you
never know and like things are gonna
like I was saying yeah I have the same
key at home but I'll take a like take
that so this will be pretty handy anyone
um for to decorate my walls you should
get a flag from your state yeah it's a
really good idea especially for Alaska
but I forgot to do that well actually
some pugs are like really ugly
that's true but like especially I think
you're a figure moving like two states
over it's not a big deal but like moving
from acreage to also Lawson's just have
like a lot of Alaska right yeah so far
my wall decorations
I got a clipboard and I didn't want to
get those big kinds because then you
have to like throw it away afterwards so
I thought these rolls are perfect
because you can make like a square for
Adam of it it looks pretty cute and then
they got some I'm going to use some
command ships but those up command ships
are really helpful especially if you
can't use on pushpins yeah in the dorms
some dorms don't allow you to like D
face their walls yeah but we can use
pushpins I also got some push pins but
I'm kind of just use these strike work
boards um so I'm ready to do a picture
collage for the other side of my wall
and so I went to my Kia and they have a
ton of really cheap picture frames and I
got them and all different kinds oh so
like Jesper dial and how much for these
you're like two dollars each okay and I
got like a pack of four for a pop of
color so I'm playing with all these all
up but just most cherished memories you
also have kind of like a aqua
going on in your yeah top of aqua yeah
yeah it's great and like a popobawa
yeah basically which is comfortable so
what I got next to where these um
hangers and they're slimline so you can
like stack more and a smaller space so
that's pretty cool but also I wanted to
transfer from like the plastic hangers
to the felt ones because they look
neater and they also like your cloak or
keep your clothes from slipping off yeah
so it's they also the plastic ones break
really easily like if I pull them off
real fast I'm in a rush they'll break
um yeah and she also got these ones from
the same brand real simple these were
ten dollars so this is like a scarf
hanger so they're Kim oh 2ds you just
hang your scars off these you also hang
your belts on this thing
that's pretty cool and the other one
came a Dickey just real simple slimline
hangers okay so my bedding is from I got
a duvet and a comforter and they're from
Urban Outfitters and I also got matching
shams and I think that tea days are like
a really cool idea because if you can
just buy one comforter and use it for
all four years but for duvets you if you
get sick of it you can switch them out I
made sure to get a great one though I
mean it's like a really pretty design
but it's just plain grey so it'll
basically match whatever come you know
might have and she gets sick of things
great easily um also I got plain white
sheets because they're the easiest to
clean and imagine everything yeah they
match with everything Ken and the people
have been Bethany on told us to get two
sets so you can like while you're
washing one you can use another set and
I thought that was like pretty smart so
that's what I'm doing
so the next thing about were these boxes
and they come in like three different
sizes and yeah they go into yeah they're
from Ikea and they're like it was like
$7.99 and they go into your drawer so
you can organize your socks and
underwear and like some suits and stuff
and so I thought well so please why idea
and I was always $7.99 do you feel like
think about it you're like organizing
and organized your drawer because you
separate you're like under where's well
we talked about this in biology yeah he
said that I thought of sexual it's
really this you just have a commercially
rule I think so but I literally thought
of that one more time we have the same
biology teachers or had the same file if
you shoot your freshman year
okay this likes my favorite this little
what do you call is like a Fisher lounge
couch allow thing okay these things are
so handy we took Chloe's for quite a
while because she left hers and our car
oh you're s be spending a lot of time
like saying your bed look like what
you're not well space yeah and I have a
pocket on society's in my group yeah wow
that's so cool thank you look yeah those
are perfect mmm is you will bring it
with a car for car rides car trips last
evening I'm gonna show you is my shoe
rack this was from Bethany on and it was
like 30 bucks
and basically you plant delicious on
there
like a picture there's like a picture
what it looks like this does that it's
three-tier and it only holds nine pairs
of shoes but we think it holds more
especially if you have like sandals yeah
like these shoes are like oh we actually
have a lot more things to buy
yeah and gi-give bought IKEA is a good
place to shop for college because it's
like cheap and it's not like perfectly
well made but it's perfect for college
like you're not going to keep it for the
rest of your life yeah
also it's um they have a lot of really
good organization stuff there and like
we went to the Container Store and
everything was so expensive
yeah gonna get anything we do like so
yellow target but about me on IKEA good
places to go
probably well Marty we just didn't go
there is yeah alright guys I hope this
was helpful for some of you going to
college or at least it make you excited
about college yeah whether you're a
junior senior going to college or
further than that and yeah that's
whatever we be good called whenever we
want
yeah then I forget to refer back to this
