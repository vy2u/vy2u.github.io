with a special guest this is Callie this
is my sister she's been in a few of my
previous videos but today we have a
video full of tips to save money for a
problem Kalyn actually went to problem
last year so she knows what it's like to
spend money on prom and a lot of our
friends are spending a ton of money on
prom home last year was great but in
preparation I spent so much money I got
my toenails done my finger nose done
like everything possible done because I
thought that's what happens but really I
have to be that way yeah I realized that
you could easily look just as good
without spreading all this money so we
have tips on how to save money but not
look like you're saving money at all so
the first tip that we have is nails so
basically here everyone always goes out
and gets those like long manicures like
the acrylics or something and we're just
manicures they cost at least 35 dollars
and then you have to give a tip to so
they cost so expensive and you could
easily just do your own nails and it'll
look just as good but most people suck
at nails so what we did this year is we
got the Sally Hansen instant gel strips
because you would just like put them on
and it's so unique because they're just
different patterns and show mirrors so
basically they're really easy to put on
it especially it's really really bad
applying nails and you can just have a
friend do it cuz that would make it
easier but um personally I'm already
good at nails so I'm gonna paint am
resales
yeah and to do by all and I just use
because I'm not good at nails yeah
and for toe nails you really only have
to paint like if you're wearing um open
toe here got my shoes heels we have the
same shoes except in different colors
because they're all on sale yeah so
literally all we're doing is painting
the two toes that show yeah not much
more than take so I mean and you no one
really notices your toes anyways like
they're hidden behind your dress you
could paint them but it's just like more
effort so the next tip that we have is
for tanning and Callie actually
spent a really long time researching the
best tanner the self-tanner everyone
spends a ton of money getting like spray
tans or like the UVA tans yeah first of
all those are bad for your skin
you got seriously in that way obviously
we don't go tan because it's bad for you
so what we did is we went like I look up
a ton of self tanners and we found a
couple really good ones but this is the
cheapest it's Banana Boat summer color
self-tanning lotion and I got this at
Fred Meyers for like $8.00 and I'm where
we're both wearing it right now I've
applied to twice and she's done once and
like it's pretty easy all I gotta do is
exfoliate and weather gloves or else to
get them actually didn't I just wash my
hands really well after after I put it
on myself
and then after I put it yeah and then
just put like a little dab on like the
yeah top your hands the only like it's
pretty I don't know cuz I have a little
bit of unevenness but it's not
noticeable at all yeah yeah and it's
also my fault yeah and then like I like
this one cuz it doesn't smell bad
afterwards like a lot of them smell
awful you just fell off of her the rest
of the day but I went after I woke up
because I planted at night I woke up and
I just put some of our st. Ives cocoa
loose in and I smelled great I smelled
like coconut so guys so another tip is
that if you go out and tan or if you're
just tan from your suntan lotion and you
are using foundation you don't have to
go out and buy another darker foundation
you can just um here you do this mixed
bronzer and foundation and all you do is
you just put your foundation onto your
hand or anything else I think it'll be
easier to do it onto like a platter or
something and if you have you could use
liquid bronzer they have that in ours
yeah or you can um grape off your palate
yeah
oh yeah and this is the severe of
minerals one because we never use these
yeah cuz we just have like a ton of
these and we just like dip a little bit
oh you only use a little bit though and
you make sure it matches your skin
because that would be really obvious and
just looks like your whole face is brown
yeah so just mix it really well and then
make sure it's like matches your neck
and everything and and then you're
saving money on foundation okay so
another tip is that last year for prom I
was like oh my I don't want to have like
a little bloated stomach stomach I was
gonna say slow me a little bit a little
pooch first for prom so I baked I like
barely ate all day and then we got to
dinner and dinner was like we went to a
fancy restaurant so it was like three
four courses and I hadn't salmon and I
was stuffed and then I had this like
huge stomach and I was just like oh my
goodness what should I do because it was
awful what you should do to prevent this
is first of all don't use what is that
day Oh
on prom day you should carry some water
like this and just keep on drinking it
these are nice because it has little
marks that tell you how much you're
drinking and also how like eat
frequently the all day like I would say
like six meals six small meals like
little snacks yeah so then like so first
of all you don't like like stuff your
face so you don't get bloated yeah by
the time you go to the dance personal
experience so now I have some questions
for this prom veteran yeah so Kelly what
would you bring for like emergency prom
makeup to go it doesn't have to be
emergency it's just like prom makeup
yeah because you have those small
clutches yeah I would definitely take a
long concealer and I would also bring
the lip lipstick or lip gloss I usually
that would you would wear and I would
pray
pressed powder because that seems
important oh yeah our blotting ships
that's a good point
and I would bring the the tapes to go
because that is genius and oh I would
also bring um if you're wearing coach
like everything I do know if you're
wearing studs you should definitely
bring extras well I would because I
always lose earrings that's why I never
wear them unless they're like the daily
card so if you're planning on doing your
own makeup for prom this kind of goes
without saying but you should definitely
practice the look that you're gonna be
doing beforehand after trying out your
look and thinking that you have it all
down is to test what it looks like
take a picture with flash to test what
it looks like in flash because it's
gonna be totally different from what it
looks like just without flash and
because flash picks up the really
dramatic makeup looks a lot better than
natural lighting - yeah and then you
know if you have like a super dramatic
line going right across here like you're
gonna be like oh you can't really tell
that this is really ugly
yeah or if you like if you try to
contour your nose or something and then
it flashes through and it's just like a
big old nose sometimes when you even get
your makeup done professionally like if
you were to go to the mall for instance
those girls are you can't rely that
they're gonna be experts selling me a
problem story okay so I went to Bobby
Brown which is like the ground
land and I haven't makeup done and the
lady first of all the first red flag was
when she put the fake eyelashes on first
and then just took a ton of aisle on her
over it like a thick line and then I had
these like bright red Lushington a carry
I like she wanted something completely
different yeah she was just like I could
see this on and then she started go you
know there we go so I ended up having to
take it all off and then and then this
girl - my makeup and it was it was all
good after that but just same thing but
it also wasted like a good portion of
her prom date ya know prom is a like a
very it takes up a lot of time yeah and
III was rushing getting my makeup done I
was freaking out I was
you never know so make sure yeah it's a
professional place doesn't mean that
you're guaranteed to have a good makeup
artist so our final tip is to use dress
tape because a lot of people spend a lot
of money on buying those like sticky
boobs I don't know what literally called
like adhesive bras because you can just
like slap them on they look like you're
not wearing a bra underneath because it
doesn't show but those are really
expensive and you get about like two or
three uses out of them so it's not
really worth it I would rather wear
unless you have to unless like unless
you have a completely black and bring it
back yeah unless you have that I would
just buy some dress tape dispenser and
tapes to go like from this we bought
this from Nordstrom Nordstrom yeah and
it was about 16 dollars which is really
expensive but it's definitely a way
cheaper than a sticky boob and it's also
you could also use it a ton it comes in
a whole tape dispenser so this is a
double-sided tape so you basically take
it off this little dispenser and then
tape it to your skin and then your dress
to the other side of it so that a little
steak yeah another thing that you can
use this with is if you have a little
flab right here and then memorize it a
little all right well you can just you
can just kind of stick it into the tape
it down yeah so it's another plus and
then another thing that's really cool
about this particular tape pack is that
it has a to-go container so these are
all little strips of those double-sided
tapes but just a ton of to go strips so
that you can just take them along
wherever you're going just in case your
as Falls or something that is probably
one of the coolest things I think yeah
this is like a must-have yeah or even
just I get any type of dress yeah it
doesn't like it that way and the evening
you must have yeah so those are all of
our you know kind of prom tips while
you're on a budget I hope it saves some
of you guys money are these tips are
helpful to some of you and thank you
