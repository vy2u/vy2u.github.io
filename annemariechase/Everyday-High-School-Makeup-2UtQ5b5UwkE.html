middle-school makeup tutorial but since
then I got a few requests to do a high
school makeup tutorial and since I'm in
high school I thought I would go ahead
and do it so that is what this video is
I know that I mentioned in my middle
school makeup tutorial that one of the
goals was to keep your makeup as natural
as possible and that goal I don't think
has changed at all I just think that in
high school people become a little bit
more aware of their imperfections and
become a little bit more self-conscious
from the other judgemental people around
so the main goal for high school makeup
is to just feel comfortable and
confident in makeup while keeping it
natural so I thought that a good focus
was to make yourself look more awake and
alive and not like a zombie and to just
emphasize your natural beauty a little
bit more so that's the goal of this
makeup tutorial also I wanted to give a
quick shout out / thank you to Jordan
from fresh beauties she made both of my
banners for my main channel so this
channel and for my blog channel so if
you guys like my banners and you're
looking for someone to make yours you
don't know how like I did you guys can
contact her and I'll have her
information linked below so I hope you
guys enjoy this video and I'll see you
guys very soon so I definitely think
that people will become a little bit
more self-conscious in high school like
in middle school I didn't really
remember being super self-conscious
about like my makeup or how I looked
really that might just be me so
something that I noticed personally was
the oiliness of my face I remember going
in the bathroom and I would just notice
that my face was like always kind of
oily in my t-zone and I was like what is
that like I don't really know what to do
about it so for a long time I didn't
really do anything about it because I
just didn't know but then I discovered
like makeup and powder and blotting
sheets and stuff like that so I would
say for foundation you should really go
with your skin type if you need coverage
I would say do what makes you feel
comfortable but if you don't need any
coverage I would say don't use any like
foundation if you feel comfortable with
your skin I would just go straight for
concealer and I will actually just do
concealer on some days depending on how
much time I have cuz I like to sleep in
as much as possible so
if I were just doing concealer I would
just conceal around my nose which has a
lot of redness and then maybe under my
eyes a little bit and then any trouble
spots that I have on a high schooler's
budget I would definitely recommend
Maybelline fit me concealer I like this
because it works as a concealer for acne
and acne scarring and redness but it's
also still really light so that it can
work under your eyes for your dark
circles if they're not like a huge
problem for you remain morning's that I
have enough time I like to use a little
bit more Foundation and also in high
school you may have more priorities you
might have a job after school you might
volunteer after school you might have a
sport so I would go for something that's
long lasting so I'm using the Revlon
Colorstay because I find it to be very
long-lasting and I can wear it basically
for anything so I'm just going to shake
it up a little bit and then put some on
the back of my hand one of the ways that
I've noticed that this is long-lasting
is that when I put it on the back of my
hand it'll stay there even if I wash it
off it'll just sit there so you should
make sure to wash it off really well
unless you want like a patch of
foundation on the back of your hand so I
just put on a tiny layer of foundation
you guys can still see that I have like
my redness and like some acne showing
and stuff so then I just go over with my
fit me concealer and I said this in one
of my previous videos I think it was my
everyday makeup routine it's a lot
easier to apply with a brush because
this carries so much product though I
would recommend either putting it on
your finger and then blending it out or
getting a brush and putting it on your
brush you can use this for an under-eye
concealer so I just put a tiny little
bit this goes a long way and then I just
blunt it out with my fingers so then I'm
gonna go and take this on any acne that
I see or just any acne scarring or
discoloration so going in with pressed
powder I don't like to use a ton of it
you just kind of switched in there so I
usually just apply this to the t-zone
because that is where I get oily but if
you want you can brush it along your
cheeks or wherever you get oily too
another thing that I started doing in
high school
where my eyebrows I would definitely
play around with your eyebrows because
they really really make a huge
difference on your face or how your face
looks you definitely want to be careful
about filling in your eyebrows too much
if you're going for the natural look
because it is something that is very
noticeable if you fill your eyebrows in
too much and other people can definitely
tell right away so what I usually do is
I just use a spoolie and kind of
straighten my eyebrows out and then I
use an eyebrow gel just because I have
pretty big eyebrows and they can get
unruly sometimes if I let them as always
I've been using my Too Faced brow and V
kit but I mean there are a lot of brow
things that you can use some people do
not need to gel their eyebrows down
because they have really small eyebrows
or they just like their eyebrows will
not move or something I don't know so
this step can be skipped today I would
just probably leave my eyebrows after
setting them just because um they look
really natural and that's what I go for
at high school or at school so I'm just
gonna leave them another problem that I
had when I first started high school is
that I didn't know how to make my
eyeshadow last like I would put it on
and then halfway throughout the day I
would look at my eyeshadow in the mirror
in the bathroom or at lunch or something
and it would be gone or it would just be
kind of like sitting on my eyes lids
just really ugly looking so I found out
that primer works really well so this is
the Too Faced shadow insurance and I'm
just gonna put this um like kind of on
my eyelid and then a little bit in my
crease because that's where I will be
applying my makeup and then just put the
left over my brow bone if you are a busy
body and have school and then some after
school activities I would definitely
recommend primer if you're going to be
using any eyeshadow I'm gonna go in with
this soft Kohl Rimmel eyeliner it's in
white again I did this in my middle
school makeup look because it works
really well I just put this a little bit
in the inner corner of my eye and then I
like to take it
and the first third of my bottom lash
line so that is what it looks like
blended out that immediately makes your
eyes look more awake so that is a very
helpful tip if you are looking pretty
sleepy and zombie-like and I'm really
sorry about getting so close up with a
camera
I'm just getting closer and closer what
I'm going for in this high school makeup
look is a base color and then I'm going
to be emphasizing the crease to give
your eyes more dimension it really
brings out the natural beauty and shape
of your eyes and I just really like
doing that so that's basically all that
this is going to be so taking this color
booty-call tapping off the excess and
then applying it onto the eye suit this
over the eyelid just like that so just
for the sake I'm using the same palette
so I'm not jumping around in palettes
I'm gonna use the color suspect in The
Naked 2 palette using that sweeping
motion right above the crease again I
like to have my eye open when I start
and then kind of close it and fix it up
a little bit the next thing I like to do
is just apply a little bit of eyeliner
this is the Revlon luxurious color and I
like this because it has a pencil liner
at one end and then kind of like a
sponge tip so that you can blend it out
one of the easiest ways to make eyeliner
look really natural is to just blend it
out with eyeliner I like to start at the
end of my eyes because usually for my
eye shape it doesn't look very good when
I apply it over here unless I get really
really close to the lash line so told
make it look as natural as possible
especially for school I usually just
apply it on the outer eyes and I usually
flick it upwards to make a tiny tiny
little cat eye and then I just like to
blend it along the lash line and then
basically the last thing that I do for
my eyes is just curl my lashes and then
apply my favorite drugstore mascara
everyone knows that those are the best
mascaras so I'm just going to show you
guys this one because I feel like it
gets really clumpy but um for a mascara
I think it's really popular in high
school so don't be afraid to use a lot
of mascara so I will actually use this
for school unless it's like snowing or
something then I don't use it cuz it
will leak on your face
so I'm just gonna show you guys what it
looks like after curling my lashes I
just apply this and kind of wiggle it
and you can already tell that it gets
pretty clumpy and also this dace went
for a much longer time than the other
mascaras like if you sneeze it'll get
all over your bottom lashline and I
typically do not apply this to my bottom
lash line because it is too clumpy so
here is what the completed eyes look
like and I kind of just plucked very
gently the very tips of my lashes to get
the goop off to make it less clumpy and
this is what it looks like so it is very
wet for the first like minute so so it
could get really messy especially if you
sneeze I would personally skip bronzer
because bronzer is really easy to make
it look super unnatural and I mean
you're going to school in the middle of
the day or in the morning and I don't
know I just don't see it as a necessary
step but I like to use highlighter
sometimes so I just like to apply that
on the highlights of my face and then
just blend it out really easily with my
finger and I like this because you get
this on your birthday at Sephora so if
you guys haven't signed up for that
thing you should go ahead and do that so
you can get a free highlighter and then
like we mentioned you might be a
busybody and have after-school
activities so I would just like to set
this all with my Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray so you just shake it up
and then this is always like a challenge
alright so that's it and I would also
not recommend wearing full-on lipsticks
unless they're nude colors but I would
recommend wearing lip glosses this is
the marvelous Moxie bare minerals
collection in spark plug so this is
basically what I'll be wearing to high
school more or less let me know in the
comments below if you guys like going
for a really natural look or kind of a
bolder look and like to stand out a
little bit more so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and hope it was
helpful to some of you out there and I
will see you guys very soon in my next
video bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
