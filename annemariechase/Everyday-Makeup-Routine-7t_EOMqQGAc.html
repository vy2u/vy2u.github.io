my everyday makeup routine this is
pretty much what I've been doing since
the beginning of this school year I have
always liked to keep my makeup really
really natural and simple and I always
worry about going out without sunscreen
and a lot of the stuff that I use
actually has SPF in it so this routine
is really good if you live in a sunny
area and even if you don't like I live
in Alaska which is like the opposite of
this basically we get a lot of sunlight
that reflects from the snow so even if
you live in like a cold area with snow
or a warm place with lots of Sun you
should always wear sunscreen in order to
protect your skin keep it healthy
looking and youthful looking when you're
older so I hope you guys enjoy it okay
so we're doing a voice that we're just
this video doesn't get too long so the
first thing that I do pretty much every
single day is use a primer so the one
that I'm using today and all the
products will be listed in the links not
in the links but just listed down below
but right now I'm using the
Porefessional by benefit but I also use
Maybelline's baby skin instant pore
eraser and I just use this because I
think it helps my makeup stand longer
and I have big pores and the second
thing that I've been doing every single
day since beginning of the year is using
my benefit again a BB cream it's called
like big easy liquid to powder I don't
really know understand the names of
these benefit products and then when I
was trying it out in store they told me
to mix it with my favorite moisturizer
and I've been using this Savino smart
essentials daily nourishing moisturizer
and these both have an SPF of like at
least 30 these are really really well
together I've actually used this with
other moisturizers before and it just
doesn't work as well
so I really like this combination of
products
I like this BB cream because it's very
natural and blendable but if you want
some more coverage you can just go ahead
and add another layer which is what I
did today so the next thing that I do is
usually conceal and lately I haven't had
many problem spots like acne or anything
if I did I would just conserve spot
conceal that but for now I just used my
maybelline instant age rewind eraser for
dark circles because those make me look
real tired sometimes in order to set my
BB cream and kind of just add another
tiny little layer of coverage I use my
bare minerals original powder foundation
and I pretty much just put that all over
my face so this next step is pretty
optional just like the entire tutorial I
usually don't do this everyday I only do
it if I have enough time or if I like
feel like anything already but that is
contouring and highlighting so for
contour I use my NARS Laguna bronzer I
use this brush which is pretty like
multifunctional it's the Mac one six
eight brush and I just kind of scoop it
along my like cheekbones and then to
highlight I use the other end of the
brush and dip it in this mac mineralize
skinfinish and soft and gentle and just
put that on the highlights of my
cheekbones it just makes you look really
dewy and fresh and I think it's really
pretty and then of course I do my
eyebrows because eyebrows are extremely
important as everyone knows you shape
your face so what I'll usually do is
I'll set my eyebrows with this anastasia
clear brow gel and then I kind of just
fill in the sparse areas using my Too
Faced brow and week it I have pretty
full eyebrows so I don't really need to
do much to them or else I look kind of
crazy
so what I do is my eyes really depends
on how much time I have but this step I
pretty much do every single day I will
highlight the inner corners and like
lower just like lower probably like 1st
4th of my eye with my NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk and then I'll Pat it down
this really just opens up your eyes and
makes it look so much brighter so much
more awake so I highly recommend this
step and if you just do this in eyeliner
and your eye balls that it makes a huge
difference
so I usually do that and then if I have
time I'll go ahead and pry my eyes using
my Mac painterly paint-pot and then I'll
kind of just add some depth or dimension
with a taupe color in the outer V and
then kind of along the crease and then
I'll go in with like usually a shimmery
eyeshadow I pretty much switch my
eyeshadow up between like a few
different palettes but right now I've
been using the Urban Decay Naked basics
palette so I usually use like a shimmery
pink or like a shimmery like whitish
color and I just placed up on my eyelid
and then I always like to go over where
I place the NYX jumbo eye pencil with
like the same color and this just brings
a lot more like highlight to the inner
corners of the eyes and then I'll line
my lashes right now I'm using the Laura
Mercier eyeliner and to make it as
natural as possible I just lined the
outer half and then just kind of blended
in with my finger tips and finally I
curl my lashes and apply a volumizing
mascara so I've been using the
Maybelline the falsies volume Express
and this is really nice because it has a
natural look while lengthening your
lashes so I've been using that lately
and I like it a lot it's waterproof kind
of sticks on your eyelashes which is
kind of annoying but it's fine
and then finally the last thing that I
do is moisturize my lips I usually don't
wear like lipsticks or even like glosses
throughout the week I just moisturize my
lips using my favorite Jack Black
moisturizer which is like any of the
mint flavors and that is pretty much it
alright so that is the end of my makeup
routine I hope you guys enjoy it thank
you so much for watching
go subscribe to my vlog channel follow
me on Instagram I think that's it for
now and I'll talk to guys next week bye
okay I was saying so thank you you were
very studious but why don't you go out
to more parties or parties in general is
it just that SEO is very hard or do you
just not drink I am what you would call
a grandma</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
