a really fun middle-school makeup
tutorial and this is a collaboration
with Kenzie and I will link her youtube
down below in the video that she has
with this collaboration so everyone go
over and subscribe to Kenzie she has an
amazing personality basically the reason
why I watch her videos is because she is
really just really fun to watch she
really connects with all her viewers so
go check her out before I start my part
of the tutorial I just wanted to kind of
direct you guys if you guys are heading
into middle school and want to start
wearing makeup I would definitely go
back to the frizz that you may have
heard less is more because a middle
school for makeup especially when you're
just beginning that is totally true I've
created this tutorial to try to be as
foolproof as possible it's really simple
really easy and really natural so I hope
you guys like it I hope it's helpful for
some of you and I'm just gonna get
started so I hope you guys enjoy when I
was in middle school I basically had the
same skin type as I do right now I'm not
wearing any makeup right now so you can
kind of tell I have like blotchy
red skin kind of Wiggy so I had blotchy
red skin and I also had a little bit of
acne not a ton of acne like little
pimples every now and then so I used and
what was really good for me was the bare
minerals original foundation bare
minerals has like a beginner starting
kit and you can get the original
foundation the bronzer that's called
warmth and then their mineral veil and
then they come with a concealer brush
and then a big like kabuki like brush I
wouldn't really recommend the entire kit
it's like around seventy sixty dollars I
think sixty-five dollars I didn't really
use warmth or the mineral veil I use the
brushes for quite a while but then I got
different new brushes so the only thing
that I'm still really using from that
entire kit is the bare minerals original
foundation so I think that the bare
minerals is absolutely perfect for
middle school because when you apply it
it doesn't kick up on the skin
whatsoever but it also actually makes a
difference it eliminates redness and you
at your skin tone without looking cakey
so you can't really mess it up
especially if you're a beginner the best
thing that I found about bareMinerals
foundation is that it's extremely
multifunctional which is what I really
like in products so it acts as a
concealer you can cover up your dark
circles with it and then it also hides
any redness so really even that your
skin tone it's just like a foundation
except it's not to the degree that
foundations can get to so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys how it works and
what it looks like on so I'm gonna apply
it onto my own face now and the brushes
that I'm gonna use are the bare minerals
concealer brush which is this is like
seriously so old I still have it and
then this Sigma round kabuki f82 brush
and this brush is made specifically for
a PI mineral makeup so the first thing
that you do with bare minerals is you
put this into your little cap or lid for
the foundation and then you swish it
around in the foundation and then you
tap off the excess I remember I watched
like the instructional DVD on how to do
it and then I would do that like every
single morning in middle school and I
was like I was so irritated by the sound
I don't know why so so I'm applying it
to the redness on my nose at first I'm
gonna go and like spot conceal areas so
I've covered up some of the more red
areas on my face like around my nose and
some acnes that I have and then I'm
gonna go back and put some more in this
cap and go in with my Sigma round kabuki
f82 brush that's meant just for mineral
makeup tap off the excess so I like
using this brush instead of the big kind
of Kabuki brush that comes with the bare
minerals kit because this packs on so
much more product than the bare minerals
one
notice that the bareMinerals run is
really really big especially after you
wash it the bristles kind of just like
come out a little bit so before you even
wash the brush it's kind of compact but
it's not nearly as tight as this one so
I kind of feel like there's a lot of
product being wasted
especially when you like tap off the
excess and you see it all flying
everywhere so I really like using this
brush because it's really really compact
as you can see and it is made
specifically for mineral powders so I
finished putting on all of my bare
minerals foundation and you can actually
tell the difference but the cool thing
is I don't feel like I'm wearing any
makeup and you cannot tell that I have
like makeup on like you wouldn't think
that I had makeup on just this really
natural is I'm trying to say so I've
gotten a few messages from younger girls
asking advice on how they should ask
their parents to start letting them wear
makeup if you're wanting to get into
foundation or just wanting to start
wearing makeup bare minerals is a really
really good selling point for your
parents because I mean their slogan is
that bare minerals is so natural that
you can sleep in it and also it's
extremely natural-looking so it doesn't
look like you're wearing makeup you
can't really mess it up and for the most
part it's pretty affordable I mean it is
like a higher-end makeup product and
then from there you can expand to eyes
shadows and eyeliners and stuff like
that I feel like once you get them in
the store you can probably go farther so
if you're not really into bare minerals
or it's a little bit too expensive for
you or you want more coverage I would
recommend using this L'Oreal Paris magic
skin beautify or BB cream I use this for
a really really long time after I use
the bare minerals because it is such a
good BB cream and I would personally
pair this because it's not quite that
much coverage especially if you have
redness on your face I would pair this
with this Maybelline fit me concealer
because both of them together are a
really light and easy duo you can't
really mess it up and you get enough
coverage
so the
basically what I would recommend as far
as foundations and just cover up ghost
and then I'm going to move on to the
eyes for my middle school no one wore
eye makeup so I didn't really feel the
need to wear eye makeup except for like
these little things I'll show you but if
people are girls in your school are
starting to wear more makeup then feel
free to do so
I would personally keep it really
natural but it's all up to you just go
with the flow or go get the flow
whatever I would stick to not wearing
eyeliners because especially when you're
beginning it's really really easy to go
crazy with the eyeliner so I would just
stay away from it so I would recommend
if you want to accentuate your eye
features is to contour them this works
really well because you're using a
natural matte color that's close to your
skin tone
so if you do actually mess it up no one
will really be able to tell but it still
makes your eyes really pop out so I'm
going to be using this color in the Too
Faced natural eye palette and it is in
the shade Velvet Revolver
I'm sure if you want to go to the
drugstore and find a similar color or
just a another natural matte color for
your crease then you can find one
probably really easily but all you're
going to do is you're gonna take a
crease brush like this this is the Sigma
blending e 25 brush and then you just
take some tap off the excess and then
we're gonna take this and then just
outline a little bit above the natural
crease line so I will show you guys that
so I'm taking this brush and then just
going back and forth and windshield
wiper motion so for this step when
you're finished contouring your eye
sockets Iowa definitely recommend taking
another clean brush and then blending it
out because when you don't blend this
out and you just have a harsh line if
you have a harsh line it can look really
really really unnatural there's kind of
a line where I started contouring my
sockets so I'm just going to take a
different brush this is mostly clean and
then blend this out some more and then
for this you can use little circles
while you're doing your little
windshield wipers so here is the eye
that I just contoured and then here is
the plane bear eye
so after contouring the eyes I would
recommend going in with a white eyeliner
pencil this one is the soft Kohl
eyeliner pencil from Rimmel and it
actually works really really really well
so I'm just going to go in and take this
and highlight the inner tear ducts to
make my eyes look really really awake
and keep it looking super natural so I
just take this eyeliner and then kind of
go along the bottom right here so I like
to do that a little bit and then take it
along my lower lash line this pencil is
really nice because it is like a Kohl
pencil so you can blend it out really
really easily just with your fingers
okay so here is what it looks like with
the white eyeliner pencil in the inner
corner and part of the lower lash line
so the final step that I would do for
the eyes is just use an eyelash curler
to curl your lashes and then apply a
favorite drugstore mascara because those
are the best types of mascaras so this
is actually the one that I used all
throughout middle school this is the
lash blast from Maybelline this one
doesn't clump as easily as some of the
other ones I mean I know that some
people go for that look but if you're
going for a natural look you should
definitely try this one and then if you
want to wear any lip products I don't
recommend wearing lipsticks or lip
glosses just because those can be a
little bit much for middle school but I
do recommend these baby lips because
they're kind of like chopsticks but with
a bit of color this baby look in
particular is kind of colorful but I
feel like it could work for middle
school so this baby lips is a little bit
more pigmented for the baby lips line
but it's still a nice pretty natural
looking color and I think you could pull
it off from middle school if you wanted
to so that is the entire makeup look
that I would recommend doing for middle
school it's really really natural super
light and less is definitely more be
sure to comment down below and tell me
what grade you guys are going into or
how old you are I would really like to
know that'd be super interesting to know
and also be sure to go check out
