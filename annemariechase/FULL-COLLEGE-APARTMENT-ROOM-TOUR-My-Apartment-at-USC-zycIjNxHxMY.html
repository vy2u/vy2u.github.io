a my apartment
this apartment is an 8-man apartment
which means that there are eight people
living here and during the school year
it can get super hectic you can just
tell by the size of this kitchen like
this is our entire kitchen
those are like entire table with four
chairs this is a fridge for eight people
yeah so basically just gets really like
really kind of it's really hard to live
with a people I'll just like leave it at
that this is actually the cleanest I
could it has ever been
let's be real um and then we have the
fridge I actually have been out of town
so I don't have much in here but fun
fact this refrigerator was clean for the
first time in ten months by me my mom
but I think the only thing that's mine
in here is this slide aaalac from Trader
Joe's I've been trying to eat like a
like a vegan lifestyle I've been
pescetarian since October I guess you
can walk over there this is where our
two other bedrooms are one of my
roommates and then another their
bathroom but here's where we do our
laundry Oh
it grows some type of like mold in there
oh it's not too bad it's like literally
so disgusting I had to tell me it's like
replace it it's really easy for like
apartments to just do whatever they want
like give you whatever they want because
students usually don't know to like
fight for a better deal or like better
equipment mm-hmm okay and then if you
can tell from these little lights here
this leads into our living room it's
real close and personal it's actually
pretty nice because it gets a lot of
natural lighting
some cool things about this room are
lights my roommates
attempted to like kind of decorate our
apartment with the lights and then
something that's really cool that I
actually really like that my one of my
roommates made is this little wall
painting like she's duct tape and made a
bunch of different really cool designs
and so she just hung it up she's really
creative and she also made that one
right there I don't know how she made
this one but she's like an art major at
USC now we're going to move on to like
my side of the apartment here's another
little wall décor thing this is like
for a pre game or something and then
here is our side so this is my bedroom
and then we have the bathroom on this
side there's nothing that's special
about this bathroom so again living with
so many people and sharing this bathroom
with like college students it gets
pretty gross here's another device that
I clean my sink with and I'm bleaching
it so I'm thinning my cleaning device
and then we have my bedroom which is my
favorite part the coolest thing I think
about my bedroom now is that I have like
a little corner a lot of people have
been asking me about my roommate
situation everyone knows
Zoey from my vlogs she hasn't lived with
me for a semester just because she went
abroad and then I had like a random
roommate she's really nice but she's not
living here anymore so as always trying
to find a new roommate for me wasn't
really my ideal situation but it's just
what's probably happened but here is my
absolute favorite part Jacob set it all
up but wait Jacob you're filming do you
want to introduce yourself so fast here
come come to the mirror this is my
cameraman and my friend say hi what's
good y'all
thank you for filming okay back to me
basically when you're editing a video it
takes a lot on your computer like it's a
huge toll on your computer so I asked my
parents to bring my desktop from home
which is this dinosaur it's actually I
think five or six years old and then I
try to editing a video on this and I
real
as that it's way too old Apple literally
built computers like so that they die
after a few years like I'm very
convinced of it especially if you do
like heavy editing and use a lot of your
postal words your processor so this
really doesn't work I'm just using this
for like I'm like emails and stuff and
then here's my laptop that I do like
pretty much everything on for school and
then editing and I just got like last
week
this Apple um Mac Mini mini Mac Mac Mini
this monitor that's actually Jacobs
previous his roomate scences oh I'm
really really excited about being able
to edit in this little space now because
um my computer was literally like dying
from me doing heavy editing so getting
into the desk we have these little
Polaroids we actually have a lot more I
just put these up we're gonna make a
scrapbook but we haven't done it yet so
I just put them here this is the first
day that we started going out what day
was a jig um you tell me you tell me I
already know you tell me
December 8th 7th no I I knew it that's
why I said age something that's really
handy that you can like maybe pick up if
you need like a space because you don't
have like a vanity in college I just put
it in this little bin and literally
everything that I need to get ready in
the morning in terms of like makeup and
then I can just put it all away so I
don't like leave a giant mess and then
we have this really cute light strand I
actually have this in my old dorm - I'm
so surprised that those lights are still
working but I can easily turn them off
with this but we actually put this up
but it's actually very convenient for
putting your keys inside your room
because you don't want them outside all
the time so a lot of people going
through I had pepper spraying just like
things that you need when you're heading
out the door really fast I'm gonna show
you one side of this mirror because the
other side is very messy
this is broken like a hundred percent of
the time but here's where I keep most of
my clothes and I have this little doodad
have a lot of food in my closet right
now because my mom just spot me a bunch
of food and I haven't put it away and
then I have all of my shoes in this
little rack which is really convenient
running on this side of the room is my
Alaska flag as you guys know wow this
must of like shrunk so I'm from Alaska
so that was so annoying did you see that
supposed to go in this thing be like
pinda here that just ruin my entire ring
tour oh oh
so I'd you guys know I'm from Alaska all
right we got a candle from Bath and Body
Works it's actually smells like nothing
so when I light it it smells like
nothing and then I have my perfume which
is alien which I really like and then
another favorite edition of my room is
this TV monitor that's also not mine
like half the monitors in this room are
not mine
this is Jacob's monitor he actually has
like four TV monitors for some reason
like he's a monitor hoarder so he put
this one in here a storage but he like
set it up with his Apple TV and I didn't
think I wanted it at first but it's
actually really nice because my bed is
right across from it and I can just
watch like Hulu or Netflix or YouTube
moving over here basically just a bunch
of storage another lamp because even
though the department is so expensive it
doesn't come with any overhead lighting
you have to provide all of your own
fighting that's awesome and then we can
move on to my bed so this is one of my
favorite lamps even though it's just the
lamp it's really handy since our beds
are bunked so that my roommate could
have like her phone plugged in while I
have my phone plugged in I basically
just have like my watch charger for my
Apple watch I'm like kind of talking
trash about Apple but I have a lot of
their products doesn't make any sense
and then I have this nice little dresser
that actually someone left in this room
so we just got it and this fell on my
foot like a good 20 minutes
go definitely leave a bruise that hurt a
lot I cried but not really I'm sorry
that the good thing about having these
beds is that there's a lot of storage
space underneath and this is like
probably where I spend most of my time
actually pretty handy I used to have
this on this side but I don't really
need it on that side anymore but it can
be really good for holding like books
like that book used to be in here and
then I have a bunch of really
comfortable blankets because you just
went on a road trip and we took some
blankets with us just like it got me
through freshman year it's really
important for me to have a really
comfortable bed because I like sometimes
like spend a lot of time in bed so
honestly like this is probably the most
important place in my entire apartment
for me and then lastly we work so hard
to keep it really nice and clean and
it's just dirty still so I would not
recommend getting a fuzzy rug from
Target especially if it's white yeah so
that is pretty much my entire room it's
weird with College because it's
sometimes hard to make your room really
personal and like make it feel like your
own especially with roommates but I feel
like this is like very like homey now
and comfortable so I'm starting to
really like it alright guys thank you so
much for watching this video I hope you
guys liked it and I just wanted to give
another thank you to Jacob you can
follow him on Instagram and Twitter his
username is in it in it jacob boa it's

lot of my Instagram photos so be sure to
follow me I'm posting kind of frequently

time for this one just give me a thumbs
