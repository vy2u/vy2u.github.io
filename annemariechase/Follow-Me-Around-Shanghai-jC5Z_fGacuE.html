lot of cool bars a lot of cool
restaurants oh this is like the best
places come out for like a sandwich like
a smoothie or a coffee it's like an old
French Concession house they've
renovated it's called a mocha
that's to tell you my word yeah one
mixed berry lady will have a really
interesting order I've been living in
Shanghai as a working adult since for
about a year now working at all a real
world now so I grew up an Asian of my
entire life you know they're called
third culture kids you know it's like
you grew up in a place where a different
culture from that of your parents so I'm
korean-american some Korean American
born in Seoul I lived in like Tokyo
Shanghai so
American citizen I only went there for a
school thanks thank you so I talked this
place up
it's not a very good smoothie hopefully
better American citizen but the only
time I lived in America was the five
years I went to Berkeley yes I went to
school for five years it's a little bit
tougher than the USC so I know and I
always wanted to get back to Asia it's
just so much more dynamic so much I'm a
vibrant when I grew up I always grow up
with like my best friends are always
like English Australia and South Africa
and French Dutch and that's just how it
is growing up as an expat over season I
just wanted to get back into that into
that vibe I guess I mean life's good in
Asia you know like the street you can
live like a king for tea and there's
always something happening you know
good man okay I'll do just poured
vinegar on the sandwich good thing is
this is a technique even take back home

lovely
funny thing about Shanghai you really
like to outdo they're super oh my god I
did not see that that's Zuma pink
Porsche with Kitty on it it's not an
unusual sight in China to see a supercar
was like a ridiculous paint job that's
