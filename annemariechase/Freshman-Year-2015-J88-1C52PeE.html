video you guys can probably tell that I
am NOT in the same I'm I'm like never in
the same place but I'm in a particularly
particularly unusual place I mean I
never seen this adorable emoji pillow
before I actually tried to get a picture
that match this and it's really hard to
do like to wink and to full kiss at the
same time without looking like a fool
this is like my mom's favorite emoji to
send so she decided to get it I just
thought that was a cutest thing ever
she's so adorable actually my parents
bedroom right now sitting on their bed
it's the best lighting in this house and
I moved so I just got back from Shanghai
and I am now in Anchorage Alaska so I'm
here for a few weeks and then I'm moving
back to LA for school lots of exciting
things in August so therefore I decided
to do vlogmas i think i did daily vlogs
for like a week or two when i was just
beginning my blog channel and it was
like getting my school supplies for
school uh shopping for my dorm stuff and
then moving into college and then like
my first few days of college so i
decided that i would do the same thing
this month except to start from August
first so if you guys are interested
there's gonna be a really busy month for
me because I'll be moving into my new
room here and she's probably a lot of
videos for you guys and do tell them
back-to-school stuff because it is that
time of month no it's not that time of
month it is that time of year where
everyone's just getting ready to go back
to school so as you guys know I just
finished my freshman year of college at
the University of Southern California so
this is going to be a reflection of
basically all of my experiences this
entire year and I honestly learned so so
much I really think that this year has
made a really big difference on my life
and I'm very excited to share my
reflection with you guys so I'm just
going to talk to you guys about like
social academic emotional and like
everything physical aspects of my
freshman year of college so let's get
started
I don't know why I always do that stupid
the first thing that I have on here that
I want
talk about for some reason was my social
aspect of college I feeling is actually
pretty important aspect because a lot of
people have this like perception of
college where it's a very social
environment for me uh for going to USC
which is a very very social school I
honestly can say that I didn't have the
best social life I don't really know how
to explain it let me just start with the
basics so I had a long-distance
boyfriend basically for the entire first
semester of college and then a little
bit into second semester so I learned a
lot of things from this relationship and
I'm not going to really talk about the
relationship itself but talk about like
what I learned from having a
relationship in college and that is just
that I don't see myself I don't really
see myself wanting to be in a
relationship in college and it's not
because of like that relationship it's
just like I personally think I can grow
more as a person and like just focus
more on myself in college and that's a
really good time to like want to focus
on yourself as a single individual I'm
also one of those people that always
like finds myself in a relationship so
like I'm not gonna like I can't really
say for sure but as of right now I would
not choose to be in a relationship in
college so I guess for me being in a
relationship put me in a situation where
I didn't put myself out there to meeting
new people if that makes sense so yeah
for me socially I just didn't meet a ton
of people especially my first semester
that I really clicked with until second
semester where I made like a lot of like
more genuine friendships and then this
summer I met a lot of really great
people that actually go to USC in China
so that was nice um but yeah that's just
like my situation for boys and dating
sometimes I get questions asking like
how your high school friendships or your
family relationships differ for me
personally I'm really really close with
my family so um it didn't change I feel
like I should talk to that boy maybe
like contact them
or call them more but we we're still
really close and my mom and dad have
come to visit multiple times even though
it's pretty far so I'm very lucky in
that aspect my siblings and I are also
very close we talk a lot less because
obviously I'm not seeing them every day
if I went to the same school as them I'm
sure I would see them a lot more but I'm
also pretty sure that we would fight a
lot more because when we're together too
often we fight more so it's really
special when I'm able to see my family
not because I'm not seeing them as often
relationships with high school friends
first of all I have realized through
college and meeting new people and
having more genuine friendships that I
have with most of my high school friends
I'm not saying all but like most of them
I've realized I just like pretty much
I'm not even really in contact a lot of
my high school friends so I think that
going to college will put you in a
situation where you're with more
like-minded people who are more your
level or who have the same interests as
you I'm not saying I'm like better or
they're better than me in any way but
I'm just saying like you'll find people
that have more in common if you in
college and for the high school friends
that are still really good friends to me
I'm still in contact with them and when
I come back to visit at home it's just
like we had never left because if a
friendship is meant to happen and lasts
it will so that's what I have to say
about that um okay so on to my academics
this is a really really hard thing for
me I think freshman year because I'm not
meaning to brag or anything like that
you guys know that alright at least I
hope you do I went from being like top
5% of my class to going into a school
where everyone that goes to that school
was like the top 10 20 I don't know what
the percentage is of their class first
of all I guess I should like address my
like emotional state and my freshman
year my first semester I think I might
have been depressed I think I actually
really was I just was not very happy and
then my second semester really picked up
for me but because of that it just made
everything a lot harder to do I didn't
do terribly but I will admit that I did
get the worst grade that I've ever
gotten as like a final grant in a class
and that was a deed I
menace on camera most of my other
classes were is Orbeez but then I got 1d
it was actually last semester in econ if
you guys saw my blogs you know that I
really struggled with econ luckily I did
so badly that I'm actually able to
retake that class it's called like
freshman forgiveness and it will count
towards my GPA because I did so badly
yeah I guess we can just reflect on that
right now
so um in college you just have to learn
how to work smarter and not harder
because I'm always the person working
really really hard and not smart um for
example like our econ class that I did
so poorly and we had to do practice
problems and if you completed those
practice problems then you pretty much
do well on the tests but for me I
couldn't get past not understanding the
theories in the practice problems where
other people wouldn't really care
because they just wanted to finish the
practice problems and I was like I want
to be able to understand exactly why
this is whereas I didn't really need to
understand exactly why it was I just
needed to know how to do it but it's
actually pretty sad if you think about
it you're not like actually learning it
you're just kind of memorizing how to do
the steps but like for that class that
was all I really needed to do I've also
learned in college that you cannot let
your academics or your grades define you
as a person because that totally did in
high school for me um but I've learned
especially since I wasn't doing so well
I was like okay I need to focus on
finding other qualities and
characteristics about myself that define
me other than my grades if I just focus
on my grades and I was not doing well
that would be so bad for me because I am
a very anxious I can't be a very anxious
brown person um so I think that was
really important for me to do - yeah
from my academics and not doing so in my
first year I learned that grades don't
define me and I shouldn't like greats to
find me or else I'd be a very sad person
and I realized that I just have a
terrible time management but these are
both things that I now know to work on
for next year so I think that
experiencing this failure was a good
thing especially during my first year
it's probably the best time to
experience this failure
because from now on you can only go up I
mean you can go down too but I don't I
don't want that to happen so another
thing that I wanted to talk about from
like an emotional aspect you shouldn't
let the first semester of your college
experience be representative of how
you're going to feel at that school for
the rest of your time there because it's
a transitional period I think a lot of
people don't realize that I've actually
had some friends transfer schools there
after their first semester because they
just feel like they're not happy there
but even for me I wasn't happy for a
semester I was looking into transferring
schools I was going to transfer to Emory
because that is where I was going to go
other than USC but I think that people
should definitely let that transition
period happen so give yourself like a
whole year to fully experience at school
because you really just get adjusted to
it you make and develop genuine
friendships and you get used to being
there you get adjusted to living in a
different place if you're going to a
different place and you overall just get
adjusted to the new life that you're
living if you're struggling yourself or
if you're going to college you should
expect to have a transitional period
where you might not be very happy or you
might feel really uncertain and
definitely look at the transferring if
you are very unhappy and you don't think
that that school is for you but also
just give your self time to allow like
that transition to happen because I did
and I can honestly say that I think that
USC will be the best place for me to be
and even though if you ask me like a
semester though I probably would have
been like I don't think I want to go to
school if anything shifts in this frame
cuz I get my charger I kind of ruined a
little thing that I had going like I was
was really getting into this video but
hopefully we'll be fine okay reflection
continuing okay so the nice thing that I
wanted to talk about was my
extracurriculars so I was rooming with
Shelley and Caroline this summer and
they both lived like on the opposite
side of campus and
actually where most of the freshmen
lived I lived in the international dorms
we're international students live and
then like all the people who didn't get
their placement for the other side of
campus but I think I would have really
had a different experience if I had
lived like on the other side of campus
for all the other freshmen where um so I
was not actually very involved in
extracurriculars I actually tried
getting involved in like a few things at
the beginning of the year and they
didn't work out because like either I
would miss the deadlines or just not
hear about them or not know about them
or I like would just not get into the
club or whatever I really wish I could
have got more involved and I think that
living somewhere else where everyone's
you know like all the freshmen are
living together you hear about more
things and so you get more involved and
you like see other people getting
involved so you want to get more
involved because in my norms like I just
I don't even know I didn't know who live
next door to me so I really think that
if I had lived somewhere else
it would have been like the social norm
or like positive peer pressure to get
more involved and I'm not really saying
that's like purely because of where I
lived I personally just wish I had
gotten more involved with things I think
I would have made friends more easily
and had like a probably an easier
transition one thing that I did get
involved in are the few things that I
got involved in we're like really weird
they ended up being like not not things
that I actually want to be in um so I
think I just got really unlucky in that
aspect next semester I definitely get
involved in not a lot of clubs but just
like one or two clubs that I'm really
passionate about and actually really
want to be involved in and I also want
to focus like a lot more time doing
YouTube and creating really really cool
content cuz my last video was something
that took me so long to edit but I was
really really happy with the final
product product and um it just made me
so happy to be like a youtuber I was
like this is like why I do YouTube
because now I have this video that I'm
able to watch that I'm able have for the
rest of my life and I can show my kids
like this is where I spent like my
summer of freshman year so the last
thing that I wanted to just like touch
on some some people are sniffing this
some people don't care at all but was
like health and like physical aspect of
my freshman year if you watched my blogs
my first semester of college I got sick
so often and I have no idea why I was
just constantly very very sick it seemed
like every single weekend um so I don't
really know again that's just like the
transition period I didn't get sick like
at all second semester that was really
interesting um but yeah I also started
working out a lot more in college I've
always been someone who like wants to
work out because let's be real I just
want to be like one of those fitness
models that'd be cool I think college is
a really really good time to start
working out you need to develop a good
habit of working out especially with all
the food that you're gonna eat Freshman
Fifteen is extremely preventable but it
is also extremely prevalent in college
campuses so if you're not careful it's
very very very easy to gain a bunch of
weight they can go two ways I think you
can either make it a really good
experience where you're pretty healthy
and you develop really good habits or
you can go the opposite way where you're
like away from your parents away from
mom who like cooks a delicious healthy
ish home-cooked meal every day to like
eating absolute like carbs at my
cafeteria 90% of the food was just carbs
yeah I just think this is a really good
time to start being really active um
especially if you make it a habit
it'll just like start being a part of
your daily schedule in college so going
on gym for me at least is just overall
very beneficial and it's something that
I want to create more of a routine for
because it was pretty routine up until
the points where I got busy and then I
would just stop going and that just like
was a downward spiral because then I
would just eat badly wouldn't exercise
like probably didn't sleep as well and
like feel bad about not exercising and
like all that stuff so definitely a
school a resolution for me is to create
a routine schedule that I do like every
single day or like a very specific time
and just actually like follow through
with that schedule pretty much every day
I think I pretty much covered everything
that I could possibly think of I'm
actually going to do my school year
resolutions now because I just wrote
down a few that I thought
worth sharing so my first one is go to
every single class the two things that I
had in common with my grades like
dropping dramatically was that in those
two classes I didn't go to class like
every single day it actually makes a
huge difference for me and I'm sure for
everyone because even in like class a
professor would be like this is really
important for the test be sure to like
focus your attention on this and like
that would be like a five-point thing on
like I 100 point test once you get in a
habit of skipping classes it becomes a
habit habits are so important I talked
about this in my news and solutions
video like just go watch if you haven't
but like habits define you as a person
so make it a habit to go to every single
class make your habits healthy good
habits or else they can ruin you
things dramatic and it like it but it's
seriously so true so another resolution
that I had was to get more involved I
already talked about that and another
one was to not let grades to find me
I've gotten way better at doing this so
I'm not saying that you should that
grades are not important but I think
that it is important to not let them
define you especially if you're a
perfectionist that is tough um my next
resolution is to have better time
management this is something that I've
always struggled with like I just have
terrible time management it comes with
being a perfectionist like
perfectionists if you guys are
perfectionist you would know this take
way too long to do like anything so um
that's really just something that I've
always had to work with so this is
probably be really long and for that I
am very sorry but that was my entire
freshman year reflection I think it was
pretty like pretty solid like I think I
covered everything so I hope you guys
enjoyed it I hope it was like maybe
helpful for some of you let me know if
you guys are going to college or like in
your freshman year or like how old you
are in the comments below
oh also if you guys are in college or in
your freshman year of college may be
sure to share your experiences of your
freshman year
actions down below I think that'd be
really really interesting and we can get
like conversation going on down there I
hope you guys enjoy this video and I
will talk to you guys next week actually
I just posted my blog the exact same
time so you guys can go watch that now
this video is over or you guys can stick
around for my next video which will be
up in a few days
alright talk to you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
