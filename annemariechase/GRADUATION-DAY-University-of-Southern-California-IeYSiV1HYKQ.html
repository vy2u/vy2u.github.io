lasts really long so it kind of like I
think it'll look like tomorrow

back asleep and turn my alarm off and
turn my phone on silent and then I just
peeked at my phone at Elliot had called
me four times and everyone was like you

sleeping I put your plugs in her ears so
no one wakes her up

didn't drop it somewhere no I want to
make sure that she didn't give it
I forgot my stash everyone Elliot Elliot
your turn Elliot you've been quiet like
dead quiet for like yeah he was so pissy
earlier he's mad he's probably like
venting right now like - but we all
probably look like this look how creepy
Elliot look
Oh cold and you to blog list it's a gold
he always tries to do this
we're gonna need to have a contingency
plan
how do we feel about this it's just like
a party full of Dementors I'm down to
leave around I'm just no just kidding
social anxiety when did you go to sleep
tonight curating some real content thank
you
I'm gonna hire you full time soon okay
[Laughter]
we got her so much warm coffee you got
it yes I did okay I provided that where
that goes and it brought a team if I'm
16 we're getting in on it in an out
basis meaning that the tester leaves and
there are all these people one of us I
know
it's gonna cry let it in and out right
now anyone else

she chose her side
Wow room
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
we have a bet we're splitting between
two who gets in first I wanted to go
that way so we'll see you Brooke oh good
idea did you come in yeah this guy
knocked on my door at 4:30 and came into
my home and looked like hurry up we're
going okay it wasn't me it wasn't all me
but I was ready so fast yeah you were
here yeah good idea
Congrats we made it in
yeah same 7:30 now ceremony start I want
to charge my camera battery cuz I think
I've decided that I'm gonna vlog my
actual graduation like walking across
the stage it'll be really symbolic if I
do I might scared I think a weapon too
so it is currently 803 no one's here
it's 8 o'clock I think there's a
ceremony at 8 like the general ceremony
for every single one of my siblings
graduations we have overslept but I
can't tell if everyone always just
misses it because we oversleep like all
collectively or if we just don't care
wait could I show you apparently it's my
fault because I didn't tell anyone that
actually started at 8 but I feel like
all my family knows that I'm like just
too jumbled to like communicate that so
I thought they all like she got my hands
up I think mom knew Tilly just look it
up cuz she was like Emory doesn't know
this no you don't think so why when I
have I ever give it off that impression
Oh kind of raining outside like a little
bit love you Kelly 8:41 I am ready to go
I got my sash that doesn't even say at
school that I'm graduating from this is
Kelly this is one of a kind no one else
has this yeah cuz this girl like sold it
to me cuz I was like I thought I
couldn't buy it from the bookstore okay
we're a little late it's 8:45
you got it I'm sorry no I have a big
head and it fits me fine I should be the
one concerned is my oh thank you
let's go tomato ketchup it's like kind
of like a little bit rainy and like
windy I don't know what we're just
saying right now but I like that it's
kind of like windy and gray because it
makes us very unique like you would
expect your graduation in California and
as of lately to be like nice because it
has been but today is like a unique
birthday yes what were times you noticed
that when people are at the end of their
lives and think deeply and honestly
about whether they live live and living
they tend to have the same five regrets
about their life
their backgrounds identities their
beliefs these five regrets
we
enjoy me in saluting the US
the birds we saw earlier
working where Western
you don't have Korean flag on there it's
good I like it I have lost all and if
any friends

the country is put on Elliott
