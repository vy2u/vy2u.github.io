third and final video of my little prom
series that I was doing I think that
this is the coolest video that I posted
so far on this channel I'm really
excited that I was able to capture it
all and put it into one little video I
think it's really cool and really
special to me because it includes my
prom mask out because my boyfriend I
know and all of my friends like Ben my
sister basically asked me out and they
decided to capture it on camera and then
they also got my reaction so I have all
of that that was a reason why I had 200
balloons in my room I actually just
popped them all because I filmed this
introduction with a know and Ellen
earlier so I was like ok I don't need
these balloons anymore but then one of
the clips got deleted so I had to really
film this so I don't have any balloons
in my room anymore but I had them in my
room for about a month and it was pretty
it was pretty cool like right dump my
room a little bit I also have my get
ready with me for prom for my makeup and
I have like my hair done and then I show
you guys my dress and everything we went
on a party bus and I thought I would
bring my camera along and I got a few
clips I didn't get that many because it
was kind of awkward to film but I still
thought that I kind of captured like the
overall feel of the entire party bus a
little bit and then I also included some
pictures and I also have some bloopers
so if you guys want to see that there at
the very end so yeah I'm really excited
about this video and I'm really happy
that I was able to capture this all on
camera even if it wasn't me capturing it
so I'm really thankful that my friends
were able to so I am really excited to
show you guys this video and I hope you
guys try it ok grace what are we doing
right now
we're blowing up balloons for you know
to ask Emery to prom
okay we are trying to
we just finished so we have all these
balloons here what type of science name
I guess you know discrete fashion yeah
it's like Mila Kunis but she's from
Russia no it's not filling it yeah no I
think you know the walls there here it
was telling them it is the final product
the process
so the look that I wore to prom is
actually really similar to the first
prom makeup tutorial in my little prom
series and the face makeup is actually
the exact same so I'm not going to
repeat what I did for the face because
it's pretty repetitive so if you want to
see that you can click on the screen now
to watch that process but I'm still
showing all the steps with all the
products listed on the bottom of the
screen so it's pretty easy either way
and I will talk to you guys when I get
on to the eye makeup
so unlike my last video I kind of
changed up my eye look a little bit I
use this really pretty top-shelf duo
from bareMinerals and using the pink
color I applied this on my eyelid as
well as my brow bone then I use the gold
color to create that fake crease that
I've been talking about in my last few
videos and I just did this over and over
again until I was satisfied with my
crease and then I use the pale pink
color again on the lower lash line and
then to dramatize look a little bit more
I layered a darker brownish gold color
to the outer beam
next I use this flat definer brush to
apply a layer of eyeliner and I think
the flat definer brush makes application
so much easier and much more
natural-looking and then I use these are
dealt edgy crazy lashes and apply these
on and at first I cut them in two
because I think that makes the
application a lot easier and I really
like these lashes except that they had
some weird type of adhesive on the very
bottom of the lash which is really weird
which made applying them kind of hard
but I still like them a lot and then to
blend those two together I applied a lot
of coats of my favorite mascara to
finish off the entire look I use this
new marvelous Moxie in ringleader and I
really really like this I just got it
it's from bareMinerals and it is super
super pretty
so here's the entire finished look with
my hair and everything I got my hair
done at a salon and it was really really
pretty I liked how it turned out in
pictures
but I wasn't too happy with it because
it did fall while I was at prom and so I
had to go to the bathroom and pin it
back up so I wasn't too happy with that
so next time I think I might go for like
an updo especially from getting it done
in a salon but I still really liked it
and it looked really good for pictures
so here's the dress that I wore to prom
and this is something that I was not at
all expecting to get I was expecting
something completely different from my
dress but the girl at the local boutique
that was helping me pulled this out she
was like I think this look really good
on you and I was like wow that dress is
crazy I'm not getting that but I tried
it on and I fell in love with it it's
super unique and the color is just
amazing so I really really like this
dress
and I also got it for a really good
price so I was pretty happy with this
dress and for shoes I wore these Steve
Madden heels that I got in sale for $30
why are waiting to get on the bus
everyone feels no sorry boss
that is mine okay let's go
I am
thank you
you're in
it's got to be really cool
hit the ground cause all the balloons
you guys want to see me in a balloon pit
that's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
