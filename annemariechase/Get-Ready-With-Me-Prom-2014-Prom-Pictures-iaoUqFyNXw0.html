stars beautiful beautiful so for all my
face makeups which is my primer
foundation concealer highlighter blush
bronzer and all that stuff I basically
do the exact same thing as I do for my
everyday full coverage makeup routine
except I emphasize everything just a
little bit more so I can get a flawless
face for pictures and so that'll last
all night long so a little bit more
foundation for coverage a little bit
more concealer some blush so if you want
to see this process you can click on the
screen now while I'm do it my face
makeup to go to my full coverage makeup
routine or it'll be linked in the
description box below just to save at
this video for becoming too
so first I'm priming my eyes with Mac's
painterly paint-pot and I will have all
the products listed in order below
because I'm not showing them so be sure
to check that out if you're curious then
I'm using this tape to create a clean
line for my eyeshadow and I'm
positioning it so that it follows the
curve of my eyes to about the end of my
eyebrows and this works really well for
all different sorts of eyes shapes and
different people I guess cuz I did this
on my friend Lily and I think it worked
out really well for her so the first
shadow that I'm using is called
unconditional from the lorac unzipped
palette and I'm placing this to
emphasize my crease and then I'm
highlighting the inner corners of my
eyes first with this NYX jumbo eye liner
in milk and I found that patting this
works way better than blending it with
your fingers like I did in my previous
videos so just Pat that eye liner on and
then I put this Mac eye shadow and
shroom on top of where I put the
eyeliner and this combination I think is
perfect and makes the shadow stand out
and last for a really long time
then i'm using the color undercover from
the same palette and putting this all
over my lid
next I am using this Mac shadow called
satin taupe and I'm blending this into
my crease a little bit and along the
upper lash line so now I'm doing the
outer V and I'm using the Naked 2
palettes darkest color or shade which is
black out so I got this Mac pigment in
vanilla because I thought it was the
glitter that I wanted when I looked it
up online um but it wasn't but it was a
pretty color anyways so I decided to use
this super last minute which was
definitely not on my prom advice list
but it turned out fine so I got pretty
lucky I guess
so I used a wet brush and patted this
onto my lid
and then I just went over and blended
the satin taupe into the crease again
next I put undercover from the lorac
unzipped palette as a brow bone
highlight and then I just lined my lower
lash line with the satin taupe color
from Mac that I used earlier for
eyeliner I used a gel liner to just line
my upper lash line and then give myself
a super thin wing and then I just
finished off the look with these ardell
lashes I didn't use dramatic lashes at
all but this is definitely the time to
use dramatic lashes if you want to so I
would I would say go for it if you want
to and I wish I would have used more
dramatic lashes because these lashes are
really more for everyday use
so as you guys can see here's the point
where my friends walk in and if you want
to see all my friends and what we did on
the problem you can check out my prom
blog link down below like I said but
then I just finished applying my false
lashes this particular day I was really
struggling with my false lashes as you
guys can tell but it worked out in the
end well
so finally I just curled my lashes
applied a coat of my favorite mascara
which is the benefit they're real
mascara and then I got some mascara on
my eyelid and then I cleaned it off and
then I took off the tape and here is the
final reveal so if you decide to use a
tape for your makeup look after doing
your face makeup like me and it takes
off that foundation and whatever you had
on underneath just use some concealer or
go over it with your foundation and that
should do the trick and finally I use my
Anastasia brow gel and Too Faced route
and B kit to fill in and keep my
eyebrows removing anywhere and I ended
up just using my bare minerals ring
glitter lip gloss I don't think I show
it for some reason I think I forgot and
that is my entire look so now I'm going
to include some of my favorite pictures
from prom and a little prom slideshow
and before you ask where any of the
dresses are from - check the description
box because I'm going to be asking my
friends where their dresses are from
because I've been getting a lot of
questions on my Instagram and my prom
blog so be sure to check the entire
description box it'll be filled with
information so I hope you guys like
these pictures and yeah I'm just gonna
show you them now

a song for you like this
