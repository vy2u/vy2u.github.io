a really really cool video because it's
a collab the person that I'm doing this
collab with is ava from my life is ava
and I will put all of her links
throughout this video and in the downbar
below but ok so Emma anybody is
seriously an amazing YouTube guru one
thing that I really like about Ava's
videos is that she has a really distinct
style and she also uses makeup that's
really accessible and affordable and
stuff like that so she has really really
high-quality videos every single week
sometimes like two to three times a week
which is really impressive and she's
also becoming like one of my best
YouTube friends which is kind of weird
she's extremely helpful like I'll ask
her like editing tips and tricks and
stuff like that and she's just like an
extremely nice person and you guys
should go check her out right now links
down below and annotate it throughout
this video the theme on this collab
video is girls night out and I really
think that everyone should have a girls
night out at least once every two weeks
everyone has those times where you're
really stressed out you get super busy
and you just don't have any time for
your girls
how many girls side outs make sure that
you keep in touch with all of your
friends keep updated it's really stress
relieving it's really fun and it's just
a good way to make sure that you're
really close with all your girls and you
know that you and your girls are gonna
be taking a ton of pictures together so
you want to be sure that you have a
picture or the face and outfit I created
this makeup look to be pretty picture
perfect and I also created an outfit
that's wearable and really comfortable
but still dressed up so I hope you guys
like this look and keep watching I'm
starting off with a freshly foundation
face and I'm going straight into
contouring with my NARS Laguna bronzer
and I just contoured the hollows of my
cheek bones as well as the temples of my
forehead and here I'm just blending it
out with a big clean fluffy brush in
order to make sure that there are no
harsh line
next I've primed my eyes with my Urban
Decay primer potion and I made sure to
prime all over the lid underneath the
brow bone and underneath the lower lash
line using my Urban Decay Naked 2
palette i use the color booty-call and
apply this all over my lid
so for the rest of this makeup look I
just use the Too Faced natural at night
palette and the first color that I'm
using is night cap so what I did with
this color was applied it right above my
crease to make it a little bit more
dramatic and this is a really cool step
to do if you don't have a very prominent
crease you can kind of fake one and it
works really well depending on how
dramatic or how much pigment you use in
your crease line next I use my tapered
blending brush from Sigma and I just
wanted a clean brush in order to blend
all of the colors that I just applied on
together in order to create some depth
to the makeup look I applied a night cap
on the outer corners of the eyes and
then I blended it out with the same
blending brush in order to concentrate
the color around that area
and then I use my fluffy tapered
blending brush to blend those colors
together
and then I use the darkest color in the
palette which is a matte brown color and
applied this to the outer V blending it
in to the crease moving onto the lower
lash line I use the color nightcap again
and applied this on the entire lower
lash line except for the first third and
finally for the inner corner highlight I
use this really pretty shimmery gold
color called full moon next I use my Too
Faced candlelight glow in order to
highlight my brow bone and then I set
and lightly filled in any sparse areas
of my eyebrows for eyeliner I use this
Abita eye pencil and I really like this
eye liner because it's really waxy and
very blendable so here you can see that
I'm just using my ring finger to gently
blend the eyeliner out
as always curl your lashes and apply
your favorite mascara I'm using the
Maybelline Rockette volume express
mascara which is waterproof because you
never really know we're gonna do
especially on a girls night out and then
for the lower lashes i'm using the
Clinique lower lash line mascara which
is perfect for getting the individual
lower lashes to complete the entire look
I use the Too Faced highlighter on my
cheekbones and then I use this borin
lippy mango peach lip balm to give my
lips just a little bit of shine
so now that the makeup is complete I'm
gonna move on to the outfit and for the
outfit I wanted something that was
really cute and picture worthy but still
comfortable and wearable for whatever
plans that I had that night
don't forget to spritz on your favorite
body spray or perfume before you leave
the house so where I live it's actually
still freezing outside so I'm just going
to layer up so that I'm still
comfortable on my girls night out
