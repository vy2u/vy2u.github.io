since I filmed my last video as always
but I graduated and I finished all of my
summer duties I just finished my job and
I'm free to make videos for the rest of
the summer so yeah yeah this video is
gonna be a lot like my prom video I'm
gonna do a get ready with me for
graduation and then at the end I will
include pictures so I hope you guys
enjoy it alright so starting off with a
bear face I'm using Maybelline's new
baby skin instant pore eraser it's
basically the same thing as benefits
Porefessional except it's a lot cheaper
and it's just a little more oily but
once you put your foundation on you
can't tell on top of that I use the
covergirl three-in-one foundation I just
got this it's really cool it's like a
primer foundation and concealer all in
one and this has really good coverage
which is what I usually look for in
foundation so I've really been liking it
so far and for concealer I've been using
my Mac Pro Longwear concealer for like
all of my acne spots I stopped using
this but I don't know why cuz it also
has really good coverage and it
generally just lasts for a long time and
then finally for concealer I just
conceal the dark circles underneath my
eyes and to set all of that concealer
and foundation I use my Maybelline press
powder and all these products will be
listed in the description box in case
you're wondering and in case I don't get
the products right mm-hmm so as you guys
know or may not know I am obsessed with
this Mac pull frost highlighter it is
amazing so I'm just using that on my
cheekbones to highlight my cheekbones
and nowhere else really and then I'm
using this Nivea mint and minerals
refreshing lip balm it looks like a glue
stick and then I am priming my eyelids
with Urban Decay primer potion and I'm
applying this all over my eyelid to the
brow bone and then underneath the lower
lash line I didn't want a super dramatic
eye makeup look so I use the Naked 3
palette and I use a color nooner to
accentuate my crease and just to give it
somewhere to mention
and you guys can tell that this makes a
huge difference it just actually makes
your eyes look dimensional I guess I
don't know
and then for eyeshadow I used my
favorite and only Mac eye shadow which
is the color shroom this is a really
pretty white shimmery eye shadow and
it's also perfect for highlighting the
inner corners of your eyes and also the
brow bones or your brow bones I don't
know that's not it weird for some reason
I don't know why I don't usually line my
entire lash line for eyeliner because I
have like almond shaped eyes so it looks
better on the outer half so I'm just
using some soft like eyeliner that I
probably got in my Ipsy bag and then I'm
curling my lashes and using my favorite
mascara it's the benefit they're real
mascara and this really makes your
lashes look like they're false lashes or
they just look very long and full so I
really like this mascara and I highly
recommend it if you're looking for a new
mascara and on the lower lash line I'm
using my Clinique lower lash line
mascara you can use any mascara but this
basically just has a really small
applicator which makes it kind of fun
and easy to apply this to your lower
lashes and finally for my eyebrows first
I just kind of straighten them out with
the spoolie and then I go over them with
my Anastasia brow gel and to fill them
in I as always used my brow Envy kit
from Too Faced I really liked how simple
this makeup look was my school colors
are orange and black a lot of like
dramatic makeup really clash with those
colors so I just stuck to the basics and
oh my gosh curling my hair was such a
chore so the first thing that I did my
hair has been really tangley lately I go
a few days in the summer without
brushing it and I was at a school for a
little while before my graduation so
here's like part of my brush coming up
my hair cuz I have this nasty rat's nest
it's so disgusting but I just brush it
out and then I use a heat protectant I
got this method for my sister because
she noticed that my hair was basically
impossible to hold curls with so I'm
using this curling iron this is like the
hot tools I think it's a one and
1/2 inch and I just curl my hair and
wait for this to heat up from my hair
it's really thick so it takes a really
long time and then I bunch all of my
hair up and keep it in a little curl
that it is in and then I put the clip on
to make sure that it stays while it's
still heated so right after I take it
off the iron
I put it in this bunch and then clip it
so that it can set that way
and then I hairspray after all that so
this process took forever because I have
a ton of hair but it ends up pretty good
and it's not that hard to do so that's
what my hair looks like right when I
curled it but then it settled down a
little bit during graduation and now I'm
going to show you guys some pictures
with like a little slideshow music
background so I hope you guys enjoy this
video
there's a maniac
got a page on the shoulder
