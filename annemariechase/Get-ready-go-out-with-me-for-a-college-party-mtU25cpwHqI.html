o'clock I woke up like five minutes ago
and it was so great because I don't even
remember when I fell asleep last night I
was just so tired I fell asleep it was
probably around like 9 or 10 and then I
also didn't set an alarm this morning
and I just woke up feel really well
rested there was a ton of noise outside
is that my hair well today alright I'm
just planning on having like a really
really relaxed study day I'll tell you
guys more about it but I think I'm just
gonna get ready so like I force myself
to get ready and like actually not look
like this I'm vlogging in the morning
because I always do this like first
thing in the morning I'm like hey guys
and then I'm like oh why do I do this so
yeah we're gonna get ready while I vlog
and talk to you guys about the things
that I was going to write now let's do
it okay so I'm doing my makeup I just
washed my face I didn't send an alarm I
didn't know when I fell asleep and I
usually have a pretty hard time falling
asleep sometimes when I'm just laying
there for like 30 minutes I start to get
like really frustrated and anxious and
then I'll like get up and like start
going on my phone for like two hours and
then just you know waste my entire night
when I was having trouble sleeping like
two days ago I looked up on podcasts
just sleep and then I found this podcast
sleep with me podcast it was the
weirdest thing but I fell asleep within
like 10 to 20 minutes and it's this guy
I'm listening to a different podcast
right now but I will bring it up so it
basically sounds like you know how when
you're just falling asleep but you're
still like thinking thoughts as you do
so you're like oh like I saw a cat
yesterday and like you're like why did I
why am I even thinking about a cat and
then you started thinking really weird
thoughts like oh the cat was like really
long and really really wide it was
almost as big as my friend and they're
just really really logical like crazy
thoughts but it's because you're like
transitioning into sleep and then when
you think about it or when you catch
yourself like thinking these things
you're like oh my god that was so weird
and then you realize it's like how do
you were falling asleep and then that's
usually when I stopped being able fall
asleep and then get really mad
but this podcast I think does the exact
same thing he just talks about the
weirdest like randomest things that I
just makes you like somehow fall asleep
I was listening for like 10 to 20
minutes and I still have no idea what he
was talking about and it's perfect for
sleeping so I'll just show you guys a
clip of what he sounds like and then
we'll have some thank yous so here's the
thing with the podcast you don't really
need to listen to it you can kind of
listen to it you can passively listen to
it you can barely pay attention talk
about you know some people don't even do
like understand what I'm saying is it
turn the volume so low down so low yeah
it's just a mumble or you know they play
this different animal shelters now that
are playing the five cast which is so
touching to me because I love animals I
remember he was talking about how his
show was like a melodrama without drama
melodrama like he just kept talking
about that
so that has actually made me fall asleep
for the past two nights it's been
working really really well for me and
I'm really excited to find something
other than like melatonin that does so I
don't know I might keep using it like
let me know if you guys check it out
it's called sleep with me and the guy
seems really funny he has a very unique
voice and it's like pretty cool really
treating myself this morning with tater
tots scrambled eggs and a veggie sausage
and I'm so excited to eat and I'm really
hungry and I might watch TV while I do
it it is a few hours later I've done
some cleaning and cleaned up the kitchen
a little just like the stuff that I've
been avoiding during finals so I'm gonna
open my don't blog miss gifts and if you
guys don't know what do't is it is
basically an online shopping mall you
guys can get your first five dollars
free if use a code and marine basically
just getting five dollars for free to
shop where you usually shop anyway so
definitely download it and follow me
but there's day eight we hope you love
it
dost liking look
oh my god this is so cute
it's from misguided this would look good
with the outfit that I have on now I
have liked Lululemon cropped pants they
might wear this today I might look to my
match II actually might wear this today
adorable
Wow thank you so much don't it's just
like super simple but like that's kind
of just how my style is like really I
please your basic simple whatever this
is what it looks like this matches like
a little too well it's kind of weird I
could actually wear this to yoga workout
guys I like I used to not really be able
to do push-ups and my family has always
been pretty athletic and so I was always
like the weak one who didn't know how to
do like push-ups but look at look at
that I could move it closer but it's a
little harder okay
getting your right when you're genuinely
out of breath from doing two push-ups
hey guys so it's 5:20 now and I had some
big plans for today I ended up just
staying at home and editing my vlogmas
and hanging out with my roommate Nurik
Shawn just talking with her I don't know
if it's like the day or just I don't
know but I just I'm just not in the best
mood and that's okay like it's been a
really hard month so I don't expect to
always be in a good mood I've been in a
pretty good mood this month surprisingly
like I thought this was gonna be like a
really difficult month and stuff but
luckily I have plans tonight it's Friday
night and it's Elliott's birthday and I
think me and all my roommates are gonna
go over there I'm gonna go eat now cuz
I'm so hungry
and I will vlog more when I am doing
something I will have to say though I
really really really appreciate that I'm
doing vlogmas my vlogmas right now cuz
it it just like gives me something to do
and something to look forward to so
thank you guys so much if you have been
watching and leaving comments I know
like I'm a very consistent blogger I do
not deserve the support and like
followers that I have just for how
inconsistent I am but I really genuinely
appreciate all of you guys so much you
guys just always give me something to
look forward to so it'll be guys so much
I'm gonna run out of space really soon
and assignments are coming I'm just
gonna I'm just gonna watch TV
it is now 807 I actually studied for at
least like maybe an hour to an hour and
a half which was not really in my plan
for the day but I was on my blog and my
comments weren't loading and then I was
like I can't be on my phone right now
cuz I'm addicted to it and I don't want
to feed my addiction so I started
studying but yeah I'm so tired this
grandma does not go out a lot but I'm
excited to see Elliot and I feel like
I'll see a lot of friends there I'm
gonna get up and like I
call this a get ready with me for a
college party even though I look pretty
much the exact same as I always did when
I put me my makeup on know what I'm
going for
I never really get dressed up for
anything and I feel like house parties
are like not something you really get
dressed up for but I know that I'll
probably see a lot of people that I know
so I don't know maybe I'll try a little
bit
maybe not I'm gonna play some music I
think people are napping and I know
narek shells on the phone so I don't
think anyone's like really ready to go
on time
no listen to my top top songs 2017
if any of you guys out there are engine
and get Asian blow and didn't know there
is a cure for it this is what it looks
like I don't know if I should be putting
this on the Internet well no well I mean
I didn't know there's a cure for it into
like quite a while so don't judge me
it's funny cuz I don't I usually really
don't care about how I look but when I
spent so much time editing myself I'm
like why couldn't I just like put my
hair up normally route taken one more
second and then wouldn't have to stare
at my hair so there you go
Danbury oh I tried
oh I'll play you guys one of my favorite
songs and one of my top listen to songs
okay it's called grows old my third
story just look it up it has so many
different layers like if you listen to
it really loud or with headphones on
it's so cool
everyone I've showed it to really likes
it
that's how I get pumped for the party
you know all right I'm pretty much done
getting ready
are you building my hair but probably
not it looks like grace your life it
should be doubly looks Gracie you really
don't know why I washed it yesterday
this is my finished makeup look it's
really nothing special I feel like I'm
talking so quietly I feel like my whole
house is sleeping but I think everyone's
awake they're just in that room and I
really want to do my hair but I don't
think anyone else is ready I guess I
could put time into putting it outfit
together how much time do you guys
usually get ready cuz like I really just
I don't get ready and take time to get
ready for a lot of things other than
just like basic makeup and I sometimes
do my hair but like I know that some
people take a really long time to get
ready like what is your guys's average I
honestly feel like sometimes I should
put more effort into bangs because I
just don't care enough but I don't think
that's always a good thing I think it's
like supposed to find a balance I might
just put some dry shampoo and then to
call it good you guys are really far
from here

is like teaching if you have not tried
it
