know I shouldn't be on here but hey guys
I'm with Joshua I decided to do like a
vlog on my main channel cuz I haven't
really been blogging my blog channel and
this is like the perfect time because
I'm gonna be with Tosh I'm Gretchen
actually pretty early we got up like
it's probably both at like 7:30 okay I
don't mind
yeah that's fine thank you so much so we
all struggled to get up early cuz we're
going to yeah I've heard about this from
like multiple people but I've never gone
so I'm really excited
that was really fun it was actually
really cool and there are a lot of cool
things like enclosed by that were pretty
cheap I mean somewhere like stable
priced it's been kind of cool every day
I would pants yeah and vans and I am
white steamy yeah should we all call
that we got oh my gosh I got a two piece
set yeah this is really cute these are
the shorts and then the top is like a
little crop top
yeah that's adorable but it's like a
geode with some hanging chains called
Tasha what's your channel Oh fiercely
Tasha he's been in a lot of my bridges
okay I found these American Apparel
shorts they were done oh that's such a
steal literally a steal they're my size
I was like hey smell it it's not good I
don't know Justin this means a literally
yeah that one's really cool like is
obsessed with the rams and this is like
this vintage scarf and then they're
coming back everything
yeah I got like the most plain boring
thing but this is like one of the things
that you were like looking at so cute
yeah so now we're gonna go get some
foods that toast I love toast I'm so
much I've never been like seeing
pictures it's it's flawless
oh wait Gretchen what's your channel Oh
veggie burger actually
our car is like 100 degrees or Enochs
it's just parked in the Sun oh we just
say that toast and it was so weird
because we saw like literally at least
10 you take we saw Danielle Danielle
Danielle Marie she's a Brooke and I were
to say we came because she is really
nice
she was super friendly and then we saw
Lindsay Hughes and Megan and like Lexie
and drew yeah there are so many people
that I was so weird
that's a place to see I can't stop Joe
well yeah but like I like ugly dog I
should
like they weren't there yeah that'd be
so cool like a Velcro yeah
don't go thinking yeah the bottom of
your camera you want to get out here you
can cuz like no one something being in
front of me so I just dropped Gretchen
and Tasha off no I'm just waiting behind
a bunch of cars at the Grove because I
have plans to go hiking we want to leave
around 4:00 and it's like 2:30 right now
so I didn't think that I had time to
like stop and park and stuff like that
it's the girls kind of busy too we're
gonna hopefully go hiking if everyone
cancels I'll be so mad though cuz I
could have like like the girl but all
good cuz we had I mean I had a lot of
fun with Gretchen and Tasha both of them
have channels if you guys want to check
them out I was just thinking because I
was trying to explain like why I like
Tasha and Gretchen so much and I feel
like in LA at least like a lot of the
people that I know maybe it's just like
the people that I'm meeting because I'm
surrounded by them I don't know
and I feel like a lot of people are like
really fake or like social-climbing or
just just like super materialistic or
just not genuine and with Tasha and
Gretchen you could just tell they're
both like really really nice and like a
real and genuine and they also like
recognize that other people are like
kind of fake or social-climbing
you have that type of like
self-awareness and just like like
awareness of your surroundings and like
other people those are like the type of
people that I can like actually like
talk to and like vibe with I don't know
why I just said bye with because it's
definitely not something that I would
ever say but like I feel like that's
something Jacob would say or something
but okay I just got really nice driving
deep thoughts did not go hiking as kind
of I saw that girl but now we're just
you know like killing time before their
flight challenge and we're at Jacobs
apartment his apartment is way cooler
than mine cuz it has like a pool yeah
it's basically your wrists or yeah right
now we're just apartment and we're gonna
take pictures because their roof is
really cool so I've always wanted to
take pictures here
that's a little funny innit photo shoot
you
what are we doing now guys I just have
an Irish fire hot spots we got over eats
yesterday it was like really convenient
and like good and since they're leaving
tonight for the airport they want to go
out so we're gonna get some fever eath
cuz they're gonna use my co to get
twenty dollars see what's on the menu
tonight
yeah yes
uber eats we're not sure yeah yeah yeah
the tons of options too many a bit oh
but OB Oh Gretchen edible it's super
vegan yeah they have lots of good it's
really good look it up on Yelp oh I
think I'm gonna get edible too hey it
says on this no need to tip that
answered their questions here tough and
tall you're tipping story yeah okay so
and I assume that the tip was included
in pizza like pizza guy and normally
it's like a student that works for time
ago but it was a pizza guy and he was
like what was my tip and I was like oh
I'm sorry I thought it was included he's
like no it's not included like you cash
on you right now and I was like no like
I can go get some if you want
he's like my food came first oh my oh no
look what I told you now it's getting
stuck wait five actually 43 there is
chocolate chips in my bag
my relatives to completion and they were
in my bag and it's really hot out and
they melted my camera was in my bag and
I pulled it out and there was melted
chocolate all over the lens and I was
like it's done for so then I took like a
talent was cleaning it out way forever
and I was like success it's good and
then the guy looks like a colder
environment in the lens like it's stuck
there was like chocolate melted like
stucco trying to clean it so many times
like I think it hardens when it's like
cold yeah yeah and it's hot actually
does it was really hot and it was
opening you just have to push it and it
opens just does enjoy your dinner take
care I think they have like a promotion
right now I think it's cuz they're just
trying to get the word out about uber
eats if you use a code you can get $20
off your meal and if you look at like
the uber eats app it's usually like a
few share code you get $10 off your meal
so I'm pretty sure it's usually $10 but
now it's $20 I really know if it expires
or if that's the actual price you can
get $20 off your first meal so it's
actually really nice to be all just got
food for like one two three dollars yeah
let's this is so good actually
oh gosh my food came the big of Oh
another one
Marguerite we just went to our sounds
excessive we use like everyone's Rico
free first code
yeah back home oh okay so it is 10:30
and I already know this is not cute now
back in my apartment everyone has two
left which is really sad but I'm so glad
that I got to see Tasha and Gretchen I
was actually really fun because we all
just got a ton of food all for like
literally like one two three dollars
because we just used the codes so we all
just got free basically free meals
previously like I think that they
literally only had like five items from
like different places but that was it
like literally didn't even have
vegetarian options or vegan but now I
think they've really updated and
upgraded their app so that there's like
a list of ten to fifteen different
places that are all like really popular
and really good and within each of those
restaurants there are like like a dozen
menu items listed so I think they really
rebooted their system and I don't even
know what or how I came across it again
I think I just really didn't feel like
going out to eat but I don't really
remember how who breeds crossed my mind
I see a bug all the way across my wall
but yeah so I don't know how they came
to mind but I'm so glad I did because
like we've been using it for like the
last two nights and it's just so much
nicer than having to like go out and get
food if you're just like feeling really
lazy and it's also just literally like a
1 dollar meal a 1 dollar meal that would
like cost you $20 so if you guys want to
use my code I will link it in the
description box below kind of long code
it's like eats a marine a 1 I don't know
so all-around a fan so yeah you guys
want feel free to download and then get
a free meal basically if you spend over
under $20 then I'm gonna go to sleep now
