you know just friends it's pretty
platonic the entire time until one night
no I don't know at the time and then he
told me he was like drop the bomb yeah
yeah he's like really boom hey guys its
Emory and today I have recurring cast
this is my finish each other's
sandwiches ha ha ha
what's your name Jacob this is um my
boyfriend and he's actually been in a
video before this one it was the yoga
challenge so today we wanted to do a
story time video this one's kind of cute
yeah we actually kind of like two
different stories first official time we
met and then the second story is kind of
a different one well the first time we
first time it's the real story that
started off this beautiful journey with
isn't beautiful woman the first time we
ever met was uh through my friend Jason
Zhang it was freshman year and actually
have a blog he literally took my camera
for like video and it's I went over to
his friend like he's really good friends
dorm to like basically pull an
all-nighter I was like there till 4:00
it was right before Easter
I had a big chocolate Easter Bunny
because my mom said to Timmy and he came
in all I remember is we talked about
being Papa which means like half-asian
half-white and that I offered my Easter
Bunny to like him and his friends and
then he ate it it was a pretty brief
interaction I think the whole thing
lasted like 10 minutes at most
probably was okay so that's the first
time we met and then the second time
it's much more interesting me and my
friend George and a couple other guys
decided to make this club called
collegiate mentors but it's basically a
mentorship program where we I'm gonna
get matched up with high school students
who are trying to go through the college
application process Tori sent out like a
Facebook message and he was like hey I'm
starting this club if anyone wants to
join like oh yeah personal message me
and I knew George from a mutual class so
I was like hey this sounds really cool
like this is definitely something I'd be
interested in
she only reached out to him because she
I had no idea I thought he was like the
only person involved and so there's like
a big plane I think you're probably
gonna hurt with this okay so I messaged
George and I was like hey this sounds
super cool I would love to join this
program like tell me more about it and
so I met up with George he had this
entire like binder full of information
on the different roles like he was super
organized and I was like wow this is
like very well liked thought-out I
didn't actually you're a part of like
the planning process of this start the
club thing and he was like I think your
best role for this club would be a
social media video production team and I
already have a friend named Jacob in
that role and I like had an idea who
Jacob was so that's not true I had an
idea rock me on Instagram okay I
honestly don't remember making a
connection for this the only memory that
I have of him was that I came across
this Instagram because I was Instagram
and I was like do anything this guy's
cute I just assumed to remember asking
myself that
but his profile was on private so I
couldn't like further explore he was
like yeah my friend Jacobs on this team
- so you guys will work together and I
was like okay we started like a group
group chat is me Emery and the other do
Jason all of us will work on the video
team and the I remember texting her the
first time like we all said messaged
each other no I text it and I was like
hey guys its Amory like George wanted me
to ask you guys when he can meet up and
I was like wait who's every hahaha i
legit was like oh he has no idea who I
am because keep in mind like I had like
one friend at USC at this point and I
was super like oh this guy just
definitely doesn't know who I am I just
like imagine myself like hey guys every
and that he said that I like shut the
door I was like just kidding never mind
it was like clearly a joke but I took it
like I was like oh so we were like
trying to coordinate times to meet and
Jason is always busy last semester in
the spring I don't know what was up with
that maybe he was busy 24/7 no time yeah
he was in dance involved in a lot of
different clubs so at it all ended up
with just me and Emery meeting for the
video production meeting yeah and we met
at Annenberg and I
vacation school yeah I'm seeing her she
we sat at her booth was kind of like one
of those movie moments were a shot a
spotlight shined on her from the side
and damn girl and I remember I have
really like ugly outfit on and my hair
looked really bad I was like wow this
guy's gonna think I'm so weird and like
rose but it went really well like we got
along really well we look I don't think
we had like a second of like not talking
the out of time and so we were just kind
of like going back and forth and talking
about videos and production and stuff
like that and it was like very
interesting yeah no it was conversation
great dialogue lots of back and forth
and the rapport was built and
established very early on I was ready to
hit the ground running with the club was
ready to meet up do another one-on-one
meet up with Dan Marino's you know
project let's get it going I just really
need more excuses to see her I was just
like in it yeah and this whole time I
had no idea cuz you like obviously liked
me before like no yeah so I had no idea
and like I couldn't tell even like
further along a week or two or three
later I couldn't tell if he was like
flirting with me or not like he just
literally gave zero sign like absolutely
none there's reasons for that but well
like I'll tell it later so he gave no
signs but I was like I mean this could
be a thing I remember we had like this
big collegiate mentors meeting so I went
to his apartment for the first time we
were sitting down and I met one of his
friends so I was like talking to her he
sat next to me and then our legs were
like our legs were like touching but
like just barely so I was like I'm not
sure if that was on accident or on
purpose so I just had no idea but also I
had like no reason to think that he like
liked me at all because he's like a very
social person he has like a lot of
friends and so I just thought that we
got along so well just because it was
like him and he just gets along really
well with everyone but I thought that
was the reason why we were like clicking
so much my god he's like well I just had
no reason to think that like there was
anything more so I was just like oh like
this guy's a really cool person it's a
cool cat right here I got all my hands
friend at the time we like started
texting a lot more daily yeah early
secondly but it's it wasn't anything
flirtatious at all he would always be
like my moon
yes as cool cuz like so I had like
Dining Dollars freshman year and the
mics used to always see here was like
I'd get you coffee I just said Cass
am i real and then yeah and of course I
was like three money wasn't mixed up
that we had like during the collegiate
mentor meeting oh no we were like we're
okay we have a bad like an entire Club
meeting at like seven and I like
honestly this is like a berry it was
just like a mistake but I was like he
was like all right what time do you want
to meet up
that was like five should work cuz I
thought it was an hour before but I
don't know
so just sounded like I really wanted to
like have like a huge amount of time
with him before this meeting but then he
would also invite me to do things with
him but every single time he would
invite me to do something or just like
hang out he would always invite a friend
or friends that just made it really
confusing no cuz I just had no idea and
I was like I don't know if this guy I
like
so yeah nothing like outside of anything
you know just friends it's pretty
platonic the entire time until one night
and you were gone you were in I don't
where was I
here in Texas like up until this point
as I like said previously we hadn't like
texted anything weird or any like I mean
we don't talk to strictly friends yeah
yeah very like friendly um no sign of
like flirting at all this night he I
remember you texted me
something about how I was pretty do you
remember that maybe I honestly don't
remember what did I say you were just
like oh you like called me miss pretty
or something
Oh probably yeah but this is like
literally the first time that he showed
any sign of like anything hmm
this was like one of the five times that
I can count on my hand that would that I
went out and I went to his house cuz
he's in a fraternity at USC and um
actually went out with pooja yeah Jay
and Jason yeah I have a picture of that
night and um I do this me that picture
he's funny yeah so I went to his house
and then this guy named M I met him once
before at like some social event but I
didn't know him that well we came up to
me and he was like hey Emory like how
are you in Jacob
I was like yeah I have no idea like
what's going on with Jake
I don't I can't tell if he likes me or
like what I was pretty good friends with
em so she didn't know but he had been
kind of caught up to date with yeah how
things were going out I don't know at
the time and then we told me he was like
dropped the ball yeah yeah you like
really mmm he was like yeah Jacob really
likes you he actually broke up with his
girlfriend because of you
like what first of all I had no idea
that he liked me at all or like anything
like that and then second of all I had
just no idea that he he had a girlfriend
so I was so confused I could have been
so weirded out by this because up until
this point I was just like I was pretty
sure we were friends and I like maybe
was interested but he just wasn't giving
me any signs and then this guy tells me
that this guy broke up with his
girlfriend for me who like we were just
friends at the time and I like was just
really confused and I was so confused
and I could have been so creeped out by
that yeah could it really likes gray he
could em could have dropped the ball on
me real quick but the baby she did but
like I just I mean I didn't really take
it that seriously yeah luckily she was
pretty understanding person but I mean
that that explains the whole reason why
I was pretty like non flirtatious yeah
he like never cross the line or anything
yeah I just backed I kept like at my
boundaries for the sake of the
relationship because I believe in
monogamy I don't know but I was just I'm
gonna call this girl X she and I had a
thing freshman year we talked a few
times and never took it seriously and
then come sophomore year we decided to
just give it a shot and so we did and it
was kind of it worked and healthy oh no
it was definitely I was it was unhealthy
like I'm in the sense that like it just
felt a little forced on my part and
things like I recognized it and like I
just kind of kept giving the
relationship more opportunities and
through that entire relationship I was
honestly kind of like questioning I was
like what do I really like this girl but
I kept telling myself that I do says
like I'll give it another shot so I was
never really sure 100% about my feelings
for this person and then to be
completely honest the first time that I
met Ann Marie and we had that one-on-one
meeting at Annenberg was kind of an
eye-opening moment because I realized I
was like I like at the moment like wow
like this is what it really feels like
to like a girl and that's how I knew
obviously get
this other way jib isn't really gonna
work out but I just was struggling a lot
during the time with like moral issues
with myself and so I didn't really know
how to handle it um I kept my distance
in regards to feelings with anne-marie
and I kept them at bay the entire time
and then I broke up with her after I
realized was like you know what I'm 100%
sure that I like this girl not you um
I'm gonna go ahead yeah also really
funny though cuz like after our first
meeting I hate like had no idea this is
oh no I kept my mouth shut and yeah
reason that we're likely weird yeah so
that was we actually explained that to
me like the next time I saw him I told
him I was like yeah your friend and
really kind of creeped me out a little
bit I don't know like I actually wasn't
like creeped out I was just like yeah
like I just didn't know anything about
this so you're like wanna know let me
know what uh I just really wanted me to
understand the situation in my shoes I
would have been like what the heck like
he's yeah really random and like I after
he told me like he pretty much told me
exactly what he told you guys just now
he was just like after like we met the
first time and had really good
conversation I realized like I didn't
like like my girlfriend or whatever and
I just I didn't have feelings for her
and so that's like basically what
happened and he thought that I was gonna
take that super badly but I was like
honestly like that's really sweet like I
just thought I thought it was super
sweet of him and like very nice that he
was being very honest so I wasn't
creeped out at all even though a little
it really like could have been creamy
like just weird so after that it was uh
yes especially from day one he nearly
jotted to date me and up until I kind of
liked it about that get out and I was
like oh maybe yeah this guy after my
friend told her that I liked her um yeah
we just picked up really quickly and
started hanging out like all the time we
started Netflix and chillin
yeah but actually just chillin yeah -
yeah but and we also like studied for
finals like yeah all of finals week
together yeah a lot of time so I went
from like 0 do
real quick we just huh huh huh huh huh
huh Jesus Christ
yeah so that's the rest is history and
then December 8th we started dating
started a new chapter in our life story
- maybe we'll tell it in another video
yeah and before that we had a couple
Instagram oh yeah dates she called it
before we did so you can check that out
