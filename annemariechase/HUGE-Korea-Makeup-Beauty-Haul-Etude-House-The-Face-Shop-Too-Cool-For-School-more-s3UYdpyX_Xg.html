from my vacation from Florida and Korea
and I'm here with a huge Korean makeup
haul so I got a lot of things to show
you guys just a quick disclaimer is that
all this makeup is not completely mine I
do share a lot of beauty products and
stuff like that with my sister and even
my mom so these are not completely mine
I'm just hauling them all I don't have
the prices because I'm gonna try to make
this video as quick as possible because
I have so many things to show you guys
if I can remember them off the top of my
head I will tell you guys them and I'm
gonna tell you them in one and I'll put
the rate of one two US dollar in the
downbar below if you're curious but I
will not be doing the prices for all of
them and finally if you have any
questions on any of the products that I
show you guys just let me know in the
comments below and if you know you want
to know more about a product I'll try to
link those products in the bottom bar
below so I'm just gonna go ahead and get
started now because I hope feeling this
will be kind of a long video the first
place that we went to was skin-food
before my sister and I went shopping we
actually were really overwhelmed with
all the Korean makeup stores and beauty
stores and stuff like that
so we went online to different blogs who
were really familiar with Korean beauty
products so we found a vlog on skin food
and a lot of the things that we got are
based around like what that person in
that blog said I don't know who that
person was my sister found her I don't
even know she was like credible or
anything but we just we just got some
stuff but so far I'm really liking the
things that she suggested one of the
things that she suggested was this argan
oil silk hair mask pack and we also got
kind of like a supplementary argan oil
silk hair essence so this is like kind
of a hair mask that you use once a week
and then this is something that you can
use every few days or so I've used this
so far and after I used it my hair felt
so soft and it smelled so good so I'm
really liking this so far this is
something that my sister found through
her blog it's just a milk shake point
makeup remover and it does look really
milky we have
try that we haven't even opened it yet
the blogger said she liked the lipsticks
from there and a really popular trend
right now in Korea is a really really
bare clean perfect looking skin face and
a pop of color on the lips so we were
kind of inspired to get a lot of
lipsticks so it is these are just two of
a lip sticks that we got this one's just
called ko1 and here's what it looks like
on my lips and then I can also swatch
them both so I'll just do that right now
this is the one that I'm wearing on my
lips right now with like a little lip
gloss over it and the other one is
called ko3 so they don't really have
names that I could read at least cuz the
rest of it is in Korean and so far I
really liked the lipstick that I'm
wearing right now it's really
moisturizing and I'm kind of like one of
those people who has who just always
seems to have like really chapped lips
and it's really annoying
especially when I'm trying to wear
lipstick so even if I have chapped lips
and put that on it'll kind of look like
I don't have chapped lips just because
it's so moisturizing this is what Callie
got so this is an eye cream for wrinkle
care and I really don't know why she's
been getting so many eye creams and
stuff like that and thinks she's been
watching too much Michelle Phan but I
probably I don't know if I'll be using
this at all but um this is just an eye
cream the next thing that I got is this
nose clear patch to reduce blackheads I
always get like poor and blackhead kind
of products just because I haven't
really found one that I really liked and
that's really worked for me I have
really big pores and some blackheads so
far I haven't really found anything that
I like a lot if you guys know of any
products leave them in the comments
below but that's what I got and also I
got this nail polish um the very first
day that we got to Korea we got our gel
nails done and here is what mine look
like this is after over a week and the
only problem is that my nails are going
out because these gel nails are gonna
stay here forever like I really don't
think that they're gonna come off unless
I take them off
but I also really liked the color of
this so I've got kind of a dupe or I
tried to find like a dupe color and I'm
pretty sure this is like two to three
thousand won so it was really really
cheap I'm not sure how it works
so far because I haven't used it because
these nails are just they're still so I
like this nail polish just because you
can't really tell that my nails are
growing out and I'm someone who doesn't
paint their nails every day because I
kind of suck at painting my own nails so
I like to keep them on as long as I can
and then all the rest of these things
are all samples that's another thing
that I absolutely love about Korean
makeup stores as they give you so many
samples this isn't actually a sample
this is just for like purchasing over
like 50,000 won or something you got
this for free this is a green tea body
wash which is really nice actually
because I needed a body wash so that's
cool I'm not sure what this is I can't
read it it's a lot of it's in Korean but
I can see like oh this is a black sugar
mask this one we got a lot of samples of
masks so far and then I think this might
be a soap I'm not really sure it looks
kind of like a soap and then I'm not
really sure what's behind that little
paper so the next place that I went to
was too cool for school and I thought
this was the cutest packaging ever in
the back it has like a bunch of
dinosaurs I don't really know why like
what the theme is but it's just really
really cute and then it has like this
little sticker keep it all shut and yes
I did
take all the bags home to show you guys
like I took all the makeup out packed
them and like my carry or my checking
bag and then refilled them so that's
kind of weird but I really wanted to
show you guys cuz it's adorable so the
first thing that I got was this
marshmallow puff and I'm really excited
about this thing because this is exactly
it like it looks exactly like a Beauty
Blender but it was I think 2001 so it
was way cheaper than a meaty blender I'm
not really sure if it works as well
because I don't have a Beauty Blender
but I'm gonna try it out and um I'll let
you guys know if I like it or not and
then the next thing is just this angel
hand cream this smells exactly like the
moisturizing mask that I got from the
face shop in my last Korean haul and
I'll link that in the bottom bar below
you guys can check that out it smells
like grapefruit and it smells so good
like I really like all the suns that
Korea has like I feel like a lot of
American scents are really overpowering
and really strong but these are just
really subtle and sweet and really
this is grapefruit so yeah this smells
exactly like the moisturizing face mask
that I got before and I just got this
because I don't know I live in a pretty
cold climate where my hands get really
dry easily these are actually oil
blotting strips because I went to
Sephora okay
I was just áfourá like the week before
or probably like a few days before I
went to Korea because I didn't know that
I was gonna go shopping so much um
and the blotting strip set Sephora were
like $5 I don't know I think they were
like $7 to be honest like I don't really
remember but I just remember I wanted
some blotting strips that were like 50
of them and they were just really
expensive and these were like 1000 won I
think each like it could have been two
thousand or something like that but it
was just so ridiculously cheap compared
to the other ones and they worked just
as well because I don't know there's
blogging strips so they shouldn't really
cost that much so I got two of these so
I have like a hundred body strips now
because the ones Elsa for we're so
expensive and then the rest of the stuff
in here are just samples this place
didn't give as many samples as other
places and I don't really know what
these are this is a I don't this is a
 cream you guys can read it I don't
know and then this I have no idea
and all the stuff in the back is Korean
so I can't read it
so definitely at this place is the
cutest I think for packaging so the next
place that we went to was the face shop
and I feel like we always get a ton of
stuff from the face shop like we I have
a whole Hall on the face shop already so
you guys can check that out but we've
got some cool stuff from here the first
thing that my mom found for me actually
was this pretty thing
this is chia seed and basically this has
0% oil so this is like a moisturizing
kind of thing that prevents sebum which
causes acne so I have like combination
oily like dry skin so this will be good
for me I don't let you guys know how I
like it
and then the next thing that we got that
I got were these volcanic clay blackhead
no strips which I don't know they
started really cool to me and like I
said before I really like trying new
products for blackheads and I just got
to
another cool thing that we got were
these lovely mix nail polish things
basically when you paint your nails you
put these over after you painted your
nails while you're ready for them to
drive so you don't mess them up so they
just go like a little claws which I
thought were really cute and really like
a really good idea and then we got CC
cream so this is umm I have not tried
any CC cream yet but I feel like the
best place to get a CC cream or like a
BB cream would be Korea because they
have that member going on that Korea
originated the BB cream and I don't know
I feel like it's just like a one thing
that Korean like skincare and like
foundation and stuff like that is really
good so we got some CC cream I have not
used it yet but I'm excited to try that
out and then we got a bunch of face
masks I'm not sure at all the price of
these because I didn't buy these but my
sister and I are really into face masks
and so basically we just my mom picked
out a bunch pomegranate green tea rice
help olive honey
avocado I think she don't want to be
like to be honest I don't know bamboo
and cucumber so these are all like
really delicious foods except for kelp
so these are actually masks which I've
never actually done before like I've
never had to put on a mask I mean I put
on like like just the spread on like
moisturizing types of masks but I've
never actually had a mess so I'm really
excited to use these and we got a bunch
of them so we gave some to her friends
and stuff like that we read somewhere
that the pore balm was a good thing and
like I said before I have pretty big
pores so I am always looking to you know
minimize my pores or like minimize the
appearance of my pores so I thought I
would try this pore balm I am not I have
not used this yet but it smells really
good
so that's a plus and then we just got
this gel liner the rest of the things in
here are all samplers earth samples and
we actually got another mask this comes
with another mask and it's aloe vera and
then this actually has the chia seed
that I purchased a full thing of
I don't know we got three of them so the
face shop is pretty like into giving
simples because I remember we got a lot
of samples last time too in the last
place that we went to was etude house
the biggest thing that I got was this
seven and one pour pack and this was
like after I had gotten like all the
poor things so I think I if I had just
gotten this first I probably wouldn't
have bought all the poor stuff that I
got but this was it looks like a really
good deal it was on like I think they
had this like as a special it was 13,000
won this is basically a skincare routine
for reducing pores I'm excited to try
that little guy and then right after I
got that we got like the exact same
thing as a sampler size except I think
they might be different because this has
a face mask in it but I see that it has
like the baking powder one or poor
wonder pore and makeup remover so I
guess they're kind of the same things
but not like all seven of these seven in
one poor thing the next thing that I got
was this perfume and you guys may know
that I'm allergic to most perfumes so
this is actually a perfumed mist so for
some reason I seem to not really be
allergic to like body sprays and like
body like just other types of things
other than perfumes I'm not allergic to
all perfumes I don't know why I'm
allergic to some but I just am so one
thing that I really really liked about
going on this subway um this sounds
super creepy but whatever um a lot of
the women smell super good because I
don't know I mentioned this earlier but
they have like a super sweet smelling
like super subtle and sweet and they
just smell so good so I definitely
wanted to get a fragrance from Korea and
this is kind of like one of those darn
this is kind of one of those super
subtle and sweet fragrances this is um
miss sunshine and it smells like I think
sunshine should smell like and I don't
know what this boy is doing I think this
is like a love note from some type of
Korean celebrity I don't really know but
anyways so this the description for this
is a fruity floral fragrance and it does
it smells really really good here is
what the
thing looks like I dropped the head so
it's really really really cute
and then it has like a little hat so I'm
definitely gonna put this on my dresser
because this is adorable and I really
really like the smell so this is like
one of the favorite things that I got
and I think that this was 15,000 won so
it really wasn't that bad in price
either and of course this packaging is
really cute I was really inspired to get
kind of an orangish color but I went to
pick this out and I thought it was a
different color so I'll swatch this it
has a like a hint of orange but it's
like coral so it's not really orange
this is a color that I just watched on
my hand I have no idea what this is
called say my name is in Korean so
that's it for what we purchased and then
the rest of these things are also
samples so I think that they definitely
gave us the most samples because they
gave us like this little pack the poor
pack thing and then these are all
collagen related this is like a collagen
peel-off mask and then this is a
moisturizing collagen thing and I don't
know what this is a trial kit for
collagen moistfull but I feel like you
spray it but I don't know cuz I can't
see what's in here so those are all the
beauty and makeup products that I got
from Korea I'm really excited to show
you guys like the clothing and
accessories haul because I got something
really really cool and adorable items so
