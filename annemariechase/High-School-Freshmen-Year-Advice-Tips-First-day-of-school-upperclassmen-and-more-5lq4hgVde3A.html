really excited because I'm starting my
back to school series yeah it's super
early but I've been getting a bunch of
requests like that's my number one
requested video right now is to do back
to school videos so I'm just gonna start
doing it because that's what you guys
want to see yeah so I graduated high
school this year and I thought I was
like a good person to talk about advice
because I did pretty well in high school
and I had friends and boyfriends and
stuff so yeah I'm really excited to do
this video and also if I don't answer
like a question that you have or if you
want to ask me a question then leave
them in the comments below about this
video if I have enough questions I will
make another video on my vlog channel
because I don't want to be posting too
many you like back-to-school videos that
are kind of like just extra on this
channel because I already have a bunch
planned so go ahead and leave any
questions that you have so I feel like a
really big concern with freshmen is like
the first day of school don't worry
about getting lost or not making friends
just everyone is there doing the exact
same thing as you are they all have the
same thoughts like they're all worried
that they might get lost and going to
the wrong classroom most likely you'll
have like an orientation day for all the
incoming freshmen and they'll like show
you around where all the classes are and
give you a tour of the school and stuff
like that also teachers are very very
helpful for that kind of thing they will
guide you in the right direction if
you're lost I would say just keep an
open mind first impressions mean a lot
at least to Maine like a lot of people
and I know so act yourself don't act
like someone who you're not because it's
gonna be really obvious just like in all
of life act yourself be yourself be open
to making new friends if you want and
just be friendly and happy and outgoing
ask for like makeup and outfits and
stuff
I would just say go natural don't
overdress yourself just act or dress how
you would for the rest of the school
year so I'm going to talk about like
social advice first before I go into
like academic advice because this is
really applicable to everyone going into
freshman year the biggest thing that I
wish I had known my freshman year and I
wish my friends had known their freshman
year is to not idolize upperclassmen
looking back I don't know what it is
about upperclassmen but as like an
underclassmen you kind of just idolize
I don't know I don't know if that's for
everyone the trouble with idolizing
someone is that obviously you have a lot
of respect for them and you want to be
just like them and you want to do all
these things and this can go for a girl
or boy you just want to please that
person and this obviously has a lot of
negative consequences for instance they
can easily take advantage of you or have
a lot of influence over you so this can
be good or bad if you're idolizing the
wrong type of person then this influence
can be very bad realize that these are
just people they're nothing special
about them unless they're like a great
person and you're idolizing them for all
the right reasons but just know that two
years will come and they'll be gone and
you don't need to please these people
just because you think they're popular
and cool so yeah this was really serious
I'm not sure how well that got across
because I was really trying to sit
through these like really jumbled
thoughts as you guys can tell but I hope
that kind of came across as like what I
was trying to get across and of course
if you have any questions look just
leave them below I'm like super jumbled
right now I'm going along with that I
would say it before you get into high
school before you even like attend the
first day of school sit down with
yourself and kind of set some boundaries
and standards just evaluate your morals
and standards because if you don't have
any you don't have anything that they're
the sky's limit for you you need to set
your limit with your own morals that
you've gained from your parents or your
religion or school or like I don't know
anything you just need to make sure that
you have them and that you know what
your limits are then you never go past a
point and you never feel terrible about
yourself if you just recognize what you
know that you should and should not do
so moving on from that social aspect
those are kind of all the bad things
about high school but trust me there are
some really really good things about
high school it's a very great time to
meet new friends and just it's a really
good experience if you make it a good
experience but those were all the
serious points that I really wanted to
touch on my favorite part moving on to
the academic
I just shut my computer because it just
fell asleep and it's really annoying
okay so academics so this is just advice
that I have for doing well and setting
yourself up for success um the first
thing that I have is challenge yourself
academically and choose the classes that
will challenge you freshman year was
actually really really difficult for me
because I had just entered like the
highly gifted program of my school I was
someone who had to work really hard for
their grades in high school so just
because you think you're not smart
doesn't mean that you can't do well in
school that's something that I had to
get through my head because I wasn't the
smartest one in any of my classes um I
was just like really average but I
passed with like really good grades
because I work so hard so just know that
you can do as good as anyone else you
can do is you can do better than the
smartest person in the class if you just
work hard so just know that and
challenge yourself academically take the
hardest class as you can and this will
really set you up for success um later
on like when you're choosing for
colleges and stuff another thing that
goes along is that is you have to learn
to adjust freshman year is going to be
different for you socially and
academically be in the mindset that you
will have to adjust to your surroundings
like it will not be easy or it might be
easy I'm not sure but if you're taking
hard classes you have all this new stuff
going on you're in a new environment
just know that it'll take some time and
that you just have to learn just keep
pushing through and you can adjust with
some time the next piece of advice is
something that I know that a lot of
seniors wish they had done like in my
year is to take your academics seriously
in freshman year looking back on it you
do not want to have like your first C or
D in your freshman year because then
you're gonna have to spend the rest of
your high school career once you decide
to take yourself or your academics
seriously um you're gonna have to spend
that time compensating for your freshman
year colleges look at your GPA and it's
like collective GPA so it counts from
your freshman year through your senior
year so take it seriously don't act like
it's not a big deal because it is I
would say freshmen and sophomore are
definitely the easiest years of high
school so take advantage of that and get
good grades and this will also give you
the momentum you need to get good grades
about high school so those are like the
biggest tips that I have for setting
yourself up for success your freshman
year so yeah gun to the next section
this is like kind of like the
miscellaneous like extra advice section
the first piece of advice that I have is
try to make friends with a staff member
you want someone that you can talk to in
high school this helped me immensely my
senior year I had a terrible teacher she
had something against me I don't know
what I told her that I made youtube
videos and I think that she thought that
was really weird so she knew that I made
videos she knew that my videos obviously
meant a lot to me because I wrote my
like college essay on it and she kind of
mocked me like throughout like the
semester that I had with her cuz I
didn't like to your class again you
never want to feel like mocked or just
like ridiculed from your teacher who you
like who's like supposed to be a figure
of authority and basically what happened
is that I did this assignment really
well it was um a seminar and I like
definitely deserved like what's called
like a five-star that's like an a-plus
and she gave me like a 4 and I was just
it just didn't make any sense and like
everyone around me was just like what it
was like my tipping point for that class
like I had had so many problems with her
she had like made fun of me in front my
face it was just really a weird
situation
I saw the grade that she gave me and she
was like watching me like check my grade
and I was just like this doesn't make
any sense like you're just like you're
just like a weird person so I was super
upset so I left her class and
immediately went down to my counselor
who was like one of my best friends in
high school
um because I knew that I could talk to
him my counselor about it and she could
like help me with my problem if I didn't
have my counselor I literally would have
had nowhere to go I would have like
walked out of her class been super upset
probably a driven home and then like
been marched ruin or something from
school so having someone to talk to you
in school like having an adult that you
can talk to about your problems that are
school related whether it be like
teachers W or students that bully you or
just like anything is really really
helpful so I would highly recommend
trying to find someone that you feel
comfortable with that you know that you
can go to talk to another thing as a
freshman is definitely join a lot of
sports and clubs as many as you possibly
can once you're like an upper class
it's just a lot harder to join a sport
especially or like a club that you
weren't already a part of just kind of
weird they're like already established
cliques in those sports and it's just
like a lot harder this is also a really
really good way to make friends um and
to just get like a sport going for the
rest of high school a lot of piece of
advice that I have as a freshman is go
out and volunteer find an organization
that you're passionate about and
volunteer for them I started
volunteering at the Imaginarium
Discovery Center at the Anchorage museum
like four years ago I think um and I
volunteered there every single week for
five hours a week for me volunteering
was probably one of the best things that
I could have done I was in super into
sports or like clubs or anything so I
felt really comfortable there like that
was my place and my sense of belonging
was like with the Imaginarium community
I got a job through volunteering and I
had that job for two years and it was
like the best job that I could have it
was the best like first real job that I
possibly could ever ask for it had a ton
of benefits you feel better about
yourself for helping your community and
your community really benefits from it
um there were just like so many benefits
from volunteering but also another thing
is that colleges really look for
community service nowadays um and they
also look for commitment so if you start
in your freshman year and you are
committed to that organization and you
keep volunteering they'll see that you
have a commitment to or that you can
make a commitment that you're dedicated
and also um those people that you
volunteer with or you're like
supervisors I don't know what they call
onto your coordinators can write you a
letter of recommendation and that's
where I got like my best letter letters
of recommendation was from my boss who
also was like my volunteer coordinator
so definitely pick an organization that
you're passionate about that you would
want to spend four years at and just
volunteer there though that's all the
advice that I have this is probably a
saddest bit okay be sure to leave any
questions that I didn't answer in the
comments and then I will potentially
make a video about it on my blog channel
so go subscribe to that and I will see
you guys later bye
and everything is going to the beach and
everything is going to eat
