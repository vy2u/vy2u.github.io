to be a really fun video I have spent so
much time looking up tumblr room decor
because everyone knows they have like
the best ideas and decided to do a video
on how to decorate your college dorm
room here at USC
you gotta stop living in dorms after
just your freshman year for example I'm
living in a house with four other people
and I'm sharing this pretty small room
with my roommate so I wanted to make
this video and these tips in this video
really universal to all college living
styles before we get started I just
wanted to thank society6 for sponsoring
this video
society6 is basically a website where a
bunch of different artists can post
their work and put them on different
things pretty much everything you can
think of from t-shirts phone covers
pillows duvet covers shower curtains
honestly the list goes on Oh also I
forgot almost I will link every single
thing that I mentioned in the
description box below and also they
hooked us up with a 10% discount if you
use the code Emery chase and you also
get free shipping on anything on a
website so you're welcome and even
though this video is sponsored it's
still 100% my opinion society6 is a
great company and an awesome website but
I think you guys will be able to just
see that from watching this video so
let's get started the very first thing
that I like to focus on is the bed and
bedding as a centerpiece of the room or
corner in my case and on tumblr I always
see those bohemian type duvet and
tapestry duos which I've always loved so
I finally decided to go for that feel
fiscal year the duvet cover that I
picked is this really really cool
elephant design by our Skinner 1 1 to 2
from society6 and she actually has some
other really cool designs so if you like
this style definitely check out her
artwork and I also just really like the
duvet covers from society6 they're super
soft and they also have this little tie
thing at the end of each corner which
you might not think is a big deal but
it's just really hard to keep the duvet
cover and
Dubey aligned if you don't have these
things and then a little pro tip is that
I got a queen-sized Dube firstly that I
can switch out my duvet covers if I want
to change which I pretty much do every
year and then secondly a queen-size
duvet fits all of the bed sizes that
I'll probably have during college and I
actually like how it drapes over the bed
because then this hides all of the ugly
storage that I kind of have to put under
my bed so after I picked this duvet
cover I kind of revolved everything else
around this including my tapestry so
I've actually never had a tapestry
before but now that I have one it's just
so clear that it's so easy to decorate
your room by getting a tapestry and
society6 has a ton of tapestries with
lots of different vibes but i think that
this one definitely ended up being the
best and that is because i was going for
that bohemian feel so when i film this
video my roommate hadn't moved in yet
you can't see it but we actually share a
very very small room so the layout of my
room was also actually inspired by
tumblr this also influenced the reason
why I put my tapestry in the corner of
my room
since this is a very symmetrical
tapestry I thought that putting it in
the corner looked really good so this is
my little bohemian corner of the room
and I just think it is so cozy looking
and just beautiful
just like tapestries I feel like throw
pillows are a really easy way to make
your room look very put together and I
feel like these are also a part of the
formula that makes a bed look very
tumblr II and just comfortable looking I
originally just got the one throw pillow
that matched my tapestry print I just
thought it would pull it all together
and the other two were for my living
room but after I put them together I saw
that they had to match perfectly so I
decided to just keep them on my bed and
on the society6 website there's an
option to purchase the throw pillows
with pillows too so that's what I did
just for convenience sake just because I
would have no idea where to find pillows
to go in these throw pillow cases things
I just think that pillow is matching
whatever accents of colors that you have
in your room are a really great way to
pull the entire room together and make
it look like you put a lot of effort and
thought into your decor when you may not
have only satellite so listening
and then of course no tumblr inspired
room decor video would be complete
without string lights and I've actually
had these in my room each year of
college and I would say that these can
make the biggest difference in the mood
of your room
I just love to turn these on at night
instead of using the main overhead light
because it creates a super chill relaxed
environment to wind down to this next
thing is not really tumblr or Antigua
related but I thought that I would
include it since it's the only other
thing that my roommate and I have had in
my room every single year other than
those lights and this is just a really
really simple key holders this is kind
of one of those things that seems so
simple and plain but it's actually just
so convenient and helpful to have you
usually have either your dorm keys house
keys car keys or your student ID that
you need each time before you leave for
class having a designated place to put
it right by your door whenever you walk
in ensures that you never misplace or
lose any of these things and you can
also make it a part of your room decor
by hanging your necklaces or bracelets
off of it
I feel like this wall would be in the
tumbler minimalist category I searched
for actual hours like literally hours
for a cool Alaska print because my
roommate and I are both from Anchorage
Alaska so I finally found this amazing
vintage Alaska canvas print and then I
just picked the cutest flippin print of
this bear like this is the cutest thing
I've ever seen
that's just the really cool thing about
this site is that there are so many
things that you can literally search any
word like Alaska and you're pretty much
guaranteed to find at least something on
it
it's simple clean super easy but I think
it's actually my favorite of all of the
decor that I chose for my entire house
so the other really really cool campus
print that I found on this site is this
vintage visit Los Angeles sign I was
actually planning on putting this in my
room with the Alaska print and the bear
print but I just didn't think that it
ended up fitting well with it but I
still love this print so much that I
wanted to show you guys anyways cuz I
feel like more people are from Los
Angeles so it's probably more relatable
I picked all of my metal prints before I
moved into the house and all I could
remember about the living room was that
there was a big red fake fireplace so I
tried to pick her in that would one look
really awesome on metal and to look okay
with the red accent of color that is
just randomly in this living room I was
planning on hanging them around the
living room at first but then I just
ended up placing them there temporarily
and then that just became their new home
but I actually really liked how these
three turned out for our living room so
I think that the metal prints really
take prints to the next level I don't
really know how to explain them they're
very modern these are kind of like
things that you want to show off to
other people and they're honestly really
unlike anything I've ever seen for decor
but I think it just looks amazing
especially depending on what print you
choose to get so I tried picking prints
and designs that really pop on metal so
I would say if you're going to get a
middle print try picking designs that
really contrast in colors or that have
gold colors because it just looks so so
so good on metal and lastly the bathroom
my bathroom this year is actually very
nice so I feel like I didn't really have
to do too much to it the only thing that
I did was I added a framed print it's
kind of just a very on-trend banana leaf
type print and then I just decided to
add these little pink flamingos hand
towels just because I thought they were
super cute they're just adorable so I
just went with it
all right guys thank you so much for

first decore video that i think i've
