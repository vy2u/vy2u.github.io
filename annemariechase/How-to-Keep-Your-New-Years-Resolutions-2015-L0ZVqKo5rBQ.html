just gonna say really sorry for the hair
I had like beautiful curls and then I
put hairspray in it and it totally
ruined my curls so if this bothers you I
very sorry you know what I'll just put
it in the back hey since it's the new
year some of you probably already made a
bunch of resolutions for yourself and
some of you might have already broken
them so this video is going to be about
how to keep your new year's resolutions
so I'm all about new year's resolutions
and like the whole new year new me kind
of thing so if you are about this that I
support you I think it's good to have
motivation to better yourself so let's
get into the video so this is a book
that I found to be very interesting it
is called the power of habit by Charles
Duhigg so basically this book talks
about how habits whether you realize it
or not make up a very very large part of
our life with this being said it is
actually quite easy to create your own
habits and break the habits that you
have now if you want to break your bad
habits so once you start exercising more
regularly it'll eventually become a
habit for you it'll make you feel good
and you'll start craving the endorphins
and other neurochemicals that you get
from exercising eventually exercising
everyday or frequently will become a lot
easier and the hardest part is just
starting that habit so I'm going to tell
you guys how to start exercising so that
it can eventually become a habit of
yours a habit of bills
each month i'll print a calendar from
like ical on my mac computer and i'll
paste it i'll post it on my door i will
tape it on my door then I mark every
time that I exercise and like what the
exercise is so this helps me to
visualize how often I'm working out and
it also helps me realize that I'm really
not working out as much as I think I am
because for some reason I just tend to
think that I work out a lot more than I
do and I just really don't and this is
also helpful because it's kind of like
peer pressure to work out like people
who walk into our suite can see they're
like wow you don't work out that much
you can also make it a competition
between you and your sibling or you and
your friend me and my roommate's
calendars are right next to each other
so it's really obvious when one of us
works out a lot and 11 doesn't
before and after pictures from when
someone first starts their journey to
fit life to the end or like during that
is super motivating for me so one idea
is there's a piece of dust one idea is
that you can take a photo every single
day during your like fitness journey or
like if you're trying to lose a large
amount of weight because it is so
noticeable
so I personally love my lululemon capri
pants like yoga pants I lost them like I
can't find them since I've been home I
were them to the gym every single day
and like one day they just disappeared
and honestly I did not go to the gym
because of it like I was getting ready
to go to the gym and I couldn't find
them anywhere and I was like I don't
have any other pants to wear that looked
this good so I didn't go to the gym so
get new workout clothes if that's
something that motivates you it
definitely motivates me for some reason
I don't know what it is just like you
want to look good go to the gym so get
some workout clothes and then go to the
gym
if you're not going to go into the gym
then one thing that I suggest is
Blogilates so it's Cassie and she has
workout videos that you can do like
inside your room basically I've done
some in my room and the best thing about
it is that they're free because I know
that there are a lot of fitness things
that just are not free but they do the
same thing basically and I guarantee you
if you do like one a date you will
definitely notice a difference her
workouts are amazing and they're really
hard and challenging and if you do it
with a friend or a sibling it makes it
way more fun I'll link my blog down or
my roommate and I filmed ourselves doing
Blogilates we're both really fat right
now and we're gonna do a Blogilates
workout because they're really fast and
we have been able to go to the gym
doable but challenging so definitely
check her out if you want to start
working out and I guarantee if you do
like one a day you'll see the difference
so something that's a huge problem for
me that I think I don't realize that
much until I like really son thought
about it is that I am on my phone way
too much I have like four different apps
that I constantly check whatever I am
waiting before i go to bed when I wake
up it's like Instagram snapchat Twitter
and then you yak and that like actually
takes up so much time something that
I've been doing recently and it's really
been working one of my resolutions is to
tune out so I'm going to delete them
during the weekdays and only download
them on the weekends or I can go on it
on my computer because I'm not usually
on my computer on social media is I'm
sure that a lot of you also do this or
you just spend way more time than you
think you do just like quickly checking
it before bed ends up turning it to like
two hours like I've been lost in the
Instagram vortex so many times just like
stalking people I like would have never
no like I have no idea who they are
they're like a friend of a friend of a
friend or something so if you start
tuning out more I guarantee you you'll
have way more time to do other things
like reading
a fun idea that my friend rachel is
going to do this year while reading and
to motivate her to read is that when she
reads a book she's going to keep a paper
dedicated to that book she's going to
write down fun ideas or quotes that she
really likes from that book and then I
was did on her inspiration board I
thought this is a really good idea and
also it's a good idea because i feel
like if you have a bunch of quotes might
actually seem like a really smart person
and you can post them on your social
medias and I don't know you just look
like an intellectual
my last tip for meeting more is to start
a book club with your nerdiest friends
I've actually tried doing this quite a
few times and it really never has worked
out so from my book clubs I don't really
actually know what book clubs actually
do I think goes and one when I was like
in fifth grade or something but what
we're going to do is I'm gonna read a
book and then she's gonna read a
different book and then we will swap
them if they're good and if they're not
good I don't really know and if you
don't have a book club to join or if you
don't have any nerdy friends that one
join or start a book club then you can
join I'm because i'm gonna start one on
my blog channel so every like month or
so depending on how much i read i'm
going to post a video talking about a
book that we read together so if you
want to draw my book club go ahead and
subscribe to my blog channel and you can
leave any requests for books or anything
that you want and we can figure out how
we're gonna do it and all that stuff
later on so the next resolution is all
about relationships the decide which
relationships are valuable to your life
and which ones are destructive or not as
valuable or just like poisonous
relationships build on the good ones and
leave the bad ones in 2014 is showing
people your appreciation really goes a
very long way um for example a dog I
think I think I found this no this is a
different book that I was reading
everyone loves dogs because a dog will
just go up to anyone and like start
looking them and just be super excited
to see them so if you do that to people
but not quite that extent then people
will really appreciate you and like you
maybe this is how you make friends 101
on a serious note if you just show your
appreciation to the people in your life
by calling them or spending more time
with them that's probably the best way
to build your relationship so now I'm
going to talk about something that is
equally as important which i think i
said like leaving the other people in
2014 which you can't actually do like
they're coming with you there's like a
tweet about that
if you're in a relationship with someone
and you feel that you give a lot to that
person and you don't receive anything
back or you just feel like you have a
lot of stress and tension and drama
coming from that relationship especially
if it continues to happen over and over
again that's when you know that you have
a bad poisonous relationship and I
really just thought this off to have my
head like there could be a lot more
factors and like really confusing stuff
so I think it's really important to cut
negative relationships out of your life
because it can reduce the amount of
stress and drama and just like a
headache in your life so much and I have
a lot of experience not a lot but I just
have some stories about this which I can
say for another video because I want to
move on to my next tip have an agenda
use a ton of sticky notes just be
organized write everything down all of
the events like dates plans that you
have in a calendar so that you don't
forget I also really enjoy writing the
lists and the best app for this is
Wunderlist I love this app because I
love to make to-do lists I love pressing
the check button on that because it has
the most appealing noise
so the last tip that I have for being
organized is to make your bed every
single morning and this may seem like a
really weird random piece of advice
unless you've already seen this YouTube
video that I'm talking about if you want
to change the world start off by making
your bed I'm going to link it down below
and that's all I'm gonna say okay so
those are all of my tips and pieces of
advice for how to keep your new year's
resolutions hopefully you guys are doing
well on them so far so if you guys would
like to see what my resolutions are for
this year you can check it in the link
below i'm going to post it on my vlog
channel just because um it's basically

want this video to be too long so check
out that video and i will see you guys
