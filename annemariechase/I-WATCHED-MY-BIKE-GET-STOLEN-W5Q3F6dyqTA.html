11 I think it is currently 10:35 and
this morning is off to such a rough
start basically I did a ton of work
yesterday I was super happy and I was
like exhausted I was ready to go to
sleep I didn't shower because I was like
I'm gonna go to yoga today at 10:00 but
I was gonna get up early to go to my
professors like office hours and I was
gonna ask him to write me a letter of
rec so I was gonna fit all of that in
and then I just could not fall asleep
until like 6:00 I like woke up at like
9:30 I think so it's all just not ideal
because first of all I miss my favorite
yoga class the instructor was literally
like see you on Monday like you'll be
there on Monday right and I was like
yeah definitely because I was for sure
planning on going but I just do not
think that my body would be able to do
it I can feel my sleep deprivation but
I'm going to campus now to ask my
professor I think it'll be fine and I
showered oh and I told you guys about
the sleep with me podcast I listened to
that guy like two hours and it's not
it's not as cute when you can't fall
asleep it's just like what are you
saying
I'm Heike I fit repeating because I just
do not have the energy to think of
anything including putting an outfit
together and I'm just going to campus
for like 20 minutes hopefully so that
was a lot more waiting than I thought it
would be just cuz I'm the keynote I was
there cuz the person
yes
it's not that cool what'd you do I know
it just doesn't know she loved her luck
so the numbers are on the other side
Shannon
hey look hey look take a picture
just get Chinese help their fans is that
bad okay so I can hold your phone for
you can you see it if I just can't tell
like which line it's supposed to be I
don't see this is the situation I can
bike here on accident yeah I can see it
wait can you hold it
can you hold the phone wait
we're gonna go now
jump jump jump jump you're fine there
yeah
oh did you even check today the life
with Tasha
so the strangest thing just happened
I made some food for myself and I was
literally just going to put it away I
was like a little frightened because we
have our all our windows are usually
closed because people can look into the
house really easily and I was frightened
because I saw someone standing like kind
of towards the fence and he was kind of
talking I I just thought he was trying
to talk to our neighbor's cat because
our neighbors have a cat that's just
always like hanging out right where we
park our bikes and I was like oh that's
like pretty creepy but I'll just keep an
eye out on him because he's not doing
anything he was literally just standing
there like he looked mentally ill I felt
really bad but I probably wouldn't want
to interact with him just because he
like was talking to himself and I just
don't like know what kind of like state
of mind that he was in you just never
know um so I was kind of just watching
him and I was like ah like I don't know
if I should call our Public Safety DPS
and I was like maybe I'll just get my
phone just in case and I walk over to
get my phone and wash my hands in the
bathroom and then I come back to like
just check up on him and he's gone and
he has taken my bike and I literally
know because I looked to see like if he
had already taken them when I saw him
but he was facing the other way and he
was just like kind of talking to himself
and so yeah he just he just straight-up
took my bike he literally left so fast I
was getting my phone to just kind of
like keep an eye out on him and called
DPS if he was like looking suspicious
but yeah he just he left so fast and so
I just called them and reported it but
that I'm just like blown away that was
so fast
fascinating
well it's me again I have an update
DPS came probably within like five
minutes or less I was pretty impressed
they were super super super helpful or
they like expressed a lot of like
empathy and concern they it was just it
was nice seeing them but it kind of just
brightened my mood because there was so
genuinely nice and we were just like
chatting for like 30 minutes I should be
studying for my final yeah it was just
so so bizarre like I was literally
getting my phone and to call DPS just
because I was like I don't I want to
have it on me just in case I have to and
I just rinsed my hands off with the soap
and water because they were greasy and
then I came back and he was just gone it
was insane
and he didn't even know that I was
watching him but it was so weird um I
was telling they were like do you know
for sure like did you hear anything or
did you see him take it when I saw him
out there I actually checked to see I
don't know if I told you guys this I
check to see if my bike was still there
or our bikes were still there but I knew
that Tasha and Eric Schadt were gone so
their bikes were gone
but my bike was there and then larlie
the next minute it was just gone and so
was he it was so dirty I was in the
middle of editing my vlogmas before all
of this stuff happened I was like
sitting down to edit it again because it
honestly I always think it doesn't take
that much time but it does so I'm not
going to post it and I'm not going to
touch it for tonight and I might not
even be able to do it tomorrow so close
to being done it's like 90% of the way
done but then that's only the video and
then it takes a while to do it thumbnail
and upload it and like it doesn't take
that long but it still takes like an
hour for me at least so I'm just not
gonna do it I'm barely committing to
that so that I don't just do it because
what I've been doing is I'm like I say
that I'm gonna focus on not blog miss
but then I do it and then it actually
takes like an hour and a half longer
than I think it will according to my
records so I'm not gonna do it for
tonight and I apologize
it's just it's not gonna get done
tonight telling myself that well
everyone okay it is 10 o'clock I have
been studying very diligently since 5:30
because somehow I ended up starting
studying again at 5 even though I was
planning on studying all day today today
it was just such a weird weird weird
lupus' our day
what an odd day probably the weirdest
day of the year honestly it was just
such a weird experience living today but
yeah this vlog is so my finals tomorrow
are at 12 to 2 and then 4 to 6 4:30 to
6:30 I also have to pack because I'm
leaving tomorrow luckily I have kind of
a lot of time I'm leaving it like not
really tomorrow it's more Wednesday at
like 5 a.m. or something but I do need
to pack for that and I think that
tomorrow night everyone's gonna be done
with their finals in my house somewhere
just kind of party I think I'll vlog
like I'll try to blog as much as
possible tomorrow like in between my
finals and stuff like my finals
reactions that could be fun but I am
going to I think study just like a
little bit more and then go to sleep and
wake up early hopefully oh oh my god I
totally forgot to say we hit we hit
10,000 subscribers followers on
Instagram which is absolutely insane
that's really exciting I'm excited to
just like do nothing this winter break
but also like focus on like basic things
like peg shirt so I'll be updating that
as soon as I'm done dying from finals I
hope you guys someone enjoyed this vlog
I hope you guys are doing well with your
finals and everything and I
talk to you guys tomorrow bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
