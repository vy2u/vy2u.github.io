first-ever Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys to ask
me questions if you had an e on
Instagram I'm actually having kind of a
lot of questions I didn't actually
expect to get that many questions an
honor being the very first person to
comment i am going to answer this one
where do you see yourself in five years
after my internship in china and like
kind of experiencing the entertainment
industry and just being like a social
media like having a social media
presence or just channel I like really
interested in entertainment but i'm not
sure like what that's like a very very
broad industry so i'm not really sure
ever know can you lick your elbow not
even close what do you love most about
cali PS she's so funny Callie has hands
down one of the funniest people i know i
would say her sense of humor she's just
like the most positive person to be
around also since we grew up together
she literally knows exactly why and the
way and like who I like and who I don't
like what I like and what I don't like
and like she knows how to make me laugh
we know all the same inside jokes she's
always gonna be my best friend and she's
always gonna be there for me and she
knows that I'll always be there for her
so I guess that's like a very comforting
warm thing about Khalid and she's really
loud actually this problem I favorite
think about her so during my senior year
she was at Emory and college and you
could notice like there was a huge
difference in the amount of noise in our
house so it was just like a lot lot more
quieter when she left and I was kind of
sad but I like how she's so loud cuz you
know like you always like hear her
around like she's always laughing this
viewer is really really active and super
supportive all my channels and accounts
so hello Zoe favorite thing you did in
Hawaii probably jumping cliff jumping
like cliff jumping it was like a
probably like a 6-foot a little just
cliff that was really fun mostly because
I feel like I was really scared and I
wasn't sure if I was gonna do it who was
your favorite Kardashian i would say
probably Khloe but I've actually been
told that I sound like Kourtney so I'm
not sure if that's a compliment cuz I
feel
she's probably that's probably not when
did you start your YouTube channel and
why a lot of people have an asking unis
in college it's kind of awkward hairs on
my leg I don't have like a separate
personal Instagram account I used to and
I really really separated them in high
school and some people are like wow I
didn't know you had youtube like why did
you start like one of you start so i
started i think in my junior year of
high school why i started there's also a
very complicated question to answer um
for people who like know nothing about
YouTube and like the communities on you
too but there's got a really big sense
of community and like belonging from the
YouTube community and when I started
posting videos and like I was able to
interact with people it just felt really
good that's probably why I started like
I was just looking for a community
outside of like school or like my friend
group and that's definitely like why
I've continued doing it did I ever have
braces I did I had braces in sixth grade
how did me and Jacob meet actually the
first time we met was through his friend
Jason me and Jason were studying I think
we pulled an allnighter that night it
was like till four in the morning and I
met him then and I gave him a chocolate
bunny that my mom gave me for Easter and
then we met again officially I guess
this year it was actually a really cute
store i kinda want to like save it for
later if you guys don't know what i'm
talking about or anything um I'm dating
a guy named Jacob I tweet about him a
lot for some reason he's on my Instagram
and stuff and my blogs as of december
seven I don't know also I wanted to tell
you guys a lot of my viewers seem to
really really like Jacob and I
understand that cuz he's a nice guy he's
really funny he's kind of cute but
someone made a couple Instagram page and
I'm like obsessed with it so I wanted to
show you guys and like that's about if
you want to follow it because they're
actually really like really good at
keeping updated these pictures are from
my snapchat Instagram Twitter and then
his Instagram I think so it's like a
really broad range of like all the
photos that we post out with each other
so it's like kind of adorable it's just
the cutest page ever so if you guys want
to go follow our like couple Instagram
page I didn't make it he didn't make it
but I think it's like the cutest thing
ever I just thought it was really cute
so I wanted to give it a little shout
out what was your first impression of
Jacob when you met him we just got along
really well but I thought
he just got along with everyone really
well wasn't like oh this is guy flirting
with me I just thought he was like
really like outgoing and really easy to
get along with and he actually is still
like that and like a lot of people think
that but that's like my initial thought
about him you guys should leave requests
on what I should film with him I don't
really want to film the boyfriend tag
yet because I don't know I feel like
that's like a rite of passage we're
gonna have to wait at least like five
months for that because we've been
dating for like one month let me know
what we should film together maybe I'll
just say I'm like a Q&amp;amp;A with him or
something but um let me know if you have
any ideas what's your favorite food I
love Korean food and mediterranean foods
like hummus and falafel one look mmm all
the good stuff do you shape pluck your
own eyebrows I usually will go get them
done like once every two months just so
that they can shape them and lengthen
them out and then I will do them in
between the times that I get them done
just a lot easier to let people who like
are really really good at it do it and I
found this really really good route
place in la called roupas brow lounge in
Anchorage it costs $22 to get your
eyebrows threaded I'm in love like I
found my place ooh Anna curry Nina has
some good questions why did you decide
to get a USC I've answered this a few
times too but mostly it's because I
wanted to be in LA and then I was
picking between UCLA and USC and UCLA is
a public school i'd be paying
out-of-state tuition for a public school
and I just really liked the campus here
they also have a business program here
and that's what I wanted to do so it's
kind of for me like a no-brainer um
hummus thoughts same person I love
hummus a little bit too much what are
your thoughts on the media's unrealistic
portrayal of boomerangs I think this is
a joke so hopefully or else I'm just
really missing something so I think the
Rings are really under a representative
how's the vegan life any tips for people
who want to try out veganism I would say
that it's actually going pretty good I
started veganism because I've been
watching a lot of being in youtubers and
like I just wanted to try it out for one
month to see if I could do it it's not
as hard as people think it is or think
it would be
game if I get into USC will you give me
a tour I don't think I'd be the best
person to give you a tour but my friend
kathara could probably give you a tour
she's a tour guide so it makes sense
Christian asks what are you thinking of
doing the summer any internships or jobs
you're looking into first of all I see
your comments and name pop up all the
time so thank you so much for always
being like support of an active I'm
going to stay in LA this summer and I
need to find an internship or else my
mom is gonna be really mad at me or a
job so that's the plan I'm gonna try to
apply to places ah it's gonna be
annoying these are some really good
questions I kind of wish I'd prepared
for this better to like have actual
answers instead of just like doing them
on this box i'm skipping over some that
require like a little bit more thought
or research how do you manage to not get
overwhelmed see this is like one of
those things where i'm like i should
have prepared for this cuz i know i had
like an answer somewhere in the back of
my head or i could like come up with the
may be helpful answer but i didn't
prepare i don't really know how I'm
gonna answer this so let's see how it
goes i would say that I'm pretty I'm a
pretty anxious person I have major
perfectionist tendencies so in high
school literally was like a student who
got straight A's I was like pretty
involved in like my work and volunteer
and I was always anxious and I can tell
like physically and like my stomach was
always like kind of tired and felt like
I needed to like I had like an upset
stomach or something I was gonna say
poop but like maybe not I don't know and
I would actually like bite my cuticles
so much that they would scab over and I
keep biting them until it looked like I
had giant warts on my hands so like I
was just super anxious all the time and
I kind of changed when I got to college
but I'm not really know what changed
about it like if it's a different link
atmosphere or like an environment or
what I didn't do horribly but I didn't
do like as well as i usually am used to
like my first semester during my first
year this is like kind of just my
philosophy for life and I'm not sure if
it's gonna be helpful for anyone out
there and this is maybe not the answer
that like the concrete answer that
you're looking for but I honestly feel
like if you are a good person and you
treat others like with respect and
kindness and you're justjust do good you
put a lot of good out into the amount of
the world and you work really hard
there's no way that you can fail so
that's kind of just what I'm relying on
and honestly I feel like
I'm willing to work really hard I try to
be a good person to everyone I'm around
I don't do weird stuff or like
suspicious stuff for like I don't know
I've never like purposely like doing
somewhat wrong and for me like I feel
like as long as I can do those two
things I know that my abilities will be
able to take me like wherever I need to
go hopefully that noise isn't too
distracting so that's not probably the
best answer maybe I can like try to
think of some actual tips to help you
but that's like my general answer what
is the best memory a freshman year
honestly freshman year was not great for
me but my best memories were definitely
hanging out with my friend rich we used
to study in one of the buildings that
was near my apartment or my dorm and
we'd literally like be there until like
12 2 a.m. sometimes and we went there
almost like sometimes like every day
definitely funnest times a freshman year
by far even though we were just like
studying we just like studying talk if
you were an emoji what would you be
perfect I have this this is what I'd be
rich gave me this and actually this for
my birthday present so if you take a
hint do you plan on doing weekly blog
soon who are you Nova yeah I actually do
weekly vlogs everything away for the
last year the last like two years almost
so I'm a little bit offended by this
question Nova rose I just don't post
them on this channel I post them on my
blog channel do I miss high school not
at all what are your favorite movies /
TV shows also do you think you're going
to be doing a meet up anytime soon right
now i'm watching seinfeld because Callie
got me on it other than that like the
Mindy project new girl the office is my
all-time favorite show and movies I hate
that question I highly just never know
what to say for a meetup I'm not sure
how they work I've never done a media
before but i am going to generation
beauty so i will be there with tasha
from Pearson tasha and my friend Jerry
who is in a lot of my blogs from
Shanghai so I'm really excited about
that I'm like so pumped so if any of you
guys are gonna be there you should let
me know cuz I'm
excited to meet people but I'm just not
sure if anyone I like any of my viewers
are gonna be there so i'll be there just
let me know if you'll be there cuz i'm
excited but i don't know what to expect
so I think those are all the questions
that I'm gonna answer today but that was
actually really fun i feel like i should
do this more often so that's it thank
you so much if you asked a question and
I'm actually I've kind of been inspired
to like film a few videos from these
questions so that's like good you guys
