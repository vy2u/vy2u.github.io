when you put another pillow pet oh yeah
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today I'm here with my roommate Tasha
hi and this is actually a really fun
video that we haven't been playing for a
little while so basically Tasha is not
like you can tell like stand up real
quick real quick this is what she's
dressed like today she dresses like this
every single day like she has matching
like jewelry like her ears match her
neck jewelry she's very well dressed and
I respect your fashion opinion and I
think a lot of other people do so that's
Tasha story and then me on the other
hand I don't dislike clothes but I just
hate shopping like it's so much work for
me and it's just like not something that
I like to do I always like watching the
videos that are like my boyfriend buys
my outfit yeah and that kind of stuff
and I was like wait and really I should
do that cuz like I love online shopping
and I shop too much for myself yeah so I
should just do it but for you I can't I
kind of know that I'll like like a lot
of the clothes that you care I like
wanted to tell you so badly but I wanted
to like wait to tell you okay okay so
you know the first like free people bag
that came in when we were going to
brunch with Jerry yeah you were like
just wear that go like I looked at it
and then you were like oh wear something
white so that I didn't end up wearing it
but I looked at it and then yesterday
when I went bowling I needed something
to wear and so I was gonna do like yeah
I like pick this shirt because I thought
it was like you can wear it for so many
occasions like it's dressy but not like
too dressy yeah okay
not only did I wear it I was like oh my
god I love this like personally but I
got like three compliments on my outfit
so I was like I know that you're gonna
pick like stuff that I like we got all
these clothes off of do't it's a
shopping app they have tons of different
stores on their app and you can shop all
on the app so I got all this stuff from
there yeah it's basically one-stop shop
it has like a lot of your favorite
stores all in one app
it's really nice for people like me
because putting it all in an app is like
really convenient and you can pretty
much like check out just in one place
from all these stores which is really
cool so that's where all these clothes
are from and yeah let's get into the
video so what I'm thinking is you just
unbox like whatever we have here and
just like talk about it in relation to
why you chose it for me for you okay I
can sit in rickshaws room alright okay
this item from Topshop I really want to
myself I think like a necessity it's a
really cute denim jacket
I wouldn't doing jackets probably every
day so I wanted to Emory overly cute by
the light other woman because she always
wears this one black one I really been
liking cropped denim jackets that are
still oversized but then kind of have
like this raw edge I think they're
really cute so hopefully she thinks
they're cute okay so this okay so one
thing in you I don't know if it's gonna
fit and the other thing is the thing
that I want
okay wait cuz I borrow like one of your
jackets I am and then I really liked it
so thank you the thing is you also pick
like good fabrics this is so like so
much like flexible yeah I feel like I
just like the fabric ready yeah I think
it's cute because it's a cropped yeah
and the good thing is like if I don't
know what to wear it was I'll just ask
you what antic I think it's cute you a
couple seasons but like I'm buying that
income from do you button them back up
I've no I just don't obviously leave
them because I don't like when I don't
right at the end if it's like kind of
loose everywhere else yeah like this no
and then I also got her denim skirt a
little bit different because it has like
a zipper in the front
there was only one size left I ordered
it okay alright
because I really
it like kind of fits I think it's a
little big yeah
that's what I thought it was to me cuz
yesterday but I like I like the style of
it a lot yeah I'd like to be so far okay
okay pretty little thing I've never
ordered to this website before in my
life so let's see what I pictured it I
really didn't try to pick a lot of
things that would just go a lot really
good for a lot of different weight this
is so soft I wanted to get her just like
a plain black bodysuit
this one's just like a straight across
like square neckline which is my
favorite type I think it's super cute
right now and really really flattering
so this is just a cute basic and this
material is so nice this is a good basic
but it might be today oh my god I'm
definitely excited for this I like the
fabric too I always try to go for body
suits and like sometimes it doesn't
really work no I thought it looked super
weird no that's like that's like trendy
now is like really like straight across
and like I like this solely because it
hides like this little fat that usually
like hangs out here you know no I think
it looks good I can't tell if it's like
maybe too small you see the back no I
actually think it was really flattering
what do you guys think comment down
below I mean I think I don't just see it
with like other things then I think you
can layer it really easily
yeah I'd like that okay okay okay
next is Toby this was something that I
thought could be like dressy or worn out
so I picked this color because I think
it's really pretty
I don't think Emory has any color it's
like this pink like white pinky
champagne little romper and then it has
this tied to like tie around your waist
she might need to pin the front of this
so it looks a little bit progressive but
I think this is really pretty
so now that we're going somewhat strong
I'm gonna pick one I'm sure about that's
a good idea okay
and this I thought would be dressy but I
don't even know I don't know if you like
the color and I don't know if it's like
you're definitely enough to pin it
because I don't know why I like the
color
first of all okay yeah we'll see you
with the boob situation though yeah you
definitely don't pin that it was like
definitely pinned in the picture yeah
okay I think I really like it so far and
then like the tie was in the little
loops I like it yeah it's like super
flowy and like super comfortable I like
calling
I wasn't even recording that whole thing
I want to require the whole reaction but
I mean it's like you get the same gist
you would even like cute close up with
like a little the cool material yeah it
was like two colors and I was trying to
decide which store do you want next
you know I'm honestly like most like
scared about the forever21 stuff every
time I want overwhelms me yes this is
from forever 21
honestly if everyone has been great to
me lately they have the best stuff
these Emory for being prepared okay
they've had the best stuff lately and I
think they have really good basics and I
thought it she doesn't love you so she
likes them enough to want to wear them
they're like really affordable so oh
yeah this is so cute okay so first I
just picked out this like white little
tie front crop top things will be really
cute for like going out or anything like
that and then I just got her like
another little clean basic top
it's like black it looks pretty basic
but they were very cheap this is just
like you oh and I thought this is a
bodysuit and I'm not gonna baby okay
yeah I think so too
I mean see this thank you too at the
bottom yeah okay no you can't they're
really black it would be yeah but I
still I'm sewing just if you upload this
and see you like everyone else yeah yeah
this is for any male build these I got
this and I think they look you know
everyone bought me
like children's hands and that's how you
say it but they're just like the classic
like strength really comfy looking pants
and they're supposed to use a ankle
length they're gonna look so cute on
annamaria I think but on me they just
look like sad pajamas so I'm living
vicariously through her okay this one I
have no idea if you're gonna like but I
bought them or you bought them because I
want them and everyone I know it has
them look so good in them and I look
like trash in them but okay we'll see
also this is not the print I wanted it
for you but the print I want three was
gone so like I don't even know how thank
you okay sounds promising
oh my god these are probably not gonna
fit no everyone they're like magical
pants except everyone I look like I'm
wearing pajamas oh my god wait
I like I've been like looking at the
advantage don't know where to start you
know my waist is like not this big but
[Laughter]
this is truly not one size fits all all
I could try them on at the end you
should okay well I'm wearing a romper
city ever sure I could put on let's see
it wait as it was broken first of all I
probably broke it from second of all
this thing barely fits me okay so what
the heck because it looks like they fit
you but then the length is up the length
and it's wrong yeah no these they really
smaller than ones that
okay nasty oh I got hurt a mother's
skirts because I think they're gonna be
a bit staple and also just go with so
much so like she could wear this with
that black bodysuit thank you because
it's this one ask a gal I wanted to get
you the version of this from pre people
but they didn't I want to get the free
people version but they didn't have
black and white so the mix Kurt oh my
god I was like well that could be spicy
for some nights out yeah okay I'm gonna
try this oh this is oh wait wait no I
really thought oh that's the front okay
I think they're actually backwards yeah
definitely the front but they have tags
in the back oh that's high and just flip
it around so I really just don't think
that's good I remember it looking like
that put your hook that around
oh that looks so much better actually
looks really cute you think so yeah I
like it yeah I like it like I can't tell
the too small for me or not
look at first it down I'm gonna get my
explode
by legit okay cool mio explore another
is the size up I think I'm more alright
just testify sit down and play something
like the princess Holly is probably my
favorite store I'm lying to get clothes
from so I wanted to get in recent stuff
I wanted to get her in overall dress oh
those are like my favorite things to
wear I wanted to get for one that wasn't
done I know she has been on so I found
this like ivory corner I won and I
thought that she could like layer this
with a lot and it would go with a lot as
well and just look really cute I also
got her just a plain black dress and
then it has like a little wrap in the
front so this would go with so many
things so yeah I hope they would be -
like really cute was just like basic
things that she can wear with a lot of
different outfits and make them in
really completely different looks so
yeah okay last door princess Polly my
favorite store yeah you always talk
about one of these is like one of those
basic and one is something that I like
wearing a lot and could be cute like the
way that you open your packages this is
like a plain black dress and it like
wraps in the front
oh I thought that with the denim jacket
would be really cute yeah these are the
kinds of things that look really good on
you
mm-hmm but not always on me really oh
okay okay I don't the only thing I'm
confused about is how this job works but
I think I like it I feel like Moana it's
cute
put the okay
yeah it's cute how you do this strap I
like it yeah I like it too
yeah you look at this watch like this is
all I'm gonna wear for like the night
watch out for you in here from now yeah
last one this one I think I feel like I
like it actually it goes with a lot yeah
anything with it okay okay how's that
experience real I relieved I was scared
that you weren't gonna like everything
