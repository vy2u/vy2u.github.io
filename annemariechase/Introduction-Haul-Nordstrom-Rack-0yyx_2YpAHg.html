first video that's going up on my
YouTube account under Amory Chase and
I'm really excited yeah kind of like
nervous to see how this goes because
I've really wanted to start one of these
channels for a really really really long
time
but they've never worked out I've
started probably about six channels and
then I get really discouraged and delete
my videos so hopefully this stays up for
a little while
I actually got all these things a little
while ago but it was on vacation and
then I was like I kind of just thought
about making a haul today so I kind of
just walked around my sister and I his
room because we share clothes and I'm
trying I was trying to pick out all the
clothes that I got um on the trip
because they're all really new it was it
was like it was a month ago but I took
some the tags awful a lot of them and
started wearing them like this one I got
this on my trip it's just um
a denim shirt it's really cute it's so
cute with black tights all these items
from Nordstrom Rack I actually live in
Alaska and we don't have that many
stores this is not a regular shopping
trip like I don't do this every I do
this like once every year I mean school
shopping and trips for trips we go we
get a lot of clothes so that's why I
kind of have a lot of clothes
um but yeah I just wanted to add that
before hand because I don't want you
guys to like think that I just go
shopping like on a regular basis and get
this much clothes I mean it might not
even be that much to you but it's a lot
to me so let's get started
okay so the first thing that I got which
is my favorite shirt or my favorite item
okay I just gave it away and I've
actually won this quite a few times so
it's this plain Frenchy um white t-shirt
I love this t-shirt I love working out
with this shirt with a next item that
was a terrible transition I'm sorry with
a sports bra
I got this from Nordstrom ACK I don't
know um it's just a Nike sports bra and
I loved the design on it so I've always
wanted like a colorful sports bra it
really motivates me to work out
like rather than just a plain shirt
because you what what I usually do is I
put this sports bra and then pair it
with this white tank top so you can see
like the design of the sports bra
without like going to the gym with a
sports bra on I will show you sorry if
I'm like talking really fast and and
stuff kind of nervous a mood um see it
like that
and it's really adorable so cute all
right so those are my favorite and then
we'll go on to all the other things my
sister and I are really close in age and
we lived right next to each other so we
share a lot of clothes so some of these
that are items that she picked out this
is one of those items she got these red
pants red denim pants um they're Paige
these actually were not like super cheap
I remember because I was like why did
you get these I am NOT a super colored
pants type of person but if you are
these are adorable pants to wear but I
do like the other pair of colored pants
that she got which are these Paige
colored short short jean things these
are really cute colored shorts I think
are really in this season so some of
those and then the next thing that we
got from Nordstrom Rack wore these Paige
shorts living in Alaska we don't have
like any shorts in our wardrobe and we
were in Atlanta Georgia where it is very
very very hot in the summertime so we
kind of had to get at least one pair of
jeans each then my mom really really
really liked this I don't really I'm
still trying to get used to it I think I
might wear it for like one of my school
dances or something but I'm not quite
sure I don't I don't really have the
body for it this is like one of those
super curvalicious girl body things
it's BCBG and this also wasn't one of
those things on sale but since my mom
and my sister and I all wear the same
size
we decided we would share it my sister
doesn't like it I don't know like I'm
kind of on the fence about it I don't
have super great shoulders and this is
like one of those things that Lea
Michele would look fabulous in because
she has amazing shoulders um so I don't
know I'm still thinking about that so
this is the next thing I got this is
actually my sister she picked this out I
hope you can see it it's um like a lace
it's definitely see-through it's a lace
shirt with really pretty designs going
down the bottom and it's like off-white
it's not it's not white and that it has
strings on the bottom which you can
tighten for the bottom and then it's
like crunches up I don't know how to
explain it and then it has the cuffs the
cuffs are also like to get they get
tight around the bottom they're elastic
I think that's what you would call them
this shirt I didn't I was not a fan of
this shirt at first at all but I
actually wore this for a job interview
that I had and it was so cute I paired
it with I paired it with tights and
heels and this with a white shirt or
like white tank top underneath and it
was adorable I really like this shirt I
really like how its see-through I don't
have any other shirts like this it's
lace I actually wore it in a video that
I filmed I might not put up I'm not sure
but I it's really really really cute so
I really like that and it pretty much
goes with anything I haven't worn it
with just jeans yet because I feel like
it's very much a more formal thing to
wear but I'll try it the next thing that
I got was from Nordstrom it was during
the the sale I really can't tell you how
much it cost but it's so cute
it is this jean jacket it's really heavy
and it's like I mean it just feels
really heavy like even when I go to hang
it up on a hanger I'm just like whoa
it's by sanctuary clothing
located in Los Angeles I guess it has
yellow stitching which makes the jacket
look like a lot
lighter in color and then here the cuffs
this is just a really it's it's really
cute to wear with um I don't know I feel
like I definitely I have definitely worn
this but I it's really cute to wear with
that plain white t-shirt and tank tops
and dresses so far I've worn it with the
plan white t-shirt and it is adorable I
get compliments every single time I wear
it which is what's so I've gotten
compliments once I actually found
another item that was from Nordstrom not
Nordstrom Rack and it was this graphic
t-shirt the next thing it's really cute
it's really plain my sister actually
pick this one out while I picked the
jean jacket out and um I don't even know
what it says it says peace and love ever
lasting there you go okay so the last
thing I have to show you is so so cute
let's see I'll try to show you some
details Wow so it comes with this little
belt and on this side it's black and
then on this side it is like a beige
color and it's adorable because we when
you tighten front you tie it in a bow
and then it shows the beige and the
black and it just all goes together so
well and then it um it kind of poops out
at the bottom like this it's it's not
straight and that's also really adorable
so we're gonna wear it to like our
school dances and stuff like that over
our dresses because it's really really
really cool up in Alaska in the winter
and then the final thing I got was not
from Nordstrom Rack or Nordstrom it was
from the Philadelphia Airport it was
like a gift shop I guess and it's a cute
little bag I thought it was very broadly
because my mom just handed it to me and
I was like oh this is so adorable it's
like Vera Bradley but it's not because I
have a very Bradley 8 keychain I mean I
know they don't match but I they kind of
look similar in designs so I just
thought that they were much both fair
Vera Bradley oh it is duh oh this is
embarrassing
yeah so this is very Bradley it's really
cute it has an inside pocket where you
can put your little ID card
really put any of my cards there because
I don't use this as my everyday like
grab and go thing I just use that little
keychain thing and then it has a pocket
in here and then you can put it over the
shoulder and it's just really I think
it's really cute and this was extremely
cheap because the store was closing down
so my mom got it for a really good price
