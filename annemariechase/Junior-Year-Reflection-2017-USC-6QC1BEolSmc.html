channel so today's video is going to be
a continuation of a little series that I
started two years ago basically this is
going to be my junior year reflection
video at the University of Southern
California where I attend I did this my
freshman year my sophomore year if you
guys haven't seen those I'll link them
in the description box below this was
definitely the best year I have had at
USC in every aspect and I learned so
much from this year and I think I grew a
lot as a person so I'm excited to share
this video with you guys and what I've
learned this year okay my first semester
was very interesting because while I
liked for the most part the classes that
I was taking I was only taking 14 units
which is the lowest amount of units that
I've ever taken at school the most I've
taken is 18 the least before this past
semester was 16 not only was that
interesting but the fact that I was just
really burnt out for the entire first
semester it was towards the end of the
semester and I was registering for my
classes for the next semester and I was
just like I have no idea how I'm going
to be able to do this exact same thing
over again next year because my life at
that point just felt so repetitive I'm
sorry she could hear the noise outside I
didn't know at the time what it was
going to be but I was like I need
something to change like I need
something to mix up my routine
thankfully this opportunity came at the
perfect time which is my offer to intern
full time with jnj but just going back
to like my first semester I did learn a
few things and have some reflection
academically I did pretty well I had the
highest GPA that I've gotten that USC so
far and I probably should have since I
was only taking 14 units so compared to
my freshman and sophomore year I talked
a lot about my social aspect in my
social life I felt like I had a way more
established friend group and not
necessarily like a friend group from the
same group with just like friends around
campus and familiar faces of people that
I really liked also going off of that I
was extremely like kind of pleasantly
surprised honestly by how well and how
much I loved my roommates this year so
you guys know that
like I've always had like kind of weird
roommate situations my first semester I
lived like in a really isolated dorm so
I didn't really meet anyone outside of
my room next year I lived in that
eight-man apartment with like a bunch of
random people and then this year I moved
in with my roommate Zoe who's been my
roommate for like last three years and
two of her friends and then one girl
who's kind of in the same position as me
she was like friends with the girls but
she wasn't like best friends yeah
Michelle do you I heard that was good
thank you
that was Jacob okay
I became super super close with two of
the other girls like outside living in
my house life is so much easier to live
with people that you like because you're
constantly surrounded by them you see
them all the time which means that like
if you like them you constantly have
really good conversation really good
company it's really easy to coordinate
plans just huge benefits of course I'm
still dating my boyfriend Jacob he just
made me coffee which is very nice of him
and then the next thing that I want to
transition over to is just that I had
like the best and like luckiest kind of
career opportunities career
opportunities because like it's not
really but it is like in some way going
to advance my career someday in terms of
like like an actual like corporate
career in terms of like my youtube I had
100 thousand subscribers this year which
is insane so obviously as I said many
many times before my channel I did a
full time co-op or internship with
Neutrogena with Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson's it
was kind of a crazy story I'll link the
story of this co-op and like how I got
it below but it was something that I
very much was not really expecting to do
I didn't even hear back until December
that I would be basically changing the
entire course of my next semester by
taking a leave of absence not taking any
classes and I also had to make a
trade-off because the past semester the
first semester I was a TA for this class
that I took part in my freshman year
called GLP the Global Leadership Program
and in this class it's basically the
first semesters like having a bunch of
guest lectures and then the second
semester was learning all about China
their culture their business practices
and then going to China Shanghai and
Beijing when I was offered this position
with J&amp;amp;J I was like well this might not
work out because I have agreed to be a
PA for GLP it ended up being that I
actually could have done both but the
person that was like behind the
organization of that was just kind of
too unorganized I personally just made
the decision to not continue with GLP
that was a trade-off that I was kind of
sad to make because I would have gotten
like a free trip to China and it was
would have been really rewarding to go
but a hundred percent do not regret my
decision to pursue and like do my
full-time internship first of all like I
learned so much about consumer marketing
which is a potential career path that I
want to go down I had a lot more
flexibility in my schedule at school I
have a really hard time differentiating
like when I should be studying and when
I should like be not studying you could
constantly be studying
I feel bad whenever I'm not but at work
it's like when you come back from work
you're done with work I was able to
travel more I went to New York City
Atlanta I was able to make money they
paid pretty well like better than any of
my internships or any previous jobs that
I've ever had before I also could
potentially work for Jay Jay in the
future if I get an offer and if not I at
least have that experience on my resume
I mean I also learn from that is that
having a unique skill or talent is so
important so I started my youtube
channel literally not knowing what I
would do with it I just wanted to make
videos and have this community of people
which I'm very proud of establishing my
YouTube thing is my favorite thing but
something that I've realized is that I
have gotten more interviews and like
calls back from job applications because
with the world becoming increasingly
digital being able to market with
influencers like YouTube influencers or
you know just knowing any social media
platform is actually so important if you
look at any of the beauty brands
influencers are talking about them
because those brands are paying
influencers to talk about that they have
a lot more importance than you might
think
I was also going to do video on that
like stuff that you don't think about
youtubers or like YouTube but because of
that and because of my youtube
experience even though it's very very
small compared to like actual YouTube
influencers and like huge like youtuber
I've been able to get like a lot of
opportunities just from that and people
even within the company have asked me a
lot about like influencers for their own
brands and that kind of just shows that
if you pick and pursue something that
you're genuinely interested in it won't
go to waste even if it seems like
something that is literally pointless
like when I started this in high school
and even in college like people make fun
of me sometimes because I make videos
and it's like you might not think that
it's an important thing to do but in
some ways it really is an important
thing to know about so yeah that's like
a very rewarding thing that I learned
this year you can take your interests
and passions and turn it into like an
actual thing that is applicable in the
corporate world if that's what you're
looking for all right that's what I'm
looking for I don't know yet but we'll
see and then even like a cool
opportunity that I was offered through
my youtube channel is I am going to
Ibiza literally the day after my co-op
ends so it's in one week that's insane
basically a company called top tech
reached out to me and was like hey we
have another influencer going on this
sailing trip to Ibiza freak me Gio who
actually no we were wondering if you
want to come and I like thought it was
spam and I just replied and I was like
oh tell me more about this but they like
I have my ticket to Barcelona I'm going
to go to Ibiza literally the most
exciting thing that has happened to my
youtube life it's something that I'm so
excited for like I can't even imagine it
because I'm still like in the process of
like finishing all my presentation for
work and stuff that I just like honestly
cannot even think about how excited I am
but I know that like I'm so blessed to
have that opportunity because of YouTube
so yeah I just like a lot of really cool
interesting opportunities that I've had
this year but I've definitely never had
before and I think my mindset has kind
of been switching more from like being
super concerned about like grades and
stuff like that to being more concerned
about like career and like what I want
to do next but I'm excited for this
summer I'm excited to finish up my co-op
just because I want to make videos for
you guys and just have that last summer
before I get like a full time job to be
able to make videos and like just do
whatever I want
yeah it was an amazing
master an amazing year I just feel so
happy and excited for the future this
