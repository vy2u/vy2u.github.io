filming my Korea haul all this stuff has
been sitting on my dresser since I said
I was gonna film it but I'm finally
filming it sorry if it looks a little
bit depressing in the background
especially with my super empty closet so
first of all I just wanted to like say
that it's my first birthday on YouTube
which I'm really excited about I feel
like that's a really big accomplishment
to be on YouTube for a year because
before I actually had this channel I had
like three other channels I just really
wanted to make videos but I never
actually kept them so this is basically
kind of a big accomplishment and I just
literally just reached four thousand
five hundred subscribers on my channel
you guys can see it's like the exact
number as I'm filming right now I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started now
I didn't buy nearly as many clothing
items and accessories as I did makeup
but I know that some of you still wanted
to see what I got and what clothes I got
from Korea and stuff like that so I'm
just gonna show you guys and I think I
got some pretty cool stuff
so the first three items and like the
majority of the clothing type we got was
definitely inspired by some of the
Korean girls that we saw like on the
streets and stuff like that in all the
subways
I really admire Korean fashion for the
most part I think it's just really
classy and really really cute the three
things that I got we were kind of
looking for just because we saw them a
lot on other girls and they looked
really good on those girls these are the
types of shirts that we saw some of the
girls wearing this is just a kind of a
grayish blue t-shirt and it's just a
super long like oversized t-shirt and
then we have one in white too so it's
literally just a super long t-shirt it
kind of like is as long as a dress
should be and then it has this little
pocket right here and we just got to
basically of the same things in
different colors so we saw these
oversized t-shirts on a few girls and
we're just like wow that looks really
good but when we've tried them on it
kind of just like t-shirts to go like
workout or go to sleep or something so
it definitely did not look the same I
think it's cuz a lot of the people that
we saw them on we're really really thin
and we're just kind of like average size
I don't know I feel
it's always good to have some kind of
t-shirt and if we do just end up wearing
these to sleep then that's also a good
use of these t-shirts so here is another
one of the super long t-shirts and it's
kind of crumpled sorry it's been in the
bag since I've gotten back but it had
this elephant design and this is just so
adorable to me like I just love this
elephant design I wish I could have it
like on my youtube like banner thing
because it's so adorable I guess I
should say where I got these things from
we got the two t-shirts from there
that's what it says on here and then
this was from namu those were actually
super cheap I think there were 7,000 won
each I can't really remember and then
this was around like 38 thousand won I
believe I took the tag off I don't know
where I put it but it really wasn't that
expensive so that is so here's what this
looks like and I just thought the print
was super pretty and I actually tried
this on and it looks a lot better than
those plain t-shirts for some reason so
I just really love this
so moving on also from the same store we
got these printed pants and these are
kind of like Genie pants I don't really
know how else to describe them they're
kind of flowy and then they they stay
like straight legged at the bottom
I saw a few girls like wearing these
types of pants with like heels and that
was really pretty Holly and I just both
really like these pants so we just
decided to share them because they were
a little bit more expensive there are 48
thousand won and that's I don't know
it's not that bad
but it was like more expensive than that
shirt um so yeah and these have pockets
and stuff like that so we just thought
these are really cute and I don't know
I'm kind of these are definitely
different I don't think I've ever had
anything like these but I'm really
excited to wear them nanu I'm really not
sure if I'm saying it right had a bunch
of these type of pants but we picked
these ones because I feel like these are
really versatile so my absolutely
favorite thing that I got I think out of
all of Korea except some makeup maybe
was from punky Planet I got this mirror
from punky Planet and this is honestly
one of the cutest things I
I think I'm just like every single time
I look at it I'm just like so happy that
I got it I feel like that doesn't really
happen for a lot of things that I get
I'm just like oh this is so beautiful I
don't know I'm so excited that I have it
and I picked this one because it looked
most like me I mean it doesn't look like
anything like me but there was like one
with black hair and then there was like
one with blonde hair and there was like
a pink one I'm really excited to use
this for like videos and stuff like that
because I don't know if you've seen but
I usually just use like like my NARS
like compact mirror or just like a
really plain Locker mirror that I got
from my locker when I was like in eighth
grade so it's really nice to have an
actual nice pant held mirror the next
thing that I got was walking from a mall
called like Emaar I think yeah so this
is just a galaxy phone case and if you
didn't know what you probably don't
unless you follow me on Twitter I have a
galaxy I just replaced my iPhone with a
galaxy and I really have no reason why I
did this I have been an Apple fan for
basically since I've been using
technology but I just heard that the
galaxy was a little bit better so I just
wanted to try it out and I'm really
happy that I did it's been a really good
switch and I really feel like this is my
phone like I didn't buy any cases for my
iPhone for some reason except for like a
$7 juicy case at a juicy outlet and it
was like super ugly but I just really
feel like I didn't need to buy things
for it I was like this is just a foam
like I don't understand why you need to
buy phone cases for phones but since
I've had this galaxy I've been buying
phone cases and I just feel like oh my
nails are really embarrassing sorry um
but I just feel like this is like a
phone that I'm gonna have for a really
long time so I want to get like cute
accessories for it I really don't know
why I feel so much better about like
buying phone cases for this phone maybe
it's cuz I know that I'll have this type
of phone for a while but I'm just really
okay with buying phone cases and it's so
weird so I just got this one the day I
got it and then in Korea a lot of people
had these flip phones flip phone cases
so me of course being the little
fashioned copier that I am really wanted
one and this is
honestly my favorite color of pale pink
I had my whole room like this this pale
pink and lime green and obviously it was
a huge headache because those colors on
walls do not look very good at least the
colors that I chose but it was exactly
like this and I just really loved this
case I don't have it on my phone right
now because I noticed that whenever I
wear jeans and I slip it in and out of
my pocket because I don't have a purse
that I really carry around yet it starts
it started to dye the sides blue so I
decided that I'm not gonna you know use
it when I go to work or something like
that I'm just gonna use it when I feel
like a change or something and I want to
use this nicer case and I saw this case
a lot and different like kiosks and
stuff like that and I got this for 48
thousand won or 47 thousand won and they
were selling and a lot of other places
for like 58 thousand won so I feel like
I got a good deal basically the last two
things that I got that were like in
Korea were from Nam Nam Dae moon and I
have this in my blog if you guys want to
go check that out but I got these two
wallets and there are 5,000 on each so
that means that there are less than five
dollars five US dollars so I thought
these were a super good steal I got this
for my friend Rachel and then I got this
one for myself and they also both come
with like a little strap so you can use
it as like a little clutch so those are
the two things that I got in Nam Dae
moon and then the very last thing that I
got was in the airport and I'm really
happy that I got this I am a super big
coffee and tea fan so I got this mug so
this is a Seoul Knight Starbucks mug and
I got the night one because my sister
got the day one and I think that the day
one's a lot more beautiful I guess
because it basically incorporates like
every single color of the rainbow and
then it has like gold in it but I
thought this one here I'll try to focus
it for you so I thought this one was
also just really beautiful and I really
like the colors that they used
so I basically go to school every single
day with a mug full of tea or coffee and
I use the exact same Christmas mug
throughout the entire school year so I'm
really excited to be able to use the
next school year and I mean during the
summer too so even though like this is
just a Starbucks mug I'm really happy
that I got this so those are all the
clothing and accessories that I got from
Seoul I really didn't get that many
things but I'm pretty happy with the
amount of things that I got so yeah
that's it for this haul I'm planning on
filming a get ready with me morning
video and also a 50 random facts about
me video I was just curious which one
you guys would want to see first and
also I'll be asking you guys what kind
of things that you guys might want for a
future giveaway but I'm gonna ask on
Twitter just because it's easy and I can
like take pictures and like just tweet
them directly so if you guys want to
follow me on Twitter to answer those
kind of things my user name is chase
underscore and ring and I'll have it
linked down below and I also have an
Instagram if you guys want to follow me
I haven't been posting as many pictures
as I wanted to just because this phone
takes my galaxy takes like amazingly
great quality pictures but if I take
like a picture of myself or something
like you can see like every single thing
on my face which kind of scares me so I
haven't been taking how many pictures
but I think I'm just gonna start using
like some filtering apps or something
like that so go ahead and follow me on
Instagram if you guys want to and
subscribe to this channel if you want
more videos from me and I will see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
