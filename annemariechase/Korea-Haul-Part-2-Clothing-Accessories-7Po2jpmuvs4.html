filming my Korea haul all this stuff has
been sitting on my dresser since I said
I was gonna film it but I'm finally
filming it sorry if it looks a little
bit depressing in the background
especially with my super empty closet so
first of all I just wanted to like say
that it's my first birthday on YouTube
which I'm really excited about I feel
like that's a really big accomplishment
to be on youtube for a year because
before I actually had this channel I had
like three other channels I just really
wanted to make videos but I never
actually kept them so this is basically
kind of a big accomplishment and I just
literally just reached four thousand
five hundred subscribers on my channel
you guys can see it's like the exact
number as I'm filming right now I'm just
gonna go ahead and get started now I
didn't buy nearly as many clothing items
and accessories as I did makeup but I
know that some of you still wanted to
see what I got and what clothes i got
from korea and stuff like that so i'm
just going to show you guys and i think
i got some pretty cool stuff so the
first three items and like the majority
of the clothing type we got was
definitely inspired by some of the
korean girls that we saw like on the
streets and stuff like that in all the
subways um i really admire korean
fashion for the most part I think it's
just really classy and really really
cute the three things that I got um we
were kind of looking for just because we
saw them a lot on other girls and then
looked really good on those girls these
are the types of shirts that we saw some
of the girls wearing this is just a kind
of a grayish blue t-shirt and it's just
a super long like oversized t-shirt and
then we have one in white too so it's
literally just a super long t-shirt it
kind of like is as long as address
should be and then it has a little paki
right here and we just got to basically
of the same things in different colors
so we saw these oversized t-shirts on a
few girls and we're just like wow that
looks really good but when we've tried
them on it kind of just like t-shirts to
go like work out or go to sleep or
something so it definitely did not look
the same i think it's cuz a lot of the
people that we saw the one we're really
really thin and we're just kind of like
average
guys I don't know I feel like it's
always good to have some kind of t-shirt
and if we do just end up wearing these
to sleep then that's also a good use of
these t-shirts so here is another one of
the super long t-shirts and it's kind of
crumpled sorry it's been in the bag
since I've gotten back but it had this
elephant design and this is just so
adorable to me like I just love this
elephant design I wish I could have it
like on my youtube like banner thing
because it's so adorable i guess i
should say where I got these things from
we got the two t-shirts from there
that's what it says on here and then
this was from namu those were actually
super cheap I think there were seven
thousand one each I can't really
remember and then this was around like
thirty eight thousand one I believe I
took the tag off I don't know where I
put it but it really wasn't that
expensive so that is so here's what this
looks like and I just thought the print
was super pretty and I actually try this
on and it looks a lot better than those
plain t-shirts for some reason so I just
really love this so moving on also from
the same store we got these printed
pants and these are kind of like Genie
pants I don't really know how else to
describe them they're kind of flowing
and they they stay like straight legged
at the bottom I saw a few girls like
wearing these types of pants with like
heels and that was really pretty Holly
and I just both really like these pants
so we just decided to share them because
they were a little bit more expensive um
there are 48 thousand one and that's I
don't know it's not that bad but it was
like more expensive than that shirt um
so yeah and these have pockets and stuff
like that so we just thought these are
really cute and I don't know I'm kind of
these are definitely different i don't
think i've ever had anything like these
but i'm really excited to wear them namu
i'm really not sure if I'm saying it
right had a bunch of these type of pants
um but we picked these ones because I
feel like these are really versatile so
my absolutely favorite thing that I got
I think out of all of Korea except some
makeup maybe was from punky planet I got
this mirror from punky planet and this
is honestly one of the cutest things
i own i think i'm just like every single
time i look at it I'm just like so happy
that I got it I feel like that doesn't
really happen for a lot of things that I
get I'm just like oh this is so
beautiful I don't know I'm so excited
that I have it and I picked this one
because it looked most like me I mean it
doesn't look like anything like me but
there was like one with black hair and
then there was like one with blond hair
and there was like a pink one I'm really
excited to use this for like videos and
stuff like that because i don't know if
you've seen but i usually just use like
like mine ours like compact mirror or
just like a really plain locker mare
that i got from my locker when I was
like in 8th grade so it's really nice to
have an actual nice pant held mirror the
next thing that I got was walking from a
mall called like e-mart I think yeah so
this is just a galaxy phone case and if
you didn't know what you probably don't
unless you follow me on twitter i have a
galaxy I just replaced my iphone with a
galaxy and i really have no reason why I
did this I have been an apple fan for
basically since i've been using
technology but i just heard that the
galaxy was a little bit better so i just
wanted to try it out and I'm really
happy that I did it's been a really good
switch and I really feel like this is my
phone like I didn't buy any cases for my
iphone for some reason except for like a
seven dollar juicy case at a juicy
outlet and it was like super ugly but I
just really feel like I didn't need to
buy things for it I was like this is
just a phone like I don't understand why
you need to buy phone cases for phones
but since I've had this galaxy I've been
buying phone cases and I just feel like
oh my nails are really embarrassing
sorry um but I just feel like this is
like a phone that I'm gonna have for a
really long time so I want to get like
cute accessories for it I really don't
know why I feel so much better about
like buying phone cases for this phone
maybe it's because I know that I'll have
this type of phone for a while but I'm
just really okay with buying phone cases
and it's so weird so I just got this one
the day I got it and then in Korea a lot
of people had these flip phones flip
phone cases so me of course being the
little fashion copier that I am really
wanted one and this is
honestly my favorite color of pale pink
I had my whole room like this this pale
pink and lime green and obviously it was
a huge headache because those colors on
walls do not look very good at least the
colors that I chose but it was exactly
like this and I just really love this
case I don't have it on my phone right
now because I noticed that whenever I
wear jeans and I slip it in and out of
my pocket because I don't have a purse
that I really carry around yet it starts
it started to die the sides blue so i
decided that i'm not going to you know
use it when i go to work or something
like that i'm just gonna use it when I
feel like a change or something and I
want to use this nicer case and I saw
this case a lot and different like
kiosks and stuff like that and I got
this for forty-eight thousand one or
forty seven thousand one and they were
selling an a lot of other places for
like fifty eight thousand one so I feel
like I got a good deal basically the
last two things that I got that were
like in Korea were from nom nom de moon
and I have this in my blog if you guys
want to go check that out but I got
these two wallets and there are 5,000 on
each so that means that there are less
than five dollars five US dollars so i
thought these were a super good steel i
got this for my friend rachel and then i
got this one for myself and they also
both come with like a little straps so
you can use it as like a little clutch
so those are the two things that i got
in nom de moon and then the very last
thing that I got was in the airport and
I'm really happy that I got this I am a
super big coffee and tea fan so I got
this mug so this is a soul night
starbucks mug and I got the night one
because my sister got the day one and I
think that the day one's a lot more
beautiful I guess because it basically
incorporates like every single color of
the rainbow and then it has like gold in
it but I thought this one here i'll try
to focus it for you so i thought this
one was also just really beautiful and i
really like the colors that they used so
i basically go to school every single
day with a mug full of tea or coffee and
I use the exact same Christmas mug
throughout the entire school year so I'm
really excited to be able to use this
next school year and I mean during the
summer too so even though like this is
just a starbucks mug I'm really happy
that I got this so those are all the
clothing and accessories that i got from
Seoul I really didn't get that many
things but I'm pretty happy with the
amount of things that I got so yeah
that's it for this hall I'm planning on
filming a get ready with me morning
video and also a 50 random facts about
me video I was just curious which one
you guys would want to see first and
also I'll be asking you guys what kind
of things that you guys might want for a
future giveaway but I'm gonna ask on
Twitter just because it's easy and I can
like take pictures and like just tweet
them directly so if you guys want to
follow me on Twitter to answer those
kind of things my user name is chase
underscore and meringue and I'll have it
linked down below and i also have an
instagram if you guys want to follow me
i have been posting as many pictures as
i wanted to just because this phone
takes my galaxy takes like amazingly
great quality pictures but if i take
like a picture of myself or something
like you can see like every single thing
on my face which kind of scares me so i
haven't been taking that many pictures
but i think i'm just going to start
using like some filtering apps or
something like that so go ahead and
follow me on instagram if you guys want
to and subscribe to this channel if you
want more videos for me and i will see
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
