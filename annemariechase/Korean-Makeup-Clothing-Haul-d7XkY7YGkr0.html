beautiful oh really want to show you
guys but I don't want to lose focus I'm
gonna show you guys oh no don't you hey
guys it's a Marie as I mentioned like a
thousand times I'm living in Shanghai so
last weekend I was able to just like
take a weekend trip to Korea Korean
people very very well put together hair
makeup an outfit on point like for guys
and girls but also another thing about
Korea is that they have like really
top-line beauty products so two years
ago when I went to Korea I did two hauls
a makeup and then a clothing haul and
then I did I think to Korea blogs so I'm
gonna link those all below and I think
it feels to be really fun to watch we
make summer purchases off of
recommendations from this youtuber and
I'll link her video in the description
box below it was really helpful so you
might see like a lot of overlapping
products the places that we went to or
etude house every time I'm definitely
saying that wrong it is free damn Club
Cleo and then of course I did like a
little bit of clothes shopping to closer
a little bit harder though because I'm
really big Indonesia so just a few
things so the first place I'm talking
about is food I was looking for like
shower stuff at skin food because Cheers
going out to Korea you guys can see in
that hall I actually got like this green
tea body wash and it smelt so good but
we asked around and they didn't have any
so I ended up just getting like this
honey rich body wash and then I also got
the skin food sit drugs scalp care
shampoo and conditioner this is a
shampoo I've only used this like once
this is the quality of my hair it
doesn't have like a very strong smell
but I think that's kind of what I like
about Korean products like if there's a
smell it's very like very light and not
like perfume II like a very light touch
of a very pleasant smell and my hair
dried pretty straight today so the girl
who's video
recommended cotton I didn't even think
about that I like didn't even watch
every day before I just needed some like
cotton pads because I also got this
black sugar cleansing water from
skin-food
just because I wanted a cleanser and
these are the mild silky condo not only
is it like good quality but it's also
very cheap I also got this peppermint
morning tea dry shampoo I totally forgot
about this I've been trying to wash my
hair every other day if I don't like
exercise and sweat profusely and dry
shampoo is very helpful to that and this
smells like peppermint which is my
favorite scent for things oh okay this
is by far the cutest thing I like the
cutest beauty product that I own so far
based on that girl's recommendation she
said that we should get the precious
mineral any cushion from etude house and
this is a DIY project that they had like
the option of doing I'm not gonna lie I
got this compact because of this case um
but yeah in the product inside I guess
so it looks very very spongy
and here's what this looks like like
this is adorable do you guys want to see
how I focus my videos okay it's manual
soap or auto automatic focus do you hear
that and then I just dug out of the way
so that it doesn't catch my face moving
really fast and then turn off like auto
focus gotta prepare myself I also have
to here just cuz it moves ready okay
that moved a little bit but I don't make
it move much so if this is out of focus
nice lift thing when she was every Tom
Audie Tom I don't know they're saying it
and I was like oh I should remember at
this right oh this is one of the
products that that girl will also
recommend it she said the full lipsticks
the honey like melting tints really the
best lipstick
I got me color number two and this is
what it looks like I'm actually wearing
it right now it's very moisturizing and
I have some dry lips sometimes and they
can get chapped and it's just disgusting
looking if I put lipstick on top of that
so a moisturizing lipstick is like a
must for me another amazing thing about
like Korean
stores is that they just give you a ton
of sample like I got so many face masks
and like little samples like that nice
place
let's Club Cleo I know I up say
we thought it was a club like and I know
that this was the perfect beauty product
for me I really I'm like super happy
that I got this
it is the gel presa waterproof pencil
gel liner and this is also something
that that girl recommended I should
learn her name I should have before I
did this I put it on the inner corners
of my eyes and then like a little bit
like right in the lower what would you
call that I'll show you guys okay so do
you see how like I have an inner
highlight right here in here and then I
like bring it down in my lower lash line
so if you go to Korea and you see like
the advertisements a lot of the girls
have like really really bright eyes like
right under your lower lash line they
have like a highlight and it just makes
them look very like adorable and like
awake it has the same function of my NYX
jumbo eye pencil but it's just a lot
easier to like concentrate in the area
that you want to put it in feel like it
just really really opens up your eyes a
lot and brings like a lot of light into
them and makes you look a lot more awake
from etude house we also got this my
beauty tool it's just like an eyebrow
comb and scissors so I don't have one of
these and my eyebrows can get really big
sometimes so I got them and then the
last place that we went to it was in a3
and this is something that the girl also
recommended let me just like show you
the samples first of all these are only
like half of the meeting for the samples
that they gave us like no that would
make that four they gave so many this is
like an actual mask and this is like a
sample of the things that I got but I
got the the green tea seed serum
it says the nourishing moisture serum is
formulated with freshly squeezed Jeju
green tea and green tea seeds and then I
just wanted to like sure I got something
real fast okay so this is a company
called boutique this company actually
sent me masks and I just totally forgot
about them it's not sponsored whatsoever
anything
like that so it's like one of those
monthly subscription boxes that sends
you their beauty products and they send
you Korean
face masks and I actually really really
like masks you guys probably seen in my
blogs that I do mass pretty often like I
would say at least like once every two
weeks just whenever I think about it I
don't think I realized like how like
good of an idea that this one until I
went to Korea and realize like how
popular the face masks are and it just
makes it really accessible to people
because like I'm not gonna just go to
Korea all the time like I got my little
haul of things that I'll take back home
but on them this is a really really cool
idea and I already use a lot of the
masks but like some of them are like
this is a wine mask this is a black head
black rose acne fighting masks which is
perfect for me this is so cute I don't
know what this is I can't oh I suppose
in house English like someone didn't
really have English which is kind of a
downside but this one does so apparently
you apply this to your cheeks and leave
for 20 or 30 minutes I don't know what
this does your cheeks oh yeah so if you
are interested links will be in the
description marks below and then we also
my clothes shopping but we didn't get as
many things I actually spent a lot of my
time at Zara and Korea not a lot of my
time but I got kind of a lot of things
from there I was looking for a striped
shirt so I just got like a pretty basic
like flame striped shirt oh this is so
cute I totally forgot about this I
totally cut along on this yesterday we
we went out okay so this is a romper my
mom actually picked this out um and it
looks like this so this is the front and
then it ties in the back so it's kind of
like backless but it ties together so
cute and then it has pockets and then it
cinches up the waist you can tie it and
yeah I think that this is really
adorable very wearable for the clubs
that we've been going to over here and I
got this shirt it just says insert your
fries here I feel like it doesn't really
make that much sense just cuz like you
can't actually insert your fries here if
it was a pocket
make more sense but it's not but I
really like fries though that'd we went
to like we were just some mall
I actually found that this was half off
but it ended up being like the normal
price so it was pretty expensive but I
think I will be able to wear it for a
pretty long time this is what it looks
like maybe I'll try it on
wow this doesn't look as cute as it is
but it's pretty cute I thought it was
just like a very dressy like casual
looking thing and it looks really good
with the outfit I was wearing that day
so maybe that's why I got it but it kind
of like just goes like this it's just a
really like cute and casual but I like a
little bit more dressy type of thing and
I'm riding it like it was like $80 so I
totally thought it was on sale yeah so I
can talk about that and then I got shoes
for I think 40 and they're super super
goth kind of said that these are really
cute I was like oh those are really cute
and they had my size and they were like
10% off and they are already kind of
cheap for like the u.s. price so I just
got them and I really liked them and
then I got some really adorable socks
Korean ones like adorable socks just
like on the streets this is one of the
pairs and then I got some Korean socks
yeah I like to represent the country
that I my mom is around okay so that's
pretty much the end of my haul you
