how does it taste that's so cool
Callaghan
very much
we're adventuring in Nam Dae moon and I
don't speak Korean that wrong but it's
pretty cool cats taking lots of pictures
smells really good
okay I'll get some Korean makeup
pictures or videos of the Korean style
supernatural
oh yeah let's look in here
or charge it was over to me that even
stuff for charity yeah
herbs are all Louise
these little thingies are cute too and
also bears
coming down me so much bad luck in the
blue dad
all right wait do pink again okay here
that looks better it's no
so we're going dumb game on so we're
leaving
damn they wouldn't go on a dumb thing
yes
anyways it's all more the sweetest
without a moon
I got both of these for 10,000 won so
5,000 won each which is like less than
$5 that's fun to give to my best friend
Rachel and I'm really excited because
they are super super cheap and the
subway go in 2000 at agent Edward :
we're good fielding Callie done
he's out looking this way
with umber somewhere to eat decided on
this one grand doors
planning automatic doors
how cool do I like this dream tea anyone
to use yeah pancakes are so good
threatened aren't they like angel cake
most of them are these are so cute too
so we just got out of Paris either
everywhere in there so cute we're going
back to the restaurant
Kelly can I see your drink is adorable
this is what you got all your dirt and
then grilled mackerel bags I'm feeling
on the back
lotta bags
here in Korea we shop at the plus-size
seriously
this place is adorable
look at cute house you day
the nostril is out the power thing wait
can I see the front of it
horrible just gonna start talking okay
well anyways um we just got back from
Lotte world and it was super cool all
the malls here I think are just giant
markets so you can go the department
stores
wait you that what did I say oh okay no
they are markets aren't they no no
because they're not all department
stores so you can get anything there
okay well I feel like they're low with
cold okay well anyways like there was a
floor for electronic so for fur clothing
and then there was even a floor in a
Mart for weddings so that was really
weird I didn't get any vlogs of that
because I just started vlogging it on
the last day of Korea which kind of
sucks but I wasn't really in the
vlogging mood before but now I am so we
just ate dinner and now we are back in
the hotel room it is like 9:00 and we
just got done eating did I already say
that I don't know anyways so we're
getting ready to pack or we're packing
and getting ready to leave and Kelly's
trying on all the clothes that we just
got a lot of stuff which I'm really
excited about because we did not go
shopping at all until the very last day
which I don't know that's fine with me
because didn't get too much stuff but
got enough stuff and I'm really excited
to vlog or haul that so I'm really
excited about the Korean things that we
got Koreans are extremely trendy and
fashionable today seriously thanks
seriously wear whatever they want and
they make it look good yeah they're all
very fit it's really awkward being kind
of big here and we're not even that big
we're just average sizes like you're
like one size and all the
pants are all size zero so it's really
hard to find clothes here yes
I'll fit you yes my god I got a video of
that yeah
so I also emphasize the subway state the
subways because they have a really
impressive subway like transportation
system here and I got a lot of video on
that it was really nice we got around by
subway so that was a thing
and then um sorry this is really heavy
it's like a Canon camera I'm just
holding it so this is the longer than
I'm posting on my beauty Channel and
this is gonna be the very very last vlog
I'm posting on this channel because I
made a vlog channel and kind of tell
them what the name is because she made
this name up and it's actually really
clever and we're chasing the world I
would point to her but she's cheap it is
I'm gonna link it right here and then
link it in the bottom bar and everywhere
as always it's a Marine chase in the
world so it's in the world - not in the
world so it's like a marine chasing the
world but it's in the world you get it
yeah that's super clever I thought it
was really cute so that is my vlog name
because we do travel a lot so I thought
that was really clever because I like to
do travel vlogs whenever I travel so I
will have the rest of my Korea blogs
there but I'm just gonna warn you right
now that they're really choppy because I
it wasn't like a vlog style like me
walking like this it was just basically
me taking videos of random things in
Korea that were all really cool but they
were just like not very connected but I
will definitely explain them in my vlogs
and I also already have a video up so
you guys can go check that video out on
my blog channel right now it's Emery
chase in the world and that's an for
this vlog video I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
