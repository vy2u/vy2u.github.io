this will be my Too Faced makeup
collection and review on these products
so if you would like to see that please
keep watching it might seem like I'm
like obsessed with Too Faced but I just
think it's a really good quality makeup
and it's really good for beginners it's
the makeup brand that I started with
like this is my first makeup brand that
I ever started with so that's why I have
it and have so many of them because it's
what I'm really familiar with but if you
would like to tell me in the comments
below what you guys like to use that'd
be amazing so I can kind of expand my
little makeup collection a little bit I
also read somewhere that they are
cruelty free so they don't test on
animals and I actually this one says
products tested on celebrities not
animals but I looked on the back of
these two and it didn't say that but I'm
assuming that they're still cruelty free
but I can look it up and then leave it
in the bottom bar so I'll just do that
so yeah I'll go get in to the reviews
now and I'll show you the products so I
already showed you guys um the Too Faced
natural eye palette and my everyday
natural eye makeup routine you can watch
that right here that's so cool I just
did that um so I'll just show it to you
again just in case you haven't watched
it so here is what it looks like here
are the colors and this palette comes
with this sponge tip brush and then a
slanted angled brush on this one on that
side and then it comes with these cars
showing you how to use the colors if you
need guidance on them or you can just
practice like I did and then find your
own colors or find your own way to use
the colors I really love this palette it
is by far my favorite like out of all
the palettes that I have it could be
because I don't have that many palettes
I've had it for quite a while so I know
what colors to use and all the different
combinations that I like so I definitely
recommend this palette especially if
you're a beginner this is the
perfect palate for beginners because
it's natural you really can't mess up
especially with the cards that come with
it I really like all of the colors they
all look really good the only problem
with this palette and I've actually seen
it
there was an eyelash in it and the
natural at night palette - is that this
color fashionista okay well I thought it
was called fashionista but it's called
nude beach so this color is nude beach
is extremely extremely glittery here it
is and this glitter if you apply it on
your eyes it will fall all over your
cheeks so I don't even use this color
anymore because it is just so much work
but other than that I really love this
palette it is by far my favorite so I'm
gonna show you the brow and B kit next
and before I show you I'll just tell you
a brief history with me and my eyebrows
as you can tell I kind of have enormous
eyebrows and when I was younger I
actually had like my eyebrows aren't
like completely filled out I mean I use
this that's why they're dark the entire
way through I mean you can kind of tell
that they're sparse spares sparse in
some places but they actually get pretty
thin like right over here and over here
and it was worse when I was younger for
some reason I was extremely like
self-conscious of my eyebrows ever since
I was little so this was the perfect kit
that um for me because first of all I
wanted setting wax because my eyebrows
are huge and sometimes they can just go
crazy and I also wanted powder shades or
just something to fill in my eyebrows I
don't actually use this pencil the
powder shades work really well for me
so this palette was perfect I'm sure
that you could find all these individual
things somewhere else but since it was
all just in a really easy place and it
was from Too Faced which I really like
because I've just been using their
products for a long time I just really
wanted to try this out so my sister
purchased it on her own and we actually
share this I'm not sure if that's like
unsanitary but I don't
they're just eyebrows so we just share
these it does exactly what it's supposed
to do these look natural depending on
how much you put and what I just do is I
use the setting wax on the outer parts
of my eyebrows where it you know kind of
gets a little bit crazy if you sleep on
it sometimes and I usually don't use the
highlighter I just use my eye shadow for
that with the other natural eye palette
and then I just mix I usually mix the
brunette powder shades with the blonde
and just apply it to the little sparse
areas so I have like filled out eyebrows
and I think it makes my eyebrows like a
hundred times better because they're
just way more defined
I know I've described like eyebrows has
been defined like four times already in
my videos but I just feel like that's
what they are if you have like splotchy
eyebrows that are really long and crazy
then I I recommend this kit but if
you're just looking for like a setting
wax don't get this kit or if you're just
looking for the powder I mean like you
don't really need it but if you are
looking for both of those things and the
highlighter or the pencil brush or the
stencils I forgot to talk about the
stencils you should get this kit I
haven't used stencils but I'm sure that
they would come in handy so yeah I
really like this I broke it so the final
thing that I will show you and what I'm
kind of most excited about just because
I got it extremely recently it was like
within a week is the natural at night
palette and um for this video I did all
of my makeup using two-faced products um
so I did my eyebrows I just filled them
in and then put setting wax and then I
also used this natural at night palette
to do my eyes if you can see those it is
pretty dark because it is natural at
night but I did want to use it I haven't
really used it that much I don't know I
just haven't gotten around to playing
with the colors yet and that's how I
usually decide what color combinations I
like to do just by playing with the
colors and messing up a few times so
this is actually pretty much the first
time that I've played with it and I kind
of liked the look so I just worked today
or is what it looks like here are the
colors
and what I did was I use this as a base
color it's I don't know these colors are
all really pretty so I use this as a
base color and then use this color and
then this color and some in this color
and I tried using some of this color but
it's exactly like let me show you what
it exactly is like it is exactly like
fashionista slash nude beach it is
extremely glittery it gets glitter all
over your face um I had to take the
Neutrogena I makeup removers and just
like put it all over my like right over
here on my nose because it was so
glittery after I used it once I used it
for I just tried to use it as a base for
my eyes and I just got glitter all over
the place I didn't even want to touch it
after that but what I actually ended up
doing since I had already started it in
the kind of inner corners of my eyes I
just took a towel and like set it over
my face and then I continued to do my
makeup like that so yeah that is a lot
of glitter I'll try to show you how much
glitter it is but some are just more
glittery than others I didn't really
have that problem with full moon which
they look like they have the same like
glitter consistency but they don't night
light is definitely way more glitter
Reap and other than that I haven't
gotten that much time to play with this
yet but so far I really like it other
than super glittery part of it and I
like this makeup look it is a little
dark for me I don't usually wear super
dark makeup but I mean it's it still
looks pretty natural in my opinion so I
really like it I would probably
recommend this to non beginners just
because it can get pretty dark it took a
lot of blending with this makeup look so
probably not for a first kit but
definitely if you're used to makeup and
you like makeup and you like playing
with darker makeup it does it is darker
but it's still natural and I really like
that so there is the natural ethnic kit
alright guys that is it for this video
today thanks
you so much for watching again I just
wanted to thank you again for

make videos all the time and it's I

cloudy outside so I want to wait until
