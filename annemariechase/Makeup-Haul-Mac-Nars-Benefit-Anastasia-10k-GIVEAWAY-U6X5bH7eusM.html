so today I'm going to be doing like a
higher-end Mac um benefit and nars and
honest hacia makeup haul I got a gift
card for my birthday from my family for
like two hundred dollars so these are
all things that I've been really wanting
for a really long time and I finally got
them I want to show you guys these
things fast because i'm also going to be
doing a giveaway for my 10,000
subscribers so if you want to be entered
in my giveaway just stay tuned till the
end of this video so the first products
that will show you guys are my mac
products because I'm probably most
excited about these so some of me like
benefit products and nerd stuff you guys
have seen in my last video because I got
them like a week ago but all the mac
stuff I got are like already staples in
my everyday makeup so it's already
changed a little bit and I'm really
excited because I just know that I'll be
using a lot of these things or like
almost every single one of these things
every single day so i'm going to show
you guys like the brushes that I got um
I got the mac 20 for 219 and 217 brushes
basically I just really wanted an
eyebrow brush like a spoolie brush and
my Sephora didn't have one and so I was
like whatever I'm just gonna get it at
max I was already there so then I got my
back to nineteen brush and this is
already like perfect for blending out
colors on my lower lash line which I've
always just never had a brush that was
good enough for that so this is the
absolute perfect brush for that and then
I got the mac 217 brush because my
sister and my friend grace had this she
had my sigma blending brush and I had
our mac 217 brush and I just love this
way more than my signal blending brush
so I just got one because we switched
back recently and I was really missing
it and then for the makeup products I
got the mac pro longwear concealer I
have heard so much about this so I
really wanted to try it out and this is
really good for me for spot concealing
and it lasts a really long time on those
areas but for me I also wanted something
to like conceal like the redness around
my nose and my eyes watery Illinois and
then I also got this mac eyeshadow and
shrimp for like an inner corner
highlight because I heard from Jaclyn
hill who is also youtuber if you guys
don't know who she is she's like this
crazy amazing mac makeup artist or she
was like a previous Mac
artist and she always suggests this
color for an inner corner highlight and
I absolutely love it I've been looking
for like an inner corner highlight
forever and once she suggested it I went
out got it as soon as I could and it's
amazing so I really like that next I got
this pro longwear Paint Pot in bear
study and then so far I've had it for
like a few days now and I've been using
it every single day for school I mean
it's like monday right now but it just
makes school makeup so much faster so
I'm really excited to have this it's
basically like a I studio maybelline
eyestudio color tattoo except this is
much more blendable and workable and I
think the colors a lot prettier and this
is just a really pretty versatile color
and then the last thing that i got from
Mac was this cream color base in pearl
frost and you can really control the
area that you put it in I have been
putting this like as a brow highlight
and um cheek bone highlight and like a
Cupid's bow highlight and it's just
looked really pretty and it also looks
really really good in pictures too so it
picks up flash really well the next
thing that I got and this is also
recommended by jaclyn hill it was like
in her yearly favorites video is this ah
Nastasia eyebrow gel so kind of seems
unnecessary to get like a twenty-dollar
eyebrow gel it's just like a clear
eyebrow gel that like you could probably
get at the drugstore I got this because
I ran out of my eyebrow ENVE kits like
gel that was in the palette and this one
is so much better my eyebrows have not
been their best lately but this makes it
like a hundred times better and it'll
stay that way throughout the entire day
so this is amazing and the next thing
that I got was from NARS and I
definitely really showed you guys this
is dulce vida this is kind of like my
natural cheek color except a little bit
darker and a little bit more flattering
to my face so I was excited to find that
and then I just have all of my benefit
products so it was weird because my mom
actually got all these like at some Navy
Exchange so i guess it was like a little
bit cheaper than if you get it like at
sephora so i already showed you guys
this is my last video if you watch that
so i'm just going to show you again
really fast so i got the they're real
mascara which is my absolute
mascara along with the NYC big bold
lashes mascara and out is called and
then I got this Porefessional I'm sure
you guys have heard a lot about this
it's basically just to minimize the
appearance of pores I think it really
works so far because I actually do have
like pretty big pores and this has been
working I think I can tell i've only
used it like a few times because
sometimes I just forget about it but um
so far i really like it and then I got
this what's up highlighter because I
have the mini highlighter that came with
like the birthday sets but I've actually
not been using this because I've been
using my Mac Pro frost highlighters but
I think I'll just switch it up and see
which one I like more but I'm just
really really loving the mac pro frost I
letter I also gave my mom like a ton of
huge samples that I don't think are
actually supposed to be samples that you
get for free I have no idea let me know
because my mom was like these are
samples and I'm like no these are like
real sized mini products that I think
you should keep buying and they just
gave it to you because they were
confused it's the total moisturizer
facial cream by benefit and they gave us
to her as a sample and this is like a
full-size product this has so much
product in it this is a sample size of
the hello flawless oxygen Wow
brightening some Sri makeup wow that's
really cool I'm going to Hawaii so I can
kind of see this being sample sized but
then they also gave her like a sample of
the hello flawless oxygen foundation and
it's like this big and this is so much
product so I'm just really confused if
they're not actual products that you're
supposed to be buying those are amazing
samples and benefit did like a really
good job with their samples and I'm
pretty sure no one's gonna buy their
actual products because they can just
use your samples alright so I try to get
through that as fast as I can because I
also have another part of this video
which is my giveaway for 10,000
subscribers so I have my box sitting
Roger so basically I just wanted to
thank you all so much first for
subscribing to this channel I haven't
thanks so much fun posting a lot more
lately so I just wanted to thank you
guys all for clicking the subscribe
button and liking my videos and
commenting on my videos and messaging me
and stuff like that I absolutely love
making videos because of the
interactions that I get to have with
people and love reply to comments and I
love reading comments I leave or I read
every single one so if the guys leave me
a comment I can guarantee you that i'll
read it and i will most likely reply so
i'm going to show you guys what is in
the box um i just picked up the sephora
box that is actually i gave to my sister
but she's not here and she loved it here
so i'm sorry if you wanted this but it's
fine i can get you one next Christmas so
to be quite honest I was really confused
and like I was kind of panicking about
what to put in this box I mean I know
that I got like a ton of makeup for
myself but I was like I don't know what
people want and I don't know like what
to get and if this will match with every
skin tone or what so I basically kind of
stuck with three kinds of things
something that you guys want that I know
you guys have been wanting because
you've been commenting a lot I mean not
all of you but some of you um something
that I have been wanting because
typically when I get presents for my
friends I get them things that I want
and I think that they would want so I
like try to customize it to like them
but it's definitely something that I
would also want and then something that
I love already so basically I just tried
to throw a little bit of everything in
there so what I put in here was and
Urban Decay Naked basics palette because
this is something that I've been wanting
for a really long time but I've been
getting too much makeup and this is at
sephora and I don't have a gift card to
sephora so I'm just gonna wait to get
this for a little while and I've just
heard like amazing things about this so
this is the first thing so I've gotten a
bunch of comments asking me to do like a
Korean makeup giveaway or just like a
Korean something give away since I still
have a ton of Korean makeup and products
and stuff like that that I haven't
touched I decided that I would give some
of them away because a lot of you guys
have been asking anyway so I thought
perfect so what I've included are
basically just the things that I haven't
opened this is a herb Valley cosmetic
miracle magic whitening cream basically
in Korea I guess some women like to
whiten their skin as much as possible
like not every Korean tries to whiten
their skin but I thought this is kind of
funny to include and then the rest of
the things are actual things that I've
been loving and using so I've included
this wonder pore set it basically is to
minimize the appearance of the pores
this is actually really popular in korea
at least that's what the people at the
counter told me so yeah this wonder poor
kit or sample set is really popular I'm
pretty sure that's from etude house and
then I'm going to include the face shop
samples of like this chia seed thing
that I actually have and there's a face
mask in here so I'm going to include
that as well and I think it's like a
moisturizer to reduce sebum which causes
acne and then I'm going to be including
three face masks I tried to pick the
best ones so I picked kelp just in case
you want to be extra healthy rice and
pomegranate because this one was like
the best one left so I tried to pick a
wide variety just in case you didn't
like one of these things I'm pretty sure
all of these are moisturizing masks so
since i haven't used all these products
that i'm including and the giveaway I
wanted to include something that I
absolutely know that I love and it is
this the scrub of your life so big glory
this is this is like the scrub one I am
obsessed with the lotions my friend
Rachel got me a V set but I don't need
like every single thing in the set so
I'm going to just include this because I
think it smells amazing so I'm gonna
like give it away and if you guys liked
it then you can pick it up at your local
Sephora or wherever else they send this
or sell this so yeah those are all
pretty versatile things that I think
everyone can find something that they
like in so in order to enter my giveaway
what you guys are going to have to do is
subscribe to this channel subscribe to
my blog channel which I will link below
