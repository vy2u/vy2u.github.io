really long time so I'm really excited
to be filming today another thing that i
will probably mention right now is I
actually died or iced bleached my hair I
guess I try to do an ombre hair and the
person who did it for me was Chloe she
wants out she did my hair and it's
actually really messed up in some spots
it looks like I just dip dyed it blonde
so like a bunch of this will be blonde
and then in some spots it looks like a
cheetah print so it'll be blonde over
here and then dark brown over here and
then blonde again um it's really bad but
I don't really blame Chloe at all
because we used three kids and hair dye
and it took like four hours it's just
because I have really really thick hair
didn't work out that well but i'm hoping
that i'll fix it i'll be able to fix it
this weekend so that was a little while
ago but i just wanted to like point that
out just in case you notice some
mistakes in my hair cuz they are
definitely there um so this video is
going to be a hall from the face shop
we went to the face shop because one of
the one of my mom's friends was like
yeah there's this Korean beauty store
and you guys should go to it because I'm
half Korean and my mom's Korean and so
we went and it was pretty cool like I
really liked it it was really I was
really clean and the girls working there
were all really pretty korean girls and
they had really nice makeup on and they
I don't know I just really liked the
products it looked the packaging i think
is what got me it was just really really
cute pretty packaging so i have like a
few things that i wanted to haul and
show you guys cuz i thought they were
all really cool so I'm just gonna be
doing that in this video and that was a
really long introduction so I'm gonna go
so the first thing that I picked out
when I got there was this white mud nose
pack and this is basically to remove
blackheads and I thought this was really
cool because it is white mud so you just
put it like over your nose and it's like
one of those pore strips except it's
like a peel off so you apply it onto
like the area and then you peel it off I
usually use like the pore strips but
sometimes you can't like get those where
you want them to be like when they dry
and it was like oh that didn't really
get where I wanted it to go so I was
really excited that like you can just
apply this wherever you want to and then
if it works then it'll be like just like
a pore strip except where you want it to
go so I haven't used it yet but I'm
going to use it now that I've hauled it
and if I like it you'll probably see it
in like a future video so the next thing
that I got um me and my sister picked
these things out and they're actually
really weird and I'm not actually sure
if I like them these are love mark tint
and so they look like this they're
really pretty packaging again this isn't
sweet kiss orange this isn't shy kiss
pinked I will take one of them out for
you this is what it looks like so it's
like the shape of the lips in a stamp
the bottom part of this you open and
then you push it down to get some
pigment on it and then stamp it on your
lips and I've used I've only used this
one the orange one and I don't like this
one this is the one that my sister
picked out I don't like this color it
kind of looks like when you eat
spaghetti and you have like
leftover spaghetti sauce on your lips
that's kind of what this color looks
like so I don't really like this one I
haven't tried the pink one that I have
but I think the concept is kind of cool
but it's just you know it doesn't work
that well the next thing that I got
which was on my one of the cooler things
is this eyebrow pencil and this has been
used so you can tell by like the sticker
and whatever label coming off so this
part is a brush like a spoolie and then
on this end on this end you have the
eyebrow pencil part it's really waxy and
pretty light it's not too dark so when
you want to fill your eyebrows in you
won't have like splotchy areas of
darkness it'll just be all one like
pretty light color and it's really
blendable and yeah so this is really
cool and again the packaging is really
pretty the last thing that i actually
purchased was in this box and I've
already opened it so I kind of ruined
the box but it's just adorable and what
is inside of it this little guy okay so
this is just a face mask the face shop
had a bunch of face mask but I wasn't
really sure what any of them meant
because a lot of them were just in
Korean so I went for the one in English
and this just smells really really
really good and it's adorable um I
haven't used it yet I think my sister
has but I'm not really sure this is the
waterfall grapefruit mast at mask
revitalize and hydrate tired and dry
skin so that's basically what this is
and you just put it on before you go to
sleep and then wash it off in the
morning 10 for packaging I don't know
and it smells really really good it
smells like grapefruit those are the
only things that I purchased and then
along with our purchases they gave us a
bunch of samples they gave us like this
clarify this toner um another toner and
then another toner and then um they gave
us like a bunch of the sample things so
basically a bunch of samples of like BB
creams and cleansers and stuff like that
and moisturizers and then something I
thought was really weird house they
asked us if we wanted like a calendar
and
yeah sure I want a calendar and um
here's the calendar that they gave us
it's basically all Korean men that are
very beautiful and I think they're
wearing makeup yeah so I was going to
give this to my friend my one of my like
Korean friends named Phil and I'm still
going to but I just wanted to haul it
cuz I thought it was really funny yeah
this guy is like 10 times more beautiful
than like any girl I've seen my life
yeah so I thought this kind of funny um
like look at this do you see this he's
like gorgeous um so yeah that is all of
what I got from the face shop I just
thought it was like a really cool shop
and I really liked it because it was
Korean and I'm Korean so it was pretty
cool to go there I hope you guys thought
it was like found some cool new things
that you may want to check out if you
ever go to the face shop thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
very soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
