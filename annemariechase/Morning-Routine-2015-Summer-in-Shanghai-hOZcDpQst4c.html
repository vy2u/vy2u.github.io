it's a marine and if you can tell I'm
that you can because this angle is very
close up and that's because the light is
like sun is setting but I am in Shanghai
China I told you guys in my last year
that I was moving here for two months
for an internship and yeah I moved I'm
actually had a sick day right now
because I think I ate something
yesterday is that really did not agree
with my stomach after sleeping for like
six hours of the day I was like I should
try to be productive what can I do
filmer morning routine because I can
film that all from my bedroom so this is
what that is you guys have been
requesting this and I thought to be the
perfect first video to show you guys
into my life in China does that make
sense so I never try this but let's try
to get this video to 2000 thumbs ups so
if you like this video give it a thumbs
up and if it's gets to two thousand
thumbs ups within like a reasonable
amount of time I will do like a going
out in Shanghai video or like any type
of video that you guys want me to do
just leave requests in the comments
below and yeah looking into the video
good morning welcome to my bedroom and
China so on a typical weekday I usually
have to get up around seven but all
snooze until like seven thirty in order
to get ready to be at my internship by
nine so of course the first thing that I
like to do is check my phone just to try
to wake myself up for a little bit and I
feel like here's the obligatory plugs
where I say go follow me on instagram
i'm posting kind of a lot of instagrams
lately of Asia I was in Korea last
weekend so that was pretty cool and i
also have been updating twitter really
frequently more than i ever have a think
and snapchat i always love sending
snapchat and
any guys and everything so don't follow
me on all of those then I'll head
straight to the bathroom which is
conveniently located right in my room
and very inconveniently not covered by
any type of solid wall or anything so
yeah you can pretty much see right
through the glass in there this is where
everyone takes a shower and does their
business so just do it doesn't make
sense he left me broken Tuesday through
with open wednesday I started just
rinsing my face in the mornings to try
to reduce oiliness on my face throughout
the day I think this is actually started
working but I'm not quite positive yet
because I just started this
but I don't really have a set place
where I do my makeup and our bathroom
smells kind of like mildew so I'll like
place all the makeup that i'm using just
on my bed and I actually posted in
everyday makeup routine already so if
you want to see like what I've been
doing for my everyday makeup look then
check that out i'll link it in the
description box below hey is that about
so yeah like I said the bathroom is in
my room and it's often the only one
working so there's kathara he's in the
bathroom then I'll just continue doing
my makeup like I usually do yeah the
song is seriously my favorite lately
we're playing it way too often so that's
my finished makeup look and we actually
all learned while we are here that our
Hot Tools don't work really well with
our outlets here like at all there's
just exploded do you think it's because
it's our outlet or is it man damn we
just all heard up I feel like I lose
that yeah me too I just got this guy's
this is what happens when you live in
China so we've all been keeping it
really natural so I'll usually just
brush my hair out and then I'm pretty
much done with hair and makeup look
who's calling e hello what's it doing
I'm doing my homework oh my gosh yeah
because of the huge time difference
between the US and China sometimes if i
have time in the morning i'll either
skype my friends are my family in cali
called while i was getting ready this
morning so i thought i'd let her say hi
pizza speaker five last one to the beach
yeah so as you can probably tell i have
pretty bad internet connection in my
apartment and also in probably tell that
Kali is a funny one so in the morning i
usually don't wake up early enough to
have them first time to face time so i
pretty much just chat for a little while
and then have to start getting ready to
leave next I pretty much just pick out
the clothes that I'm going to wear for
the day so today I just picked out these
high waisted jeans that I feel I got
always wear in all my videos this little
bra left that i got from aerie and then
a black t-shirt from brandy melville and
i decided to pair this with my white
converse that are now basically like
yellow so usually by this time i'm
running close to being late for needing
to leave but I always try to take my
vitamins I am like such a grandma when
it comes to vitamins just because I get
really sick easily and I'll usually
follow my vitamins with a really light
snack and this is just because our work
provides free breakfast and it's like
two hours after work starts and also
because my mom is not here to make me a
delicious breakfast every morning so
since I take a metro every day I just
carry everything I need in my backpack
so I'll usually take my computer my
agenda and a book because sometimes we
don't exactly have that much to do at
our internship the books that I'm
reading right now is lean in by sheryl
sandberg definitely definitely
definitely definitely recommend this
book then I usually will bring my wallet
and most importantly my metro card to
get to and from my internship I also
have this pass that I need in order to
get inside the building and then I bring
my water bottle a hydro flask water
bottle my charger and headphones I don't
know why I just listed that all I mean
you guys see oh yeah that's pretty much
library to work and these are like my
work essentials so of course we riding
at the door I have to check on
appearance a little bit and go would
just be real here I know you're all
thinking it
ha hey who put my basil message see ya
then I'm finally ready to head out the
door
so it takes me about 40 minutes 40 to 45
minutes to get to work from my apartment
I live in an area in Shanghai called the
French concessions and it is like this
absolutely gorgeous little area that is
so adorable and then I just walk over to
the Metro which is about a 10 minute
walk and then i have to take like six
stops to get to my work yeah the metro
is a very very interesting place I
usually just listen to music while I'm
waiting or people watch it's also very
fun thing to do sometimes it gets very
busy and there is no sense of personal
space and a lot of people have been
asking on my blog I work at the
mercedes-benz arena as an intern it's
honestly a really really cool job I get
to do a lot of fun stuff I gotta go kpop
concert this week Big Bang and in
general just learn about some marketing
and sales of like a really big
entertainment company so yeah it's
really awesome and here is a view from
the arena from a very clear day you sure
doesn't look like this it's like kind of
an amazing season of China right now

morning routine every weekday sometimes
