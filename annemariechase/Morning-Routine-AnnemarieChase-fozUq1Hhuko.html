showing you guys all of what I do on a
typical relaxed summer morning the very
first thing that I do in the morning is
get my phone and text my boyfriend ain't
no good morning even though it's night
in Finland and then I'll just scroll
through Twitter and check my Instagram
and I usually don't look at my own
pictures and just doing some shameless
self-promotion right now so go follow me
on Instagram and then I like to see if I
have any new YouTube comments through my
gmail account once I'm done checking all
those things I like to get out of bed
put on some slippers get my day started
right and then head over to the bathroom
to wash my face this summer I've been
using this Neutrogena oil-free pink
grapefruit face wash I also really like
the blue one that they have they're both
super refreshing for the first thing in
the morning after I'm finished washing
my face I always find that I have some
leftover makeup right underneath my eyes
even if I feel like I'm taking it all
off the night before and then wash my
face and wash my face in the morning
it's there so I like to use my milkshake
point makeup remover from skin-food
and then I'll usually just go straight
into my moisturizer with SPF during the
school year I was having some troubles
with my acne but luckily I have gotten
some acne medication and it's been
working really well for my skin so I'll
apply one of them in the morning and
then a different one at night and I've
noticed a really positive difference in
my skin so far so usually by this point
I'm much too excited to go downstairs
and eat and make my coffee to actually
finish getting ready so I will just show
you guys what I do downstairs I've been
really loving this coconut milk creamer
from so delicious it's actually dairy
free so doesn't have any milk coconut
milk and it is seriously so good so I
know that a lot of people don't actually
like coffee I really like the taste of
it and I also think it's pretty good for
you it
boosts your metabolisms in the morning
and it also gets your bowels going to be
quiet honest so if you guys watch my 50
facts about me video you might remember
that I really extremely just loved
breakfast so I usually take quite a bit
of time to make and eat my breakfast so
here is one of my favorite breakfasts to
eat this is actually a waffle made with
oatmeal it's a healthier alternative to
just plain waffles or echoes or
something like that so I will usually
just cover this and fruit and syrup and
then eat it so after eating breakfast
and being downstairs I head back
upstairs to the bathroom to go to the
bathroom and also to brush my teeth I've
been using this Colgate toothpaste and
it's pretty good and I just use this
with my Sonicare toothbrush sometimes on
these types of relaxed summer days I
like to film videos which is what I'm
doing today so I thought it'd be fun to
show you guys the process of me making a
video so after deciding what type of
video that I want to film for that day I
usually gather all of my materials that
I need and then I will start filming I'm
not going to show you guys the whole
thing so obviously just posted this
video so you've probably already seen it
but if you haven't you can check it out
the links are in the downbar below
I usually like to film in the morning so
that I have all of my makeup done by the
late afternoon or so after I finished
doing all my makeup I usually do my hair
in this summer I've just been keeping it
super natural so I'll just use this skin
food argan oil silk hair essence that I
got in Korea because since I dyed my
hair ombre it's been a little bit
unhealthy so I'm trying to fit as
healthy as possible next I'll usually
just pick an outfit and get dressed and
get completely ready to go out for the
day today I'm just wearing my new
Abercrombie white fitted skinny jeans
and then I'm wearing this with my shirt
that I got from Brittany Melville
and for accessories I am wearing this
ring that I wear every single day
because Anna gave it to me and my
wraparound bracelet is from mintberry
and my best friend Rachel actually just
gave it to me so that is what I wore
today and then I just paired this outfit
with some wedges
so at this point I'm all ready to go and
then I will just head out for any
adventures or chores or errands that I
need to run or something like that so
thank you all so much for watching I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did please give it a thumbs up and
subscribe to this channel for more
videos from me bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
