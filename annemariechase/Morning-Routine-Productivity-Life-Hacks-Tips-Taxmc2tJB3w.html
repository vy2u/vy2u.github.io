channel so you are around the age of 18
which according to my YouTube analytics
a lot of you guys are plus or minus a
few years the average age dollies in the
u.s. is around 80 so 80 minus 18 equal
62 times 365 days equals twenty two
thousand six hundred and thirty mornings
that you'll have left in your life
that's a lot of mornings which is why I
decided to kind of do this video I'll
explain I'll explain so recently I
started working a full-time job which
means that I have to be somewhere at a
very specific time which also means that
I know exactly how much time that I have
to get ready and essentially I just have
a very regimented very routine morning
routine but then when it comes to the
weekends or even school when I don't
really have a solid schedule I can waste
so much time getting ready and something
I learned from this book that I read I
always talk about called the power of
habit by Charles Duhigg is that habit
are such a huge part of our lives even
if we don't realize it it essentially
lets our brains kind of go on autopilot
for every day repetitive things that we
do so we're able to create a habit out
of a really effective and productive
morning routine then not only are we
able to give ourselves a really good
start for the rest of the day but then
we also have the ability to kind of
think about other more important things
while we're getting rain and then I at
least won't waste hours just doing
nothing in the morning and actually get
my day started so basically I'm going to
walk you guys through my super effective
productive morning routine and hope that
you guys can find something that works
for you so let's get into the video so
after a good night's rest I like to wake
up early to feel really prepared and on
top of my day so I get up any 7:00 and I
always read articles about how top
executives get up super super early but
I think if students it's really
important to prioritize sleep so the
thing that I try to focus on is just to
wake up at the same time every day or at
least two hours within that time so that
I don't mess up my circadian rhythm and
there are a lot of habits
we as people and Millennials created
when we wake up in the morning even
before we leave our bed that we should
definitely stop doing the first thing is
to stop snoozing it's pretty much a
lose-lose because by snoozing for five
and 10 minutes you're just tricking your
body into thinking that you're going
back to sleep so when the alarm comes on
again you'll just wake up feeling more
tired and groggy and the second thing is
to stop checking social media in the
morning there have been Studies on why
this is psychologically bad and I think
it has to do with the immediate
comparison of your life to someone
else's perceived life when you go on
social media but we just don't need that
kind of negativity and time waste for
our productive morning routines so I
just like to ditch the phone in the
morning entirely so instead of doing
these things I like to just get up right
after my alarm goes off and then walk
straight to the coffee maker something
that's super simple but so helpful for
brightening up my morning is just
letting natural light in I love doing
this first thing in the morning as a
kind of welcoming to the day and I also
get impressed and motivated when I see
people running in the morning or just
going to the library it's kind of just
like a another little boost that I have
so then I'll just start making my coffee
for the morning
and sometimes when I'm waiting for that
to finish I'll try to challenge myself
to drink a whole bottle of water because
I just generally think hydration is
really important but sometimes I just
straight-up do not want to drink so much
water and that's totally okay too so
I'll get my coffee and then head back to
my bedroom so this next little
productivity lifehack is simply to make
your bed every morning and I got this
tip from a video that I've shared with a
bunch of my friends and literally almost
everyone has found it so helpful the
point where I've gone even several
lavash college boys making their beds
every single morning you make your bed
every morning you will have accomplished
the first task of the day it will give
you a small sense of pride and it will
encourage you to do another task and by
the end of the day that one task
completed will have turned into mini
task completed so if you want to change
the world start off by making your bed
and I've talked about this video and two
videos but I'll also be sure to link it
in the description if you want to check
it out so I noticed that the thing that
takes me the longest in the morning is
getting ready with hair and makeup but
something I realized weirdly is that I
didn't even have an everyday makeup
routine so I did there do the basics
like always or go all out and do all the
works with like eyeshadow and eyeliner
and contouring and whatever else so
realizing this has been a huge time
saver and it might seem obvious but
something that is so helpful is to
create a set makeup routine and this
wheat-rick me because sometimes there's
a lot of makeup to do right well I took
a little time really reflecting on these
important topics of makeup and getting
ready and productivity and I realized
that you can look at doing your makeup
in terms of the economic law of
diminishing marginal utility let me
explain
so basically as I put on more makeup
products the makeups utility or
usefulness increases a lot as I do the
basics like foundation concealer
eyebrows eyeliner and mascara however if
I start being extra with contouring and
eyeshadow and whatever then it's a lot
of effort from not as much reward as the
basics work or you
too much makeup and it looks worse and
takes more time out of your day so
figure out at what fair minimum point
you're satisfied with with getting ready
in the morning and then just stick to
that routine I really hope that that
made sense or else I will just look
really really stupid so the last tip
that I have is for those of us with long
is cher and that is to not wash your
hair every day I used to wash my hair
every single day so then I would have to
spend time to wash it air dry or
blow-dry it and straighten it if I was
going somewhere now I like to try to go
1 or 2 days without washing my hair and
it actually saved a lot of time over the
week and something that really helps is
this batiste dry shampoo for those no
wash days because I feel like it really
absorbs my oiliness and it also smells
really good
so that's pretty much my last real life
hack slash productivity tip for your
productive morning routine and other
than that I usually just finish up my
morning by having some breakfast
brushing my teeth afterwards and then I
just give myself a very set amount of
time to get dressed and get ready to
leave out the door to go to work or
school or wherever I'm going guys thank
