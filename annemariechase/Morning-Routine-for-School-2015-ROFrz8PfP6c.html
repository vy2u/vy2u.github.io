hey guys it's Amory so today I'm super
excited because first of all it's the
first time I'm posting a video and so on
my second of all it's a morning routine
I actually don't know why everyone those
morning routines because so many people
do it all the time and they usually
don't change I guess I do have like a
little bit I do have different morning
routines like every single semester my
schedule changes or in like in a
different place being in college and
stuff I feel like some updates are due
just because you may not have seen me in
a while but also I do post weekly vlogs
every single week if you guys want to
catch up with my life but yeah I'm in my
third semester of college I'm a
sophomore now moved into an apartment I
share this space with
seven other people so it will probably
be a little bit noisy because they're
all here also life update we got a cast
who wish they were Simba she looks like
a Simba or Anala this is the only room
she's not allowed to come in because I'm
allergic to her so this is basically
gonna be my like no routine warning your
team because I really don't have a set
morning routine right now because this
semester I have all evening classes and
this sounds great and it sounded great
when I was creating my schedule but I
actually hate it and it sucks so this
semester I've been all about trying to
create or find my morning routine that
all good youtubers seem to have done
five or six times by now filming is hard
alright so tomorrow before class I need
to work out edit my video into a caddy
homework so I should probably wake up
around so I'd like to think of myself in
the morning person because I feel like
everyone just tells you that it's good
to get up early but you guys probably
know as well as I do that when you
subconsciously know that you don't
actually have to get up at 7 or 8 in the
morning it's pretty much impossible to
get yourself out of bed
or I'll do that thing where I wake up
and then check my social media to wake
myself up sometimes I'll even turn off
my alarm because I'm half asleep not
sudden alarm again and it won't even
matter because I don't actually have to
be anywhere until 2:00 but when I do
eventually get up and out of bed I'll
usually head over to the bathroom and
rinse my face off with some water and
possibly brush my teeth I usually brush
my teeth after I eat but it depends on
what I'm eating just depends on the day
sometimes if I don't have some
last-minute studying or homework to do
I'll try to exercise in the morning and
at the gym in my apartment I'd pretty
much only run on the treadmill so I'll
run like a mile or two while watching my
absolute favorite show the office or
listening to some music so if I do have
some homework or last-minute studying to
do I will go downstairs to my study
lounge I found that I'm a little bit
more productive when I like leave my
room or apartment and today I decided to
go outside to do my homework which is
actually super nice now that the
temperature has gone down a little bit
and some days I'll just start getting
ready
right after washing my face also every
single morning I take vitamins and I
recently got this pill holder thing I
don't really know what it's called and
it makes it way easier to take all these
vitamins here just go back
so most days I usually don't have
groceries in the apartment so I started
making this oatmeal with like a spoonful
of peanut butter and then some nuts or
walnuts or fruit yeah it's actually
surprisingly good and I honestly like
don't mind eating it for like multiple
breakfasts in a row and then sometimes
when I want really relaxed morning I
turn on the TV drink some coffee and
kind of just chill but usually I don't
have these kind of mornings because I
feel like I want my mornings free more
productive I don't know it's nice when
it happens and lastly I just get dressed
and put on like whatever shoes I'm
wearing for the day and then I grab all
of my work that I need for school I
usually end up bringing like everything
so I don't have to come back so my
backpack is always like 50 pounds high
then I head out the door and go to
school via my bike because I refuse to
walk and I'm not even kidding every
single time I ride my bike to school I
like almost get hit
and that's pretty much the end of my
morning slash afternoon slash life
everyday all right guys thank you so
much for watching this video if you
liked it be sure to give it a thumb up
maybe some of this video if you would
like to see a night routine for college
cuz those are different - those are fun
I don't know make sure to follow me on
Instagram and Twitter as I update you
guys pretty much easiest on those and
subscribe to my weekly vlog channel and
I'll talk to you guys later bye guys
