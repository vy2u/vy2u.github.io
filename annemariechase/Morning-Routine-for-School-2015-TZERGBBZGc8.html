thousand so we hit 50,000 subscribers on
this channel which is absolutely
mind-boggling that means that literally
fifty thousand different people except
like the 10 accounts on my mom made hit
the subscribe button for this channel
and if you're a part of that I just want
to thank you so much it's really not
about the numbers for me it's just about
like the interactions that I have with
you guys but that means so much to me
that you guys like my channel enough to
stick around and I actually hit 7000
subscribers on my vlog channel on the
same day and I was like oh my gosh and
is celebrate somehow I was gonna buy
cake but I was like that's a little bit
excessive
in celebration of hitting 50000
subscribers I just decided to post a new
video every single Wednesday for you
guys because I post every Monday on my
vlog channel and everyone seems to like
that a lot
so I decided that I'd do the same for my
main channel so this first video is my
morning routine a freshman in college
and I have a roommate and we've had some
pretty funny moments together so I
thought I would try to capture that as
best I could not sure how it worked oh
yeah these are real life moments with
real life people so I hope you guys
enjoy it and I'm just gonna jump into
the video now
ah
a few moments later
12 seconds later can we just talk about
the struggles of getting out of bed
sometimes because this is actually
happen to me enjoy multiple times where
it's just we play off of each other's
news buttons but after we finally get
out of bed I usually head to the
bathroom or I will brush my teeth and
wash my face to wake myself up and since
then I usually get ready together in the
morning she is doing the same thing at
the other bathroom to prison freaking
magic trash here cuz I think he was on
look at what's in there right now yeah
so that actually happened but usually
have to go to the bathroom I like to
turn on some music
and if I have enough time in the morning
I love making tea while I get ready so
this is my favorite tea it's the green
tea with brown rice that I think you can
get a like Costco and I usually get my
hot water from our awesome water
dispenser that we got I also take these
vitamins every morning because that was
one of my new year's resolutions and I
actually take more now but after all
that I will usually start off my day
with doing my makeup okay so for my
makeup my skin got really weirdly clear
here in California like when I moved
here it just like cleared up I don't
really know why so I pretty much just
need a really light coverage every day
so this is my everyday look and then
when I want more coverage I'll change it
up a little bit and that'll just do
really neutral natural-looking colors on
the eyelids and a little bit of eyeliner
and everything like that so if you guys
want like an updated everyday makeup
routine kind of thing just let me know
in the comments below or let me know by
liking this video I've been waiting for
this I know
I'm crazy just how fast the night
changes yay so that's my final makeup
look this is what I look like
usually on a daily basis in the week and
here is me awkwardly trying to pose a
like usual I'm really bad at like posing
in pictures and stuff so depending on
what day it is we will usually be in a
rush to get to breakfast before it
closes so we'll like rush downstairs but
take the elevator instead of the stairs
and then we'll go into the cafeteria and
we have like this system sometimes if we
have enough time to eat we'll get an
omelet so I will wait in line and so
will bring me a cup of coffee and then
I'll pretty much just order an omelet to
share
look at they serve frickin Krispy Kreme
Doughnuts
it's actually really rough having to
walk by here everyone we haven't eaten
any yet so this is the breakfast at our
dining hall and it looks pretty good but
it's literally like the same every
single day gets real old but after that
we'll just try to be super creative and
find something new to eat and then we'll
just eat it by the way we brought that
avocado
where do you actually go away that today
yes and me you literally wore that for
the last three days do people don't
notice yeah I felt it so I'm pretty much
looking for an entirely new wardrobe so
if you have any suggestions for online
shopping let me know in the comments
below because I need new clothes but
yeah I ended up just picking a super
basic outfit just high-waisted jeans
some sandals and a black t-shirt and
then after getting dressed I try to make
my bed every morning if I have enough
time
so after I'm all ready to head out the
door I will usually either grab my purse
that I got from like twice calm it's not
sponsored video or I'll grab my backpack
depending on how much I have to bring
and where I'm going
so my essentials for class are
definitely my computer my agenda those
two things are my life and then I'll
usually bring along my bike key my
student ID and my water bottle to every
single class and then I am ready to head
out the door sometimes though and I will
walk to class together or bike to class
together and this is me rejecting her
hug and yeah that I just head off to
class if you made
crazy alright guys thank you so much for

thumbs up if you liked it subscribe this
