don't scold Catherine you guys get it
good some people tell I mean I didn't
get it for a little while
Catherine today we're filming a highly
requested apartment or just going to
like split the house down the middle
yeah you guys might see like our kitchen
and like the left side of the house I
mean I was like briefly overview it but
if you want like a superb like detailed
tour of that go check out Catherine's
channel cause it's big house okay so
today our apartment this is the front
door that we just walked in Jerry behind
you here show you something mirror this
is Jerry
he's gonna be the cameraman for today
this is how you shut the door I get to
blame it what are we doing here okay so
this is our what would you call this
what we do is we just come in and just
like we just like take our shoes off
like that so this is never like this
that was Jerry like organizing this off
it's just like a huge pile of shoes and
everyone who walks in every single time
they're like wow that's a lot of shoes I
actually moved all my shoes to my room
though and there's two my shoes this is
where we wear makeup sometimes in front
of this mirror it's like big full-length
mirror and we'll sit down do our makeup
chair has makeup all over it now so
probably have to pay for that this is
all right side of the house but
Catherine's doing this so we'll just
like doing a sneak peek I guess this is
the main bathroom we have two bathrooms
this four-bedroom apartment oh my gosh
Jerry Francisco everyone I was doing my
makeup getting ready to like just fill
them and we're just here like this huge
crash for like ten seconds our plates
not really on this thing uh-huh
like all felt broke and we were just
sitting there and Catherine is like we
had a cockroach problem and that's where
I saw all the cockroaches so I really
don't go in there for dinner I usually
like either eat out or get takeout and
take out some really really cool in here
because there's like never really a
delivery fee or it's really low
and it's really fast and you say here
and it's disgusting in my seat this is
our couch it was actually voted that the
number one comfiest couch out of all of
our friends so it's pretty comfortable
we usually don't have these bills
they're cute this frickin apartment has
at least 20 pillows like decorative and
just like pillows on the beds my bedroom
had four and then we took some of them
out there's pills up there there's like
everywhere this is our TV we don't watch
like cable on it cable TV but we have
like a lot of DVDs and we have this red
couch all the art and this apartment is
weird it like the decorations in this
place are like so really just like a
look at this like you'd think like at
first it's like wow this is so cute
but then you look at it and you're like
what is this oh I know we have like some
of those on this area like that this is
ours
so just have some random decorations
super random yeah so this is like
basically where we all hang out so like
will either be sitting like on the couch
or like on the table or on that chair
and it's like just like the community
room that everyone likes to sit at where
should we take a sneak peek at
Caroline's room we through all of our
clothes in here well while preparing for
this video so that's a first we also
through all of our clothes there but we
get this real fast so weird what is it
no idea okay wait guys we somehow
decided to turn this thing around this
is what it's supposed to be
Oh like what the heck
compare compares not not not quite the
same they also hang it up like this I'm
just so confused okay
there's a bathroom right here so this is
the bathroom that everyone uses to
shower in and let go to the bathroom I
would say that my bedroom is usually
like on the cleaner side just because I
know that people are gonna be walking
through so like my bed's usually like a
big mess but I made it for you guys
today
so I have all my shoes lined up down
here and I keep like my sneakers and
like nasty shoes out there so organize
this thing I keep my camera's up here so
like my SIM cards my cameras my makeup
and like beauty stuff right here and
then clothes and then like bags watches
sunglasses and like and then this little
thing actually like hai organizes my mom
like pack these little Ziploc things
that little they're pretty big actually
and I was like mom like watch you pack
this is so annoying
they came like they're so handy because
we didn't have enough hangers so I just
like kind of made like this little
organization system so I have like all
my t-shirts here and like my skirts and
my bra let's in my PJs and my workout
clothes here then we have tried to go
pod cuz they're really handy started
putting my shower stuff here because I
think I'm gonna run out okay over here
we have like bras and like underwear and
stuff but I have my dirty laundry here
and I honestly don't know how other
people organized they're so freaking
Caroline will just pile it there so I
know it's a good system this side of the
closet there the pillow that I was
talking about I think I might hung up my
dresses and like formal clothes and then
like things I can't really fold and then
here I use like nice big ziploc things
to just throw all my random stuff like
right here I have like a mouse or a
chalk pad like cotton pads and that I
have the suitcase my other suitcase
would not fit under my bed so it's just
like chilly over there it's like what
it's like in the RV bag
it makes you look really intimidating
though I usually keep my tripod and like
camera stuff and this little thing below
the beds kind of funny too
so Jerry it's like a China thing like
you don't have like a fitted sheet it's
just like a sheet
no I think that's like your thing this
mattress is so gross look at that you
guys so this is not a fitted sheet and
you just like you so your body's like in
there and then the rest of the dirty
medicine and I made sure to bring my
favorite blankets
Emmit my pillow pet this is like
actually five years old now but you
can't by yourself
like you have to get it from someone
else so that's a hint to you mom it
looks like I'm super intellectual with
all my books I haven't been reading that
much when Peter came out very he like
gave me this book to read and he
actually reads the light structures kind
of cool I guess shoosh a little bathroom
are the two girls we can show them okay
when you take a shower it kind of like
clogged the drain a little bit so like
you're just standing in like a pool of
water and it kind of overflows into this
rug that is never it's 100% wet all the
time that's drinking smelling mildew or
what's called as a mildew or like mold
that smells this thing is constantly wet
I have never gone in this bathroom
without shoes on because I feel like
it's diseas'd
kills a bug right here yesterday what
else the plumbing is really bad here so
they told us to throw our toilet paper
into the trash can so this is like this
guy Lee refuse to do that like I don't
care like I would rather have the toilet
clog I expected it has a clock for me
yet so like I started to but everyone
else does it here anything about it it's
like we like I try to not spend number
two time in here but it looks cool
because those are some reason like they
have this thing it's just the glass core
design or design but I guess it's okay
that's it thanks for filming Jerry the
apartment tour
