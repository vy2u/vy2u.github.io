channel so for the last three years ever
since moving to California for college
I've seen that my skin has improved
dramatically like if you've seen from my
earlier videos hell and it was just kind
of always there like I always had some
pimple or breakout people have asked me
like what my skincare routine is or my
acne free or like how to get rid of acne
routine is I feel like I've developed a
routine that has really been working for
me and it might work for you guys seeing
this is a clearest my skin has ever been
and also my scalp because it's pretty
much an extension of like your skin your
scalp is very like similary first of all
I just want to mention that there are
probably so many factors that have gone
into like making my skin clear and also
I use really specific products but I
think that the products are less
important than the routine itself just
because I'm showing you guys specific
products doesn't mean that things like
what they're my Skinner like this is
what I'm using all the time I changed
that up all the time but these are like
really good products that I haven't
liked it lately and then the second
thing that I wanted to mention is that
I've never really had like severe severe
acne so I don't personally have
experience like really clearing bad acne
so this video is probably not for you if
you are looking for that yeah I just
wanted to share this with you guys and I
haven't done like a beauty video in a
really long time I'm excited to do this
I hope you guys enjoy it and let's just
get into the video
we're definitely to start off the shower
because because we're all of my clear
skin pretty much happens growing up like
literally until like high school I wash
my hair every single day and then I
realized that it's not very good for
your scalp and it really dries it out
when my scalp dries out faster my hair
gets greasy ur faster because my scalp
is trying to restore its natural oils so
while I wash my face and body every day
I try to just wash my hair every other
day here's a question for you guys I
have a very very set routine in the
shower I do the exact same thing every
single time and usually that starts with
the top of my head to the very tip top
bottom of my toes words so do you guys
have the same routine every time or is
that just me this is the shampoo that
I'm using right now I got it in Korea it
is
Korean beauty brand called skin food but
they also have it in the US that's
definitely available this is a
peppermint flavor ascent and it smells
really good and I think it's really cool
because it has like a cooling flash
tingling effect which just feels really
weird but in like a good way so I'm
going to be a hundred percent on it
sometimes I have scalp buildup in like
little flakes which is never fun because
that's no one likes that so I went to a
Veda of Veda and they have scalp experts
they told me in order to target your
scalp what you do is you do kind of a
first wash to get all the dirt and oil
out of your hair and then go back and
target the scalp by massaging the
product only onto the scalp so I work at
Neutrogena this is not a sponsored video
but since I started working there I
tried out this T Sal gel which is
specifically made for build-up and
flakes and stuff like that and this
actually works very very well whenever I
feel like I have buildup or just like a
dirty greasy gross scalp I use this and
it helps like clear all of it away
really really well so like I was saying
earlier I do a first rinse using my
normal shampoo and then I'll go back
with this product because it's very
scalp specific and I'll massage it
directly on my scalp and it calls her
you leaving the product for a while so
I'll usually just wrap my hair and a
little bun at the top of my head and
then go on to the next thing which is
usually washing my face so face wash is
something that I definitely change up a
ton but lately I've been using this
Dermalogica brand I always say it's
dermatological and actually another
embarrassing thing shortly after this
video I realized that I was using this
wrong in the shower and it's not usually
a product that I actually use in the
shower I like to use this outside and it
really makes sense because you're
supposed to apply the pre cleanse to dry
hands and then dry face and then rinse
it off with water afterwards and then
the microphone Ian is also a dry product
which is very unique and you just pour
it onto wet hands and then a wet face
and then it acts was like in exfoliant
so I actually listen to the Holly built
this podcast on this company
and the founder created this brand
because she didn't see a lot of products
in the market that didn't have irritants
in them that's what I really like about
this kind of weird at first thing you
use it because we're so used to having
formulas that are really good smelling
and like have stuff in it but this just
seems like a very much more natural and
simple kind of cleanser that just really
does a job so after I'm done washing my
face and rinsing all that stuff off I
will usually rinse off all the shampoo
and then I will follow that with
conditioner of course I actually really
like to focus the conditioner both on my
scalp and at the ends of my hair just
like the rest of your body and your skin
your scalp can also get dried so it just
makes sense to moisturize your scalp
with conditioner so that's what I do and
finally I've just been using this shower
gel from Bath and Body Works they have
some really good smelling stuff but I
usually changed my body wash up a lot
after the shower I'll usually get out
and wipe off any excess makeup with
makeup remover wipes and I just started
using this serum which is also from
skin-food I do really like these two
base lotions or face moisturizers from
the leaf which is also a k-beauty brand
and then from pixie which I did not
expect to like this so much but I really
really like the consistency and feel of
this moisturizer
and then sometimes I'll blow dry my hair
out a little bit I usually don't even
blow dry at all just because I like to
give my scalp and my hair a little bit
of a break so I'll usually just air dry
my hair and then before bed I'll put on
my absolute favorite chapstick which is
from Jack Black I've been using this for
years and years and years and then I'll
also try to put on some lotion on my
hands for whatever lotion that I'm using
and then when I wake up my lips are
super soft and so are my hands so
fast-forward a little bit too when I
wake up after a night's sleep I don't
wash my face in the morning and this is
something that I used to do like all
throughout high school and I did this
every single day if I realized that this
tends to make my face really really oily
throughout the rest of the day I think
it's the same thing with like over
washing your scalp your body is just
trying to replace its natural oils so it
kind of just speeds up that process so I
usually just rinse my face off with
water and then pat dry my face and this
made a huge difference in the level of
oiliness that my skin had and then
finally I always put a moisturizing
sunscreen on before I leave my house
with no exceptions sun protection is
extremely important it's probably the
best thing that you can do for your skin
ever I recently picked up the Neutrogena
one that I used to use in high school
again just because I worked there but
it's also just a really good product
especially because they're oil-free and
I tend to get oily so I really like this
one and it's just really important to
put sunscreen on if you're going on the
Sun at all and then that's pretty much
it alright guys thank you so much for
