channel so for some reason I have been
getting bombarded with college
acceptance / admission reaction videos
for all of those seniors who have been
getting their acceptance letters or
denial letters and I've seen so many
recommended videos on my page for some
reason on these like college admission
reactions so that's kind of what
inspired me to do this video I also did
a senior year advice video when I was in
high school and kind of covered all the
things that you should probably do when
you're a senior in high school / junior
in high school to prepare for the
college admission process and I watched
that and it was actually like a pretty
thorough video I'm pretty proud of that
I think it has like over 100,000 views I
even held like a few comments or one
comment up said that they're like
college admissions counselor played it
in class so that just makes me so happy
that very much warms my heart so in that
video I told you guys like where I
applied to and like where I decided to
go but then after that I like never
talked about it again and I still get
questions all the time on like where I'm
going and why I chose USC over the other
schools and how I like to my decision or
like knowing what I know now what I
still choose USC so that's what the city
is going to be about I'm really excited
because I think a lot of you guys will
like this video based on the questions
that I get all the time so we're going
to get started first of all for some
reason I like started watching before I
film this video those College Admission
reaction videos and that inspired me to
make a note to say that I will not share
any of my like stats meaning my GPA my a
CT score my extracurriculars I watch
this one girl in my eyes she was very
very much a qualified like candidate for
a lot of the schools that even I applied
for and she didn't get into the schools
that I applied for and I did so that
just goes to show you like you never
know what college admissions counselors
are looking for so I'm not going to like
share my stats just because I don't
think that's the very productive thing
to do and honestly like it's not worth
it to stress over that so actually honey
we need to say that because for like
acceptances and everyone just got their
exceptions
so whatever but I'm not going to share
my stats with you guys because I just do
not think that's a productive thing to
do so all the schools that I applied to
where USC UCLA UC Berkeley Emory
University of Pennsylvania Vanderbilt
and Dartmouth you guys can probably
guess when I got in but the schools that
I was accepted you were USC UC Berkeley
at UCLA so all of the California schools
and then I was also accepted into Emory
and then I was not accepted until you
Penn Vanderbilt and Dartmouth I think
that I would have gone to Vanderbilt if
I had gotten in and you can because
upends obviously just an Ivy it has a
really good business school and I would
have gone to Vanderbilt because I just
really liked the atmosphere that I had
when I visited the only other school
that was really really considering after
I got like that acceptance list out of
the UC schools USC and Emory was Emory
because my two siblings were going there
at the time and they'd be there the
whole time that I was there pretty much
and then I always get the question on
why I chose USC over the you see school
so UCLA and UC Berkeley because I
remember even all of my family members
were like oh my gosh you have to go to
UCLA UCLA I think is a much better known
school for like everyone else outside of
like the West Coast but even for Alaska
like I'd never heard of USC and that's
super embarrassing to say now because
like obviously it's a huge part of my
life because I go here but I'd honestly
never really heard much about it the
only thing that a lot of my friends knew
about it was that they had a really good
football team and that it was in
California like I didn't even apply to
USC I didn't think about applying to it
my mom actually told me to apply too and
I was like okay so that's pretty much
the extent that I knew about you can see
until I visited the campus and really
really ended up liking the campus and
then I visit the UCLA campus it was
really huge
I felt really kind of insignificant
there and it was very overwhelming I
think they had like a pep rally or like
some type of student-led protests and it
was just very overwhelming for me so
that's like kind of why I didn't choose
UCLA over USC some other reasons why I
personally chose USC over all the other
schools so like mostly just the schools
in California was that USC is a private
school versus UCLA which is a public
school for me
it'd be pretty much paying the same
amount of money for a public school
versus a private school I don't know how
true this is but I mean I know people
who go to UCLA and they've said that
this is pretty true you don't really
call freshman sophomore junior seniors
like by that name you call first year
second years 30 years fourth years fifth
years because it's very common to
graduate within five years versus four
which is definitely something I did not
want to do especially paying
out-of-state tuition also they don't
have a business school and I was
pursuing a business degree so that was
clearly a huge factor as well I chose
USC over Emory and Berkeley because I
really wanted to be in LA so when I was
applying to colleges I think I was a
part of style Hall which is like MCM
which is like a lot of youtubers are
part of that acid Network my network was
in LA and I had actually gotten like a
lot of YouTube related jobs I don't even
think I've logged about this but I had a
an audition with Walmart or now it's not
an audition I did a like an
advertisement was Walmart calm so they
flew me down and then I like film this
advertisement for them it was horrible I
was absolutely terrible at acting but
that was something that was really cool
it's not like there's like a lot of
opportunity in LA and it was also
somewhere that I knew that I would
regret or always wonder about have that
big what-if in my head if I didn't end
up going to LA but I didn't want to just
move to LA for YouTube because it's not
something that I was like considering
pursuing full-time but since I did get
accepted just to schools that were in LA
I was like this is a perfect opportunity
to go here especially since those
schools are really good and I also just
wanted to like experience the city of LA
so that was a huge reason why I did end
up choosing USC or I did consider UCLA
as well but a lot of that was because it
was in LA something else that definitely
drew me to LA was that it was on the
west coast which is where I've spent
like pretty much all of my life Alaska
Washington so like staying on the west
coast is pretty important to me it sucks
to have to travel a really long distance
just to go home huh my dad just called
me and I don't remember what I was
saying
so knowing what I know now would I still
choose USC I get this question all the
time
USC is a great school and I think it's
just going to get better like I'm
looking right now at the University
Village which is a salient dollar
project USC is growing it's getting more
selective every year it's definitely a
competitive school and I don't even know
if I'd be able to get it right now
if I applied as a senior in high school
with my stats that I had there are
definitely some flaws with it though
that I haven't noticed so I'm going to
go over like kind of just the bad things
that I've noticed within USC and like
why it might not be a good fit for you
if you're watching this video I'm
considering it and also some pros so I
am personally a very introverted person
this is something that I realized in
college like I am pretty much the
definition of an introvert with being an
introvert I have noticed that USC is
definitely a very extroverted school
Greek life is super loud and super
present on campus and in general I would
say that the students here are very like
they have extroverted qualities and
that's definitely not to say that like
everyone's an extrovert or whatever but
I feel like if you're applying to UIC
you know it's like in California it's
like a really big Greek life school kind
of a party school so like you kind of
just sign up for like going to like an
extra rinse school I'm also in the
business school so maybe that's why I
like I just see it more so for me like
just being an introvert I've especially
noticed that I'm I kind of stand out as
an introvert people love to go out here
and like party and I honestly can say
that that like I stand out for not
wanting to go out that often
like in classrooms extroverts like tend
to have very different characteristics
like us students like they're very
outspoken they like like group settings
and like speaking out loud and I really
don't mind that like I'm able to do that
but it does take more energy for me so
even in like classroom settings it's I
just noticed that I'm very much an
introvert so that does kind of impact
your social situation initially when I
first came here
I noticed that like everyone had two
groups of friends and always went out
and like always went to parties and like
you know knew everyone on campus and
always said hi to people I felt really
insecure about my like social standing
or like not really my social standing
because I've never really cared about
that but I felt insecure about my like
social abilities because like if
everyone's extroverted everyone has kind
of a norm and then if you're an
introvert like me then it's like you're
different from everyone else and that
obviously like any differences that
people have tend to like just make you
think that you know like it makes you a
little bit insecure so it could be a
good or a bad thing depending on like
who you are but definitely something
that I've noticed and then with that I
think is another really interesting like
social aspect of us see is that like
okay so I wrote it down like this
because I'm trying to think of how to
explain it but you know like the girls
that you see on Instagram that are like
Instagram goals and you like follow them
just because you like their outfit they
look really cute they're really fit they
like wear really nice clothes pretty
much every single girl that you've seen
on Instagram that's like Instagram goals
from like LA you could like easily stick
them at USC like people are so
well-dressed here so trendy like that's
super important to some people but
people really really care about their
social standing and outward appearance
here like extremely and this is not
everywhere USC like you can find your
place and like your pocket of people
everywhere but like I've seen so many
really fake very social climbing not
really genuine down-to-earth girls and
so for me it's been kind of hard to like
make girlfriends that are just like
normal girls who are like are
down-to-earth and like don't really care
like their life doesn't revolve around
like how they look outwardly and how
they're seeing socially so that's
something that I've definitely noticed
and obviously that comes with just like
choosing to go to a school that's in LA
like this school is very la it's very
trendy it's just like kind of amazing
how much social standing really matters
to people here but I guess it's probably
like everywhere I don't know maybe
that's next we're dissing it some
positives are that I absolutely love LA
I love food and I can literally go like
any direction in LA like find how
amazing food which is really
to me and there's always stuff to do and
I spent a lot of time off-campus like
exploring la or like at least exploring
different food scenes so that isn't
something that's extremely important to
me and I have absolutely loved that with
USC and like attending USC I'm able to
do that where I've heard other schools
like even a marine my sister goes there
and she said that like they have a
memory bubble where people don't really
find themselves going off of campus a
lot and also something that you can find
at other schools as well but USC I feel
has given me really really cool
opportunities if you follow my blog
channel and so many hate text messages
okay have you followed my blog channel
you'll probably know that I was a part
of like GLP here at USC which basically
was a Freshman Seminar class where we
were like invited to this class and then
we got to go to China and Shang Shanghai
and Beijing for spring break and then I
was able to intern in Shanghai through
that class because I applied so I'm just
a really cool opportunity and then I was
a TA for that class I was gonna go to
Shanghai Beijing with like the freshmen
this year but I ended up doing my coop
instead and it just really was hard to
kind of make that work out and also you
know the connections that you're able to
get with like the Trojan family but it's
kind of true that's not necessarily
unique to USC but USC like is able to
provide like those connections and
opportunities that other schools might
not but again like I don't go to other
schools so I don't know like what kind
of connections that they have and also
just with USC being in LA I have access
to all the companies pretty much that
are in LA like all the entertainment
companies if I wanted to go there this
is a really good school for that so
that's something that I think I didn't
really think about when I was applying
to schools but that I've learned from
attending USC that's like kind of a lot
of information I'm not really sure what
I've said in the past 10 minutes or
whatever 20 minutes those are all things
to think about when you're making your
final decisions for college I hope this
video was helpful I've gotten a lot of a
lot of a lot of questions about USC and
like why I chose it so I definitely am
glad that I made this video for those of
you who have been asking and I say if
I'm making this video I got to reflect
on like why I chose to go here like
three year
ago and if I made the right decision and
I think I can say that I have but
definitely I know that I would be happy
or I would have been happy at some of
the other schools that I got accepted to
so that's just like important to think
about as well so I hope you guys enjoyed
