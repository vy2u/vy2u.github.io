day summer makeup routine because the
last time I filled an everyday routine
was last summer so I was like whoa I've
been doing YouTube for a year now so I
should start like updating some videos
and stuff like that so I thought it was
kind of funny because I for my everyday
summer makeup routine last year I used
the Too Faced natural eye palette and
this year I'm using the exact same
palette but different colors so this
palette is awesome I used it a lot and I
mean I don't know I feel like use it a
lot but it doesn't really look like it
that much so yeah I thought that was
pretty cool and I really like this
palette so if you're looking for a
palette that you might want to get it's
perfect for summer and winter and
everything in between so I hope you guys
enjoy it and I will talk to you guys in
my tutorials so the first thing that I
like to do for my everyday summer makeup
routine is use this base it which is a
pore balm and it's the equivalent to
like pore fessional here in the US and
it basically it just minimizes the
appearances of pores and for foundation
I've really been loving the Revlon
24-hour color stain I am in the shade
250 fresh beige and that sounds so nice
I don't know why I just really like that
shade and this is just really good for
summer because it feels really really
light it's buildable and it's really
long-lasting
for everyday foundation I like to keep
things very natural and simple and light
so what I'll do is I'll go over with a
thin first layer to kind of even out my
skin tone and then I will go over with a
second layer and spot-check the areas
that I think be more coverage during the
summer time I am all about under-eye
concealer the one I'm currently using is
Laura Mercier and it is this duo
concealer palette that my sister did not
want anymore so I took it from her I
found that these two colors mixed
together make my face appear much more
awake and a lot brighter so what I'll do
is I'll put the lighter shade first on
my dark circles and then
the darker shade afterwards and then
I'll blend it all together with my
marshmallow puffs that I got from Korea
and then for my everything else kind of
concealer I just used the Maybelline fit
me and I found that applying this on a
concealer brush rather than just
applying it directly on your face with
the brush it's a lot easier because the
brush that it comes with it carries a
lot more product than you would think
so I find some discoloration and
blemishes and redness and I just can
seal that up for my eyebrows I'm using
my Too Faced brow Envy kit and I really
use this basically all the time for my
eyebrows this has lasted me so long I
use it every single day if my sister
even uses it sometimes so I pretty much
really like this then B kit that we want
to call it so what I do with this kit is
I just apply the wax first and then I
will apply the lighter shades basically
to the first third of my eyebrows in
those sparse areas and then the darker
shade to the last two thirds and then I
just brush it out with the spoolie to
make sure that everything is even for
powder I just brush on my covergirl
trublend translucent powder mostly
concentrated in the t-zone area and for
a pretty natural looking glow I'm just
using my little mini sample of what's up
from benefit
for bronzer i'm using my NARS Laguna
bronzer and I found a new way that I
like to bronze especially for the
summertime so instead of taking a very
compact brush like I usually do and
contouring very harshly along the
cheekbones I've been taking this big
fluffy brush and doing the exact same
thing but this makes for a much less
defined and harsh contour and a more
natural and bronzed look very perfect
for summertime now for an eyeshadow
primer which is super important to
prevent creasing I use my Urban Decay
primer potion and then I get on to the
eyeshadow I applied the shade heaven all
over these lid for a base color and for
my crease I use the color Velvet
Revolver and I'm going for a super
natural look so basically what I'm doing
is I'm just emphasizing my crease to
make my eyes look a little bit bigger
and deeper and I do this by applying
this color in my crease and then just
above it and I kind of call this like
creating a fake crease but not really
just a little bit in order to create a
kind of balance I also added the same
color to the outer two-thirds of the
lower lash line for the outer B I'm
taking the color sex press oh yeah
that's a cool name and I'm just blending
that on top of the crease color that I
put on and I just made sure to blend it
a lot because I am going for a more
natural and very wearable look and then
I use the same colors expresso on the
outer third of the lower lash line to
just again balance the eyes out a little
bit
and finally I just took a clean blending
brush in order to blend all the colors
together for a flawless and
natural-looking eyeshadow and here I'm
taking my highlighter from benefit again
I love multifunctional products that you
can just use on multiple things and
afterwards I used my Rimmel white
eyeliner as an inner corner highlight
this is a super good eyeliner to use as
an inner corner highlight because it is
very blendable and you can even blend it
with your finger if you don't have a
brush I like to switch out what I do
with my eyeliner but today I'm just
using this Laura Mercier black navy
color and doing a slight tiny wing at
the end I showed this in my last video
you don't have to be precise with a
brush at all and you can just blend it
out with a brush and make all the bad
lines go away
and finally I'm just curling my lashes
with my cute little mirror that I got
from Korea in preparation to use my
Maybelline the falsies slurred
waterproof mascara because you never
know what you're gonna do on summer days
at least I don't I don't know so you
have to prep for those spontaneous
summer adventures with some waterproof
mascara and I also always use my
Clinique slower lash on mascara just
because I really like the look of really
full lower lashes
also for my looks I like to change
things up a lot but today I'm going for
more of a nude book going on with the
natural kind of theme that I have going
here and then I also got a brand new
marvelous Moxie from bareMinerals
because I'm always raving about how much
I love my ring later one so this one is
in rule breaker and I will have all of
my products that I use listed in the
downbar if you want to come back to that
so the very last thing that I do which I
usually forget is spray the Urban Decay
all nighter setting spray just in order
to make sure that my makeup lasts to its
fullest so that is my completed everyday
makeup routine I hope you guys enjoyed
it and if you did please give it a
thumbs up and be sure to subscribe to
this channel for more videos from you
and I will see you guys very soon with a
morning routine video so be excited for
that bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
