day 3 this intro doesn't have any music
because I'm getting copyrighted and I
can't tell what it's for
so enjoy I don't know why I do this I
always start my vlogs before I like get
ready with my like hair and makeup but
oh well my hair is like kind of still
mmm doing something from dry bar but
today I got back and I left last night
so I could you know just be at home and
like go to sleep and have a good night's
sleep and then get up to go study and of
course I woke up at like 12:00 and it's
now 1 because I stayed in bed and almost
fell asleep again and I'm just getting
up and I'm just like starting my day and
I think it's just like do you guys ever
have those days where you're just like
in bed thinking about all the stuff that
you need to do and you really don't want
to do it and you even get up but then go
back to bed because you're just like
like don't want to do any of this I have
so much to do or is that just me because
I'm really about it like dealing with
things but now that the amazing weekend
is over I have so much stuff to do I
have to like figure out my car insurance
so I don't know if I told you guys what
happened basically this is such a pain
in the butt to like have to deal with so
I was in the middle lane basically and
there are like three lanes there's this
Lane and it was turning left and I
needed to turn left so I started merging
into LAT Lane and I waited but I
signaled and the car in front of the car
who hit me pulled up and so I had enough
room and so I was like pulling in and
the guy was like letting me go and so
you know as you do you just pull in but
then I realized like he started to
accelerate like he wasn't even
accelerating he was very like it looked
like Tasha described it as like you know
how your car moves forward if you don't
put your foot on the gas or the brake it
was just like he was going that slow I
think what happened and I think he knows
that this happened too because I talked
him afterwards about it and he
apologized and he litter
said that the crash is his fault after
he was like kind of mad at me and what
happened I think is he was texting and
so I thought he was letting me in but he
really just wasn't paying attention and
so like he was just driving forward
because he was texting at the same time
or like looking at his phone and also
like trying to drive so he was going
forward because I was honking for at
least five seconds like I was honking
for such a long time that there was no
way that if he was paying attention he I
don't know like he was just very much
not paying attention and I'm not sure if
the insurance people will think it's my
fault just based on like me merging but
it was how to present his fault for not
paying attention and afterwards we like
stopped to the side and like we talked
to each other and like exchange
insurance and like contact info and he
was mad at me at first he was like yeah
like why would you merge like I couldn't
see you but yeah like I was the one
merging and I just kind of said like
look like I'm really sorry that this
happened I would never try to purposely
merge into you I was looking the whole
time I was in the driver seat like I
wouldn't of course I wouldn't like want
to run into your car I think that would
happen is like I was honking and even
after we crashed like I rolled down my
window and I was like I was honking for
like five seconds or more like I was
talking for so long guys after I said
like I just don't like I don't know what
you were doing you weren't paying
attention I was honking for so long like
maybe you're on your phone but like you
just like slowly ran into me and I like
really couldn't do anything about that
at that point because it was just too
late like I was just watching him run
into my car so after that like he kind
of raised his voice a little bit while
he was like kind of blaming me but after
that he kind of calmed down and like
collected himself and he was like yeah
look like I'm really sorry like this is
my like he literally said this is my
fault and then at that point I was like
you know it's like no-one's fault like
it just happens like it's an accident
whatever I really think that he was
texting because otherwise I don't think
he would admit that it was his fault but
yeah that's what I have to deal with I
have to like figure out the insurance
stuff with that and of course I have no
idea how to do that so and there's also
like a chance that he probably won't
tell his insurance company that it was
his fault money was too
so it'll just look like my fault so
that's the thing I also have my finals a
lot of my finals due on Wednesday and
it's Sunday so I have to like get
started on that and it's just a lot of
stuff I feel like I'm dealing with like
a lot of stuff and just like trying to
like not deal with it or just I don't
even know I'm just so ready it's already
break I think I'm gonna get started on
all that but before I do
maybe I cheer myself up I'm going to
open a dote gift so this is day three I
don't know if I've also explained this
really well but basically don't is a
shopping platform it's really good for
people like me who are really bad at
shopping because it's kind of like you
just click a button and then you
checkout and it's being sent to your
door it takes a lot for me to go looking
for stuff and then it's like a whole
nother commitment in like a whole nother
hurdle to actually buy it cuz I'm like
ah but that's actually a really bad
thing for me because that I just never
buy clothes and then I'm like stuck
going to events and I'm like I don't
have anything to wear
so that's personally just why I really
like don't like it could be dangerous
for you like shopaholics but it just
makes everything so easy and you can
also um it'll notify you when your items
that you like are on sale so that's
really cool but if you guys want to
check it out and download it and then
use my free $5 code that will be in the
description below definitely check it
out because it is a really really cool
app and if you do let me know if you
guys did and if you liked it or like
whatnot
because I would just be curious to hear
you guys opinions and they're just like
such a great awesome team so like I very
much just love supporting them but this
is day 3 so we're gonna just put you on
top of my Tylenol honestly this is
really making my life because this day
a little something from one of our
favorite brands Lauren this is a CEO of
a company and she's so awesome and she's
also from Anchorage so that's pretty
much why I like though mm-hmm just
kidding you guys should guess like
honestly I have no idea what any of
these gifts are like what type of gifts
or like how cool they are so it's always
like a huge surprise and I've honestly
been blown away with like how nice these
gifts are so far so I'm very thankful
like I'm not just taking this okay this
is so nice of them that's so bad every
time I like we're at the stove wrapping
paper yes oh my gosh this is actually so
perfect because I literally go to yoga
and I'm like this is a dry fit like
sweat thing I actually am running out of
like clothes to wear so I like pretty
much wear the same things and I always
have to wash them because I go to yoga
like so often sometimes so this is
actually so perfect okay this just shows
you how great the DOE team is they've
truly just did their research like this
is such a great gift for me oh my gosh
it's also just black so it's like really
versatile and I can wear it with
anything thank you so much dog oh this
is so thoughtful that's actually made my
day
so thank you so much to everyone at the
DOE team like you guys are really just
every single day that I have like
interacted or experienced like working
with the DOE team they add to themselves
and I'm just like continually
continually continuously impressed like
they're amazing so definitely go check
out doe not just because they sent me a
really cool gift but because it's like a
genuinely really cool app and then also
follow me and you can see like my
favorites page and stuff and what I like
and what they're probably breaks nice
gifts on
I'm showing my mom what I got for
vlogmas can hear people yeah she's more
excited than I am just kidding I'm
really excited yeah I know it's like
directly cuts off my lights but they
don't look very cute in the camera for
some reason anyway so I guess I'm okay
with that
it is now 941 and playing a cheering in
the background for some nude mood music
and I don't want to get copyright but I
also don't want to turn it off because I
like it um I always played a cheering
when I'm trying to like relax and like
calm down and like okay now it's
distracting me I've been studying for my
finals basically I thought I would walk
you guys through kind of my finals
schedule and then like kind of what I
have to do then I wanted to show you
guys like how I'm studying for my finals
or like how I'm just like studying on a
day-to-day or like what my scheduling is
like so that's what this is gonna be
right now and then I'm also gonna like
prepare my room for finals I don't know
it's a freaking mess right now and
usually one of my mess area from when my
room is messy I get really stressed out
and it like stresses me out and I'm like
and I'm like I should clean stuff but
for some reason I was just content to
like sit at my desk and not do anything
with this huge mess around me so pretty
much what I'm doing I can show you guys
my final schedule so it was weird
because I am taking 18 units this
semester which is more than I've taken
in like two years the last time I took
18 units was my freshman year like all
throughout my freshman year but for some
reason my final schedule I think is
easier than ever before I think it's
just like the combination of classes
that I'm taking but my last week had a
ton of group projects and a quiz and
just like assignments do and so this
week it's actually like I only really
have two tests that I have to take
and I'm only really worried about one of
them I mean both of them are important
because they're both tests that like my
grade could really fluctuate on but
other than that I just have our would
have had a portfolio which was like two
paper essays due and one it was
basically just revising two essays and
then putting them into a new portfolio
and then you'd get graded on your
improvements but I already have two A's
on both of my essays that I would use
for my portfolio so I don't have to do
anything and I still get an A which is
amazing so I'm super excited about that
but I also have like a creative writing
assignment due so it's like an essay due
on this week and then the other one is
just like showing up to class
I don't yeah he's like it's an
entrepreneurship class and I'm pretty
sure he's just gonna like feed us which
is super nice so that's like pretty much
my final schedule and in between I have
like small like just last minute
assignments due but yeah so on Wednesday
I have three things do it's my Excel
class final which i think is like my
most important final because I really
don't know how I'm doing in that class
but I know it's gonna be really hard
because the curve like needs to be
established and she told us that the
average is like 60 or 70 or something
and I'm doing the worst in this class I
don't know all of my other classes
luckily it's a two-unit so even if I get
like a B or C I'm actually I'm probably
not gonna get an A for sure but if I get
a bad grade it's not weighted as heavily
so that's good and then on Wednesday I
also have my essay due and then I have
like the remaining stuff of a group
project and paper due and that's all due
on Wednesday and then the only other
stuff that I have is do the next Tuesday
so I have such a long time to study for
my next and final strategic management
course it's a pretty easy class but it's
just like a lot of memorization and
stuff so I could really split it up a
lot so I think that'll be like pretty
easy but it's nice that I have a long
time to study for it because if it is
hard like I have an Anna at class right
now but
I can probably keep my a if I actually
do all in this so like I want to do well
so I want time to study and then I just
have like a get-together
kind of thing he was like you can't
prepare for this final you just have to
show up so I'm pretty sure he's just
gonna feed us food because he's like
it's a pretty cool guy that is like what
my final schedule is and in terms of
like how I am studying or structuring my
schedule to study luckily this is a
pretty relaxed final schedule so like me
going away for the entire weekend didn't
really matter I think that I would
probably have wasted a lot of my weekend
anyways so that's good I just have to
make sure to like balance my time well
because I'm really bad at actually
writing my essays it takes it's just
something that I don't want to do but
it's funny because the class that I have
my final test on it's like a class that
I really hate doing - so these are both
like two things that I just do not like
to do but basically how I've structured
this I'm prioritizing the class that I
have the worst grade in so for Wednesday
out of all of the things that are due my
data analysis Excel class is my most
important to focus on because I'm doing
like the worse than that
like I have a very like a pretty solid
grade in my writing class so even though
like it's like a mini essay I don't have
to do that well so I'm like not not
prioritizing it but I'm just like
spending less time than I am on my test
and it's also do much later I have my
Excel class at 8:00 a.m. and then this
thing is do you like at 11:59 p.m. and
he doesn't really care about the timing
so it's just like I'm trying to rank the
importance of my classes and also how
I'm doing in them cuz in my freshman
year and sophomore year I used to study
for the classes that I actually liked
which is a good thing but it's bad
because like I'm not as likely to study
for the classes that I don't like and in
order to keep track of that I started
doing this last year so what I basically
do is I take I just start writing the
time down so like if I were to start
right now I'd be 9:50 and I either give
myself a goal of like 25 minutes it's
called the Pomodoro Technique and if I
just do 25 minutes I use that if I want
to
make sure to do a lot of subjects and if
I'm having a really hard time balancing
or managing my time between my subjects
which happens a lot so this is a really
really good technique for that that
ensures that you're doing at least
something every single day or just
working on it a little bit so that's
kind of how I'm studying for finals it's
just like managing my time and
prioritizing which classes that I think
I need more focus on and I guess for
like specific subjects like I just make
a little to-do list so for here I have
like module 1 and I'm pretty much just
doing all the same exact things for each
module to like learn or just review what
to learn so I have lecture notes lab
homework quiz crib sheet because like we
get cheat sheets so when I finish like
reviewing one of them are like doing one
of them we're making one of them then
I'm just gonna cross that off and that's
pretty much like what I'm gonna be doing
for finals that was really not as
in-depth as I thought it would be but
it's I guess helpful like if you just
like don't know where to start or like
if you're having troubles managing your
time between multiple things cuz I
always used to have that problem and
writing the 25 minutes per like subject
thing is pretty helpful for that so
right now I just did my like excel class
work or studying for like two hours so
I'm just taking a break and then I think
from now on since it's getting late
I'm going to start doing the 25 minute
thing where I work on stuff for like
chunks of 25 minutes because for the
rest of the night I have my vlogmas to
edit and then my paper that I want to
write and I always like I just keep
putting my paper off because I just
don't want write it so I think today's
the day that I'm gonna start forcing it
into my schedule and then I also still
need to study for this take that class
so that's my finals how I'm studying for
my finals some just like little things
that I've done is when my parents were
here they bought me like a box of juices
and they're supposed to be like juice
diets but I don't actually ever just
like not eat food but today I really did
not eat that much so that's actually
been super helpful it's just like having
something really easy to grab and
or just consume four calories so right
now you guys are like sitting on top of
a Suja bottle and it's the third meal
but that's like bailing when I've had
today but it's really helpful because
like I didn't want to make any food so
I'm just drinking that and it's like two
hundred so many calories it has like
almonds and stuff so it's nice and
filling and caloric and has protein just
like little things like that and then
I'm also going to clean up my room
because I like working at my desk for my
Excel class because it has like the
double monitors which is super super
helpful so like it's not just all on my
tiny laptop so I'm assuming that I'm
going to be staying at my house to work
for like probably until Wednesday so I
just want to make sure like clean
everything so I'm not like looking at it
and getting stressed out about how messy
my room is well I'm supposed to be
studying finally what I want to do to
like kind of just study for finals is
make sure that I get an don't work out
everyday because this is honestly so so
incredibly helpful and it's always a
thing that I push off and like push off
my list of things to do but it's
honestly a necessity and I don't know
why I always do that but I'm going to
try to exercise every single day of my
finals and I'm sure like on Wednesday I
probably won't because I have my 8 a.m.
and then my essay due at 11:59 but for
the rest of the days I don't really have
an excuse so I'm going to be doing that
and I can also use my doped shirt that I
just got in my vlogmas package so yeah
that's pretty much it for my finals also
I apologize for this boring blog it's
always like this way when it's finals
time and that's just kind of like a con
of doing vlogmas in college like a lot
of people are just not doing it because
they're like oh all I'm gonna be doing
is studying for finals but sometimes
people like seeing these so I don't know
if you guys want me to talk about
something in particular definitely like
request that in the comments like
whether it's finals related or like
studying related or whatever let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
