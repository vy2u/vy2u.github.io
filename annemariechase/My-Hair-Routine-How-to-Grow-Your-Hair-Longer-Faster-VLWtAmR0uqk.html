showing you guys my hair care routine
and then giving you tips on how to grow
long healthy hair this is why I'm
weirdly standing in the shower I don't
know I thought it was really weird at
first but it was kind of fun so before I
even step into the shower I will brush
my hair and make sure that it is free of
knots and tangles then I gently bring
out most of the water in my hair so that
my shampoo sticks a lot better and then
I'll put like a quarter-sized or more
amount of shampoo right now I'm using
this Pantene shampoo but I really switch
up my shampoos all of the time and I'll
just keep doing this from the top of my
scalp to the nape of my neck so the
reason why I only concentrate my shampoo
on my scalp is because that is where all
of your dead skin cells are and your
natural oils that your scalp has so I
personally feel like putting it on the
tips of your hair can actually be
damaging because it can dry your tips
out so after I feel like I've gotten a
good amount of shampoo all over my scalp
I will actually twist my hair into a bun
and let it sit at the top of my head
this is nice because it lets the shampoo
just sit and work its thing for a few
minutes and I feel like it also
indirectly gets some shampoo onto your
tips so that it smells nice and if your
hair is not long enough or it just won't
sit at the top of your hair without
using like an elastic I would recommend
like clipping it also as a final tip for
shampoo I use this tea gel shampoo from
Neutrogena at least once a month because
I mean everyone's embarrassed by it but
honestly it's natural and it happens
sometimes if you're getting little
flakes in your hair or like looking a
little bit dandruff II just use some
type of shampoo that specializes in that
it's not embarrassing and this is just
good for preventative measures and then
I just rinse out my shampoo and then
move on to conditioner and for
conditioner I'm using this old Pantene
conditioner that I'm trying to use up
but I do the exact same steps except I
focus the conditioner solely on the ends
and tips of my hair because that is
where it needs moisture so every week I
love using leave-in conditioners
cuz it's just really luxurious and it
makes your hair super soft and yummy
smelling so my favorite one is actually
from Korea and I got it from skin foods
but I've also used this Herbal Essence
one and it is also very nice but these
are the only two I've tried so let me
know if you guys have any favorite ones
so then I just twist my hair into a bun
again and I leave this at the top of my
head a little bit longer than I do for
the shampoo and I really feel like this
moisturizes your scalp really well which
is important and then to dry my hair I
use this microfiber towel because I have
super long and thick hair and it takes
absolutely forever to dry and this does
a really really good job with absorbing
all of the water so my last step for the
night is to blow-dry my hair
halfway until it is dry and I point the
blow-dryer straight down on my hair and
I don't use a brush I just use my
fingers so I will talk about this later
but this keeps my hair very frizz free
and it actually straightens it pretty
well surprisingly and it retains the
smell of your shampoo and conditioner
super well so I love doing this before I
go to bed and then I just let my hair
air dry and that is the last step for my
night
all right so now that I've shown you
guys basically my entire hair routine
I'm gonna go into tips and tricks for
growing out long healthy hair so I'm
gonna tell you guys a little bit about
my hair
it is this long so it's pretty long and
it took me like two years to grow this
out so before this here I had
disgustingly super dry hair that was
just dead all over the place so now my
hair is much longer than it was even
when it was just completely disgusting
and dead and it is also extremely
healthy
the only time I've had short hair is
what my hairstylist messes up my haircut
so I know the pain of trying to grow
your hair out and I have researched so
many times how to grow a long healthy
hair and I don't know about you guys but
I really feel like no one actually knows
a really good way of how to grow hair
and for my experience growing your hair
out is really all just about keeping it
healthy and not having split ends so
that you don't have to cut it if you cut
your hair it will be shorter if you grow
your hair it's gonna be longer but when
you grow your hair you want it to be
healthy so that you don't have to cut
your hair and the split ends and after
that I kind of think genetics just takes
the rest of it
so with that being said I think that
healthy hair comes from a healthy scalp
and I absolutely hate the word scalp but
if you also hate the word as much as I
do I'm very sorry and also keeping the
tips of your hair healthy so that you
don't have to cut it so I was in biology
class when one of my friends and I grace
came up with a list of tips and tricks
for a healthy long hair okay so we're
gonna start from the roots of your hair
so the first tip that I would have is
listen to your scalp I'm so dumb and
after you listen to it you should try
and experiment with different shampoos
and conditioners when I was younger I
did not know that you could buy
different shampoos and conditioners
they do different things because my
parents always just bought the exact
same conditioners and shampoos so now
that I can buy my own shampoo I have
been using different shampoos and they
do very different shampoos do very
different things and the same goes for
conditioners so if your scalp is feeling
very oily or looks very oily or your
hair and the roots of your hair just
look oily then you should try using a
stronger shampoo and I do not know what
chemical or ingredient in the shampoo is
that makes a shampoo stronger I can
assume that there is like a particular
ingredient but I just don't know because
I did not do enough research I'm kind of
just sitting here talking to a camera
but for example whenever I use my
Pantene shampoo it does a really
thorough job of cleaning my hair it
never feels greasy after I clean it on
the other hand if I need to wash my hair
and my scalp is feeling a little bit dry
I will use my yes - cucumber shampoo
because while that does like a good job
cleaning your hair it like doesn't
really take care of oiliness because it
doesn't strip your hair of all of those
natural oils that your scalp has I kind
of feel like natural shampoos are less
harsh and like more commercial shampoos
are pretty harsh that definitely does
not go for all natural shampoos in
commercial shampoos so if you're feeling
too oily or too dry just try different
shampoos or don't wash your hair as much
that's also another thing for me
personally I have to shower every day
and I have to wash my hair every day or
else I just feel absolutely disgusting
so I never used dry shampoo but it is
really really helpful for your hair my
sister does not shower everyday because
she doesn't have to she's not like a
greasy oily person so when she goes one
day without showering she will use dry
shampoo to give her hair volume if it
becomes flat after not showering and
washing it or to take the gray Sina sand
oiliness away from it so this also goes
through conditioners like I showed you
guys in my hair routine I only keep the
conditioner on the ends of my hair but
if my scalp is feeling dry I will put
some kind
now on to my hands massage it into my
scalp and leave it there for a few
minutes and that actually really really
helps so if you're feeling a little bit
like flaky even or dry that can help a
bunch conditioner really moisturizes
your hair and it can also moisturize
your scalp so this is random and I'm not
really sure if this actually works but I
thought it was worth mentioning
I usually massage my scalp whenever I am
in the shower I'm shampooing my hair
like you guys saw and grace just does it
like in class I guess um I'm not really
sure if that's an actual thing and that
stimulates hair growth but I can kind of
see that working like like stimulating
little hair follicles in your head so
you guys want to try that like let me
know your thoughts on if that actually
works or if you guys think that's stupid
so now I'm going to move on to the ends
and tips of healthy hair advice the main
thing that I would say is to not use as
much heat on your hair if you do I have
gotten in the habit of not using heat a
lot at all because like I said my hair
was like completely disgusting and
completely dried out and I think that
this is like the biggest thing that made
a difference for my hair but also I'm
very smart about the way that I use heat
so after I take a shower I will blow dry
my hair half way until it's dry
so by blow-drying my hair and then
letting it air dry it gives my hair a
completely different look and texture
this is what it looks like after the day
after but if I don't blow dry my hair
halfway it'll be completely frizzy and
like maybe even a little bit wavy and
it's just like a big frizzy ish puffy
wavy mess like you know what I'm talking
about just like the big hair that you
don't really think is cute it doesn't
look that smooth because it's just all
frizzy and also be sure to use heat
protectant to put a barrier between the
heat and your hair I think that's also a
huge thing so I'm gonna talk about two
things that kind of damage your hair my
friend grace gave me this tip that I
didn't even know about which is really
interesting so wet hair is a lot more
like fragile and elasticy than dry hair
when you put your hair up and
ponytail or a button after you shower
and when your hair is wet then it can
break your hairs and that may be why you
have like the little hair sticking up in
your head so I thought that was super
interesting but it completely makes
sense and that is also why you do not
use hair brushes like this one after you
shower because it can break your hair
what I would recommend using are like
wide tooth comb brushes or I personally
just don't really brush my hair until
the morning after when my hair is all
dry another thing that can be damaging
to your hair and scalp is using super
hot water when you shower using super
hot water just dries out your skin in
general hot water also relaxes your
scalp and it can cause your hair to fall
out more easily than lukewarm water or
even cold water if you want to do that
so the final tip that I have is to use
even conditioner and brings a lot of
moisture to the ends of your hair and it
also kind of controls like the
frizziness and like the fluffiness it
also smells amazing so that's I use that
like every single day and it's really
made a huge difference on my hair and it
also looks a lot shinier so that is
basically my entire hair routine and all
of my tips and tricks for growing the
long healthy hair I hope you guys
