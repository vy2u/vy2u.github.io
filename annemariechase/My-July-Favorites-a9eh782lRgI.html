channel so today I'm going to be doing a
favorites today I'm going to be doing in
July favorites video so I'm gonna be
showing you all the products and things
that I've really been liking in the
month of July so I've been looking
around for a contour brush for a little
while I kind of just avoided contouring
like my cheekbones and stuff because I
didn't really have a brush to do it so I
went out to Mac and I got one but i
actually really like it it makes
contouring really easily i just like
kind of put a concentrated amount like
on the hollows of my cheekbone and then
i'll blend it out a bunch so this is
definitely worked a lot better than like
the random brushes that i was using
before and i actually really like to
contour now and i'll just like contour
my face this summer I picked up the
Naked basics palette and I thought that
that was going to be my favorite palette
for the entire summer because it's
really small compact and it has like all
of the neutral colors that you need with
like shimmery and matte colors so it was
really awesome but recently I started
digging in my old make out and I found
this palette this is a two-faced natural
eye palette so this is my very first
pallet I've ever gone and i started
using it again this summer or this month
actually and I just really I fell in
love with it all over again this is such
a great palette that I just completely
forgot about so right now I'm wearing
silk teddy on my eyelid with velvet
revolver in the crease and then sex
presso in the outer V so these are some
weird names and I'm pretty sure two
years ago I probably had a video saying
that this is my favorite palette too so
if you guys how to check that out i'll
link it in the description box but it is
gonna be weird real weird we got my next
favorite a little while ago i think it
was probably like half a year ago but i
still really like it and it is the mac
219 brush basically i use this to
highlight the inner corners of my eyes
and I used to just have like a lot of
trouble highlighting the inner corners
of my eyes and I also bring this a
little bit along the lower lash line to
highlight my eyes some more and this
just makes highlighting those areas so
much easier those areas are super small
so it's just like the perfect amount of
coverage on those areas if that makes
this is my last beauty favorite and this
is the they're real push-up eyeliner I'm
sure you might have seen it's around
YouTube before but basically what you do
is this is what it looks like and then
you twist it a few times so I really
like this product for the precision that
it allows because you can draw wings
super easily it just gives you a really
exact line and it's just really user
friendly but there is a downside to this
the gel is really fragile so if you kind
of like bump it the wrong way on your
eye it can either fall off on your eye
and then it's really it's like a gel
liner so when you try to get it off
it'll just smear everywhere or the gel
will kind of build up in here and then
not give you a good gel to work with
hello I don't really know how you fix
that and I don't know if that's like
just a problem I'm having with this
product but the gel is a little bit
clumpy sometimes and that just like it's
no good when that happens cuz then it's
like somewhere just jelly and gets all
over the place I have one fashion
favorite it's not even really fashion
it's just a sports bra from victoria's
secret this is what it looks like and
I've used this so much not sure why I'm
showing sports bra but this is on sale
during their sale um I think it was like
twenty dollars or something probably a
little bit more I feel like I said this
like many times before but whenever I
get new workout gear just really
motivates me to work out and I didn't
realize that the sports bra that I have
been using for some locks I only use
like two or three um they're all too
small for me so it really kind of tricks
I mean sports bras are meant to be
really like constricting anyways because
they're holding up your boobies but um I
didn't realize that mine were too small
for me so every time I would work out is
just like a little bit harder to breathe
it's hard enough working out anyways and
you want things to be running smoothly
so um I really like the sports bra and
it's adorable it also peeks through like
the tee shirts that I wear or the shirts
that I wear so it's just super cute it's
also nice because it's adjustable in the
back this is something that I have never
had before and I think that's why this
works so well because I mean if you're
on one of your skinnier weeks or months
you can just put it up the closest
but if not it's you can adjust it and I
just feel like this bra just makes sense
okay so we're gonna move on into the
random favourites time a lot of you guys
have been asking where I've gotten this
and put this in the last two videos that
I've had this is my weekly calendar
organizers thing and basically I got
this at target I showed this in my
school supplies haul and then I kind of
showed it like for like two seconds in
my night routine and people were like
where'd you get that calendar I actually
really really like this calendar I told
you guys in my hall that I would try it
out and if i liked it i was gonna bring
it to college i'm definitely bringing
this to college I don't know what it is
about this but it's just seeing your
week visually it just helps so much so
this is how I've kind of been using it
so I put that as scheduled I have
YouTube fitness and then other and then
on this side I have my to-do lists I
haven't been taking this top one off
because it carries on for my two week I
don't do those things for this one I
have my video ideas on here and this
also just stays down here and then every
day if I feel like writing a list and I
have a lot of things to do I will just
write it to do list for today so i'll
write today and then I like make a
little bullet point and then I'll just
stick it on the day like forever for
whichever one is clear and then I'll
just kind of check the things off as I
do them throughout the day I have like a
bunch of calendar like things or like
agendas but I feel like just having a
visually like appealing week planned out
in front of you and just like looking at
it all the time it's really helpful it's
also just really nice to have during the
summer when I feel like I don't actually
have to do anything but I should so
that's been helpful for that my last
favorite I favorite artist by far this
month has been add shared and I'm sure
so many people have said that in their
favorites videos but I don't even care
because it's just like some love pretty
much all the songs are songs that I
would listen to over and over again and
they are definitely songs and I have
listened to over and over again so my
favorite two songs on insurance new
album multiply are a photograph so I
have this as my alarm because for every
single song I've ever had as in a lot
I end up hating that song because it
just like kind of wakes you up like
abruptly orders like this song is so
annoying now because it's like it's an
alarm so you start to hate it but I said
this as my alarm because it's just a
super super pleasant sound they were
just spit everywhere and this is like
the nicest thing to wake up to because
the beginning is really really mellow so
you don't actually wake up until halfway
through the song and one time I was
listening to this song as I was waking
up and I was like pretty much still
asleep and I had an epiphany with one of
the things he said in this song but I
don't remember what it was anymore but
it like it just it was so weird like the
entire world made sense after I woke up
like I was half asleep and I listened to
something that he said it was like okay
that makes sense and i woke up and i
remembered and so I listened to the
whole song like over and over again and
I was like what What did he say and I
don't really know what lyric in the song
he said and I think it might have just
been a dream but I just like had this
special connection with this song for so
long now probably because of that so I
listened to this song so many times and
I love it this is my favorite song right
now okay and then my second favorite
song on this album is thinking out loud
and I try to learn all the lyrics to the
song but it is a really really fun song
to sing along to so if you guys have not
heard those songs definitely look them
up I love that shirt but I know that
he's not for everyone like my mom thinks
his music is really depressing and my
sister doesn't really like him for some
reason but I don't know I think he's a
musical genius so I don't know so those
are all my favorites for this month be
sure to check out my last video so I
hope you guys all enjoyed this video and
be sure to give it a thumbs up if you
did also I'm thinking about starting up
a blog series on my channel where I will
vlog throughout my week and then post it
like every Sunday or something let me
know what you guys think of that I'm
still like cuz I'm really trying to just
walk but I don't know like what to vlog
sometimes I just don't do anything so
I'm like I can't do like a daily vlog so
that was my idea that I came up with and
I think it'll be really fun cuz I'll be
going to college and stuff and I can
show you guys around and show you what
i've been doing or might be really
boring cuz i might not do anything so
we'll see but let me know what you guys
think of that idea and i will talk to
you guys later bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
