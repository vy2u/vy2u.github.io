from doing whatever I've been doing the
day I'll usually go straight into my
room and then change that I'm really
comfortable for the rest of the night
all the way I'll pretty much just wear
whatever today I picked out a white
t-shirt and some USC shorts that I just
got it's not kind of just chill and hang
out my room I'm actually really really
introverted so I love spending time
alone but I really use this time to
re-energize myself and to just think so
during this time I'll either realize
that my room's a complete disaster and
I'll clean it or I'll just listen to
music and light a candle and kind of
just relax and chill out I also like to
edit videos or repetitive comments I'll
even try to plan out my week or you know
my life or whatever
and I'll also eat dinner with my family
today my sister and I just made some
cauliflower crusted pizza it was super
delicious and sometimes I'll even go out
again with my friends or boyfriend or
sister because in Alaska gets dark super
late so it feels a lot earlier than it
actually is but eventually when I get
tired this is kind of like the point of
no return where I just don't leave my
house
so I'll start taking off my makeup and I
just use the Neutrogena facial wipes for
this I brush my hair whenever I remember
to before the shower because this helps
the detangling process after the shower
when your hair is all wet and fragile
and inside I will usually wash my face
with a facial cleanser and then every
now and then I'll deep clean with my
Clarisonic I like to switch at my
shampoos but this week I'm just using
all Pantene for shampoo and conditioner
and I love using body washes so I've
been using philosophy and vanilla cake
and it smells really good and then
afterwards I'll change into some
comfortable pajamas I got this one from
Victoria's Secret like a few days ago
and I think it's adorable I just really
like wearing long shirts because pants
are really uncomfortable for me in the
summer so this is pretty much what I
look like when I get out of the shower
it's scary I always use a piece of
another makeup wipe and then wipe off
the excess makeup and then I use this
Clinique moisturizing lotion for my face
this is a really good moisturizer I've
been using it for a few years now and
this towel is a microfiber towel I think
it is cold and it basically just dries
really fast so it's really good for
drying your hair but so after I kind of
moisturize my face I will put on my acne
medicine that I just recently started
using again this is retin-a and this is
super strong so it'll basically take off
that layer of skin so you'll have like
kind of flaky gross skin for a little
bit but it really does a job of taking
your acne off of your face which that's
kind of gross so I'll use this at night
so that I can moisturize my face the
next morning and then I try to do this
every night I floss my teeth with this
super thin floss I'll brush my teeth
with my sonic hair to
brush not clear sonic and then I will
use this fluoride that my sister and I
have been really obsessed with since
very younger but we just recently
started using it again afterwards I
usually forget this step but I'll put in
my retainer and since I forget it's
super painful every time I do it like
every month or so I like to mostly air
dry my hair but in order to keep it
frizz free I'll put some product in it
which can just be a leave-in conditioner
and then I'll blow-dry it halfway and I
find that when I do this my hair is just
a lot less puffy in the morning and I
also sleep on this silk pillowcase I
only bought one because they're about
twenty dollars on Amazon but I think
that this has actually made a big
difference for helping my hair become
less frizzy and I always moisturize my
lips and hands before bed because I feel
like this is the best time to let it
really just sink into your skin so for
the rest of the night I'll pretty much
just either read or most likely a go on
my computer and I've been really ended
tumblr lately I've had it for a while
but I just like recently started using
it a bunch so if you guys want to follow
me on tumblr you can and then I'll go on
Instagram and check my newsfeed if I
haven't for the day this usually takes a
while and yes my phone is completely
shattered I dropped it like on July
fourth or something it was really lame
I'll reply to YouTube comments or edit
my videos or pretty much do whatever and
then eventually I will force myself to
go to sleep so that is my entire night
routine I hope you all enjoyed it a lot
and that you did please give it a thumbs
up as it really helps me out and I'll
talk to you guys later bye
