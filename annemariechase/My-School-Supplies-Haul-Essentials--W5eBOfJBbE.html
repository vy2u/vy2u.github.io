room I filmed here once before and I
kind of liked it um if you're wondering
this is like my closet where I keep all
of my like baby stuff and stuff like
that like you can see some stuffed
animals so if you're wondering why I'm
wearing the exact same clothes as my
last video it's because it is the same
day if you guys want to see how to do
this makeup tutorial you can watch my
last video so this video today is my
school supplies essentials haul and I
literally just sat here for the last
hour
filming an hour-long video about school
supplies essentials and organization
tips because I kind of didn't know that
I could divide the two but I don't want
my video to be an hour long so I'm going
to split this video up into two so this
is the school supplies essentials part
these are the supplies that I get every
single year and I know this sounds
extremely materialistic and it is
actually a really materialistic but when
I get new school supplies that I really
like using it kind of just makes me want
to do my homework more like it motivates
me a little bit more just like buying
workout clothes may motivate some people
to workout just because they have like
good gear now um it makes me motivated
to do homework I'm not sure if that's
for everyone it's kind of just whatever
works so whatever gets you do in your
homework you know and I will be a senior
this upcoming year so these are the
things that I've just found that work
best for me so I don't know I thought
some of you might be curious and I also
have a really really good system for
keeping organized um so if you guys want
to check that out I'm going to be
posting that in the next few days or so
it just took way too long to explain it
in one video so I'm gonna go ahead and
just get started I'm just gonna show you
the things that I got and not try to
talk too much about it because I learned
that I can talk a lot also if you are
going school shopping at this time I
would definitely recommend shopping
around because just from my shopping
experiences I've been to like three
different stores the price is very kind
of a lot like up from $1 to like $3 and
that might not seem a lot but it really
does that up so if that's something you
guys are concerned about you should
definitely shop around because some
places are a lot cheaper than others so
the first thing that I have here is
hybrid note binder from five-star and
this is my absolute favorite binder I've
been using it since the seventh grade I
think this is 13 dollars and you can
find it at Target or it's 13 dollars at
Target I don't know you can probably
find it in other places I really really
really like this binder because it is so
small and compact it's a one-inch binder
so it kind of forces you to stay really
organized and keep everything light and
this is perfect for if you carry around
a tote or a purse so this is pretty
small in terms of how binders are and
it's very lightweight so if that's
something that you're looking for this
is the perfect Byner for you so one of
the things that I like most about
binders being this small is that it does
again force you to kind of be selective
about what you put in your binder so it
makes sure that you don't have too much
clutter in here so it keeps you really
organized with just the size itself
another thing that I really like about
it is that it has a super simple design
um they have started carrying designed
ones so it's like I don't know I think I
saw like polka dots
it was very playful but just kind of a
little bit too childish I don't know I
just really like this simple design so
the thing that I like about the outside
of this is that you can take papers and
take notes on top of the binder because
it lays flat
it doesn't slope like this another thing
about this binder that you can see is
that the rings are actually on the
outside which is really really cool for
if you have like a pencil pouch that has
a three ring attachment on it so I just
usually take my pencil pouch and put it
on these they ring has five dividers two
of them are like this and the other
three are kind of just like hard core
paper protectors it also includes
graphic paper and just regular lined
paper so that is this binder so the nice
thing that I got that is definitely a
back-to-school essential is this
expanding file this one's the 13 pocket
five star one and you guys might figure
out by now that I kind of like pink so I
keep these expanding files for passed
back work so I put a ton of work all the
work that I get back in these files um
if you want to do the same thing
and I don't talk about it more in my
organization video but if you guys are
looking to do the same thing you don't
really have to worry about the number of
pockets it has the most important thing
to look at is the width of the expanding
file so this is not that big so it might
not actually hold all the homework that
I'll have passed back for the entire
year but I'm also planning on possibly
graduating early so it'll probably hold
all my homework for the semester also
another essential is a planner and a
notebook but I have not been able to
find a notebook with paper that I
actually like because there's some paper
that I just hate like when you write on
it it comes off like on the side of your
hand so for the planner that I got last
year I really liked it but they always
change it up a little bit each year so I
didn't really like the version of the
planner that I got this year so I'm
gonna look for another one but those two
things are definitely important and
essentials for me and then all the rest
of the things that I'm going to show you
are just my favorite types of like
pencils erasers and some cheap things
that I found so the first thing that I
will show you guys are these pencils
these are the Paper Mate pencils and I
feel like a lot of people have these
these are probably the best pencils that
I have found so far on the market and I
really like how it comes with extra lead
because that is actually really
important to have once you run out of
lead and if you have these pencils
they'll last you the entire year like I
know that I have had these pencils and I
don't have to get pencils at all for the
rest the year unless they break or
something and for erasers um I really
like these type of erasers I don't like
the erasers I don't really you like
using me ratios that go back here just
because they kind of don't erase that
much and you can get a lot harder with
your erasing if you have these things
and then I also found these while I was
shopping so I definitely want to try out
these these are retractable so they kind
of if you push too hard or they get a
little bit old they'll start just
retracting on their own so these look a
little bit more promising so I wanted to
try these out
these are Paper Mate so I really like
the brand Paper Mate and then I also got
this USB flash drive at home
Depot or Office Depot and it was really
cool because they had a bunch of these
on their like sales section right before
you get to the cashier and this was like
the only one that was in me a dollar
been four in a gigabyte thing but it was
actually misplaced but they gave me the
$8 price anyway so it was like $15 but
they gave it to me for $8 so this is
adorable and I got this because I have
USB sticks like at home but sometimes I
find that when I bring my computer to
school which is kind of often a lot of
my friends also bring their computers to
school and they have either like
pictures that they have of us or they
have music that they want to give me and
I never actually have a USB flash drive
so I'm definitely keeping this in my
school bag for those occasions cuz it's
actually pretty handy to have one around
so the next thing that I got are these
post-its and I really like these ones
because you can write on them I find
myself using these a lot something that
I use them for that seems really obvious
that actually not a lot of people do is
as a bookmark so if you're on chapter 15
of your textbook at school you just mark
the page of the chapter 15 and then you
can flip right to it every single day I
did that in one of my classes last year
and everyone thought it was like so
clever and I was like this is probably
the most obvious thing but I will take
credit for you I also find it's helpful
for if you are doing an English
assignment and for example you have to
find like themes in a book you can use
the different colors for a different
theme so I like these because they come
in different colors but you can also
write on them and these were six dollars
at Target but they were like eight
dollars at Home Depot or Office Depot so
again look around and then I got these
index cards at Office Depot for 25 cents
so that was a really good deal um I
really like index cards and I like the
smaller ones because they waste the
least amount of paper so I usually use
my index cards as flashcards so what
I'll do is I'll just cut these guys in
half because you don't really need the
whole thing for just one flashcard so my
favorite pens have to be these g2 old
roller gel roller pens and I
like how they also come in different
colors because I like color coding
things I've tried the fancy like you
know ball pens and stuff they're not
actually fancy I don't know I said fancy
but I found that these gel pens are a
lot better and faster just a lot easier
to write faster with they don't blade
through like the Sharpie fine point pens
and yeah I just like these oh and then I
just picked up this little Vaseline lip
therapy at Target but this was $2.00 at
Target and it is just adorable so
keeping that in my school bag so yeah
those are basically all of my
back-to-school essentials that I have
found work best for me over the years so

tips video that's coming up as my next
video because I feel like I have a
really good system that really works for
me so if you guys are looking for tips
