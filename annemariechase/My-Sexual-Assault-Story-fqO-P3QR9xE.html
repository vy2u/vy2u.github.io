type of video that I've ever posted on
my channel I made channel before as you
guys can probably tell from the title
this is more serious topic so there's a
lot of like shit happening in the world
right now at first I was really
disturbed by the brock turner case if
you don't know what that is it's
basically a stanford swimmer who
sexually assaulted a girl and she made
public her letter the argument is kind
of just that he did this really really
really creepy thing he sexually
assaulted this girl when she was
unconscious behind a dumpster and his
argument is that he was just really
drunk and he thinks that he can kind of
make it all right by just doing some
alcohol awareness where the real
argument is that he sexually assaulted
this girl it doesn't matter if he's
drunk it's never okay to do that I've
read about that for the first time like
two weeks ago and then the Christina
Grimmie incident and then the mass
shooting in Orlando usually my channel
is a place where I like to be super
upbeat and positive but to be honest
there is a lot of like bad stuff in the
world so I decided to make this video
just so that if one person watches it
and it can help one person then it'll be
a thousand percent worth it to me when I
first kind of um read the Brock Turner
case I like didn't even think about it
or connect it to my own life until I
read the victim is the older sister and
her sister was there and her sister
places a lot of blame on herself this
happened and she kind of took it as her
own fault and I have a sister Callie and
I really resonated with her sister
because if this happened to my sister I
would totally be in the same position
but yeah so this happened a really long
time ago and not something that
I think really affects me today but as I
sat down to film this video I was like
kind of nervous usually by the time I
like start talking about the camera a
little bit it's like it's all good but
it's still like a little bit but I kind
of wrote down a little bit of an outline
that I want to make sure I cover just
because this is like a really sensitive
topic and I just want to be like as
transparent and clear as possible with
all the points that I want to make okay
so there are a lot of like important
messages but basically I'll just skip a
brief like backstory of my story and how
I was sexually assaulted and it wasn't
just me it was also my sister this is
really hard to tell on camera okay um I
honestly don't remember a lot from this
time period of my life because I was
really young I think I brought it up
with my sister like years later I think
sometime when we were in high school or
something so we've talked about it but
it's not like a common conversation that
we've had in our household at all but I
distinctly remember like basically the
entire thing that happened so I was
probably like four or five and our
cousins were over and these cousins at
the time are a lot older than us I think
I'm just gonna say like seven years
older than us so me and Callie are 16
months apart so I was probably four or
five I don't really know it could be a
little bit older my parents were gone
for some reason and the deal was that
like our aunt was babysitting us with
her kids so there she was like
house-sitting / babysitting so I think
we had built a fort or something in our
living room area and we all decided to
just kind of sleep there not sure if it
was our idea or their idea or what but
we decided to sleep there so I was
sleeping on a couch and then my sister
was on the same couch and I think I was
asleep and all of a sudden I kind of
feel someone touching my legs like
they're kind of nearing my thighs and I
just remember I woke up from this
and I just pretended to be asleep like I
was kind of just in shock as a
five-year-old and I wasn't gonna say
anything but I knew that I felt really
uncomfortable with what was happening I
knew this wasn't something that was
supposed to be happening my parents did
a really good job when I was growing up
teaching me to be very cautious of the
world outside and of like creepy people
and at a very early age so I knew this
was something that like wasn't supposed
to be going on there were two cousins
both boys at least seven years older
than us and I think the older one of the
two was touching my thighs and he kind
of goes up my legs until he gets to you
know like my private areas I don't know
how like PG I want to keep this out I
don't think this is a PG topic anyway so
I don't know so he you know he's very
slow and I don't really know what he's
trying to do out of this or what his end
goal was but he's very very slow and
careful I think maybe he's like not
trying to wake me up but I'm definitely
awake and I just remember that he did
end up going past my underwear and
touching me like in the vagina that's
like I don't really know how else to say
it so he was definitely in an area that
he wasn't supposed to be and he did
touch me and Callie was also awake I
think I talked to her like years years
after and she said that um our other
cousin the younger one didn't end up
actually like touching her but he was on
his way there she gets up and she wakes
me up and she's like Amory I think we
should go sleep upstairs and so we go
upstairs in my room and sleep there for
the rest of night and we're like
completely safe there they don't follow
us or anything like we spent the rest of
the night sleeping together in my
bedroom upstairs and that's pretty much
the end of the story but the thing that
was so weird to me that I think about
now I just remember that
when we did end up telling our parents
about this situation pally brought it up
she started telling them what happened I
was a five-year-old I had no life
experience to know that this was like a
super uncomfortable topic to talk about
but I just remember that I was really
uncomfortable and I kind of just like
uncomfortably laughed and like you know
hid my face really shy like I feel
extremely safe around my parents like
they've always encouraged me to be
really open and honest with them or just
you know protect me in any sort of way
like they're amazing parents in that way
but I just I wouldn't have told them and
I don't even know why first of all if
Kali wasn't there like when it was
happening like I have no idea how far it
would have gone or like what my cousin's
motives were or what would have happened
that night or anything like that I have
no idea
and then if Kali hadn't told my parents
I can probably say was like a hundred
percent confidence that I don't think
that I would have told them if that says
something about this topic or just like
discomfort or just sexual assault or
even rape in general is that it's not
like a comfortable thing to talk about
but it should be talked about which is
why I'm making this video to kind of
come out and talk about the topic so
that it's not such a not talked about
thing like in order for people to be
comfortable talking about it I think
that people need to know that it's okay
to talk about it and tell someone if
this is something that has happened to
you or has happened to or is happening
to you you know you can tell someone now
I'm gonna go into like the things that I
think I'm gonna probably get questions
on or the topics that I like need to
derive from this topic I think that it
didn't really have extremely long term
effects on me
I don't like think about this a lot
clearly like it was a scarring event in
my life because I still remember it so
much longer and I will never forget it
but something that it did do to me is
that it made me super cautious of
avoiding uncomfortable situations I feel
like everyone
has gotten their self into a situation
like whether it be like a party or with
a person or just anything like that
where they're just kind of uncomfortable
I will either leave or speak up and I am
very assertive about it and I have no
problem hurting anyone's feelings just
having this situation happen to me and
if it ever happened again if it's like
under my control if it's under my power
to avoid these situations I'm definitely
gonna do it because it would just be
stupid of me to not I'm definitely not
saying that like oh I of what these
situations and victims are always at
fault because that's definitely not the
case there are situations where the
victim can't leave in the case of like
Brock Turner his victim learned about
this in the aftermath of it happening
because she was so intoxicated that she
didn't remember any of this happening I
have no probably being a situation like
that but I really don't think that a lot
of girls can say the same you just never
know
like what kind of state or emotional
state you'll be in a lot of girls in
these situations kind of just freeze up
or you know think that they're the bad
person just this year I've heard of so
many accounts of sexual assault and even
rape but the descriptions of these
stories are kind of told like in a
joking way I think a lot of it has to
contribute to just the environment that
my school USC like Greek life has an
example of this that I've heard is like
a mid tier sorority girls like kind of
with a guy in a top house to me these
have like I don't give a shit about
sorority and fraternity rankings because
they are based off of purely
materialistic just really stupid
arbitrary things that shouldn't matter
when you're judging a person people's
characters and their accomplishments and
their you know their niceness should be
the most important factors but she
thinks that since this guy is paying
attention to her or you know talking to
her that she that she should feel lucky
in some way that he's giving her
attention or that he even wants to you
know talk to her or hook up with her
that she should be
like flattered to me this makes
absolutely no sense at all in my head so
I don't relate to this whatsoever like
this makes me like I get heated whenever
I talk about it but like this is a
mindset for some girls like for a lot of
girls like at USC ting this is a huge
problem and so if he wants tuck up and
she is by her status lower than him he
has the authority to do what he wants
and she doesn't want to ruin her
reputation or ruin her sororities
reputation so she kind of just lets it
happen then when she tells the story she
tells it as kind of humorous thing which
it is so backwards to me it takes away
from the seriousness of what sexual
assault is and what rape is these are
both very real things that happen and
have a huge impact if you don't take it
seriously it's not only doing an
injustice to yourself as a victim but to
other people and other girls as well and
to the person who did it if you're
letting a guy to this and there is no
consequence then he thinks it's okay
basically what I wanted to say with that
story is that this is a lot a lot more
common than I think people think it is
the advice that I want to give girls who
are either going through something like
this now or who might have to deal with
this in the future is to be aware of
these things and know that they are
things that happen especially like on
college campuses be aware take it
seriously speak up if something like
this is happening to you don't be scared
to speak up leave the situation if
you're ever feeling uncomfortable and
another thing is do your friends a favor
and help them become aware of this as
well in high school I was definitely
seen in multiple situations as like a
cock-block or like a bitch because I was
the one who pulled my friends aside and
was like I'm not sure if this is
something that you want to be doing
especially if they're at a party and
they're drinking like their judgment is
impaired be the person be that friend
who is willing to do that for your
friends that's the right thing to do and
if something does happen you have a
clear conscience and that you know you
tried
never had a problem with looking like a
bitch or you know someone like a
cock-block just because I know that I'm
doing the right thing the right thing
that my gut is telling me to do and the
thing that I would want someone one of
my friends to do for me
it might suck for like that night or the
time where you're kind of pulling your
friend aside I can guarantee you that
the guys the guy's friends who think
you're a cock block
they won't matter if they have that
opinion of you they're not people that
you want to be associated with in the
first place and they're not people who
are going to matter in your life later
but for my experience the people who are
like this in my life in high school have
zero importance zero impact in the world
in my opinion while I'm trying to be a
good friend a good person and trying to
do something you know with my life and
trying to make an impact look out for
your friends tell them to look out for
you public code words develop a strategy
a game plan and if you ever see a girl
that you don't even know in a situation
where it looks bad reach out to her and
ask her she's okay or if she wants to
hang out with you or go home if everyone
did this the world would be so much more
of a better place so do me a favor and
please like develop that system with
your friends I feel like I've been
addressing this very much to girls I
start any guys watching this video at
this point I'm very impressed and I
applaud you for you know just watching a
video on this topic so let me know if
you are a guy watching this video and I
feel like this is gonna be probably the
most controversial part of this video
because I don't really know how to say
this in like a super politically correct
way I'm just gonna say it how I see it
and if you want to fight me on it like
feel free if a girl claims that you've
sexually assaulted her or raped her 99%
of the time
people are going to believe the girl if
she claims that you've like sexually
assaulted her and you had nothing to do
with her but you were with her the fault
is like potentially percent on you
regardless of what really happened
because no one was in the room with you
guys no one knows except for you two or
one of you or none of you if there's
like alcohol involved it doesn't matter
if it happened or not if you're accused
of that that's going to stain your
reputation in some way shape or form and
you never want to have that sort of
reputation behind your name guys be
careful who you interact with who you
hook up with who you're involved with
because you never know how they are they
might seem normal at first based on a
first impression the worst type of
person is a person who you think is cool
at first and then the more you get to
know them the more you hate them there's
so many people like that though some
girls are crazy and I just want to look
out for the guys out there who are
perfectly good human beings first of all
obviously be a good human being but
second of all just be cautious because
there are girls who would you know I
don't know what their motives are but
they would rather stay in your
reputation than theirs or they just have
no idea and they are gonna blame you I
have no idea
that is probably the most controversial
controversial topic that um is in this
video and I'm expecting to see some hate
comments so that is what this video is
I'm just trying to speak out and to let
people know that they should take this
topic seriously they should be cautious
they should just have an awareness about
this and in my situation it was not even
anything related to college so I don't
really know how it shifted to that but
you can do something about it and even
if you can't at the time um you need to
speak up and get help for it my mom
always tells me to ask for help because
I'm pretty bad at that but people do
need to ask for help that's why you have
family and friends so that they can help
you and you can help them and you can
feel safe I'm like whispering at this
point so I'm gonna go now I hope this
video was helpful to one person I'll try
to like lighten the mood a little bit in
my next video so thank you so much for
watching and I will talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
