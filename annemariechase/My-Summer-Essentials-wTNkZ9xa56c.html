you make me feel
you're going to be showing you all my
summer essentials and these items are
all like little puzzle pieces that would
fit together make the perfect summer so
the first thing is a daily moisturizer
with sunscreen this one is the Avena one
it hasn't SPF of 30 so many people do
not put on sunscreen and you're just
like you're gonna look so old when
you're older it is so easy it's already
put in here so just go out and get this
then you can have protected skin for the
rest of the day next thing is bare
minerals um original foundation this is
a light foundation with natural-looking
coverage and its really mattifying for
oily skin like me the next thing is a
matte highlighter I talk about this all
the time this is the one in pearl frost
sometimes I go out with just foundation
and this highlighter and it is the
perfect blowie summertime look this lip
balm jack black I also talked about soul
time but this has an SPF of 25 so this
is the best lip balm with really good
coverage so my last beauty product is
this country chic creamy body wash from
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works this smells like
summertime and it's just really
luxurious to put on in a shower and it
just leaves your skin smelling so good
so it's like summer in a bottle um I
feel like in the summer I have a lot
more preferences with drinks because
during a school year it's usually just
like coffee and then water and then
coffee water coffee water so it's our
time I really really love CBS this one
is by far my favorite is the grave
stevia it is made with stevia so there's
no sugar and no artificial sweeteners
this is the ginger root beer and this is
Callie's favourite and these are super
refreshing and great for summertime so
the next beverage that I find really
refreshing nur in the summertime are
these starbucks refreshers they're
basically the same thing that starbucks
serves except you just make it at home
there they have in packets and they're
really good my favorite is the
strawberry lemonade one and the lime
this is definitely a perfect and
refreshing alternative to coffee in the
morning they have white coffee bean
extract which I've never heard of but
apparently it's a thing because
starbucks says so so when you're used to
a school like routine or you just drink
coffee coffee coffee every morning it's
like hard to get out of that caffeine
routine or like
the caffeine habit so another a good
alternative to the coffee is green tea
this is my favorite tea like ever I
don't know why it's so plain and simple
this is a great team with brown rice and
it's so good yeah this is my favorite I
also really like T's too just like kind
of wind down the day or just to drink
while I'm like reading or editing a
video or watching TV so these are really
good ones for the night time this is the
peppermint herbal tea so it's caffeine
free and then this is the sleepy time
bearable caffeine free tea so in the
summer time you're on the go a lot
you're like going to work going to hike
blah blah blah and the worst thing is
when there's like hot sunshine rails
like shining down on your plastic water
bottle then you take a drink of your
warm water it tastes like plastic so I
definitely use glass water bottles and
also I don't know this made out of but
deal you get it this is a hydro flask
and the cool thing about Hydra flasks is
that they're expensive that's not the
google thing but they're kind of
expensive um oh it but the cool thing
cool thing about hydro flask is that
they keep warm water hot or hot water
hot and then cold water cold and the
like awesome thing too is that the
surface of this like the around like if
you're grabbing this it doesn't feel hot
or cold when you put hot or cold water
in it so that's pretty crazy this one I
think it just looks cool it's not really
like functional but looks cool and cute
and I really like these ones these are
the live factory they have a bunch of
different colors and sizes and I also
have two more one with a straw that's
really nice and otherwise these are just
really good and you never have that
plasticky um taste it always just tastes
like water from that like freshly poured
plastic has like some BPA or something
in it something like that I'm real smart
um so it's better for you in a long run
too so I also have stainless steel
straws to go with my glass bottles and
stainless steel bottles and these are
also just better for straws and you can
use them over and over again so the
summertime you're not running like off
of a really strict schedule and
everything is just spontaneous
so these next things are just things
that I like to keep with me at all times
so the first thing are my sunglasses and
these are Ray Bans so they're girl
really stupid right now ray bans are
kind of expensive but they're really
worth it because you're basically
investing in a lifetime pair of
sunglasses if you break them they have a
lifetime warranty so they will replace
them and this sounds like a riggman ad
but they also have like a hundred
percent UV ray protection which is
pretty important for those UV rays the
next thing and probably like my favorite
thing to keep my purse is my camera I
have the powershot s110 camera and this
is just really perfect for me because I
like to vlog and whenever I'm like
vlogging experiences just really easy to
pull out its light weight and it's small
I have this in my purse at all times and
it also takes really really good
pictures so I actually take a lot of my
Instagram pictures that you see on my
Instagram with this camera you guys want
to follow me on instagram so the
summertime I'm out later and I'm out
more in general and I just generally
find that I have less and less battery
in my phone so one thing that was really
a good purchase is this power I don't
know this is basically just an external
charger for your phone what you do is
you charge this thing and then you turn
it on connect it to your phone and then
it'll charge your phone and it's just
really small and portable and perfect
for charging your phone on the go this
summer I made myself a deal after I
watched the first two seasons of gossip
girl that I would not watch any more
netflix and unless I was exercising like
on a treadmill or stepmill and so I have
been doing a lot more reading the books
that I read so far like this summer are
the fault in our stars like everyone
else and their grandma and then I've
also read the power of habit which is a
really interesting book so I basically
been leaning towards more nonfiction
rather than fiction so right now I'm
like reading some other books that I
just started someone on the title but
reading has been really nice and it's
just something that I never do during
this girl at school year because I'm
either doing my homework or like hanging
out with friends there's basically just
no time to read but now there is so get
readin I got this cool journal for my
got one of my graduation presents
and it's just been a really nice to like
have a place where i can actually jot
down ideas and it's a lot more helpful
than I whatever think that a journal
would be so this has been really nice
for the summer time too so another thing
that I do is I actually keep a summer
journal that i actually type in every
single day I just put the date and then
underneath I'll include like everything
that I did for that date and it's not
just like I went hiking and then I went
to this new restaurant it's like all the
feelings that are associated with it and
just like important events in my life at
that time of day or whatever so space of
it just like a diary and it seems really
pointless while you're actually like
typing it like today I'll be like why am
I doing this but it's really cool when
you look back like it a year passed or
like two years past sometimes I'll be
with like Callie and I'll be like hey I
want to see what we were doing last year
and then we can see exactly what we did
and like the people that we were hanging
out with you just basically see like
friendships and like your current
friendships or friendships developing at
the time and it's just really
fascinating so i don't know i recommend
doing it in the summertime because you
have a lot more time and it's just
really fun to look back on so my first
shoe essentials are my tory burch
flip-flops and then the second are these
sam edelman sandals so I it's kind of
obvious but I got like two completely
different colors because I didn't want
to keep buying like different flip-flops
these two colors like very opposite
colors go with everything and I'd never
feel like I like don't have an option to
wear for sandals my clothing summer
essentials are kimonos so I love these
kimonos because they're really sheer and
they're just a really good thing for
Larry I feel more comfortable when I
layer like with a kimono then just like
wearing like a tank top or something and
they're just really pretty like kind of
accessories to wear ok so those are all
of my summer essentials and all the
things i'll be using religiously this
summer i hope you guys enjoyed this
video and i'll talk to you guys later
