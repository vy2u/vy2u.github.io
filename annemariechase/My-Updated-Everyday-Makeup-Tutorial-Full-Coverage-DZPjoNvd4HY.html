full-coverage natural everyday makeup
look and I know that's really
paradoxical but I just love this look
for when I'm breaking out or when I'm
not feeling very confident with my skin
so the first thing that I do is prime my
face using this Porefessional by benefit
and I only use this on and a little bit
around my nose where my pores are
biggest next I usually do your
foundation and the foundation that I've
been using is this Revlon Colorstay and
I really love it because it's wonderful
giving you that natural look but also
really buildable so if you want a fuller
coverage which is like exactly what I
wanted for this video you can get a
fuller coverage so I usually just apply
this with my Real Techniques brush in
circular motions after I apply it on and
I'm always sure to take this down to my
neck and chin especially when you're
aiming for fuller coverage that line if
you don't blend it out to your neck and
chin it's really really obvious and yes
that is a PJ top because I was actually
going to make this a part of my morning
routine but then I ran out of time
before I went to Hawaii so I'm gonna
film that later
for concealer lately I've been using
this Mac Pro Longwear concealer for my
forehead because usually I have acne and
imperfections around my forehead and
this color I think is a little bit too
light for my forehead so what I'll do is
I'll just apply it and it works really
nicely for those acne spots and red
areas on my forehead so I'll apply it
and then blend it out with my finger and
then my brush and then I'll go over with
my foundation brush to blend it out even
more just to make sure that it matches
the rest of my skin color and this
concealer doesn't work very well for the
redness around my nose so for that I've
been using my Maybelline fit me
concealer and I've been doing this for
like a year now so that works really
well and then I will just blend that out
with a brush as well
so moving on to under-eye concealing
this seems like a lot but it is full
coverage makeup so I usually use my
instant age rewind eraser for dark spots
I do not think that this was the one
that I wanted but it works really well
for under-eye concealing anyways and
this is really easy to blend out with
your fingers so it looks very natural
and it's not cakey at all and then I
will go in and highlight with my Mac
pearl frost cream color base this is
such a natural looking highlighter I've
never had a more natural and more
beautiful highlighter ever I absolutely
love this highlighter and I will apply
this to highlight my cheekbones as well
as my brow bones and my Cupid's bow next
I will set all of this makeup with my
pressed powder from covergirl that I've
been using forever and I will only apply
this in my t-zone because I have
combination skin and the other parts of
my face don't really need it and then
I've been really liking this blush by
NARS
it's called Dulce Vita and it is a very
natural color for my skin tone
personally and I'm not really used to
putting on blush so I just made sure to
blend it out really well with a clean
brush after I applied it on the apples
of my cheeks and yeah I just blended it
out so in terms of eye makeup I usually
just use my Mac Paint Pot and bear study
because this is pretty natural I mean
there is shimmer but in terms of like
makeup it's pretty natural and really
simple and for an inner corner highlight
I used Mac's
shroom and I just put this in the inner
corners of my eyes and kind of along my
lower lash line to make my eyes appear
more awake next I used the Too Faced
natural eye palette and the color Velvet
Revolver which is kind of a taupe ish
color in order to define and emphasize
my crease to make my eyes look a little
bit more dimensional and then I also
applied this color to my lower third of
my lash line if you're going for a
natural eyeliner look to make your
eyelashes appear fuller then I think
smudge Abell like soft Kohl eyeliner
pencils are the best way to go because
you just blend them out with your
fingers and it doesn't even look like
you're wearing eyeliner
so I think that's one of the easiest and
most natural looking ways to apply
eyeliner and I'm using this pencil
eyeliner from makeup forever and I
actually got this from that's a for a
birthday set thing that they give to
their people and I actually really
really really like it and then I'm just
curling my lashes and using my they're
real mascara from benefit even if I'm
doing a natural look I usually don't
mind if my eyelashes are crazy and big
and bold but if you want to skip this
step go ahead because this mascara makes
your eyelashes look really full and
false yeah so after that I usually just
brush out the natural shape of my
eyebrows to make sure that it is all
good for when I apply this honest hacia
brow gel and I don't really know if I'm
saying that right I probably am not so
this is a really good brow gel for just
keeping your eyebrows exactly in place
which is like a problem if you have big
eyebrows like me this is me like drying
it off in me faces in the mirror and
then I just you my typical eyebrow
routine which is just using my Too Faced
brow and be kicked and filling in my
eyebrows so that is what I am just doing
and then for my lips I'm just using my
favorite Jack black lip balm and mint
because I love this stuff and that is
the entire makeup look so if you enjoyed
this video please give it a thumbs up
and subscribe to my channel for more
videos from me and my next video is
gonna be my giveaway winner announcement
I mean it's gonna be a different video
but I'll include it so look out for that

out my vlogs that I did from Hawaii I
still have one more that's gonna be
