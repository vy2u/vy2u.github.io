a great winter break so today I have a
me receive tutorial and whenever I think
about New Year's Eve makeup I always
think about like glam and glitter so I
really wanted to incorporate glitter
into my makeup look so I have this
glittery eye as you guys can see and
it's also really versatile for lips so
right now I'm wearing like this kind of
peachy top and then I just did a really
neutral lip to make sure that it looked
good together but you can also wear this
with red if you have like a black dress
or basically any other lip color so
that's what I really like about this
look it's really simple to do and it's
relatively cheap makeup so I tried to
make it as affordable as possible so I
hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial I'm
gonna start off this tutorial by saying
that my nail polish is from butter
london and me color fairy cake it
matches my eyes and its really adorable
so that is what my nail polish is and
then starting with a bare face i'm going
straight into priming eyes you don't
want to do your foundation or concealer
before you do your eye makeup because
you will probably get fallout so I'm
just priming my eyes with this Urban
Decay primer potion and I'm using the
Sigma P 82 brush to blend all of the
primer out next time setting the base
for the glare that I'm applying and I'm
using this color tattoo eyeshadow and
barely branded which is actually kind of
pinkish but you can really use anything
with white silver or gray undertones
this is basically just a foundation for
the glitter you'll be applying then i'm
using this middle color from this pop UD
palette that I got my Ipsy bag into my
crease to prevent any harsh lines for
the darker colors that I'll be using so
the file eyeshadow that I'm using is
from the Naked 3 palette which I've
pretty much been using every single day
I definitely got four of these this
holiday for gifts and for myself but
that is beside the point i'm using the
darkest color in this palette called
black hearts in the outer v of my eye
you can use a black eyeshadow or just
the darkest eyeshadow that you have and
the trick here is to blend the eyeshadow
to get a smooth looking smokey eye
foundation for the glitter that will be
applying ok so now it's time to apply
the glitter which is my absolute
favorite part
I got this glitter set at Sephora for
sixteen dollars and I don't want to say
that's cheap but then again it is makeup
and it's pretty inexpensive compared to
a lot of things at Sephora and it makes
this step super super easy all you have
to do is apply the glitter liner either
onto your finger or directly on your
eyelid and then Pat around the area that
you applied it to in order to blend it
in i'm using the silver glitter on the
first tab of my eyelid and then the gold
glitter on the middle third in order to
create a gradient between the colors ok
so the outer V is the best step about
this entire tutorial because it is so
darn easy all you have to do is apply
the black glitter in two lines in the
outer V and then blend it out with your
fingers so you can see that the liner is
what creates the black pigment of the
look and the eyeshadow was just a
foundation for that so it's basically
just really really easy and then I'm
going back and adding more ladder to the
outer V on both eyes to darken up the
look and to try to make them look as
identical as possible i'm using the
shade strange in the naked 3 palette to
highlight and accentuate my brow bone
and then i'm just going to use some
false lashes because this look is super
wearable but it's also pretty bold and I
thought lashes will be the perfect
addition these are just some random kind
of cheap lashes that I've been reusing I
don't really know the brand but you can
just pick you know the most natural
looking lashes that you have to make
this a little bit more wearable or you
can go all out and crazy on these then
I'm highlighting the inner corner and
first third of my lower lash line with
this soft coal Rimmel white eyeliner
pencil and then I'm setting that
eyeliner with the same white that i use
to highlight my brow bone now i'm using
the shade called dark side and the naked
3 palette in the outer third of my lower
lash line in order to kind of complete
the entire look and if you want to make
this look more dramatic you can just
create a deeper and darker crease and
out
me and also bring the look upwards
instead of just pretty much keeping it
on the eyelid like I did and then in
order to blend out or blend in the
fullest lashes I'm just using this gel
liner that i got from Korea and I'm just
creating a very small thin line but you
can also make this line the thicker in
order to dramatize look more and finally
I'm curling my lashes and using this NYC
big bold I don't really know what the
name is called mascara which has been my
absolute favorite mascara lately because
it makes it look like you're wearing
false lashes when you're really just
adding this mascara and then i'm using
my clinic lower lash line mascara too
dark in my lower lashes and that's all
for the eye makeup and then i'm going to
fill in my eyebrows with this to face
and be broke it
like I predicted i had fall out with a
glitter all over my face so first i just
took this cotton pad and tried wiping
most of it away and for the little
stubborn pieces I took some tape and
then kind of like stuck it off that
makes sense that way pinky promise touch
them don't know make you suffer and I'll
ask in return is some reciprocation I'll
be oxygen when you run and adaptation so
ticket alright so moving on to face
makeup i'm using my favorite foundation
which is this Revlon 24-hour colorstay
which is the perfect blasting foundation
for a long New Year's Eve night and then
I'm just going to keep building this
foundation until I get the perfect
amount of coverage next i'm using the
maybelline fit me concealer to cover any
redness around my nose and any pimples
to get rid of the dark circles
underneath my eyes I'm using this
benefit fake up concealer which I
absolutely love for dark circle
concealing and then I'm setting that
concealer with the press powder and I
decided that since I wanted a lasting
coverage with my foundation I'm going to
use my bare minerals foundation in order
to set my makeup especially in the
t-zone or my face tends to be more oily
and I think this gives you a lot better
of coverage and sets the makeup better
than just using your normal pressed
powder so now I'm using this to face
candlelight glow duo and i'm using the
white shade to highlight my cheekbones
and i'm just doing this in an incomplete
C shape above my cheekbones for my lips
I'm using this really fancy dior sticks
at my friend grace from my last video
left at my house and I think it is in
the color Rouge serum or its number 455
it's basically just a really natural
looking pink so thank you to grace we're
leaving that at my house and over that
I'm wearing the philosophy lip gloss and
the name is like sugar sprinkles funnel
cake or something so that's what that's
called and I think this duo is really
pretty together and then for blush I'm
using this via bombshell stick that came
in my Ipsy bag I'm not affiliated with
FC and anyway I just really liked their
bag last month
and then of course the last step is to
set all the makeup with this Urban Decay
setting spray to ensure that it'll last
all night long alright so that is you
completed makeup look I hope you guys
