starting with my prom series with the
first video and it's going to be a
preparation tips for prom I think is
what I called it as you guys can see
like I created my little intro I was
actually asked to prom with like a
little puzzle and I cut him into four
pieces after I recreated my intro but
they were in balloons so they had to fit
in balloons and so they were cut into
like tiny tiny little pieces I'm not
sure if you guys can tell but it was
hard it took us 40 minutes to reassemble
all the letters but it was really fun
I've organized all of my tips in
categories so I'm gonna start off with a
dress
your prom dress is going to be the
centerpiece of everything prom related
in terms of your makeup and what your
date is going to wear and your shoes and
your nails and all that stuff I think
that you should probably try to get your
prom dress at least a month in advance
for me and my friends we all I think
ordered from out of state have to do
that well in advance first of all
because of shipping and you also have to
make sure that you like it and in case
you don't like it you have to give
yourself enough time to get another
dress then after that you also have to
think about altering your dress if it
doesn't fit you perfectly so when you're
picking out a prom dress something to
keep in mind money-wise is that you will
have to alter it if it doesn't fit you
like a lot of dresses are way way too
long for girls when I got my prom dress
last year I had to pay like $40 to alter
it and my sister had to pay like $60 or
something ridiculous
okay so now I have some hair tips I
would recommend like up to a month or so
in advance to like get on Pinterest or
Instagram and just go through really
fancy or cute updos or go through like
someone's YouTube channel who
specializes in hairdos and just kind of
see what a hairstyle you want if you're
doing it yourself or even if you're
getting it done in the salon because
then you can show them a picture of it
after you pick out what kind of
hairstyle you want you should practice
it a lot to make sure that you know how
to do it and you know how it'll turn out
the day of prom if you're not going to
do your own hair and this is something
that I'm like totally behind on you
should make appointments well in advance
because they get overbooked really fast
for special events like this I don't
think I'm doing my own hair and I still
have not looked my hair appointment and
my proms next week so it's just like
something to think about there are a lot
of different things to think about that
you just kind of forget in terms of like
other hair if you want umm I would
personally recommend like waxing or
bleaching up to three days don't do it
the night before um whenever I wax my
eyebrows I break out and it doesn't look
like I have broken out from waxing it
just looks like I have like some extra
acne it goes away after like five days
or so so I know my skin and I know that
I cannot wax like a day before a big
event where I don't want to have like a
bunch of acne and freak out um but
that's like one of the best ways for me
to get my eyebrows done I would
recommend waxing and bleaching about
three days before so that you don't have
breakouts and you don't have redness and
especially if it's your first time you
should just make sure that your skin has
time to recover something that it's
really easy to do that I would highly
recommend instead of going out to a
salon and paying a bunch of money for
waxing and tipping would be to get like
a Sally Hansen bleaching kit like the
little peach fuzz is here that doesn't
need to be waxed all the time it can be
really expensive to do that it lasts a
little bit longer but I think bleaching
also works really well like I don't
often have to do it because mine's not
that bad but it does last for like up to
two weeks like I did mine two weeks ago
and I'm like good to go so I would
recommend bleaching instead of waxing
and also you can do bleaching for your
eyebrow
was in like around here where your hair
is like kind of prominent and that works
just as well in my opinion
so for makeup just like hair you should
definitely practice the look that you're
wanting to wear on prom date well in
advance before then I mean I'm always on
like Instagram I follow a lot of makeup
accounts and I just scroll through and
like and like screenshot all the
pictures that I want to recreate for
prom so just having like some
inspiration and some practice before
prom day and doing your own prom makeup
can really help it's a lot harder to
improvise
prom day makeup especially since you're
not used to doing it every single day it
is a lot easier to practice dramatic
makeup looks beforehand so that you're
not looking crazy like a raccoon or
something
on prom day if you're going to makeup
artist at some counter and having them
do your makeup be sure to have a plan B
if you don't like their makeup my sister
absolutely hated her makeup she went to
Bobby Brown and the makeup artist a
terrible job and this was her prom date
and she was like in a panic so she came
home and I like tried to fix up her
makeup and she was happy after that but
just be sure that you have enough time
and a plan B just in case you don't like
your makeup and that also goes for your
hair
so I recommend if you're trying to save
money to just get a group of girls go to
someone's house the night before and
just do each other's nails and also
using the nail stickers they have really
cool designs and you stick them on your
nail and then file them down if they
have solid colors and patterns and all
those different kinds of things so
that's something you should check out if
you want your nails to look like you had
them done but you don't want to spend
the money
so I'm going to talk about like some
skin issues this is kind of a long-term
thing that you should be looking out for
weeks in advance but drinking water
really helps to flush out your system
and try to give yourself some radiant
moisturized skin so a few days before or
like a week before just start drinking
tons and tons of water and this will
also help you I mean I know this is like
always a concern for girls if you're
trying to diet do that last-minute
dieting for prom this will help you stay
fuller longer and something that I love
drinking is green tea with brown rice
like from Costco that is the best stuff
and that just gives you a lot of water
and fluids in your system and you'll
feel fuller I'm not sure if you guys
have heard this tip but if you drink a
glass of water before every meal that
makes you feel so much fuller and for me
every single time I do that I eat way
less so if you guys haven't tried that
tip out you should try it out let me
know how it works for you but that is
like a major tip that I have for keeping
your skin healthy and good and also I
mean avoiding junk food that really
affects my skin like greasy foods and
junk foods just try to eat clean and
natural food I would not recommend
getting a spray tan if you're not used
to getting spray tans if you're not used
to getting spray tans you can turn out
looking really orange and then you have
to match your makeup to this new spray
tan so it's just like a lot harder to
work around a spray tan rather than just
um not tanning or just doing like a
gradual like fake and bake even though
that's not good for your skin it's
sometimes a lot easier to just avoid
tanning in general
so in terms of trying to stay in shape
and looking good in your dress I would
recommend doing ab and arm toning some
people might just be like it's kind of
too late for getting in shape but if you
still have like a month or so or like
even a week you can make a difference in
your body I remember I started doing
like p90x in the summertime like two
years ago I'm not super toned at all
like I work out but I I like don't do
like weights and stuff or I didn't I do
more often now but I like was not toned
at all at this point just one week of
doing p90x like every single day I
noticed a huge difference in my ABS and
in my arms so it does make a difference
to work out even if it's last minute so
I think every little bit helps and I
would not get a scourge by saying that
it's too late to work out because I
really don't think it is ever too late
to work out so if that's something that
you need to work on I would say go for
it
even if you don't think you have that
much time my legs hurt yeah we okay well
better
I'm going to talk about your well-being
now this is something that is important
for prom I would say you should get a
lot of sleep before prom you have a lot
to do and it can be really overwhelming
so get a good night's sleep before this
will prevent being in a grumpy mood and
like being able to stay out long and
have fun the whole time and just
all-around just get a good night's sleep
before another thing that kind of goes
along with well-being is to just not
stress out about the little things
there'll be things that might go wrong
and you just have to deal with it if
you're conscious of not being stressed
out and keep reminding yourself to not
be stressed out
you'll probably be more careful about
not finding yourself super stressed out
so just keep that in mind it's supposed
to be a fun day don't stress out too
much because it's just completely
unnecessary and it will not get you
anywhere
so now I'm going to talk about some
long-term planning if you have time and
some things to think about beforehand I
know that some girls are absolutely like
obsessed with having to look amazing on
prom and they want everything to be
perfect and they want to look super thin
and nice and skinny and stuff you should
probably start thinking about that well
in advance
this is not something that'll happen
overnight so just try to eat clean and
I'm a sneeze excuse me
okay so try to eat clean exercise do all
that you want to do in order to make
yourself look how you want yourself to
look this is your night something that I
definitely want to pay attention to and
I'm sure a lot of you guys do is money
think about all the stuff that you have
to buy you have to buy a boutonniere for
your date if you have one hour corsage
for your date think about some makeup
that you might want to buy you have to
think about your hair if you're getting
your makeup done and your hair done your
dress your shoes you have to think about
all that stuff I would actually set out
and like read all the stuff that you
have to get or that you want to get and
list the prices and make sure that
you're on budget if you have a budget
just to make sure that you know you're
spending because you can spend so much
money on prom and you just don't even
realize it because it's just like a
little thing here and then like there so
it can really add up so pay attention to
what you're buying so just keep all of
that in mind
alright so now I'm going to give you
guys some tips for prom day one of my
tips is to not have such high
expectations for prom a lot of people
think that this is like their wedding
day or something if you set your
expectations so high then you're bound
to just set yourself up for some failure
I don't know is that like really hard
just don't have super high expectations
and then with whatever happens you'll be
happier in general another tip that I
have is to give yourself all day for
prom I know that I am going to need all
day to get ready because I am filming my
get ready with me and I'm also doing
some my friends makeup I'm not working
at all on that day that also allows me
to like sleep in a little bit and just
have like a better relaxed major tip
actually that I have is it does not
matter if you have a date or not
I have personally had dates for like the
last two proms
so I feel like I can't like talk out of
experience but I don't think that having
a prom date is a huge deal as long as
you're going with your friends I think
that that should be enough I don't think
that you should make a big deal about
having or not having a prom date if a
girl didn't have a prom date and she
wanted to go to prom and she went
without a date I am so much more respect
for her going to prom without a prom
date than just not going at all so I
think that if you don't have a prom date
don't worry about it some girls are
asking their other girlfriends to go to
prom with them because like none of the
boys are asking them um and even if
you're a girl go ask a guy to prom like
a lot of guys are just really shy it's
kind of a weird concept like you guys
aren't dating you're not really talking
but you guys both need a prom date just
ask the guy to prom or just like I don't
know ask around and see if you'd be
interested I mean it's not like
kindergarten but I don't think it's a
big deal for guys to formally ask girls
it's like a new day and age people are
just shy and scared of rejection so if
you're if it's such a big deal to you
then you should go out and ask a guy or
ask your girlfriend I don't even know I
don't care I would recommend taking
pictures like at your home or getting to
the picture place that you're taking
pictures out early in order to make sure
that you get pictures with everyone you
want because this is like a day that
you're looking really good
you're with all of your friends and your
date and I mean how often does that
happen not that often so take lots of
pictures and be sure to get as many
pictures as you want because I know that
if I hadn't taken pictures at home
before I went to this place that I was
taking pictures I would not have gotten
any pictures basically on prom day bring
money if you're a girl do not expect
your date to pay for your dinner
traditionally this is not really how it
works if a guy asks a girl to prom
he's like basically taking her out to
dinner and like buying a prom ticket all
that stuff you can't expect your date to
pay for your dinner unless you've
already talked about it previously so be
sure to bring money for dinner and like
dessert or like whatever you guys are
doing just be sure that you have enough
money to pay for yourself and the last
tip I have is to just have fun I think
that a lot of people overlook the idea
of prom problems should really just be
seen as a great night to have a lot of
fun and look good while you're doing it
so have fun at prom don't stress out too
much don't make a huge deal about it so
that when you do have a great time and
everything goes awesome you can look
back and be like wow that was such a
great night didn't even expect it to be
amazing like that this is like my
biggest piece of advice just don't make
prom a chore just make it a fun thing
and that is all of my advice for you
this might be a really long video but I
hope it was helpful for some of you and
I hope you guys enjoyed it my next video
might be my get rid of me for prom video
let me know if you guys have any more
promised and I will talk to you guys in
my next video
