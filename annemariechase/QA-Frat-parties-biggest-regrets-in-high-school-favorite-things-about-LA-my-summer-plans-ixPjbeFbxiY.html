to be filming a question and answer
video for you guys wearing my kimono for
Coachella weekend even though I'm not
going to Coachella I really don't have
any plans go to Coachella it's very
expensive so what I did was I asked you
guys to ask me questions on my vlog
channel so these are all coming from
there if you guys want to participate
next time go subscribe to my blog
channel go subscribe to it anyways cuz I
post a lot on my blog channel okay Allen
Zhang says I understand that you are
very studious but why don't you go out
to more frat parties or parties in
general is it just that I see is very
hard or do you just not drink I am what
you would call a grandma I'm pretty
introverted so it takes a lot of energy
for me to go out but I'm not like
opposed to going out it's just something
that takes like a ton of energy for me
what dog do you want after you graduate
and what kind of business degree are you
pursuing my major is Business
Administration and I do not know what
type of concentration that I'm going for
I feel like I'm more of an entrepreneur
type so like having my own business or
something or working with like a social
media platform I work for a company
called stylehaul or I work under it
doesn't really benefit me in a lot of
ways it's just like the network that I'm
a part of but I feel like that's a
really fascinating industry is there
anything you regret not doing in high
school my biggest regret in high school
is not applying for scholarships
especially for USC I actually missed the
deadline for like the major scholarship
I like I had no idea that I was coming
to USC when I was applying and I also
wished I took more AP tests and like ib
test cuz I took 11 ib / AP classes but I
didn't think that the credits were
important to take so I really didn't
take any tests and some schools it
doesn't really matter but at USC it
really helps you out like in terms of
like registering for classes and you can
like waive some classes if so I would
recommend like take those things
seriously apply to as many scholarships
as you can just be on top of things
especially for your last two years of
high school okay so this one got four
thumbs up yeah take it from those mine
are programs doing you did really well
my school's much I think that seems to
change in college I know that calls me
hard but is it really hard already
trying less I can't ask you to get ugly
alright so I don't take your comment
offensively so I did really well in high
school and I honestly I didn't do that
badly in college I may make it seem like
I did pretty badly but my like
like a bee so like it's not terribly but
it's not like the a that I'm used to
from high school I think I'm just
someone who takes a really long time to
adjust to things first semester for some
reason I was just I got sick a lot and I
was just really unhappy I don't know why
it might have been because I was sick
all the time I didn't really make a lot
of friends I was kind of isolated so I
was just like not super happy my first
semester and it just took a really long
time for me to get adjusted this
semester I'm a lot happier and I feel
like I'm adjusting really well and I
have more friends and I'm just like a
lot more just like in general a lot
happier and obviously if you're not
happy where you are you're not gonna
perform at your best but there's a huge
difference between high school and
college like high school I can basically
trick my way into getting really good
grades for example if I had a test and I
wasn't prepared I just didn't have to
get school and I can make it up later in
college you can't do that what made you
decide that you wanted to become a
youtuber and why did you start when you
did I spent a lot of time watching other
youtubers so I know that when I was
watching as a middle schooler or a
freshman or like maybe even before that
I looked up to the people that I watched
so much like they were my role models in
life like I was just like I really want
to be like this person that I was
watching so I'm really not meaning to be
offensive or like put anyone throw
anyone under the bus and I say this but
a lot of youtubers who are like in the
beauty community don't like they try to
be relatable but a lot of them just
aren't because once they get there on
YouTube they make a big enough living to
not have to go to college because they
can just spend all their time making
YouTube videos and then they're giving
you guys tips on like how to do really
well in school where like they don't
even go to school I just found it like
super misleading and I felt like I could
be a good role model to other people
like I wanted to be the role model
that's those people those girls were to
me and say hey I'm a youtuber I'm going
to school and everyone else can't - my
goal for this channel was really to be
like a positive role model because I
just always wanted to be someone that
could be a role model
I feel like doesn't really make sense
like your goal in life is to be a role
model like for one so that's why I
started my YouTube channel and I'm not
sure if I'm doing a very good job of
that but I'm just that's what I'm
working towards every single day every
video
that was real d got to move on to a
different question now Ashley since you
are from Alaska wasn't ready to move to
LA how did you deal or cope with it was
easy and to feeling like you belong
there sorry just like totally could not
read that I honestly was actually pretty
worried about this I thought it was
gonna be really hard for me to adjust to
such a big city but I actually really
love LA I love the food I love how you
can go pretty much to like five
different places all in one city like
Santa Monica Hollywood I'm not from here
so I don't all the names but yeah so you
can just go to a ton of different places
it's just like there's so much stuff you
can do here what's one thing you're
proud about yourself that you have done
in life also you're putting me on
snapchat and Instagram and I said thank
you for that you're welcome t sandy
I love snapchat you guys if you guys
want to follow me on snapchat it is
amery chase and my Instagram is a Murray
chase without a dot so what is one thing
that I'm really proud about myself one
of the things that I'm proud of is that
I'm like a really hard worker so like
while I might not be like the smartest
person or like the most time-efficient
person or just like the best person I am
pretty sure like I can outwork like a
lot of people just cuz I know that
hardware can get you what places even if
you're like not the best of the best
anyways this is a really really deep
question and answer have you have any
Korea can you tell us about your
connection with your Korean roots like
language food visits do you plan to go
there at all during a slash after
college that is a good question I happen
to Korea I actually have a creative vlog
on my channel my main channel about that
I don't speak the language apparently I
did when I was younger and my parents
didn't like want to force me to learn
the language and I guess they put me in
like Korean classes but we didn't learn
much I'm considering taking it here at
USC but it might conflict with my minor
that I'm trying to take which I don't
really know what it is yet but it's
something to do with technology I found
so so confused right now I actually went
to Korean barbecue almost every single
weekend and then
before I went to China I puked up a ton
of Korean barbecue and got a fever so I
stopped going since then which is
probably good for my health visits
so actually I'm like announcing this
right now I am going to be in China this
summer for an internship that I got
through my GLP class then I went to
China with so I will be in China for
like eight weeks this summer I don't
know where yet because um they're
placing us there themselves so I'm not
sure what where I'll be but I will be in
China and apparently it's really easy to
just take flights to different places in
Asia so I actually really want to go to
Korea for like a weekend or a week after
my internship um so yeah I want to go to
Korea when I'm in China oh this is a
good question
Sophie Eleanor asks what is it like
being an interracial child how has being
mixed influenced your life a lot of
people ask what I am I'm a quarter
Finnish like Irish English that type of
stuff so my dad's like a white guy
my mom is Asia and she's Korean a lot of
like my white friends especially at like
college they think I'm just full agen
and then a lot of my Asian friends think
I'm like full white so technically you
don't really fit into either of those
groups like granted like this is not
actually a huge deal I have like a
pretty diverse group of friends but
sometimes there's like a little bit of a
barrier like with like racism like white
friends like being a little bit racist
with like Asians and then agents being
like races against whites I don't know
it's not a huge deal but it's like a
little bit of an identity crisis it's
just like it's not a big deal but then
identity crisis is a big deal there are
people who feel like they don't really
understand you because I'm like Asian or
something what do you use to edit your
videos Final Cut Pro X any tips for
travelers going to China I found your
blog super helpful my upcoming trips but
just in general is there any one thing
you would tell someone planning on going
to China soon interesting one thing that
you can do is haggle so you can bargain
the prices and markets you should learn
some basic Chinese phrases I did not do
this I really just hung out with people
who spoke Chinese but I'm sure it would
be really beneficial and caviar
do not really speak English so it's
really hard to get around if you don't
speak Chinese or Mandarin so I'm not
sure if those are tips or just obstacles
but yeah speak I learned some basic
phrases
do you miss high school would you go
back and could no I do not miss high
school and I would not go back that's
your biggest advice to incoming college
freshmen I would say you should try to
stick with who you are and don't change
too much because if you change your
personality or if you change like what
you do in an extreme way it's not going
to be normal for you and you're either
going to regret it or just realize that
it's not like a sustainable lifestyle
that is an extremely vague statement or
a piece of advice but don't like stray
from who you really are and like what
your values and morals are yeah so I
think that is going to be my last
question thank you guys so much for ask
asking me questions I think I did send
this out
I got like over I got a hundred like
almost 200 comments in less than 12
hours so that's pretty crazy if you guys
want to participate in the next one go
subscribe my blog channel if you guys
want to see my China adventures I
flunked everything so go check them out
my next video will be up next week and
I'll talk to you guys later bye how did
you find it going to school well we're
not a stance for we're private which I
think makes a huge difference um I
wasn't to Berkeley I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
