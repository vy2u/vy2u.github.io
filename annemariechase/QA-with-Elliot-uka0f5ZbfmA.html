okay so this is vlogmas day I have no
idea I'm so hot on my blog this is like
I don't even know what day it is
but last I went to LA birthday today I
actually woke up at like 9:00 and I went
and did a really good workout I felt
really good and then I took a nap again
after and so I woke up like an hour two
ago and I have done nothing I have no
footage it's 11 o'clock and I think
we're going out tonight so we just
decided to do a little Q&amp;amp;A like wine
with us I have beer like you know why
does this look like wine to drink some
questions I don't really know what we're
doing tonight we're gonna go out okay
they're going out and so this is a Q&amp;amp;A
pregame with us I'm sure that'll get
fired on YouTube though I mean
title otherwise racing question your
mouth I did this company named dote is
sending me like one present every day
for vlogmas did I have an open mind will
you open mine yeah if I get to keep it
I mean you probably won't want it I mean
it's December 9 oh are you kidding me
can you open it and like tell me if you
like it or not in my just different
reaction marry everything and happy
always
my sister wait this is like so
complicated like how do you your guess
is as good as mine I think it's like
three necklaces in one sure yeah no it's
like this ah it's one of the try
layering necklaces no saying thank you
dope for this wonderful trial area
necklace if you want to send me a guy's
change like you can get five dollars off
you see my code you can find a chain I'm
sure I don't want to chain actually I
break this oh no that's not
important
well I could be like don't gift so
figure out a secret
okay they're just like so weird they
literally gauge like if they want to be
friends of you based on how many
followers you have that's why I don't
like social media yeah I just like
didn't realize that there are actually
people like that I was so sad I know
there's people like that too and only
talk to people but like way more
followers yeah
believe me 11:30 it's like it's so far
like his video has not made a lot of
progress and we're running out of time
it's 1122 we're supposed to go out like
an hour ago that's what normal people do
so we're going to do a speed round
why good since ready oh we opened up a
new bottle cuz like we're all sharing
this one this one's really bad that
smells bad it's it dies they're the same
price though I thought they would be
like good this tastes like alcohol but
like bad alcohol ready yo cassie m asks
they remember together what's one thing
you both are excited about in the future
how did you guys meet it was gonna be
one long question
okay favorite memory together go
favorite YouTube memory is the one where
we did that with three Christmases ago
yeah that was her vlogmas like three
years ago we did the whisper challenge
and the other one the cod ball one that
was fun okay and any other memories I'm
really trying to think you're not that
fun to hang out with I'm sure I'll think
of my favorite memory I can ever think
of he's on the spot I really thought
about it okay that sucks how'd you guys
meet oh this is a good story
it was so weird so one of my really good
friends from high school grace she went
to a summer camp it was like this summer
Leadership camp was like you learn about
economics and leadership it was kind of
a joint thing so okay that's what it was
it was in high school it was your junior
and was your senior he's after my junior
then I would like hang out there and
she'd be like yeah I know what a guy
who's going to USC and then we had
orientation and that's when you're like
kind of acquired have come spend a
weekend at USC or just like a few days
during the summer
and they have like literally seven
different sessions is it seven or like
ten it's like now you're 11 it was like
seven oh yeah and then each session had
like how many people too many okay he
was an orientation about circus let us
know this would you say like a thousand
like it was more than a thousand because
if think about we have 18,000 undergrad
what mean 1800 yeah what am I saying
Oh divide that by like a four and a half
I'd say probably like four thousand
freshmen four or four thousand seven
four and a half we just said seven to
ten no we have four and a half thousand
oh sure okay what there are a lot of
people and then within those orientation
groups that like out of the many days
that you can pick how many days where
they're like ten oh you're right now I
think they're about seven then yeah
seven days that you can pick from and
then in those seven different days you
were divided into groups of like twenty
so there are 20 different groups and
then we just happen to be placed in the
same group and so after we did our
introductions like our icebreakers yeah
to me she won't because she was like
we're going around like oh I'm Elliot
I'm from Lincoln beachball blah and then
went around the circle it got to Henry
and it's like hi I'm Emery everyone he'd
be like this girl's weird she's from
Alaska and then everyone would just be
like that's just not what I just said no
she's from Alaska like that's boy okay
that's a good that's a good question I
like that one okay Karissa hum a bong on
Instagram but if she comments on all my
videos all the time so hello Krista how
do you feel about the semester what are
you two most excited for next year what
are your parents were on a break okay so
my classes were pretty easy honestly I
took 18 units and it was like I don't
know I had a pretty good time my first
semester back after my leave of absence
what about you I'm having pretty good
semester grades are good
I'm in great again I have a pretty clear
direction of what I want to do so I'm
really excited for that
oh no everything's been lighting up and
our football has been
you know they've been all right so
nothing to complain about okay what are
your plans for winter break I'm going to
Alaska and then Hawaii the best places
cuz I can see snow and then go Beach
so like California how you can go to the
mountain and then certain amenities now
I live at hut in height to beach best
underrated places in LA or USC Korea
tell all definitely Koreatown because
you can say that yeah without it no
because no one knows about Koreatown
unless you're Asian
yeah my life revolves around food nice
oh hey they're in town yeah Koreatown
definitely has the best food that was by
Diaz Daniella amber C D favorite song
right now I don't know all been shooting
songs I have a few classic is put your
records on it by Kern Bailey Rae got
every lyric down that one yeah and then
there's a song called drink and drugs
not the best message but um it's this
dutch rap song that was huge in clubs
over in 2014 but i just found out about
it and its really entertaining
I don't really know I love insurance Oh
probably something for mentoring from
oMG it's fate was it hard to get into
USC I worked hard in high school like
yeah like I worked hard you know you do
on your test you know extracurricular
activity is like it it's all relative we
have no idea like we have no idea how
close we were to getting in or like not
getting in you know yeah a big thing is
it's all relatives like kind of like
just where you're at in life and like in
a sense like it whether you find certain
things easier or harder it just yeah
Apple Beyonce's asks dear friends change
from freshman year to senior year in
college honestly like for a lot of
people now yeah it's weird I think you
can you can like go to yeah filter out
but you cannot like you can definitely
have the same friends yeah for me if
anything um I mean I've kept a lot of my
friends and then you filter out some of
the people that you realize you don't
want to get as close to but for the most
part you you expand on that and then
kind of repeat that process of expand
filter expand and by the end you know
you just kind of build a little pyramid
and you're at the top with a good group
of friends but after college and I was
like yeah it's hard whatever never seen
you again but yeah is that do chains
asks I like this one how did you find a
solid friend and her friend group in
college slash learned to just be
yourself
I like that to just be yourself one so
we had a mutual friend she's my roommate
like when my housemates Michelle the one
thing that I could say about Michelle
like I'm many things I could say many
good things but the one good thing is
she like is always herself like so she's
always the same person to every single
person that you meet and she's always so
friendly and nice she's probably one of
the friendlies like most extroverted
like talking to people that I know and
it's like she could say anything and ask
any question and no matter if it was
like dumb or not like she was
comfortable asking anyone and the thing
is like a lot of the times like you
think that people are judging you for
what you're saying but she I could just
tell I've never thought about that and
that actually gave me a ton of
confidence just be like I can say
anything that
- and I don't have to feel like I'm
being judged or being stupid when I say
it and no one actually cares like I
wasn't sitting there being like oh that
was a dumb question I was just like this
girl like is just having the
conversation and that was actually super
valuable to me so I was like I just had
never really seen that if you like a lot
of people are just like trying to keep
up this image but if you find people who
don't care about that then that's how
you like learn how to be yourself
lei Lani Laster says can I be your
friend who say yes no yes why haven't I
seen Elliott and your videos in like two
years lawl Jamie Catherine's doc we kind
of expanded out to meet new people and
get different friend groups and not but
senior kind of came to like oh I feel
like we've always liked seeing each
other yeah we've always hung out we
don't see each other but like we didn't
not as frequently yeah yeah we did a
house frequently but I think senior year
you kind of come to realize like ohoo
looking back like who are some of the
more important people so who are some of
the people that he just likes my
roommates they're pretty cool too I like
Nareesha and Sydney they're pretty nice
but yeah you just kind of go back to
like oh like hey basically she realize
how great I was and he was like I need a
memory back in my life last question do
you have any hobbies such passions that
not many people know about mine is like
always my youtube I don't tell anyone
about it but I think we'll know about it
yeah I'd say mine is my youtube channel
- what's yours no one really knows about
it like I don't have many other than
that outside of that I like I don't
actually have a YouTube channel but
great secret hobbies I don't really like
I don't know I'm pretty open about like
what I like to do like play basketball
