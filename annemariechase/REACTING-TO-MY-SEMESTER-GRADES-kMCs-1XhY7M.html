the airport
I ended up swimming a mile this is why
my face looks like this you can't really
tell just like I'm super tired and have
really big bags on my eyes but it's
because of the pressure from the goggles
so me and daddy out here is really
stressful to travel with does anyone
else major travel anxiety and give
everyone else anxiety unnecessarily
we're going to the airport we made it
they're sending our bags possibly to a
different Island and we're meeting calli
there I was gonna surprise you and then
clickbait it surprising her at the
airport tomorrow morning I haven't
blogged a lot it was kind of a disaster
not really yes so do I it started off as
a bad travel because they lost her bags
but then they found them I guess I'm
gonna give you guys a hotel tour because
this is a really hip trendy hotel this
is my new pimpled friend we're supposed
to be five of us sitting in this room I
think so but it's a cool hotel it has
like snacks even if you're paid for it
in like the hotel fee it's a fun
addition there's dad with his mouth open
yeah
property oh yes absolutely just the
Cookie Company sugar cookies have a
height you oh my god these are my
favorite the outside oh there's a nice
little parking garage Oh
this looks way cooler honestly armed
camera well it looks like the colors are
just very emphasized wow that's
horrifying
there's the ocean over there
pretty lady
are you smarter the ladder just how you
do it we're going to yoga I think my
membership works like anywhere I don't
know if I'll have to pay extra but I'm
taking my mom for the first time so
we're kidding that's just just replace
you cuz I am excited
you look cute in my shirt and I'm just
gonna take it off because you're really
sweaty and upend just not worth getting
into this what he is something and I
don't know anyone here so really lazy
do you like it I love it I think I could
you know heat up my room to record TRX
that was a good class it was that one
was really cardio heavy but just the
word far so she kept saying like we're
doing a more cardio I think she has like
a cardio which I don't cuz I usually her
cars going on your wrists and I have a
bad wrist I didn't tell them I have a
little sack what's it called dad oh you
gave Lea it's a cyst so my wrist always
hurt and I didn't know why I thought it
was because I texted too much
and I was getting arthritis but it's
because I have a little same issue about
your age
yeah so I can't really do push-ups it
easily except with dumbbells hey how'd
you find that I don't know man it was
just sitting there you know what I told
Callie she should have got you for
Christmas and I see just one shirt he's
a wannabe it's the California bears I
know it's cool look at you okay everyone
we have napped and excuse me excuse me
okay so our grades came out and I
thought I would check them cool get my
new SC gear I got this at t.j.maxx today
I like it more SC year than every ads is
pretty cool anyway there you go I don't
know what do you think my grades are
done well it doesn't really much matter
cuz you don't apply into medical school
but you need to get at least some decent
grades so you can go to law school
because kalyana said you're going to
lost me yeah because you're
argumentative that's your college you
need to go to law school
okay so everybody put a comment whether
but what you think I've never seen my
argumentative skills okay we saw them
exploited I don't know that when you're
talking to that person on the phone that
they pay it were paid enough money that
let's do that
anyways if we're not the only great that
I'm there's one class where like look
that one guy's he was like no one has to
come to class so I stopped one class and
then he was like everyone has to come to
class this is actually the semester that
I took the most units attending 18 since
my freshman year next semester I'll take
20 but I actually follow who was pretty
relaxed I was taking mostly upper
division class so I picked them all
pretty much actually I had two required
courses still
just kidding I got really good grades
each semester I get well this is a
little concerning the only thing is my
seminar and entrepreneurship is mg
missing grade because it says I have
zero units for that suppose to be a two
unit so what are you gonna do about that
I'm just gonna email him because I
definitely finished the class
what's your cumulative GPA to get into
medical school I know but I'm just
saying just let's just say I got a 3.72
that session how about the candidate for
this I do it ii find it somewhere else
look at I got an A in writing good you'd
be a lawyer then this guy okay this guy
gave me an a-minus because well I
literally had an a whole class our final
is to write three paragraphs on who
impacted us the most the semester and I
was on a flight and I just took I
thought he said Friday 8:00 a.m. for
some reason even though I knew that
grades are due Wednesday and so he
emailed like five of us and you know you
guys haven't turned your reflections in
and I was like oh my bad and I sent them
in ASAP and then he was like what am I
supposed to do you were on the border
between an A and a minus and I was like
I thought he was joking and I was like
okay whatever I don't really care that
much you should have just told me one of
the a if you are on the border just say
okay well I know just because he was
like I had to dock you for turning your
final in late so I was like whatever I
don't care
it was just so wrong because you'll gun
off the startup company that's gonna
make millions of dollars and you're
gonna write him a letter and say hey
remember the aim is like that's also
thing is he's always like he really
likes my start-up ideas cuz it's like an
entrepreneurship class and he's like he
mailed me and he was like keep me
updated in all of your ventures and he
like keeps connecting me to like other
people and I'm just like why would it if
you like me so much then why would he
just give me an A because well
professors do that all the time you know
so
I got I got all A's except one B in data
that doesn't oh I got an a-minus in his
class that's what he's told me
probably hey what's your cumulative but
I need to email this guy because I have
a missing grade can you pick over my
shoulder oh no dad you can pick over my
shoulder like this ah like this no oh
you get in like this you pick over my
shoulder because we're all anticipating
my Oh
that's my anticipation fit oh yeah so
basically I got this semester I got a
3.72 because I don't care about telling
my grades but I have a missing grade
which is quite concerning and I'll
probably realize I have concentrations
right now we used to
now you can technically do a
concentration going on but no I think
I'm I'm technically concentrating your
concentration GPA onto your resume
well because I'm technically
concentrating in entrepreneurship and
our life taken like two classes or any
like relating course that relates to
entrepreneurship just added like
marketing once I've created well that's
uh that's my connection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
