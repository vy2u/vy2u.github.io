Zoe hi she makes them here in my blog
Channel three weeks basically say live
with her yo yeah so today we are filming
the roommate tag because it was really
requested but we actually felt most like
twice before and the questions are
pretty boring you don't really get it us
it is really good to feel not dig deep
great something deeper and we're go
through the main tag questions really
fast and then we're going to go into our
challenge we're gonna ask each other
questions we got the supplies to make
pancakes and if we get them wrong they
get an ingredient of pancake did you
guys know each other before you became
roommates yes high school together what
do you guys actually think about each
other when you met one two hands what do
you like how long did it take for you
guys become friends we were like kind of
like first in my class we went from in
acquaintances or friends pretty easily
never like in such close proximity our
package what do you guys usually argue
about cleaning what is one thing that
really bothers you that your roommate
does to the room is for you Russ fringe
shall buy foods and I feel like she
purposely doesn't eat them just so that
they'll rot there do you guys know that
the same passion for makeup I'm pretty
good at doing like I makeup and stuff
and she's really good at babies they go
they always do face me really pair up we
can like go out and actually make it
like I'll do her eye makeup and she'll
do my face makeup and it works out so

three like nice a nice often when i kind
of makeup and she's like one out of
three what was something that you two
didn't notice about each other before
becoming roommates I thought she was
really shy you're more of an introvert
than you actually are you were way more
extroverted do you guys get fed up with
each other from seeing each other so
often we got a lot of really well for
how much time you spend together yeah
seriously like Mike but no learn to
spend this much time with someone and
