video which was my school essentials
haul I'm here with my organization tips
video because I think I have some good
tips and a good system that might be
helpful for some other people if you
guys hear like kids outside they are my
neighbors
um so I'm a pretty organized person when
it comes to school I never feel
disorganized when it comes to school and
I know that some people really do have
that problem so that's why I'm making
this video I hope that these tips might
be helpful to some of you out there and
let me know in the comments below if
they are helpful at all because I would
be very curious to see if they are
helpful and just a quick disclaimer if
it does seem like I'm super anal about
like um my organization for school it's
because I am um but I think that's why
it works pretty well
so yeah just wanted to point that out
before anyone else did so yeah I'm gonna
get started now because I feel like this
could get pretty long I think that the
main thing that keeps me most organized
would have to be this hybrid note binder
that I showed you guys in my haul um I
actually got the exact same one as I did
last year and I've already emptied
everything out from last year except
like a few things that weren't
schoolwork related so first of all
though I'm gonna show you guys kind of
the structure of this binder
I guess I'll just use this one that
doesn't have the little thing on it um
okay so this is a one inch binder so
these rings are one-inch and I think
that having a small binder is probably
the main thing that keeps me organized
because you will notice that this cannot
hold that many papers and that actually
is a really good thing if you're trying
to stay really organized so basically
all the papers that you have in here are
essential papers that you need so I kind
of wrote down like a list of what I
found to be in my binder throughout the
year because this is so small and it
doesn't hold that many papers so the
only things that should be in your
binder our immediate homework long-term
project papers unit or chapter notes not
like from two units ago just immediate
unit or chapter notes um guides and
sheets that you use often also what I
really like about this
sure that I think I mentioned in my last
video is that the rings are on the
outside so if you have a pencil holder
like I did I just attach my pencil
holder onto these rings outside and it
doesn't really um you don't really have
to compromise any space just because
it's on the outside which is really nice
so going on into the inside of the
binder feel like this is the first page
that you see or the first thing that you
see when you open your binder so I kind
of made this like the important page or
my inspiration divider kind of thing
it's kind of just a very personal part
of my binder if that's possible
this contains basically priorities or
important things or inspiration for me
okay so one thing that I found really
helpful was to have sticky notes and I
actually got some in my hall so I have
sticky notes and this just says Spanish
ib 4 / 5 . 4 because i was i did that at
the end of the year because i was trying
to sign up for my Spanish class for the
next year so this is kind of like just a
long-term to-do list and what really
inspires me to kind of work harder and
get good grades is seeing my transcript
so I have a copy of my transcript in
here um but I'm not gonna show you guys
just because has like personal
information and stuff and then I have a
fine slip right here and then I also
have my Key Club manual things and also
what I found to be kind of inspiration
was this card that my grandparents gave
me for my birthday you have so much
going for you and we enjoy everything
about you from your share of mine to
your bright spirit to your good heart so
while I was in school um in the month of
January I really felt this um motivated
me to work hard and keep doing my
schoolwork and stuff so I just threw it
in here and then I have my counselors
junior checklist from last year so
basically you guys can tell that I keep
all of kind of motivational stuff and
also important extracurricular like
clubs kind of thing and then sticky
notes and I also keep my index cards in
there so that is what I keep in this
very first divider this was a new thing
as last year because usually I just kept
my schoolwork in there but then I found
that
I would always want some type of thing
some type of place to keep all these
types of things but as in my sophomore
year so I just designated a divider to
it and it worked really well so the next
things that you have are your subject
dividers so the only thing as I already
said that should be in these dividers is
your immediate homework long term
projects guides notes for the chapter
that you're currently on and papers or
reference sheets that you use pretty
often and I'm sure that I'm missing some
things but basically you guys get the
gist there's only supposed to be the
bare minimum in your binder and that
keeps me really really organized and I
think that the less papers that I have
in my binder makes me feel a little less
overwhelmed for the work that I have to
do and I don't know it's just a really
good system it keeps you really
organized and you only have the most
important things in your binder if you
don't like this binder because of the
rings because you're used to pulling
paper out after you just push down the
Rings and then it opens they all open at
the same time and then take your paper
out because you don't like to rip your
paper I have made a solution for that
and you can also use this for the
typical open closed three-ring binders
so what I did was I took a page
protector cut a slit that was like half
of an inch long but since um since then
it kind of tore more which is fine so I
would actually cut it up to here and
then I put a sticker to try to save it
from tearing some more and then it's
really really really easy to just kind
of get your finger and then take out a
piece of paper and it's actually a lot
easier and less work than opening the
typical three-ring binder anyways so
that is my solution for the whole paper
thing because this binder actually comes
with a bunch of paper in the back and I
just found it really hard and kind of
annoying to have to undo every single
little ring binder or binder ring so I
really liked my little solution that I
thought up so if you only have important
things in your mind
you may be wondering where you put your
passed back papers or tests or something
like that and I personally keep those
things in expanding folders or files
like these and I think these are really
really useful
you should definitely definitely keep
all of the past back work work pass back
work that you get from your teachers for
a number of reasons the first reason is
that they make really good reference
sheets for example my calculus teacher
used or recycled questions from our
chapter tests throughout the year for
our final so basically if you had
studied from those chapter tests that
you took throughout the year you would
be really prepared for the finals and
you also might have to reference old
material if you're learning new material
and you forget or something basically
they're just really important for
references also I found it really really
important to keep your old pass bagged
papers that are already graded that's
important because sometimes their
grading system might fail so they might
like lose the grades that they give you
or they might enter it wrong at the
computer and you have to go and prove
that your grade was different or better
or something like that that's happened a
few times so I would definitely
recommend keeping your schoolwork if you
want to stay on top of grades and
everything I will just show you guys
what my expanding folder looks like at
the end of the year so here is all of my
work from the school year and as you can
tell you want to try to find an
expanding folder that's just fatter it
doesn't matter about how many subjects
it can fold yeah so this weighs a lot
and that is what it looks like at the
end of the year and I have every single
paper that I handed back every single
short story that I had to read and all
that stuff in there by subject so I
don't know why I've been doing goals
littly in some of my videos like I've
done it for like my last two videos but
I think it's pretty useful to have goals
in life so I'm just gonna make some
goals for your binder the first goal is
to keep it compact you don't want a lot
of clutter
kind of is overwhelming especially when
it's just a bunch of random papers
number two is to keep it updated you
don't want to have old assignments in
there that you don't need anymore you
want to put those assignments somewhere
else and number three you should make
your binder the central location for
everything school related I know that
some people have like a binder for each
subject that they have and that probably
works for some people but I just find
that to be like a lot to keep track of
and a lot to carry around and if I want
to go do my homework like at the library
I just want to carry around one binder
and then my textbooks I don't want to
have to carry around like seven
notebooks or like one notebook for each
subject and then like all of my
textbooks so it is whatever works for
you but I find that having everything
compact and in one central location and
everything updated is just a lot easier
so the other major thing that really
keeps you organized in high school I
think is a planner and I didn't get a
planner for this year because I haven't
found one that I like I really liked
this planner but they always update it
every year and they make it different
and I just don't like when they change
it um so I'm still looking for mine but
I personally like the planners that have
a calendar a monthly calendar and then a
week-long kind of thing with lots of
room for writing so this is my calendar
from last year
you guys can tell that I do use this a
lot and you guys probably can't read it
but I just have everything on here for
my monthly calendar I have like my work
scheduled events for Key Club and then I
have events like personal events like
YouTube I had d-17 Beauty smartie
showdown aired on the 23rd of last year
um so that's pretty neat and then I have
like important deadlines and stuff so
having a planner along with this system
of organized binder really helps because
you go down to sit you go you sit down
to go into your homework and then you
see exactly what you have written for
the day because I usually write in my
planner whenever I'm bored or at the end
of classes I usually get bored in my
classes at some point or another so I
have four
math test tomorrow study review history
notes for the possible quiz that's
tomorrow study for biology quiz tomorrow
so what I'll do is I'll sit down to
start my homework read what I have on my
planner so for example it's like
historic investigation topic due Friday
or read rocking-horse winter short story
so then I will go over to this binder
flip to that subject and then I will
have those exact assignments just right
there because I only have the immediate
assignments and homeworks so that system
really really really really works for me
it keeps me so organized I've never had
a problem where I've lost an assignment
because I can't find it or anything like
that so this system really works I hope
I explained it well enough
and I really think that's kind of it if
you guys have any questions about the
way that I organize my binder and my
schoolwork leave them in the comments
below and I'll be sure to answer them as
best I can let me know any requests that
you have for back to school if you guys
want any and I will talk to you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
