me there's only
hey guys it's Amory so this is all
advice that I would give to myself
starting off like in the summer before
senior year because I didn't do any of
this
and I'll like tell you guys within this
video and it was so stressful so here's
me giving the advice that I would give
to myself to you guys and before anyone
asks I've been getting some questions on
this I'm going to be going to USC so
that's the University of Southern
California first semester of senior year
is going to be really busy for you
you're going to be applying to colleges
trying to keep your GPA strong and also
I applied to a lot of scholarships so
that is all basically before December or
before January 1st the earlier you start
the less you'll have to do later on and
it all really really just piles up like
you cannot escape this process so if you
start earlier it'll just be much more
beneficial to you the very first step in
this process of college picking is to
actually pick the colleges that you
would go to and I would recommend
getting a top ten list of colleges that
you would go to you don't necessarily
have to apply to these later on but you
can just have an idea of where you would
want to go you want to have reach
schools and safety schools reach schools
are the schools that are kind of a reach
to get into you're kind of sitting at
the average in comparison to all their
statistics or you're kind of under their
average of admitted students and safety
schools are schools that you know you
will get into you're like above the
average of the admitted students
statistics and you're pretty much just
guaranteed to get in so this isn't
completely true but for the most part
colleges look for your GPA and your SAT
and a CT scores but when you're
considering your reach in safety schools
you also have to consider a big number
of things finances like how much it
costs to get in there where it is the
academics and if they're challenging
enough for you if it's a private or a
public university quality of life the
majors that are popular at the
university or that they offer or that
you would want to take so basically you
just have a huge list of things that you
have to look for when you're deciding to
choose your top ten list of colleges I
have this book I got it up Bryce Nobles
it's the best 377 colleges
and basically it has all of the top
colleges in the United States and I
think there are also some other
countries so I basically went through
this book flipped through every single
one of the university pages personally I
wanted to find a college that was kind
of a challenging well-known college that
was probably like the top 50 or top 20
so what I did was I looked at the
freshman profile and kind of looked at
the a CT scores the percentage of
graduated top 10% of the class because I
was in the top 10% of my class and I
also looked at the quality of wife
rating that was really important to me
and of course if I saw schools that I
recognized or heard about a lot I also
mark that page so I ended up having all
of these stickers and I probably even
have more so this didn't take that long
it took less than an hour just to go
through the actual statistics and
ratings and just see what colleges that
I would kind of be interested in and
then after that I kind of went through
all of the stickies that I had in here
and then I separated them from schools
that I would actually want to apply to
like I think these were it and then
these were just kind of like schools
that met my criteria but I didn't really
want to apply because of the place I was
looking for schools on the west coast
because I live in Alaska and I lived in
Washington so I'm pretty used to the
west coast or I wanted to be in Atlanta
or really really close to Atlanta
because both of my siblings go to
Atlanta and then my exception for both
of these like criteria was I if I got in
I would definitely go to UPenn so
University of Pennsylvania if you guys
are curious this is my top ten list of
schools um Emory University University
of Pennsylvania USC or like University
of Southern California Claremont McKenna
Vanderbilt
um UC Berkeley UCLA you Chicago
University of Washington and Tulare
state Pomona I don't know I think that
was nine or ten and I didn't end up
applying to a lot of those actually so I
applied to UCLA UC Berkeley USC Emory
University Vanderbilt and then
University of Pennsylvania and I think
that's it I got into USC UC Berkeley
UCLA Emory and I didn't get into
University of Pennsylvania and I also
applied to Dartmouth because I remember
that I didn't get in there and I also
did not get into Vanderbilt weird cuz I
got into all the California schools and
I got until like Emory but none of the
other schools on the East Coast so that
was really good for me because I think I
wanted to be in California anyways and
I'm going to USC now so those are just
all the schools that I applied to and
got into so um anyways what was I saying
alright some other really good resources
of looking at colleges are these
websites College Board which is
basically a really really official legit
website for college searching it has all
the same qualities that that book does
and there's also like a similar colleges
like this function so you can click on
that and then see what colleges are like
the ones that you've been looking at so
another good website for college like
information is college confidential and
this is basically like a google for all
college related questions if you type in
Google like a college question or like a
question about a certain college it will
most likely take you to college
confidential because that's where
students answer other students questions
and it's basically just a really good
resource like personal experience
type of website and then the last one
that I think is a good website for
college searching is college Prowler
this is like the least legitimate out of
all the color searches I think but
basically on this one you can look at
like anecdotes and personal like student
um comments and also another really cool
function that they have which I'm not
really sure how like legitimate it is
you can see how you stack up an
admission you can enter your GPA and
then your standardized test scores are
estimated predicted standardized test
scores and see like where you on on the
chart of accepted students and like not
accepted students and all that stuff the
next piece of advice is to be really
organized just go ahead and buy a
planner or a calendar and you need to
put the dates of your application
deadlines in the calendars right now
though look on the school's website and
see when the application deadline is due
and personally for
every single college I applied to I
applied to it the day before so this is
super super stressful and I would highly
not recommend this it's a gradual
process don't do it all at once
and you'll be fine and way better off
than I was also in your calendar you
want to put scholarship deadlines for
USC they had an earlier deadline which
was like December 15th and if you
applied by that deadline you'd
automatically be considered for a bunch
of scholarships I didn't even apply by
that date I applied January 15th and so
I wasn't even like a nerd or girl I
considered for a USC scholarship
going back to starting now I know that
common application which is basically
the website that a lot of schools that I
applied to use like require in order for
you to apply to that school they
announced that common app will have the
same questions the same essay questions
so basically you could theoretically get
started right now and be prepared to
apply for college on August 1st when
they open up the website for
applications so I'm going to talk about
the essay portion of the common
application now because I feel like a
lot of you will be using it when I was
writing my essay and I know this is the
same for my sister we just had this
image of a perfect essay that we wanted
to write about and if you have like this
perfect image of something you don't
want to ruin it by like actually
starting it because then you just have a
rough draft of something that is
completely not what you pictured it to
be but you have to start it sometime so
I would suggest if you're having trouble
starting your essay brainstorm for
awhile you know like at least a few days
like think about what you want to write
about try to pick a solid topic once you
have an idea of what you want to write
about just sit down on your computer or
like with your pen and pencil and pencil
and paper um and um do what I call a
word vomit and that's basically just
putting all of the words and thoughts
that you have in your head just on a
paper without even thinking about it
don't even like look for grammar errors
or anything just all on to paper or your
computer and this will help you just get
star
because you're not gonna have your
perfect essay the first draft that you
read in my first draft was complete like
it was not recognizable from my last
draft like they were not the same thing
basically if you start earlier and just
do a word vomit then you can start the
editing process and trust me you'll want
to edit a lot so this isn't a bad thing
this essay is basically like the
college's way of seeing what you're
capable of creating and writing so you
want to be able to edit it a lot and get
a lot of feedback from different people
another piece of advice that I have is
to have a lot of different people
critique it my teacher actually made
this comment up essay response an
assignment for her class and her advice
was not helpful whatsoever it didn't
take away from the point of my essay and
it didn't really add anything it was
just like kind of surprising because you
would expect that your teacher would
give you like helpful advice would be
the one to give you helpful advice but
my best advice came from my friend
Rachel she basically just helped me with
like adjusting the content that I was
really having troubles with I was trying
to tell a story and I already know the
story really well and I wasn't sure how
to cut down the story and she didn't
know the story but she said that I was
telling the same story by cutting down
this portion so it was just really
helpful to have a second opinion
but also just know that you should go to
different people don't rely on like one
person to give you your editing tips
different people have different opinions
and you don't have to take everyone's
opinion the next thing that I'm going to
talk about our standardized test the a
CTS or the SATs if you did not know both
tests are really really different so
what you kind of want to do is you want
to take a practice test for each of them
you want to take one for each and then
see which one you do better on
comparatively on a conversion chart and
then you're going to want to only focus
on studying for one test and this is
especially for if you haven't started
studying and you're in senior year or if
you just like if this is a complete
last-minute thing because that was
totally the case for me I think I
started studying in September and then I
had to be finished by December I studied
for two months and I raise my score by
three points the only way to really
practice and improve your score is to do
the tests under a timed environment time
testing environment and then review your
answers I would highly recommend taking
the test or whichever test that you're
taking at least two times like I said
usde had a deadline scholarship where
you automatically were entered for
scholarships but if you don't think
you're gonna get like a big school
scholarship first of all actually I'm
gonna back up and say you should
definitely just apply because you never
know apply for those scholarships at the
big schools I applied for like the Emory
scholarship and I applied for a USC
scholarship and I got it wasn't very big
but it was like eight thousand dollars
um it takes a lot of time because
usually there are essays involved but
it's really really worth it if you get
it but also I got the majority of my
scholarships from local businesses in
places basically they applied for like a
bunch of really small scholarships and
they kind of accumulated and made like a
bigger chunk of money so it's a lot
easier to get local scholarships because
just the people around you are competing
to get that scholarship and if you're
like the top of your class or you have a
really good story to tell or you have
really good test scores then you're more
likely to get like a local scholarship
than a national scholarship that
everyone in the nation is applying to
ask your counselor ask your like I don't
know they're called they're like there
are people made for this in schools this
is why you should definitely start early
with your essay and stuff like that
because basically for every single one
of my scholarships I copied and pasted
some of my essay from like either my
Emory scholarship application essay or
just my common app essay basically all
of my essays were a big compilation of
other essays that I had to write for
other things like I don't know if that's
allowed but they pretty much all asked
the general like generally the same
thing so I just copied and pasted and
then added what I needed to UM and you
might find herself doing that a lot
especially if you applied she was my
scholarships as I did like I think I
applied to like 10 or something and they
all had essays and yeah I basically just
use a lot of copy and paste that's
pretty much all of the information that
I thought of I hope this was really
helpful for you guys I really tried to
like compile
like a really helpful video in this
little series and so I hope you guys
liked it be sure to give it a thumbs up
if you did and I will talk to you very
soon bye
everyone so today I'm really really
really excited because I'm starting my
back to school series yeah it's super
early but I've been getting a bunch of
requests like that's my number one
requested video right now is to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
