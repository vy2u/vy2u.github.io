video is in celebration of me finishing
my freshman year of college I don't know
why this is in celebration of it but
yeah I was like really just like came up
to me and like hit me in the face I was
like wow if I had actually prepared for
this and you know like what's ready for
finals this would have ended a lot
better so I decided to try to help some
of you guys out and make a how to
survive final slash file Survival Guide
slash tips on how I like to study for
finals so hopefully it'll be helpful to
some of you and yeah good luck on your
finals alright so first things first
where you study is actually very
important and I know a lot of you guys
probably like to study in bed but that
can be a little bit dangerous okay
symptoms of mineral deficiency a few
moments later or something
yeah so I'd really recommend not
studying in bed you're going to be
taking your tests on a desk so you want
your testing environment to be as
similar as possible to how you study
there's actually a study that says when
you dress for success you act the part
so even just changing into some jeans
versus your sweats may actually make you
study more efficiently this next tip is
for those of you who find yourself in
those situations where like three hours
have passed and you've done nothing
because you're a little bit distracted
so I find that going to a library or
just studying with friends who are
studying creates a positive peer
pressured environment where you will
want to study so I always did this in
high school I would calculate what grade
I needed on the final in order to get an
A or like a B or whatever grade you're
trying to get so your grade is going to
equal the exam worth and this is going
to be in a percentage so it's going to
be like point 1 for 10% of your grade
times the score that you need on the
exam in order to get said grade plus one
minus the exam worth again times your
current grade so for example if you put
in like point one for the exam worth
times seventy and you got eighty in the
end you would need a 70% on your test in
order to get an 80 in the class and if
you're confused about this still no I
will not calculate your grade for you
because I'm on summer break now but
there are lots of great calculators you
just have to look up like final grade
calculator and then a bunch will pop up
got a feeling like okay so now that
you're ready to get started I would
recommend just reading every single
thing that you have to do down this
really helps me relieve a lot of stress
because I just know in the back of my
head that I have so much to do but
writing it all down just gives it a
place and just
is it for my mind so that I can worry
about other things an ideal amount of
time would be to give yourself two weeks
to study for each final and I have not
ever done this but I really feel like
the core of most studying problems is
just not having enough time or time
management so if you do this and stick
to your plan then I guarantee you you'll
probably do a lot better than if you
hadn't what I do is I list the number of
days that I have so I do like day one
through day 12 and then I kind of write
down when each exam is and keeping in
mind how much time you'll have to study
each day I kind of take the assignments
that I wrote down that I needed to do
before my final exam and stick them
under each day the important thing to
keep in mind while planning is that
everyone underestimates the amount of
time and activity will take so it's
getting a little bit each day in order
to finish studying before your final and
a really really good tip is to try to
get everything done a day before your
final because you're always wishing you
had that one extra day to study and for
me personally I just like having a
visual and something that I can
physically cross off to feel
accomplished I don't know why like I
literally do this every single day I
either make a list in a bullet journal
or I make a list in wonder list which is
an app that you can sync with your phone
and computer and has the most satisfying
noise to reward you for your
accomplishments here it is yeah and I
also use sticky notes or post-it notes I
mean this is pretty useless but I just
feel that it is extremely satisfying
crossing something off or checking
something off when I'm done with it so
if you're anything like me you need
absolutely no distractions in order to
concentrate for me that also means no
noise so these headphones are my
absolute necessity during finals so
these are the bose noise-canceling
headphones and i use these every single
day whenever i'm studying and i think my
mom actually got them for free after she
sign up for some credit card but I know
that they can get really expensive ear
plugs work just as well
for the noise-canceling aspect but I
also really like to use music as a way
to focus and concentrate and block out
any of the surrounding noise so my
favorite thing to listen to what I need
to focus is just classical music and I
really like Spotify focus playlists so I
like to listen to deep focus or I'm
feeling a little down and need a pump up
I listen to their electronic study music
and if I'm doing a subject that doesn't
require much focus so I can listen to
like lyrics in the background I've
really been liking the totally
stress-free playlists
okay okay I guess it makes sense all
right done so this is a really good tip
for reviewing anything math related
rewrite the problems on a separate piece
of paper there's always going to be one
small detail that you don't understand
if you just look it over and this
totally killed me on one of my finals
that I just took I thought I understood
the concept because it was the exact
opposite of another concept but when I
was asked to do it on the test I just
couldn't do it because it was different
write it on a separate piece of paper
and then see if you get the answer right
my next tip is to stay hydrated and this
is especially if you're drinking coffee
because coffee is a diuretic meaning
that it will cause you to lose fluids
and I know that I drink so much coffee
during my finals weeks
so it's really important to drink more
water than you're used to drinking in a
day in order to replenish your fluids in
your body and this will also keep you
from getting those headaches while
you're studying
so something that I've realized in my
years of learning is that a lot of
students just don't utilize the
resources that are available to them and
I don't understand that so I'm going to
share with you some of my favorite
resources available out in the interwebs
which are Quizlet self-control app Khan
Academy and audible and this is probably
the only video on YouTube right now that
is talking about audible and is not
sponsored by them okay so the basic
function of Quizlet is just to make
flashcards but you can do so much more
with that because it's on the Internet
the learning and testing functions on
this app are really great but something
that I've also realized is that you can
actually search any flashcards that are
made public on Quizlet and if you search
with a textbook or if you type in the
right stuff you can actually find a lot
of flashcards that would probably be
useful to you so you can basically steal
their flashcards without having to do
all the work of typing it up and then
you can also edit those flashcards to
your liking just in case you're stealing
from some dum-dums or something
so for self-controlling it's downloaded
off the internet and i honestly have
kind of a love-hate relationship with
this app because you basically add a
list of websites that you want to block
yourself off of and then you literally
cannot get back on after you type in
your password it's very useful if you
don't want to be distracted but very
very annoying if you want to get back on
YouTube I think students sometimes just
think that the stuff that they're
learning is new because it's new to them
most likely the stuff that you're
learning is extremely well known to
someone out there and there's
information on it so all you have to do
is google it and Khan Academy is a great
place if they have information on the
subject that you're looking for so if I
need to read a book but I'm very limited
on time and slash do not want to read
the book at all get it on audible and
then fast forward the speed like times
two and you can listen to it like doing
pretty much whatever
okay so it's test day and the first tip
that I have for you is to make sure to
breathe if you're nervous so deep
breathing is very important and it's
been proven to reduce stress and anxiety
something that I also like to do before
big tests that I'm really nervous about
is listen to like a really good song
like a very upbeat song so the sign that
I listened to before one of my big exams
was by Andy Grammer oh honey I'm good
and the last thing that I just want to
let you know is that this test really
doesn't affect your life as much as you
might think it does in the moment and
you're gonna do great so good luck bye
guys
