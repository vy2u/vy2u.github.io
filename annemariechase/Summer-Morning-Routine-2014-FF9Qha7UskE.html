everything is going to eat hey guys so
this is gonna be my morning routine
summer edition so this entire summer
I've been waking up super super late
like at 12:00 or 1:00 but lately I've
been waking up a lot earlier it just
makes my day so much longer and a lot
better and I just feel better about
myself so I'll check up on my text
messages and then I'll go in like all my
social videos I've been super into
tumblr lately it's like cool cuz I can
answer questions and I will go on like
Instagram if you want to follow me on
Instagram it's Emery chase and I will
also update on all the tweets that I
missed through the last night and I will
spend like an hour in bed during the
summer because I don't have a job and I
don't really have anywhere to be most of
the time and there's so edgy this is
like the real life of Emery next I'll go
to the bathroom and the first thing I do
when I get up is wash my face because I
hate that feeling of like a layer of oil
and dirt on your face from the night
before we're just like from sweating or
I don't even know what happens
does anyone else like rinse their face
off by like sticking their entire head
in there sink because I do so next I'll
just take off like the extra left over
makeup around my eyes and then apply a
moisturizer during the summertime I like
to use ones with really high SPF so this
was the Aveeno one that I showed in my
last video
so afterwards I will head downstairs and
there is that wedgie again apparently oh
I don't know I should probably I don't
know
okay so I'll head downstairs and if it's
a weekend I will make breakfast with
Cali
so we'll basically just watch her
favorite TV show or any movie we're
watching frozen today and we'll make
coffee together and we'll make breakfast
together breakfast is like the only meal
that I'll make because it is my favorite
meal to make and to eat I think maybe I
don't know
so yeah I'll make breakfast and my
sister and I made eggs and my sister
decided to make a smoothie so she tried
to make it really healthy and she put
like kale and spinach and berries and
chia seeds in I don't even know and then
she blended it all up it wasn't very
good but well basically just eat
breakfast together and I'll go on my
phone and keep updated again I don't
know and we'll watch TV or a movie and
just have a nice relaxing breakfast time
so after that I'll go upstairs and then
I'll go to the bathroom and do my
business in there and yeah I do brush my
teeth in the morning and here is some
proof because apparently people need it
sometimes so after that my routine
basically depends on two things if I
have plans that day or not and if I do I
will head over to my vanity to do my
makeup and if I don't I will not so I
know I've shown a lot of like everyday
makeup routine so I'll just kind of like
skip through a mine and do like the
highlights or the summer highlights that
I like to do during the summer I either
use a really light foundation and really
light coverage or I like to use like
bare minerals mineral foundation and
that also has an SPF so it is quite nice
and just very natural-looking
in the summertime I also really like to
contour and to bronze a lot more so I
got this new contour brush that works
really well from Mac and I'm just
contouring my cheekbones and I also
always love highlighting but especially
during the summer time so here I'm just
highlighting my cheekbones my Cupid's
bow and my brow bone I think that this
just makes your face sparkle
so this goes for the school year as well
but during the summertime especially I
like to keep my eye makeup natural so
I'm just using this Naked basics palette
which basically just has a bunch of
natural and neutral colors and I also
can not forget to cover up my dark
circles during the summer cuz you don't
get a lot of sleep during the summertime
and I just forgot to do that
this next step is really really pretty
you take a NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk
and you just Pat that down in your inner
corners and lower lashline and then over
that you take kind of a shimmery white
color either take the whiter or the
lightest color the first color in The
Naked basics palette or my Mac in shroom
and I think I've said this before but it
just makes a really really pretty effect
and then just really opens your eyes and
brings a ton of light it so I love doing
that year-round as well and then that's
pretty much it basic stuff like mascara
and then like chapstick and then that is
pretty much my everyday summer makeup
routine if I'm wearing makeup that day
on a typical day I will just leave my
hair natural if I'm like filming or
doing something special then I'll either
straighten it or curl it but I have
super I have a ton of hair and it's
really thick so that just takes way too
long for everyday if I'm not doing
anything I'll usually just like kind of
hang out at home I'll light a candle if
I want to relax and then I'll turn on
some music on my computer or I will
browse through some YouTube comments
I've been getting a ton on really old
videos lately so I don't know it's kind
of fun and this is actually the bedding
that I'll be getting for college I'm
already shopping for my college dorm and
I will definitely be making a video on
that but after that I'll just clean up
my room a little bit because I'm someone
who like really thrives off my
environment so if it's like messy I just
feel like really disorganized and kind
of anxious so here's me just making my
bed which is like the first start to
cleaning my room and usually I will get
dressed even if I'm not going anywhere
just in case I want to run out the door
real fast or something so here's me just
picking up
and today I don't know lately I've been
using a lot of my new clothes that I got
from LA it just like really attracts me
obviously so I'm wearing all of my new
clothes that I showed in my haul and I
just really like these things together
and separate on their own they're just
really pretty so my kimono is from
brandy melville my tank top with this
cool detail metal detail in the front is
from Urban Outfitters and my jeans are
from Free People so that is my entire
morning routine and I'll either go out
and enjoy the day or stay home and do
stuff so I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I'm actually currently probably in
Washington or on a flight to Washington
right now so I will not be putting out a
video for like at least five days but I
will be daily vlogging so if you want to
head over to my blog channel which I
will link in the description box below
you can see me daily vlog so I will talk
to you guys there or see you guys there
or see you next week bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
