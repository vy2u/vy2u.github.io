everything is going to eat hey guys so
this is gonna be my morning routine
summer edition so this entire summer
I've been waking up super super late
like at 12 or one but lately I've been
waking up a lot earlier it just makes my
day so much longer and a lot better and
I just feel better about myself so I'll
check up on my text messages and then
I'll go on like all my social medias
I've been super in a tumblr lately it's
like cool because I can answer questions
and I will go on like Instagram if you
want to follow me on instagram it's a
mariee chase and i will also update on
all the tweets that i missed through the
last night and i will spend like an hour
in bed during the summer because i don't
have a job and i don't really have
anywhere to be most of the time and
there's so edgy this is like the real
life of a marie thanks i'll go to the
bathroom and the first thing i do when i
get up is wash my face because I hate
that feeling of like a layer of oil and
dirt on your face from the night before
we're just like from sweating or I don't
even know what happens does anyone else
like rinse her face off by like sticking
their entire head in their sink because
I do so next I'll just take off like the
extra left over makeup around my eyes
and then apply a moisturizer during the
summertime I like to use ones with
really high SPF so this wasn't cioffi no
one that I showed in my last video
so afterwards I will head downstairs and
there is that wedgie again apparently
have oh I don't know I should probably I
don't know okay so i'll head downstairs
and if it's a weekend i will make
breakfast with cali so we'll basically
just watch her favorite TV show or any
movie we're watching frozen today and
we'll make coffee together and we'll
make breakfast together breakfast is
like the only meal that i'll make
because it is my favorite meal to make
and to eat i think maybe i don't know so
yeah I'll make breakfast with my sister
and I made eggs and my sister decided to
make a smoothie so she tried to make it
really healthy and she put like kale and
spinach and berries and chia seeds in I
don't even know and then she blended it
all up it wasn't very good but well
basically just eat breakfast together
and I'll go on my phone and keep updated
again I don't know and we'll watch TV or
a movie and just have a nice relaxing
breakfast time so after that I'll go
upstairs and then I'll go to the
bathroom and do my business in there and
yeah I do brush my teeth in the morning
and here is some proof because
apparently people need it sometimes so
no so after that my routine basically
depends on two things if I have plans
that day or not and if I do I will head
over to my vanity to do my makeup and if
I don't I will not so I know I've shown
a lot of like everyday makeup routine so
I'll just kind of like skip through a
mine and do like the highlights for the
summer highlights that I like to do so
in the summer I either use a really
light foundation and really let coverage
or I like to use like bare minerals
mineral foundation and that also has an
SPF so it is quite nice and just very
natural looking
in the summertime i also really like to
contour and two bronze a lot more so i
got this new contour brush that works
really well for mac and i'm just
contouring my cheekbones and I also
always love highlighting but especially
during the summer time so here I'm just
highlighting my cheekbones my Cupid's
bow and my brow bone I think that this
just makes your face sparkle
so this goes for the school year as well
but during the summertime especially I
like to keep my eye makeup natural so
I'm just using this naked basics palette
which basically just has a bunch of
natural and neutral colors and i also
can not forget to cover up my dark
circles during the summer cuz you don't
get a lot of sleep during the summertime
and i just forgot to do that this next
step is really really pretty you take a
NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk and you
just Pat that down in your inner corners
and lower lash line and then over that
you take kind of a shimmery white color
either take the wider or the lightest
color the first pillar in The Naked
basics palette or my mac in shroom and i
think i've said this before but it just
makes a really really pretty effect and
it just really opens your eyes and
brings a ton of light it so i love doing
that year round as well and then that's
pretty much it um basic stuff like
mascara and then like chapstick and then
that is pretty much my everyday summer
makeup routine if i'm wearing makeup
that day on a typical day i will just
leave my hair natural if I'm like
filming or doing something special then
I'll either straighten it or curl it but
I have super I have a ton of hair and
it's really thick so that just takes way
too long for every day if I'm not doing
anything I'll usually just like kind of
hang out at home I'll light a candle if
I want to relax and then I'll turn on
some music on my computer or I will
browse through some YouTube comments
I've been getting a ton on really old
videos lately so I don't know it's kind
of fun and this is actually the betting
that i'll be getting for college i'm
already shopping for my college dorm and
i will definitely be making a video on
that but after that I'll just clean up
my room a little bit because I'm someone
who like really thrives off my
environment so if it's like messy I just
feel like really disorganized and kind
of anxious so here's me just making my
bed which is like the first start to
cleaning my room and usually i will get
dressed even if i'm not going anywhere
just in case i want to run out the door
real fast or something so here's me just
picking up
it and today I I don't know lately I've
been using a lot of my new clothes that
i got from LA it just like really
attracts me obviously so i'm wearing all
of my new clothes that i showed in my
hall and i just really like these things
together and separate on her own they're
just really pretty so my kimono is from
brandy melville my tank top with this
cool detail metal detail in the front is
from urban outfitters and my jeans are
from free people so that is my entire
morning routine and I'll either go out
and enjoy the day or stay home and do
stuff so I hope you guys enjoyed this
and I'm actually currently probably in
Washington or on a flight to Washington
right now so I will not be putting out a
video for like at least five days but I
will be daily vlogging so if you want to
head over to my blog channel which I
will link in the description box below

to you guys there or see you guys there
or see you next week bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
