today's video is going to be I think
kind of fun I don't think I've ever done
a video like this on my channel before
it's kind of walking you through like a
day in my life of a USC football game it
is the 7th 10:25 I asked my boyfriend
Jacob who are playing against because I
honestly don't really keep up with all
that much but we're playing against Utah
I'm not really sure what all of our
friends are up to we were supposed to
like go meet at like 9 a.m. but I think
everyone just had like a long night it
was one of our friends birthdays so I
guess that plate was kind of like
scrapped
so instead me and Jacob we're just gonna
head over directly to the rouse tailgate
usually the process we're getting into
the Ralphs tailgate is you have to go to
a Ralph's and then spend on select
tailgate items it's super simple you
just need the receipt afterwards I will
insert a clip of what that process looks
like while we are getting ready to walk
over alright guys so right now we are in
the car I'm kind of scared to vlog
inside a browser so we're getting ready
to go inside of Ralph's because we're
going to the rouse tailgate for
tomorrow's game in order to like get a
ticket to go you like come to rouse and
then buy $35 worth of the participating
items so I don't kind of just like show
you guys that process yeah and then
tomorrow we're gonna go to browse and
like go to the rouse tailgate and I
always like going because there's like a
food drink and then like some games that
are fun sometimes it's out the game so I
was at one so it's kind of early we had
to show up yeah and it's also supposed
to be really hot
so I don't know are you gonna say what
about one that's early you have to be
there three hours before oh yeah we're
gonna go like get the stuff tomorrow but
like some people get up so early to like
start getting ready for these tailgates
I've never been someone to do that so
like that's also why I like one of these
tailgates like I rob tailgate show up
yeah you just show up because like some
people just go all out for these and
like just way too much get up way too
early but like I'm just like I just want
to chill like I don't want to like I
have to feel like I'm doing work for
this we're going the day before and then
we're just gonna show the tailgate and
it's gonna be a great time so I'm gonna
walk inside I'm gonna try to vlog inside
but if they don't let me I'm just gonna
I'm gonna not know okay let's go
they got the big advertisement oh that's
out at UCLA that's interesting but which
one that's we're good this video is in
partnership with rouse and they did not
require so go to Ralph's but I want to
show you guys like the kinds of things
that you can get that count toward here
at $35
I'm waiting for someone to top it help
me you got this little thing these used
to be like our favorite snack in the
world what all cheese grease yeah like
you just look for these things and then
you can get like their chips
you definitely get those those are good
and these are dangerous I'll get these
before I toto
this is seriously like a scavenger hunt
we're next
Hey oh yeah I'm a local I'm a local
another one oh you would like that
why huh what are you looking at house
being still Oh
being a statue okay we guessed this one
didn't we come to me you always need Oh
ketchup sriracha Oh oh that's
interesting
the cocktail hail let's just guess what
else mustard but on hot dogs five years
like chocolate chips all mustard oh just
kidding I cheated I saw this early fan
bun good reason oh we just hit the
jackpot over here here's what campus
looks like it's pretty dead right now
yeah I'm kind of surprised whenever I
got a campus like usually it's much more
crowded
but it looks very chill hmm actually
kind of enjoy this baby yeah it's kind
of nice it's like Oh everyone's just
like so relaxed this is actually crazy
because I could tailgate experience I'm
used to it's just like yeah flooded yeah
because the game starts like in two
hours
where
what oh I think they mean just like in
this crossing you know what I've always
been amused by like very much this is
like our library and then all this like
tailgate happens it's just like a weird
thing to see like where you study with
like alcohol and stuff I camped I just
wish that's a wet campus but I always
just see it dry so it's like it's weird
for me but you can technically walk
around with like a beer again like this
guy yeah
of it
this lighting is just smells like
sunscreen it reminds me that we didn't
put any on yeah I know
I'm so upset oh okay what state is not
look it but team is that oh it's organ
you told me Utah and we have a game
Jacob who's the game with against Utah
that that's from last week I don't know
either
is it or get our Utah make up your mind
actually oh my god
you ruined my intro I think you just
ruined my intro look at all that
tailgating gear
shade like this is where I learned
accounting and they're just people
drinking and they are taking a cute
detour on our way because it's really
close
these are usually not fenced off so you
can let go and take pictures and they're
super pretty but I guess it's a good
thing that they fenced them off another
drunk hazard yeah I'm surprised they
didn't fence off this fountain I bet you
people go in here all the time look at
this tailgating gold yeah that's like
whoa I think we're almost there this Sun
just literally came out of nowhere it
was like nice all week it was kind of
chilly like your sweater weather ish and
then I have nowhere it's like 90 degrees
yeah I'm like dying it's so hot we
didn't put sunscreen on now you feel my
skin burning my pale skin
yes is a better football

21 and this is definitely an option for
those of you who are 21 and up but they

of food
it's getting really hot I think we're
gonna like take cover and Shih Tzu
but this is a very fun good time to hunt
when you're trying to find shade like
poof this is valuable stuff
so thankful for that guy because he
blogs all the people that would have
bumped into me I would have had major
social anxiety just like a panic attack
if I was in that by myself it is 95
degrees outside expecting to be 96 it's
literally the hottest it's been in like
two weeks
when's the last time it was like 90s
Jesus oh yeah it's October October 7th
and it's 90 now you guys obviously can't
tell right now but it is burning hot
this is the hottest has been and so long
so all everyone walks to the game which
there actually weren't the only people
going this game like just like usually
it's very very crowded it was like semi
kata today but we're walking the
opposite way because it's just too
unbearable but I just literally cannot
imagine sitting out in the Coliseum with
no shade just the Sun beating down on
now it's also supposed to get hotter but
I just cannot imagine doing that to my
skin right now so we're going back where
I am we did not make to the game but it
is just too hot out for me and I did not
prepare with sunscreen
hey guys so I'm editing this video now
and realize that I never filmed a
conclusion but basically for the rest of
the day I think we just hung out at like
Jacob's house because we were just too
hot to do anything I know we're super
late for not going to the game but we
even saw people come back who we saw on
the way goin in the game and they were
like it was just way too hot so that was
kind of random but obviously now it's
like a little cooler and I'm wearing
like fall clothes luckily because that's
my favorite thing ever
but if you guys want like a game day
vlog of us actually going to the game
and like getting ready for that and
stuff definitely let me know hopefully I
can get that like soon because I do feel
so late for doing a game babe lobby
not going to the game but is it parked
in the driveway oh look right now I'll
go out there okay bye but now the vlog
vlog is now over I have to go see if my
car is gonna get a ticket it shouldn't
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
vlog and if you guys did give it a thumb
up and definitely let me know if you
guys want to see like game day vlog in
the future but thank you guys so much
