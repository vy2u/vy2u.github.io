steel arrows Juan my giveaway so please

respond within like a week from today
she doesn't respond by then I will just
pick a new winner for my giveaway I
watched one other person's team ID tag I
noticed it was a pretty long video so
I'm gonna try to make it as short as
possible by doing some real fast edits
so here we go what are you wearing this
top from Nordstrom that I got from grace
for my birthday and then I'm wearing
these jeans that I wear all the time and
these fuzzy socks that I got from Costco
ever been in love
yes ever had a terrible breakup I'm
actually going to use this question as
an opportunity to tell you guys that
ain't no I have broken up I know that
some of you are probably gonna want a
reason and an explanation of why we
broke up and if you guys don't know who
I'm even talking about if you're a new
viewer then you can see you I'm talking
about and my boyfriend tag and stuff
that I posted last year basically I was
dating one of the foreign exchange
students that came to the u.s. gives me
my bra strap is showing it's a really
hard situation when you're so young and
you're dating long distance long
distance is very very hard
I have College after I graduate from
high school and um he has college and
army but finish army or something to do
after he graduates from high school and
he's he wasn't gonna come down to the
u.s. to go to college because it costs
money and in Finland their education is
free they really just would not have
worked out and I think we were together
for a pretty long time considering like
the long-distance thing and kind of
knowing that it wouldn't really work out
in the end and it was really sad but I
think that was the best thing to do was
to just break up because I was just
getting really upset over it and it just
seemed like something that would have a
terrible ending no matter what anyway is
how tall are you
five five and a half how much do you a
very typical
range is from 127 to 133 and yeah it
just basically varies a lot from there
any tattoos I am someone who is way too
indecisive to ever get a tattoo because
I just cannot make up my mind for
anything here's things I do have two
piercings or just one piercing it's just
like my normal the normal piercings OTP
I'm going to pick there's not oh I
really like Sean and oh my gosh what's
her name I this is the only bachelor
season that I watched except as a
Bachelorette Emily and Sean I really
really really like them together Everett
show the Carrie Diaries new girl the
Mindy project Modern Family and some
seasons that I've watched from Netflix
are How I Met Your Mother
and probably the office favorite bands
okay so one thing that you guys might
not know about me is I like have a
terrible memory
like I have probably the worst memory of
anyone I know for certain things song
lyrics I don't know I can't memorize
song lyrics for the life of me and also
like the band names so I don't know like
any bands like I'll recognize some but I
really like music from bands that I
don't know and you might be like well
how do you listen to those musics well
um good question um usually I just get
them off my Pandora station or I have a
computer full of songs that my friends
have given me that are really like into
music and have really good music taste
something you miss I really miss hanging
out with some of my friends who were
here last year but are not here anymore
and also um just so my friends here like
I haven't seen them in a really long
time I kind of miss them so I mean I
could just call them but I've been I've
been busy with like catching up from
school but I will definitely get on that
thank you for making me realize that
question favorite song I don't really
have a favorite song it's like just that
it just comes with my indecisiveness
like I can't pick a favorite song I
cannot commit to a favorite song how old
are you I am 18 years old my birthday
was on January 5th zodiac sign my zodiac
sign is a I'm a Capricorn favorite actor
I do not have a favorite actor favorite
color I do not really have a favorite
color loud music or so
music I guess it depends on the
circumstance situation because when I'm
in my car by myself I really like to
blast my music so I can sing along but
that whole thing where I have a terrible
memory and can't remember song lyrics or
the life of me makes me not want to
blast music and sing along in front of
other people all the time soft music and
that situation maybe so I can converse
over it and also soft music while I'm
studying where do you go when you're sad
I don't really make a big deal about
being sad maybe like if I'm like crying
sad I'll go to my bed and cry or in the
shower a shower is a good place to cry
but other than that I kind of just deal
with things like as it's happening like
I won't I don't know I don't know if
this answers that question how long does
it take you to shower
apparently I take long showers according
to some people but I take like 30
minutes hours I don't know is that long
like let me know how long your showers
are how long does it take you to get
ready in the morning fifty minutes I
guess and that's like to do everything
have you ever been in a physical fight
yes I actually have been in multiple
physical fights like they're not like
ghetto fighting but I have two siblings
so obviously I've been in a physical
fight um usually when Kali and I fight
we just kind of like lift our legs dude
and blocking for each other which is
really funny like we will be fighting
and we'll try to like push and kick each
other and then we'll end up laughing
because we look ridiculous and I don't
really fight getting physical fights
with my brother cuz he's 21 and he's a
mature adult and I also one time got in
a fight with this boy in like sixth
seventh grade because he tried to like
tackle me or something and then I just
sat on him parents of being a big 7th
grader turn on good-smelling boys it's
really weird
if you it's like a good smelling male
walks past me like even if I don't
really think they're attractive like I
will automatically just kind of think
they're a little bit more attractive
turn-off it's like obviously if you
don't smell good and I don't have like
specific turn offs like Oh brown hair is
a really big turn-off obviously that's
not true but um like if you're just
really lazy I guess like if you don't
really have
any plans or goals that's kind of a big
turn-off to me the reason I joined
YouTube I watched other people make
videos and I just thought it was
something that I would be really into
and I've always liked to make videos
since my fifth grade teacher taught me
how to make videos and since I'm not
like involved in like a lot of
afterschool activities like sports or
like drama I don't know I kind of felt
like I wasn't really a part of something
like all my friends are dance so I kind
of just wanted my own community so this
is basically what that is for me fears
in all seriousness I actually really
fear getting taken like kidnapped um
yeah and like a smaller fear is that um
I kind I don't know like crashing my car
is like a big fear that I have because I
I Drive in Alaska and it's like snowy I
mean it's snowing everywhere so like I'm
like am I gonna crash it last time you
said you loved someone to my mom
yesterday when I was at the library I
was like 11 o'clock and she was like
thank you for checking it with me I love
you and I said love you too Onan and
then that though it was to my friend
Dalton because he nope that was before
it I mean last thing that made you cry I
don't I don't remember the last time I
cried it probably was not very recently
but I did cry a lot last semester when I
know and I broke up that was a big crime
period of my life was not a happy camper
meaning behind your youtube name
interestingly enough anne-marie Chase is
not my name and raised my name and it's
anne-marie it's all inward and it's like
the whole thing I know that a lot of
people get really confused about that um
but Chase is not my middle name I just
did not want to put my actual last name
or middle name it's actually one of my
siblings middle names I've always liked
the name chase so it kind of just like
rolls off the tongue so I was like you
know what I'll use chase so a Murray
Chase is my youtube name but that's not
my name last book you read and current
book you're reading the last book that I
read was supposed to be at the heart of
darkness by
Johnathan's someone for English class
but I did not read that I did read the
sparknotes of it but I am planning on
reading it don't worry and the books
that I'm currently reading for like
pleasure is into the wild because it's
like it takes place in Alaska I've only
gotten like a few pages into it but I've
heard it was really good
last show that you watched while I was
getting ready to film this video I
watched the Carrie Diaries last person
that you talked to you was my friend
grace in school and then I went home and
now I'm talking to you guys the
relationship between you and the person

at the end of this video or it'll be
linked down below last place you were
this was at school um pretty much do you
have a crush I actually do have a crush
but I've also decided to use this
opportunity to kind of tell you guys
that I do not think that I'm gonna be
sharing that much of my personal life in
that aspect I might have a stage where
I'm really young and I feel like I and
I'm not really into completely committed
relationships like I'm going to college
next year and so did you show you like a
bunch of people that I'm like oh I have
a crush on this guy it's kind of weird
and um I feel like you guys also may
have like some a little bit of an
attachment to them because you guys get
to know them like I know and then I
always get questions about it and that
it's just kind of awkward so I'm not I
don't think I'm gonna like show you guys
who my crush at the moment but I do have
one last time you kissed someone
yesterday last time you were insulted
probably right one of my friends she
kind of is insulting sometimes so like a
few days ago probably favorite flavor of
sweet I like chocolate
um sugar ice cream what instruments do
you play I have played the piano for
quite a while in my life and then in
middle school I played the clarinet and
tenor saxophone but I stopped all of
those instruments favourite piece of
jewelry this is actually my newest
favorite piece of jewelry this is
actually a diam that my friend Chloe
flattened out and wrote my initials on
and then she also attached this to that
and I thought it looked really good
together laughs for that you played
terms of like high school I think the
last sport I played in a season was like
softball last song that you say probably
just a song on the radio favorite
chat-up or pickup line I feel like I
have so many favorite chata Bloods when
my battery's dying um a pirate something
and then they go six inches or 12 inches
and and then they do it on a person's
shoulder so they go like six inches or
12 inches and then they have their arm
around you and that's not really a
chat-up line have you ever used it yeah
I definitely used that last time that
you hung out with someone my crush
yesterday brought him food who should
answer these questions next anyone who
wants to answer these questions should
answer them next so if you guys want I
tank you guys if you guys make videos
all right so that at the end of this
video and my battery is just gonna guys

you guys in my next video bye believe me
