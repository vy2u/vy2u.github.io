this but it's articles from 2009 have
you noticed
oh I thought the boyfriend tag was like
asking each other questions but I think
I'm asking you questions about me oh and
then Iowa I was yes I I asked you these
and you answer them and then you answer
half I don't think so right that's good
when did we meet and where so we kind of
have like two different stories of where
we first met we have this exact like the
whole story already films like into a
story time video that's what we did
knowing that do you not remember to
refer to that story that's how we met
where / when was our first kiss oh I
remember this it was a in my apartment
last year around this time definitely
before the 11th because we dated on a
in my apartment we are watching a master
of none we were Netflix and chillin yeah
we were watching Netflix and eating
pizza and then we cuz it happened like
that I think it who dish eiated it
though I don't know it was like a very
mutual thing who say I love you first no
it was definitely 100% knows for sure
you know we ran in your head no it is
too scared to say it out like we were
studying at her apartment this time in
the study room and then she looks at me
she goes oh my god those so funny I was
like what is this girl really pulling
that out on me I was middle school shit
I was like wait are you saying all of
juice and eating she technically said it
first cuz she hinted at it yeah I think
I said it later like that night but it's
pretty funny I'm pretty sure she did to
have a really good so good job I was

allowed to say this but they're like the
whitest people ever and they literally
don't know the difference between any
Asians they know I was Vietnamese they
didn't know we ever like kind of like
joking with them so like I was like yeah
I'm like Chinese because like I actually
haven't in China and everyone was like
you look half Chinese but then Jacobs
like no she's like Vietnamese duh but I
mean yeah so she's Korean and white yeah

while we hit really hit it out of the
park right there first time I kinda
liked the first parent at first I met
was her mom with my mom yeah Tony emo
what is one thing you wish I didn't do
this is not making me look good
nothing okay yeah you do how I know what
well that's a given but sometimes what
he's like Bobby enough I just go like
and my mom gets really annoyed I think I
got that for my brother though he does
that to me like from across the dinner
table he's like hmm tell you that I have
to deal with that all day
when you least expect it to so yeah that
that that would be it right there is
that it yes I hear finally yeah where
was our first date she and I started
like talking around the time of my
