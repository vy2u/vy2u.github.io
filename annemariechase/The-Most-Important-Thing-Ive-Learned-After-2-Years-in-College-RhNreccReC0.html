actually at home in Anchorage Alaska
that's where I'm from
for just one week or actually less than
a week I thought this is an appropriate
time to wear my USU sweater this isn't
actually even mine it's Jacob's cuz I
thought it was mine I took it so it's
really big and I always think I can pull
these off my mindset is like I'll wear
like a big sweater a big baggy sweater
and then I'll look smaller but it's
usually like the complete opposite I
look for marshmallow and now I'm
starting to sweat so last year around
this time I did a freshman reflection
video and it's basically where I
reflected on all aspects of my freshman
year it's really easy to forget you know
like the struggles or successes that
you've overcome during a certain year so
I think it's kind of interesting to
document it last year I think that I
kind of sat and took the time to write
out everything that I wanted to talk
about this is kind of more of me just
talking to the camera rather than it
being like an outline video of things
that I've already thought about that is
a copy-machine because it just made copy
in my USB mug so I'm sweet for that to
pass and so if you want to watch my
freshman year reflection I feel like a
lot has changed and I could just tell
from watching it it kind of brought me
back to those times where I just kind of
didn't like my school like I didn't have
a great freshman year and there was a
lot of things that contributed to me not
liking my freshman year and me not
liking UIC very much that was just like
all in a big pile I'm just like sent to
me it just brought me back to those
feelings and I was like kind of felt a
little bad for myself even though a
sophomore year was probably equally as
weird it was also more of a transitional
year for me as well like freshman year I
honestly feel like I didn't even really
go to USC because I was so disconnected
from the school and just like so
disconnected from the people and just
met the weirdest people I honestly think
I'm gonna do a story time video on the
people that I met it was like the first
year that I really felt like I was kind
of more part of the community I met a
lot more people and it was weird because
I lived with eight other people or seven
other people in an eight-man apartment
and I really
no anyone in the apartment they're
actually all part of the same sorority
and so at first I felt a little bit like
uncomfortable that was kind of a hard
adjustment the girls ended up being like
nice we're not super close still but
that was also just very interesting and
I kept having to switch roommates
because Zoey who was my roommate during
the first semester went abroad so I had
to get a random roommate and then she
ended up also not living with me during
this summer so I had to get another
random roommate but one of my other
roommates took her Ana's as a roommate
and I like paid her because I wanted a
single so I could be able to film and I
was actually able to film like a lot
more videos this summer so I was
actually glad that I did that but
basically what that summed up to is just
a bunch of transitioning so it was a lot
of getting used to in terms of actually
like where I lived just like an entire
new social aspect social life just
different situation and living
I went from kind of living in a dorm
that was so antisocial apparently the
person that took over Zoey's lease for
the summer lived the next door down from
us in our freshman year dorm and I
literally had no recollection
I liked she told me that I was like no
way so that's how disconnected our dorm
was our freshman dorm I went from having
that as a living situation to being in
an apartment with eight people and um
very loud social like outgoing yeah just
like a lot going on in that living
situation so it's definitely a
transitional period definitely a
learning experience I learned so much I
have so many stories from that and then
this semester or this year I also joined
a sorority I joined a tea pie at USC as
a sophomore so that was also something
that kind of played a role in my social
life so I'll track how to talk about all
of those things I'm not really sure if
I'll like touch on everything that I
mean - there's a fuzz but yeah this
video is just gonna be all over the
place you guys see that like I wonder if
my camera's good enough like there's I
just got it oh my god I feel like that's
so rare to actually catch a fuzz wow I'm
impressed with myself so the first thing
that I talked about my last video was
like kind of my social aspect of college
because
typically I think when other people
sometimes think about USC like it's a
good school but you kind of also
associate it with being like a very
social school and like a party school
maybe and I met the football team and
like the tailgates and like parties the
Greek life all that stuff but maybe
being an introvert me not having like a
good social environment in my freshman
year it was kind of hard for me to make
friends but this year I can say that I
think I made a lot more friends I joined
my sorority like I said I don't really
know the rules but apparently you're not
really supposed to talk about it so I'm
just gonna like not explain anything I
don't know I really just no one actually
tells you like what you're not supposed
to talk about but basically I really
like the girls that I have met in my
sorority so far I think they're all like
really really nice done earth people and
that's actually very hard to find at USC
sometimes just because there's so much
materialism and just like fakeness I
don't know like social climbing at USU
that I notice so it's hard to find like
people that are down earth and like
normal in my opinion just like nice
genuine peoples like what I look for and
friendships and relationships if I don't
see those qualities that I find like
valuable and a friendship like loyal
like good genuine person the list goes
on I just like kind of discount them I'm
like I'm not really gonna pursue a
relationship with this person and a
friendship and that's just like how I
feel about a lot of people at USC like I
wouldn't actually be friends with them
because they wouldn't be good friends so
I've met a lot of girls who actually
like have those qualities that I really
like and friends so that's good and
another social aspect that I totally did
not mention that I'll bring up now as I
started dating my current boyfriend
Jacob this is actually really funny cuz
I was watching my freshman video I'm
like really tripping on my words today
so last year I broke up with my
ex-boyfriend in January and then in my
reflection video I literally said I
don't see myself wanting to be in a
relationship at college there in college
but lo and behold I'm in a relationship
so Jacob and I started dating in January
or December hey he's gonna get so mad if
you watch this Jacob and I started
dating in January and it's honestly been
such a great time I don't know what to
say about the
like he's a very social person so I feel
like my social life has increased like
immensely just because he has a lot of
friends and since I'm dating him I've
kind of like adopted those friends this
is my own friends you know so I'll like
hang out with him and his friends and I
actually really like all of his friends
like I feel like they're really good
friends because they have like all the
qualities that I really like in
friendships aren't friends kind of
balances me out so I'm like not as
social I'm like pretty introverted he's
like pretty social and is pretty
extroverted so it's a good mix last year
I mentioned that I was thinking about
transferring and I think it's just cuz I
didn't really feel a sense of belonging
because I didn't have my own friend
group or like my own community at USC it
was honestly to the point where I just
didn't make any friends and I'm just not
used to Lex in high school like I had my
group of friends and in college it just
didn't even cross my mind that I
wouldn't really make the friendships
that I wanted to so I was getting like
to the point where I self-conscious I
just thought there was something wrong
with me and how I was and now his reason
why people didn't want to be friends of
me and I think dating Jacob and like
talking to him more and just hanging out
with him made me realize that it wasn't
really me it was just kind of the
situation that I was in you know that
maybe like a lot more confident with
making new friends and I expressed to
him that that was like something that I
was kind of upset about was just not
making any girlfriends and he's like
really sweet so he tried to help me make
friends yeah
but I I can't say that I'm a lot happier
with my group of girlfriends that I have
and I think that it's only gonna like
get better this next year so that's a
good thing
yeah I think that's like pretty much it
for social life it's getting really hot
here honestly like this makes me seem
like such a loser but I don't even care
I just like try to be as honest as
possible but I do want to mention
something towards Anna this video that I
think is like a very serious issue that
I will continue talking about later but
this video is already so long that I'm
gonna kind of like try to speed through
this a little bit more the next thing I
talked about my last video was academics
I've done a lot better of a job at you
know making sure that my grades don't
define me I said that was a goal in my
last year's video I'm like fun with that
now but I'm still gonna try to like get
as good of grades as I possibly can so
this year I didn't get nearly as sick as
I did my freshman year I think I was
able to build my immune system more but
one of my roommates
she had a huge health scare where she
actually had to take the rest of the
year off at college I don't know the
exact details of it because I didn't
really want to pry because it's really
not my business and I didn't know her
too much but it started off with uncured
strep and she literally was out for two
full semesters more all the story is
take care of yourself always prioritize
your health
never you know overwork yourself because
it's just not ever worth it and I can
say the same from my experience my
freshman year I got up really early
stayed up really late trying to like
study or whatever and it ended up just
not helping at all it was no good so
definitely a prioritize health so this
next thing that I really wanted to touch
on was something that I read I don't
know how I found it oh I think someone
posted it on Facebook I don't know if
you guys have heard this story it's
about this girl named Madison Hollerin
and she went to UPenn as a runner so she
was on track basically what the article
says I can link it in the description
box below but basically what happened is
Madison was a freshman at Penn and she
wasn't really having a great time and it
was obvious because when she went home
she would kind of like talk to her home
friends about it and express how she
like wasn't really making the friends
that she wanted to at Penn like she did
at home and I guess she kind of read it
like a little while ago but I guess she
just kind of felt like she didn't belong
but she didn't want to transfer she just
was really unhappy she was depressed and
she ended up taking her life so I kind
of wanted to touch on that because she
was a freshman when she did take her
life and the reason why she did it was
because she wasn't I I guess she just
wasn't happy during her first year at
college I can speak to that because
during my first year of college I just
felt really really out of place I was
not happy and I was depressed like
looking back on I was definitely like
just not in a good place like I was like
I was never suicidal just because I have
a really I mean I'm not saying that she
doesn't are people who are suicidal
don't have this but
um I've talked to my mom about one of
her friends whose daughter committed
suicide and I just know that that's not
ever an option but I mean when I was
going through that time I did think
about how like it was kind of pointless
I was like my life is like literally
pointless I'm not happy about it it's
just not fun so I do kind of know how
one could go through those steps to take
their own life I guess um yeah I just
heard the story and it made me so sad
it's just like a very very very sad
story because I really related to this
girl who just felt like she didn't fit
in didn't belong there was like no point
of you know whatever she was doing but
the difference between like my story and
her story is that she no longer is able
to continue her story because she took
her life so I kind of said this in my
last video when I was saying like make
your first year at college a
transitional period and just know that
if you're not having a good time that it
is and you should allow this to be a
transitional period and I just want to
like stress that and emphasize that
because that's exactly how it was for me
but now a year later I feel like there's
so much going for me I'm a lot happier
with USC and I knew that I would be
after my first year but there was like
that point in time even during my
sophomore year when I was like I don't
really know why I'm going here what I'm
doing here like why I'm going to this
school even though I've been planning on
addressing this I didn't ever plan out
what I was going to say but my friend
Catherine who has YouTube called
Catherine also just recently posted a
video about how one of her best friends
committed suicide because she just
wasn't happy after her first year of
college
hey I don't know how common this is or
it is a common thing I could relate to
this article up until that point but it
just made me so sad thinking about it
because just knowing where I am now in
my life and where I was back then
there's just like a huge difference of
happiness and I've like hopefulness of
excitedness for my future and I would
never be able to experience that
if my pathway had ended the same way
that her stood that madison's did or
that anyone who has taken their life did
so I guess like my stance on this is
that it gets better
if you're not happy and it's a really
understandable time to not be happy in
your life it's a really really hard
adjustment period you're on your own for
this first time sometimes and for me
like I just felt like something wrong
was wrong with me I don't think I could
have done anything at the time to make
myself happier and like get myself out
of that little like phase or period of
unhappiness or depression um it's
getting really hot but it did get better
once I was able to kind of adjust more
and come back for the second year and I
actually do know people who have
transferred like not every school is
gonna be for everyone like I definitely
know that USC is not a school for
everyone I guess the moral of my story
at least is that it does get better and
to reach out to people or to tell
someone if you're really having a
difficult time because people in your
life are 100% going to want to help you
overcome that period of your of your
life um my camera just beeped her turned
off telling me that I'm talking too much
so I think that's all I'm going to say
in this video and I'm sweating and it's
hot I want to take this off no this is a
mistake so thank you so much for
watching and I will be coming out with a
new video shortly but in the meanwhile
check out my vlog channel because I just
post a vlog on there and I will talk to
you guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
