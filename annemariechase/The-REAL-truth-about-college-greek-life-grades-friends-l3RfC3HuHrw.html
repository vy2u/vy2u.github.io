anybody he doesn't know me so you was a
series regular on Emory Emory vlog yeah
pop up here in there but today we asked
everybody if they could submit questions
for call a device but also some of it
goes off why we're in this black good we
were actually walking and we saw like a
black hole so we walked into the black
hole and we forgot chairs to actually
walk out of the black hole get chairs
brought the chairs back into the black
hole and here we are the black hole so
if you're going to use likewise are
setting like this is a see books video
but yeah ended on how the questions were
at so on you guys if this doesn't make
any sense
was this like stranger things the bitch
right now it's good it's pretty cool
yeah the one who might be walking around
someone there anything fancy us
purchasing I watch the first episode is
she's scaring myself so are you ready to
show it looks like very successful
another people like a white pg-13 maybe
we asked questions on my main channel
and my blog channel and I'm gonna take
questions my favorite questions for my
main channel and rich is going to take
his favorite questions to ask from the
vlog channel yeah this is going to be a
lead-in to if you're not already
subscribe to my blog dude I'll go
subscribe you can't go subscribe to and
Marie vlogs the adventure begins
Tanya sing ask how do you stop
procrastinating and Rick this is not the
question for you let you think of a
great fun debate I think a basic answer
for me like an actually in series to
start doing it like just do it I am um I
got to think about the yeah think about
the bigger picture and also either
relates to school don't forget that you
should actually be learning something
if you can because like a lot of times
like you'll take a class and you'll be
like I'm taking this class on like
whatever subject like I'm taking this
class on like the signs of time winds or
something I don't know I've done this
like in several classes but just be
conscious of it like you start taking
the class and then you don't go to a
bunch of the classes and then you just
show up for the midterm like you cram
for the midterm and you show up for the
final you cram for the final and then
you ended up only learning the
information that's on the midterm or the
final part of it just is the way we're
tested sometimes especially in like math
based courses but it's easier to like
invest in in school work or in things
that you would procrastinate if you try
to like figure out whatever it is that
you can derive from it that's actually
like functionally useful to you yeah it
also really helps when you're very
interested in classes that you're taking
yeah but if you can't be just try to
figure out like try to take the classes
and appropriate the classes to the
whatever field you're interested in
Carol Liu asks was the best part about
college I answered this already on video
and I said like the people that you meet
I would agree that I think you elaborate
on that a little bit college is just a
just like a giant melting pot of like
ideologies and and sometimes ideologies
that make you like really angry and
sometimes ideologies that completely
mirror the way you are when you go to
college it's like a huge asset to you to
meet people who don't think like you
because that's just how the world is and
it just allows you to engage with people
in a really in a really mutual mutually
beneficial way ultimately because you
all have to be in a game from each other
I think even if you violently disagree
with yeah also just in college I feel
like it makes you aware of careers and
opportunities that you didn't actually
know existed yeah
Kelsey Daniel Hill asks what to do if
you don't know what you want to major in
that's kind of my situation like I miss
this major the pretty flexible major but
I didn't have any
like real the nation towards any other
majors I was like I think the most like
flexible major that I was like pretty
good study what you what you care about
because it makes it way easier to
succeed if you inherently already care
about what you're studying but it's
totally fine to come to college
undeclared and figure it out while
you're there and it's totally fine to
graduate with a certain degree and then
work for a little while and figure it
out from there like nobody I don't think
really knows exactly yeah I'll do
something I think a lot of people just
don't know that their interests can
translate into jobs like even in terms
of social media or putting on events or
something you could literally just try
researching like what you're kind of
interested in and see if that's a
potential like career path for you like
I didn't know what like communications
entailed that would have been a good
major for me as well PR communications
like those are all things I had no idea
about or I like got to college so just
literally just trying researching majors
yeah not to go all cliche inspirational
speaker but like don't be afraid to fail
at anything that you that you are
interested in and you know fail a
hundred times until you find out what
you're if you're enjoying yes what are
some unexpected things you've learned
about USD / college or Greek life I'm
not in Greek life but when I describe
Greek life as I'm going to offend a lot
of the people who are in Greek life I
mean you can honestly back it up I just
think that I just think that Greek life
is is iWitness it's okay come on I don't
want to get Jonathan do it but I
understand totally why people join Greek
life first of all I think when you come
to college it's difficult to find people
who are like it can't be like different
things like any kind of work for certain
people it's a system that's like
fundamentally based in exquisite and
when you're excluding people there will
be certain reasons you're excluding
people for and I think that rate is the
factor that plays into at least like it
at you
see laughter it's very true for other
schools too basically it does not be
like whatever politically correct about
it like I like there's like rankings for
for Greek life and everybody knows them
they're like somehow just very
ubiquitous the higher tier you get so
kind of whiter and blonder again yeah I
know that there's exceptions to that but
it basically put like stanzas of beauty
of beauty on people that might not
necessarily fit those yeah and that and
it's all just sounds like a whole lot of
negative consequences yeah and so it
makes it makes sense if you're in
college and you want to just find a lot
of people who are who are like you and
make friends like oh we're done service
a good community like a place that you
continuously go back to your like
familiar faces but it does like have
problems just within the system yeah I
ultimately am very happy with the
decision that I made to not join it
because I feel like I would have had to
sort of change aspects of myself to fit
a larger abstract ideal of a fraternity
rather than the fraternity being of some
of its parts and one of those parts
being me but I also have a overwhelming
personality has been trolls of them
let's try an season like ten words or
less do you ever feel homesick and where
you want to live after you graduate not
really because my family does all the
time I mean I felt a little bit homesick
in the first couple months but I would
pretty cool it like I live in the Bay
Area's so it's like a six-hour drive
from LA I think if you do feel homesick
then your parents want you to call them
so call your mom that'll help tomlin
zombie Tom when zombie has a bunch of
questions we do you wish you had been
more involved in high school with the
question no III just reach into beta in
high school as my like main thing I was
in like a couple of clubs I prefer to
just be involved and like a few things
that I can sort of invest a lot in them
I would probably not change anything
about my ball in high school
and I feel like I spent too much time
there anyways Gabriella asks how much
work do you put in to get the grades you
have is it a good thing or a bad thing
of all I think this like this really
pertains to me because I feel like if I
want good grades I really have to work
hard for it just like how like I learn I
don't know if it's like a good thing or
a bad thing it's kind
more difficult but like it makes you
learn how to work hard how much work he
put in for the grade um he's naturally
like pretty smart so like I feel like
not have to work that hard so that's
like a good thing for him that's true I
just always try to study enough that I
won't have regrets and I mean studying
for like a couple of hours but sometimes
it takes me like several days to feel
comfortable like I wouldn't have regrets
after the test so my policy is just like
do as much studying if you need to to
like walk out a test and no matter what
grade you got like not having regret
about deeper ways like usually like it's
really hard to get to that point even if
I study for a long time Tammy hatin
what's your recommendation on getting
the full experience flash the most out
of college I would say like early on
research like what your college has to
offer and then try to get involved
pretty early on or just consistently try
to get involved with what you're
interested in I would do like on a
social level just like it might take
time to make like friends that you
really like and in my experience it's
like worth waiting for those boots yeah
if you don't have like friends that you
necessarily like like like right yeah
don't change yourself - yeah - like you
know - just have like a bunch of
arbitrary friends yeah if there's
anything you could change about your
college experience what would it be
I wish I didn't have to take GE oh yeah
me too because I wish I took more AP
tests like actually wizard - so
seriously so that I could like wave from
the requirement so I have to because
like mostly Jews I've taken at USDA
after 1hour pointless where are your
plans after college that's light on hail
goddess got a lot so still debating that
you know I'm going to live in LA my
brother's here and just sort of write
more and to stand out more and make more
stuff and I don't know we got government
of land but yeah kitty nice ass
why don't you ever close college videos
and why haven't you still posted the
dorm room right
you know it's helps being a YouTube
celeb you got a lot of you to love
things to do you got a you got it
I don't know eat kale salad you got a
malware on Fowler gotta wear shirts and
say I love kale gotta like gotta on your
ivory I'm not like friend II gotta make
moments like make mo did and you have to
manufacture a lot of candid moments yeah
and it's a part like it's just it's a
difficult life yeah and oh you know like
give her a break thank you god damn it
give her a break
no it's the real reason though into the
answer the question is that she's super
like super meticulous perfectionist
almost to a fault about like her videos
and she like will not like post anything
until she thinks like she's done
everything you know what Emily its art
it never finished only abandoned
so maybe you should live by that oh
here's an interesting one Amanda do at
yay rigid back ah that's how you paint
it go through your parents or doctors
did they ever encourage you guys to do
the same my brother always thought he
was going to be a doctor it's not just a
doctor but a cardiothoracic surgeon
thank God and I always was like I wanted
to do movies my dad actually took me to
watch his surgeries and one time he had
to burn the fat of someone he was
operating on and that was like ghosting
and I was like no and I can't deal with
like blood or gore so I'm like yeah my
brother eventually stopped doing pre-med
but my dad was ultimately fine for that
night we met so maybe he's like
satisfied with him okay Amanda's we
watched a bunch of like rapid-fire
questions
Lisa everything about us see it's very
superficial in LA like yeah the campus
is it's pretty divided by five people
laughs
spaceship up they say you discover
yourself in college name three things
you learn about yourself I think I'm a
pretty individualistic person I think
I'm okay being on the hounds I'm done
yeah I think I have very strong world
values that I stick to I'm not usually
persuaded by others I actually find
reading more interesting than I did when
I was in high school the ability to
write is like a pathway to like anything
pretty much except for sign okay so
thank you everyone who answered or
everyone who asked questions like the
last minute yeah thank a lot for some
etiologies question and we hope that I
didn't talk too much over you also I
