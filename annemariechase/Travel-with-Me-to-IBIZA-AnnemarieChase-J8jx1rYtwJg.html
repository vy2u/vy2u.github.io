one of the coolest and best trips of my
entire life I was lucky enough to be
invited to go on top decks sailing trip
around Ibiza
I am also still letting that sink in
even though I just got back from the
trip
top deck also has trips world round and
they're not only sailing trips so if
these travel experiences where anything
like mine was I would highly recommend
any travel destination that top deck
offers basically in this video I'm going
to walk you guys through what a travel
experience with top deck sailing around
Ibiza looks like because I hope you guys
enjoy so day 1 after 23 hours of
traveling and a rather awful travel
experience with Miley severe lines
serving as people at the plane to
melatonin so tired start to the
nine-hour 32 first we're going to make
my connecting flight I finally make it
to Ibiza
we are whatever you okay help check out
my choices it just depends on the kind
of setup it's all of them have bathroom
oh cool Wow pretty much one this is a
bunk yes
this one kind of looks I like the space
in this one I'll take this one turns out
most of the other guest flights also got
delayed
so our first afternoon was spent getting
to know the sailboat in our new home for
the next four days and also getting to
know each other over dinner and drinks
and dancing men passing by in San
Antonio which is most famous for its
beautiful sunsets good morning everyone
it is day two at Ibiza and it is
currently back 21 Wow look at that hair
Jeju was definitely one of my favorite
days I woke up way too early but it was
okay because I was just way too excited
and full of energy to sleep so I went
out at 5:30 to watch a sunrise and then
a few hours later Angelika our guide
made us a delicious breakfast Justices
so what's on for today this is something
that they do at top deck that I thought
was really cute but before all of that
this is probably a good time to
introduce you guys to everyone so all
links everyone will be in the
description box below so check them out
but first we have Brooke who also has
YouTube channel Megan who works for
diffusion appear
Emma who's a freelance writer who's done
work for Teen Vogue Naveen also a
freelance writer who worked for
refinery29 Liz who writes her vessel and
Maria who is top decks PR person and
also my favorite person to troll on
camera hey guys I'm Angelica and Maurice
completed your topic and we're going to
do shoot while skippa establishment
provide an interactive entire specific
like is my go to net because what we see
that you should definitely come say hi
be the Tirpitz lenticular it's pretty
much all we do CS is improving stuff all
day around the ones your instagram my
instagram i'm intrepid rudra okay so
back to day two activities and I live in
Lex is our first sailing destination
it's apparently where the famous
Victoria's Secret model Naomi Campbell
lives so we are trying to spy to see if
we could spot anyone famous
but this is also our first swim spot
it is pretty funny because book is kind
of scared of fish and for good reason
fish ate everything
but there were fish swimming all around
us I just couldn't see so I thought I'd
get some shots to show her post wins
so here you go Brooke release water I
have Monday blues and then we head over
to a cedra etc like myth and mystery
about this so when we come out so you
see the focus of what looks like smoke
marks on it is actually a black rock
that's highly magnetic so as bedrooms
with the most magnetic points in the
world I was also like Nora's like are
meaningful murder triangles so there's
quite a lot of crazy things that going
to happen now there are if you guys know
of the story the Odyssey yes so in the
book you have you as if you really want
to hear the siren song and in the book
it's all based that the firing for
offenses I'll include etc because also a
legends that if you go on the island you
get a giver to good luck I've done it
three times now I'm hoping this kind of
come trial before yeah so I didn't
really put a lot of thought into s Vedra
being Bermuda Triangle like but honestly
the place did have weirdness about it
first we lost service
hello service and just as we're
approaching the island the skies
overcast for the first time on an entire
trip and there are a ton of birds making
a ton of noise which is always very good
Oh like places where that call for you
know and you know that worse than on
swimming to touch alum for good luck but
as we're approaching it I start to
notice more and more jellyfish in the
water Oh Jerry fish there are so many
jelly fishes yeah they might swim to
touch this rock because it's good luck
debating on the jellyfish there's quite
a few yeah there's a lot a lot oh my God
look at the mole jeez yeah don't want to
get in there yeah yeah
oh wow great glasses I guess this is
like bad luck that Megan is like a medic
full of the I'm selling food all odds
are against us to touch the rock but we
take our handy dandy beanie defy all
odds and just go touch the rock with no
problem afterwards we made the short
sale over to Khaleda Hort a beautiful
beach with a beautiful view of a century
after a guided cod tour we were
definitely ready for dinner we just got
on track we're now getting ready to go
to dinner yeah I think this is a nice
dinner but I've kind of given up good so
I guess I could stick living and guys it
was hands-down the most beautiful dinner
setting that I've ever seen in my life
this is
oh my gosh
the epic sunset and dinner over etc is
the hashtag ultimate 49 experience I got
to cross off my bucket list so this
campaign is really cool it basically
showcases all of top Dex bucket list
items that you can experience on their
many different trips around the world so
I'll be sure to leave the link to the
blog post about that in the description
box and don't forget to check out mine
and Brooks but yes one thing that's for
sure is that this dinner with this view
was definitely an experience of a
lifetime so I think that this is
probably a good time to end this little
vlog before it gets way too long I'll be
posting a blog from each day that I was
in Ibiza on my vlog channel very shortly
yet so be sure to subscribe to my blog
channel and watch those vlogs if you
want to see more about what we did on
our trip I also have three and a half
hours of footage so I'm hoping that
someone will watch those vlogs
alright guys that's the end of this
video if you guys liked it please give
it a thumb up this is just an extremely
memorable experience that I had and I
was really excited to share it with you
guys and just tell you guys about top
deck because it was honestly one of the
coolest things that I've ever done in my
entire life so I will link some
informational links below about top deck
