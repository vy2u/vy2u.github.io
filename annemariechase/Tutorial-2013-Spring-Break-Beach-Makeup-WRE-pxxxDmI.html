screen like peach makeup look hey guys
so you may have noticed that I was not
at home on this entire video I was
actually in Hawaii it's almost spring
break for me and I know that a lot of
people go to really warm places and
beaches during spring break so I thought
this would be pretty helpful to some of
you who are going anywhere and if you
are going to know where let me know in
the comments below where you're going
I'm actually not going anywhere I'm just
staying home which I'm pretty excited
about this is kind of weird because i
think it's the first time that I've ever
been home for spring break so it'll be
kind of weird but I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial and i'll talk to
you guys soon so if you're planning on
spending a lot of time in the sun the
spring break i recommend using a tinted
moisturizer or a BB cream these options
give you great coverage for how light
they feel which is especially important
in the sun be sure to apply some extra
sunscreen beforehand if yours doesn't
have any SPF in it and even if it does
it usually has a small amount so just to
be on the safe side you may want to
apply some extra and Here I am just
applying a second layer of the same BB
cream for extra coverage in areas that I
felt needed more attention this
particular BB cream is really buildable
so you can really pick as little or as
much coverage as you want next I use my
bare minerals original foundation and
I've always been a huge fan of bare
minerals because it's perfect for a
natural light concealer and foundation
it also has an SPF of 15 which is
helpful to have in your foundation for
everyday use and so I just use this to
even further conceal my red spots as
well as set my makeup
moving on to the eyes I made sure to
prime my eyes with Mac's painterly Paint
Pot it's really important to use primer
if you're going to be applying any
eyeshadow on so that it doesn't crease
while you're sitting in the Sun and I
applied this to my eyelid as well as
underneath my lower lashline so overall
I definitely recommend getting palettes
because they're cheap and convenient
ways to chat a lot of makeup the this
little black book palette by to face is
especially perfect for spring very
troubling because it basically has all
the makeup you need all in a tiny
compact little palette the products in
this palette are also all high quality
so i won't use it specifically while I'm
traveling I also use this everyday at
home as well i was going for a simple
subtle kind of look so i went for the
shimmery white and apply this into my
entire eyelid next I use the lightly
shimmery brown eyeshadow Pat it off any
excess into my hand and applied this to
the outer V blending it into the crease
and then I just mix the shimmery pale
pink with a matte white eyeshadow as an
inner corner highlight I also took this
along the first third of my lower lash
line instead of using an actual eyeliner
I use the same brown eyeshadow and line
to my lash line you can do this step by
using any darker shade of eyeshadow and
it makes for a very natural looking and
very convenient faux eyeliner and I just
did this step for both the top and
bottom lash lines and as a final touch
on this makeup look you can mix your
highlighter with a little bit of bronzer
for the perfect sunkissed glow
curl your lashes and apply your favorite
mascara and if you're planning on
spending some time by the water it
probably wouldn't hurt to invest in a
good drugstore waterproof mascara and to
finish this entire look off I use this
baby lips moisturizing lip balm and pink
punch for a really pretty flirty pop of
color on the lips and that is the
completed makeup look alright guys
