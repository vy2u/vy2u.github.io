tutorial using my too faced natural eye
palette so if you would like to see my
tutorial in this please keep watching so
I'm just starting off with a bare face
and I don't have any makeup on my
eyelids however I did do my eyebrows
someone asked in the comments with this
Too Faced eyebrow envy kit I might um do
like a two-faced um review because I
have a lot of to face products I tried
to include this in my tutorial except i
just kept stumbling over my words and so
i just decided to save it for another
video because i don't know it was really
just giving me problems so i'm just
gonna stick to the everyday eye makeup
routine so the first thing that I do is
I use urban decay primer potion and I
actually use this before I apply
eyeshadow on my eyelids every single
time I just got this one at sephora i
had this one and it lasted me an entire
year so i use this pretty much every
single day for one year and i really
liked it and i was really upset that the
new packaging didn't come with a wand um
because i was just really used to the
one I was like how am I gonna apply it
now but it's actually really simple to
use the oops just drop that the
applicator is small and it just comes
out a little dab so it's not a problem
at all and apparently it comes with ten
percent more with the new packaging so
that's always a plus and it was $25 I
got it discounted because my friend or
said JC Penney's and my Sephora is in JC
Penney's so he got me a discount which
is really nice of him I'm gonna get that
cabin out so you just take a little dab
and this hopefully you can see it will
actually be enough for my entire I my
eyelid and I'm going to use a separate
mirror and just apply it all over my
eyelid under my brow and then
right are in the inner corner of my tear
ducts and then right under my eye so all
over there and I mean you can use
however much you want or however little
you want I just think primer is really
good for making the colors really stand
out and keeping your makeup looking
fresh and new the palette that I use
every day is the two faced natural eye
palette and by the way while I was
filming my last video this snail got
completely messed up and I had just
gotten my manicure done by my sister's
best friend she did them for free just
did my toenails which is really nice of
her they're really pretty um and so we
just covered it with little dots isn't
that really cool i mean you can still
tell that it's chipped but i don't think
it had dried all the way even though i
waited over the long time so we just put
little dots and it was it ended up being
really cute so it's a really cool idea
if your nails get messed up and you have
little holes in them um in the color put
dots on it okay anyways so this kit
comes with um all these colors and you
can tell that i actually do use this
every day I've had this for about a year
now and then it some of these kits come
with this little brush it's just a
generic sponge brush and then a slanted
angle brush but some don't so make sure
if you want the brushes it's um pretty
it's thick the other one that does not
come with a brush is about half this
size maybe less than half or more than
half of that size and it also comes with
these little cards um this basically
just shows you or gives you an idea of
how to use the colors I used to use
these cards as guidance but I don't
anymore I've had time to experiment with
the palette so I no longer use these
cards um but they're really fun to look
at and to use if you do need some
guidance like I did I'm just going to
show you all the things that I'm going
to be using in this tutorial so I don't
have to explain it during it I'm going
to be using this brush because it is
pretty much the only eyeshadow brush
that I have
along with um oops just drop that along
with this um brush for blending the
crease and this actually came from the
Naked 2 Urban Decay palette which I just
got so I i'm using those brushes and i
will also actually just use this one and
here um or i'll show you an alternative
to what i'll be doing with this one
because it does come with it and that's
really easy i just take a little bit of
heaven color that's what it's called on
the palate so i put it under my eyebrow
and to my crease or from Chris Dubrow I
think that it just makes your eyebrows
look really defined the next thing I do
is I take nude beach and I just load
some up on my brush and then I apply it
and the first two thirds of my eyelid
and I'm also going to put it underneath
my eye because what I like to do is I
like to do the lightest colors and then
do the darkest colors because i usually
don't change out my brush um so I want
to get all the lightest colors on there
first because when you get the darkest
colors on there they kind of their
really easily noticeable and if you mess
up it's harder to fix so I'm just gonna
do all the light colors before i do any
of the dark colors I just take some of
the UM silk teddy and I just line under
my waterline with it basically for the
first third and then a little more I
used to not do this step but it really
makes a difference it really opens up
your eyes and I just it looks really
good in pictures and I don't know I
really like this step so I advise that
you do it and it's really easy
especially if you already have this
brush and then we're gonna do is take
push up which is this color right here
load up some color on there and then put
that in the outer third of your eye so
my camera ran out of space while I was
filming that so I just um I put the
push-up color on my eye and that's what
I did last and then we're going to put
it on the lower um lower lash line so
what you do is or what I do is I just
take some the push up and then just
apply it right where I put it um put it
on my upper lash line except i'm going
to do probably the outer half instead of
the outer third oh that's what it looks
like so far and then i'm going to take
this little brush for the crease and
outer corner of my eye and since i'm
going from lightest to darkest i just
blend a little push up and then erotica
which are these two colors and i start
from the outer corner of my eye just in
case it is too dark
so I'm just going to take some more and
then again go from the outer corner and
then blend towards the inner and I
usually stop are usually blend this um
from the outer corner to about a third
of the way out using a lot of fractions
here and you just really blend until it
looks natural and you can just decide
what looks natural I would say that this
has a pretty natural look to it there
are no sharp color lines so I'm going to
be done with this um with blending what
I've noticed from a lot of eye makeup
looks that I've um that I really like is
that um usually there's some type of
little ething going on in the outer
corner of your eye so it's from the
crease to the upper lash line to the
lower lash line it creates a little e so
that's what I have been doing so I'm
going to blend it from my crease to my
upper lash line to my lower lash line
this is just a really natural look so
you might not be able to see it
dramatically but that's not what i'm
going for in this look and then what i
do is i usually just put eyeliner on the
outer third of my upper lash line and i
just have it curve up a little bit and
then I just curl my lashes and then
apply some mascara
so that concludes my everyday makeup
routine using the two faced natural eye
palette I hope you enjoyed it I'm
actually thinking about doing a
two-faced review because I have a lot of
their products I really like their
company that's something you'd be
interested in please comment below thank
