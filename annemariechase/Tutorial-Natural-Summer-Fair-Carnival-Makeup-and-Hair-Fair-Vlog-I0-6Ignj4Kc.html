state fair and Palmer Alaska so i just
made a quick video on the hair and
makeup that i did also at the end of
this video i have a blog kind of thing
of me and my friends at the fair so if
you'd be interested in seeing that just
keep watching or if not you don't have
to so here's just a little sneak peek of
it and I hope you guys enjoy this video
by all right if it goes since the fair
is almost completely outdoors I mean
absolute sure to moisturize my face with
this Neutrogena facial lotion with an
SPF of 15 I would actually even
recommend a higher SPF if it's available
to you
so the next thing that I did was just
set my eyebrows with my brow and be
Kitsch because they were really
bothering me at this moment so I just
wanted to fill them in and set them
you
I knew that I was going to be around
thousands of people all day so I
definitely wanted coverage but I didn't
want a heavy foundation because when
you're in the Sun you don't want a face
caked with makeup because first of all
it's really easy for other people to see
it and it's just generally uncomfortable
so my solution was this BB cream the one
that I have here is L'Oreal's magic skin
beautifier BB cream I'm a huge fan of BB
creams because it gives you even
coverage but looks completely natural so
as you can see here it's really easy to
apply you don't really need brushes or
anything I always just use my fingers
like I would apply a moisturizer
and then I just applied some more BB
cream on some acne spots and red areas
on my face
so here's the final look using just BB
cream as my coverage and I would say
that this is really good for how light
it feels on my face I've noticed that a
lot of BB creams come with some sort of
SPF mine didn't so I just used
moisturizer that had some but a lot of
products containing any sort of SPF will
usually give your face some kind of
shine so if you don't want that I would
recommend setting it with a powder i'm
using my covergirl trublend pressed
powder to set my makeup the step is
super easy but makes a huge difference
with shine this press powder is really
portable so I was able to take this with
me to the fair and reapply it whenever I
needed to
so the next step is optional kind of
like everything else in this tutorial
but I used warmth from bareMinerals for
just a healthy looking glow on my skin
next I primed my eyelids with Too Faced
shadow insurance if you're planning on
being out in the Sun all day it would
make sense to use matte eyeshadow colors
I found that with shimmery eyeshadows
it's really easy to get fallout which is
very visible in the sunlight another
thing I've noticed with shimmery shadows
in the Sun is that they can be a little
bit distracting to the colors you may
want to opt for a matte shadow but I'm
obsessed with shimmery eyeshadows so I
decided to use my favorite neutral
shimmery colors from the Naked 2 palette
anyways I used the color booty call on
my lid as a base and also in the amber
corners of my eyes then I took this matt
white shadow called Roxy in the inner
corners of my eyes to bring it more
light and to make my eyes appear more
open
the next and actually the last color I
used on my I was suspect i apply this on
the outer third two outer half of my
eyelid
then I took the same colors underneath
my lower lash line I think that doing
this step always makes I makeup look so
much more put together and done up than
not doing it
since I wanted to keep my eyeshadow
simple a neutral I took suspect again
and applied this in the crease to blend
the colors more and to make the light to
dark color shift more apparent
alright so I mentioned the problem with
fallout earlier the best way to avoid
this is to not have any I just took some
scotch tape picked up some lint off my
shirt and then picked up any visible
shimmery fallout left out of my cheeks I
would also recommend going over these
areas with some press powder again okay
so onto my favorite part since my
eyeshadow is neutral I was debating on
making my eyeliner really dramatic I
acted up just doing a slight wing but
feel free to play with this because
eyeliner can definitely change the
entire appearance of your eye shape and
lashes
next I used a white eyeliner and apply
this to my lower waterline this also
makes the eyes appear more open
and lastly I curled my lashes and
applied my favorite volumizing mascara
which is Maybelline falsies volume
Express mascara
and I applied this to both my top and
bottom lashes
okay so now that the makeup look is
complete I would suggest bringing two
things along first a chapstick or lip
gloss I always have chapstick because my
lips are always chapped and then you can
also bring your pressed powder for
controlling any shine
so I'll show you what I did for my hair
but i'm just going to fast-forward
through all the things that I did
because I don't want this video to be
too long so the first thing I did was
just brush out my hair and I decided
that today I would curl it just because
my makeup was so simple and I wanted
pretty hair i guess so i was going for
miley cyrus inspired waves so i parted
my hair down the middle but i actually
ended up just parting my hair a
different way later on which you can
probably see in my blog so i don't know
but that's always pretty if you part
your hair down the middle and just do
wavy curls so for my heat protectant I
use this really cool paul mitchell
product and it works as a heat
protectant and also a hairspray so i
thought it was a really cool thing
and then I just used my Connor infinity
and turned it up to the second highest
level and just started curling my hair
I wasn't expecting my curls to be this
curly so I was kind of surprised but I
actually really liked them at the end
you
and then here's me spray my face it
actually did get all over my face and it
kind of hurt
so you can tell that i have pretty tight
curls and then at the very end I just
ran my fingers through them so that they
weren't all bunched up together like
that and they ended up being really
pretty so I really like these curls and
I hope you guys did too so here is my
blog now I hope you guys enjoy it
