style we're going to be doing a USC like
Q&amp;amp;A I asked you guys to leave me
questions on my blog channel and I got a
bunch of questions that I'm gonna have
to like sort through so we answer them
which items food clothes electronics etc
- you're grabbing my college we live in
a suite so we have like two individual
bathrooms who don't have a communal
style and it brought like a shower caddy
and I never used that essentially all
myself in the shower so I was really you
slit yeah I use my shower caddy I
brought like a bunch of like Tupperware
and stuff and I never use that yeah I
also brought too much storage which
items you wish you had brought with you
I needed like a bed like memory has a
bed lamp right there I didn't bring a
bed lamp with me to like read so when I
was reading on my bed like I didn't have
anything yeah I didn't bring my mirror
so I I asked my mom to shut that one
home I said that was gonna break that my
mom told me not to there's no there's no
though yeah they're like a dollar yeah
which items were surprisingly useful my
laundry hamper oh yeah it's like
two-sided so sex mine yeah my even darks
it is so helpful I really like this like
storage unit wasn't hard to get in I've
gotten asked this question like this
yeah sometimes I watch you know we don't
actually know yeah like the acceptance
rate is like what 20 percent its 17.8%
but um I work at the emission centers
you know I know a lot of the stats and
obviously like it's not easy to get in
like it's not eighty percent of people
gonna get it like it's competitive just
like every college yeah this point um
like we don't know if it was hard for us
personally and again like with our like
I don't know to be honest to be honest
like from my high school my high school
took one with the top like five schools
that like feeds into USC so for me I
like kind of felt like okay like I based
on the people have gotten in like I'm
kind of in that pool so I like it pretty
much like this is bad to say but I kind
of like expected out get in yeah see I
didn't have that at all so I had no idea
like for all the schools that I applied
to I was like I could get in but I also
very yak about it I didn't count on
anything like don't expect they're gonna
get anywhere just so that's what makes
it easier on you because you can expect
like it's just gonna turn out badly I
guess like basically if you're like the
top 10% of your school you'll get a
pretty good chance cuz it's also based
on schools like yeah vigils I didn't
even have ranking so I couldn't even
think
Alley um but just do your best feel is
it fun to live on campus and in a dorm
yes
what housing options us you have and
what would you recommend
okay we have three styles of housing
it's residential residence hall which is
kind of took your typical one long hall
Holloway like doors branching off with
that two people and every like room and
in the communal bathrooms then you have
suite style which we're in which is like
usually I totally asked the right person
the glass yeah I only it's like atatürk
I think in my speech like I just wrote
this like Jerry so sweet Styles like
eight people usually two per room and
then we have two bathrooms so you're
only sharing like four person per
bathroom versus like an entire floor and
the residence hall it shares bathroom
and then third was apartment so there's
a couple housing like apartment
buildings and that's just like more
private but you also get like a kitchen
um attached like your common area like
living room do you know any people that
are in a dorm with someone they don't
like mostly like I don't I don't know
anyone who's a big problem with there so
yeah but it's like all this person so
annoying no I didn't think moved out
yeah because of some yeah yeah um most
people like get it like moved out really
oh no yeah I don't I what Joe's room but
I said where's your other person it's an
empty bed no one moved in like I was so
loved us are their healthy food options
available
yeah gotta find those I don't really
wanna know like if you like they have
salad bars like every single um yeah
yeah they're pretty healthy
uh mostly carbs though or a chunk are
yeah in the cafeteria yeah so I like it
is it hard living so far away from your
family I don't really have a big problem
with it my family's like six hours north
so I mean I have it honestly I haven't
Skype them in like a month and a half
which is bad but I'll just text them for
little things rowing up I was really
independent so like I didn't like call
on them for a lot of stuff so it's been
pretty easy for me to live here and then
like if I have to if I have a problem
with my laptop broke I'll let call my
dad if I want them to like reimburse me
for books and stuff it's like pretty
easy for them to do that my parents
actually like this it pretty often like
a lot so I see them a lot do you know
anyone who does not drink alcohol yeah I
know bunch of people yeah and actually
yeah like a lot of my friends and band
like don't drink at all what you would
think like oh man like those kids go
crazy which like yes we do but also like
there's no pressure like
but are good things you can do to make
your application for college look good
us use on the common app so you get to
write like a little supplement about USC
because usually it depending on which
school you apply to like engineering
like Dramatic Arts like business you
write like a different supplement and
one of them is pretty much going to be
like why USC and for that one like for
me like what you should do this is a
prohibition counselor so you can trust
this find specific things at the school
that like you really connect to and if
you should like show where you're gonna
fit in at USC it's a lot easier for them
to be like well this kids like qualified
and they like would do a lot here so I
would say a way to make yourself stand
out and like in general um I would say
like be as low run it as possible like
like I think of roan yeah this bullying
volunteering is important like
extracurricular they're pretty important
yeah what's the best part of college
there are so many times I get to meet
really really cool people like whether
it's just like I've met my dream is to
work at Disney so many of you can set
that out that's great but like mom so I
Disney as like a really good connection
with USC and I've met so many alumni
from here that have gone to work at
Disney and like they're so welcoming I
got to see the interview roll premiere
for free like I met Seth Rogen James
Franco like just crazy things happen
because USC is like so connected so I
think it's just like those concert
minders are like why you're here in
general like on USC related what would
you say like like you're super
independent so you have a good time to
actually like figure out what you want
to do with your life and like who you
want to be sounds really like corny but
yeah pretty true yeah that's at the
point of view being of students figure
out what you want and I talked to
everyone and they'll teach your student
that like willing to talk to you once
you're like out of college you try to
talk someone that's like in the
workforce they'll be like you try to get
a job but what are you doing but if your
student your psyche I just want to see
what you're doing it like they'll be
really really welcoming yeah okay
opinions on USC Greek life or both not
yeah I'm not because I like thought I
was going to be in Greek life um but
it's like pretty expensive which I wish
could justify us he has a ridiculously
expensive like these like I don't even
know what it is and I don't want to know
like I actually I'm still considering
rushing next year yeah it's not really
sure it's not like I have like a
distaste for anything like I understand
like I mentioned the point of it
um and like everyone I know it has had
like a pretty good experience with it
does anyone else have a hard time in
college being a non-party person there's
so much to do like there are always a
theater show or like a music performance
or like some sort of like open mic or
like you can always go like see a movie
go downtown like there's so much do
that's what's nice about being in LA
like you can just go get like Korean
barbecue one night they don't want to go
out or anything
yeah or every night but there's no issue
if you don't want to go out I think the
biggest thing that you would need to do
is just like find a group of people who
also don't go out also it gets kind of
exhausting going out all the time yeah
like you do kind of get over it like
it's there's like a honeymoon phase of
like yeah this is college but yeah
honestly like you'll you'll find that
like other things are more worthwhile
house marching band Catherine's
marching band is my favorite I love it
so much I'll I recommend whatever
college you go to mark join the marching
band but if you come to us II liked
especially join the marching band cuz
you'll meet me ah
so how can I manage my time oh my gosh
that's tricky one and when you started
doing this in her videos and she said
like she would like plan out every hour
for day yeah I got the same professor
yeah do that and I was actually doing
that like before he told us to do that
and changed my life in college like you
need to make sure that you're not
wasting your time just thinking about
what you're gonna do and you actually
just do it during that time whenever I
plan out my days it's actually pretty
not that flexible so it's like I'll get
it done if I do it but sometimes I just
don't want to so I'm like I kinda want
to stay be more flexible so if you like
a balance between us you yeah it would
be really good that's actually good to
rate on a scale of 1 to 10 on how good
the food is at the cafeteria what's
what's a 10 just based off like your
favorite restaurant okay if 10 like my
favorite restaurant dining hall is like
a 6 yeah I was gonna be like a 5 or
something I don't know sometimes it's
pretty good and sometimes it's just like
tear I can pretty much just count on it
to like have something like you can
always count on the pizza I don't need
the pits anymore and I also donate the
donuts but if you're all of those those
are my staples so is theirs
yeah the donuts are my
yeah they have a lot of really really
good carbs but like that's why I like
yeah not always like a lot of like lean
proteins yeah
salad they always have a good variety
like drinks though so yeah like juices
and stuff
yeah they got you what does your gym
look like actually our gym sucks yeah I
wouldn't know I've literally gone there
one time I tried to find you of the
class couldn't find it locked Ali yeah
I'll totally go yoga with you if you
want I'll like track is always opens a
bit to run yeah that's easy with you if
you want to like exercise or like go
running outside it's nice yeah
but the gym is just not that nice yeah
we really nice cool yeah it's only
yesterday you guys how secure is your
campus super secure now it's a closed
campus past 9:00 p.m. so unless you have
an ID you can't get on campus and I need
a really strict about them yeah they
always have security guards like off
campus within like a two-mile radius I
get every corner sink making sure you're
okay it's like because you as he's on
the best neighborhood yeah it's better
they have like yeah security how do you
get motivated to do homework in
assignments and become a good student oh
I've been struggling with that yeah so
have I have really been friend with that
motivations like so hard like a lot of
times I'll be like okay I'm gonna read
this before I go to bed and then I'm
like in bed and I'm like I can't read
this yeah there are like spurts where
I'll just be super motivated and then
late when the time comes to actually do
it I'm just like a lot of times it's
just like the act of just like getting
your stuff out yeah like writing down
like the prompt and then like starting
to read like you just taken the steps to
begin the work is like the hardest part
of it for me um but like for overall
like motivation I remember I was in high
school I just really wanted to get into
a good college and I was like that
seriously pushed me so hard yeah that
did a lot but like now that I'm in
college just like whoa yeah but yeah
because honestly your GPA isn't like
super important especially for business
yeah this is like I'm gonna get MBA at
some point I think that is important but
like a lot of it's your experience yeah
so like I would someone told me as like
an investment banker like he didn't
invest in things like the hardest part
of business like the most elite like
most competitive and he didn't put his
GPA he worked really hard and got like a
three nine which is like really really
accomplished and he didn't put it on his
resume which is kind of strange and when
he was interviewing not a single person
asked him about his GPA which is like
weird like you think they were on no but
they just trust
because of all the stuff he had done on
campus all of his like internships and
stuff so it's more about just getting
those things yeah but also that really
depends on the major like oh yeah is
that really like major pre-med or
something your GPA pre-med you have a
lot of requirement as what else yeah
are you homesick a lot I have never
really been homesick here like homesick
where I'm like crying and like I feel
like just crap I didn't like on homesick
but I think like having stuff like from
home homes and stuff because I have like
my blanket yeah
and it's like the nice I like look
through my photos and that is how did
you find it going to such a huge state
school well we're not a stance for we're
private um which i think makes a huge
difference um I'm also de Berkeley I
like that would've been a very different
experience um personally the 18-thousand
sounds like a ton with my high schools
at 2000 but I always see when I'm
walking in campus yeah and I like you so
many I always I feel like it doesn't
feel that big yeah I know how it's so
big no it doesn't feel that because a
lot of times like all the freshmen live
on campus there's like a smaller
community there and like within your
major within like your other stuff like
it just it breaks down a lot so it
doesn't feel that big honestly I don't
know what 30,000 would be like but
18,000 like isn't is it huge yeah I mean
like we don't have anything to compare
to yeah it doesn't feel like that much
just being here having its Greek life I
would actually say it's pretty big it's
right it's like big offense
it's 22 percent for some sleep social
aspects it's pretty big yeah like I've
definitely gotten the like Oh what house
are you and I'm not in a house like some
people think I'm in a sorority I'm like
no I'm not yeah no no no like people
would be like wow you're not in a
sorority that's so like I totally like
wouldn't think that of yeah it's just
like obviously so it's like a big deal
like in that way the last question I'm
thinking about applying either USC or
UCLA me both good and so it made you
choose USC over UCLA or any other good
schools okay
I I applied to UCLA but only because for
the UC at me because of this only
because you see act like you just click
all the boxes yeah so like once you're
applying to one of the schools I was I
was trying to go to Berkeley and like
you can just click all the rest of them
so it's like why not I never even to
reduce Elaine because they don't have
graduate business so they were kind of
off my list and honestly I didn't get
into UCLA which I'm not heard about cuz
I got into Berkeley which i think is
like a better school yeah and that's
like the only one I would have
considered going to but um I'm not gonna
bash UCLA it's just like a different
vibe over there
yeah for me like I got into UCLA and I
was like choosing between USC and UCLA
everyone was telling me to go to UCLA
because in like Alaska and like some
other parts of like the u.s. not a lot
of people know us yeah it's not big for
some reason yeah that's for sure like
people do know UCLA more as a research
institution versus USC I didn't choose
Berkeley because it it wasn't in LA and
I wanted to be in LA and I honestly
didn't choose UCLA because I went on
campus and I just felt like it was
extremely big I felt really small there
so that's something that made me want to
choose USC and also like coming from out
of state I'd be paying yeah how does get
ready Stanford private if you're coming
out of state like why would you go to a
public school in state you're going to
be paying more than like your private
education yeah so that's why I chose USC
personally and yeah I didn't even have
the option but I just knocked it out of
my list pretty quickly yeah alright so
that's basically all the time that we
have for questions right now if you guys
want to see more on kathryn go subscribe
to her channel and we're also gonna be
doing a collab on your channel yeah so
be sure to subscribe to her and I hope
you guys enjoy this video and I'll talk
