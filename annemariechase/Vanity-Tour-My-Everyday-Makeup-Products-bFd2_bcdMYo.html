you guys like a tour of my vanity that
is behind me right now all of the
products on my vanity right now our
products that I use like on a daily
basis so these are basically the
products that are really relevant to my
makeup life so yeah I thought this is a
really good way to show you guys what
products I've been using a lot and also
just to give you like a tour and show
you guys what's on my vanity so I hope
you guys enjoy it and I will talk to you
very soon hey guys so I'm going to be
doing my vanity tour and I'm just going
to show you a quick overview before I
actually like going to like the stuff on
the manatee so all of this is Callie's
room and if you guys don't know who that
is it's my sister she's in college so I
kind of asked to take over her room and
she was fine with it so this is my
little portion of her room so I'm gonna
go ahead and show you where all my
furniture is from so I was actually
given this chair by my friends so I'm
pretty sure this is from Ikea and I
really love it um it's just like a cheap
chair but I think it like serves its
purpose well and I think it actually
looks pretty nice and then I just got
this pillow try to the focus it more I
just got this pillow from the nordstrom
like home décor section and it was on
sale for um 1898 off of thirty-eight
dollars so i thought this is really
pretty and it also has um polka dots on
the back so i thought that was really
cute this is the haworth vanity from
pier 1 imports you can buy the mirror
and then like the Vanity itself the dust
part and the chair separately or the
stool but I got them all together and
they were discounted I don't know there
was like a holiday discount but then
also I got the credit card or I signed
up for the credit card which gave you
like twenty percent off your entire
purchase for your entire first purchase
so that's what I did so it ended up
being like 700 something dollars it was
kind of pricey
but i did buy it with my own money you
can like see my like gestures in the
mirror and this is Callie's like messy
room it's not my fault sorry I guess I
could clean it for her I'll do that
someday it was kind of expensive but I
mean I think it's worth that I think
it's really really really pretty and
I've actually been using it quite a bit
this I think was from costco I'm pretty
sure my mom got me that so I'm actually
really considering taking this out
because I feel like this is very cramped
and I don't really like it very cramped
so yeah I'm gonna go into the actual
vanity and what is on my vanity like I
said these are all things that I use
everyday or could use every day so I
like I switch up when I use every day
but these are all being used like daily
or weekly the first day I have are my
brushes and I separated them from face
brushes in this container because my eye
brushes some of them are really small
and I was like just losing them and I
didn't know where they went and then
they ended up being like tucked in here
so I separated them and I put them in a
smaller Bowl and that has really helped
me to not lose all my brushes and I'm
gonna go sit down so this was actually
made by cali and pottery I don't know
where she got this I'm assuming that she
got it at target I guess I can show you
like some highlight products that I use
like every single day throughout the
vanity tour and I will do the same for
brushes some very popular brushes for me
are this Real Techniques foundation
brush I use this every single day to put
my foundation on so on days when I'm not
using this brush I use this Sigma round
kabuki f82 brush or powder foundation
with my bare minerals and I also use
this when I'm not using my foundation
and then what else do I use in here I
use this every day for pressed powder
this is the Sigma F 10 brush and then I
also use this everyday for concealer if
i'm doing like liquid makeup and this is
the f 75 brush and i'll try to link all
of these below yeah I willing hold them
below they'll be in the description box
if you guys want to check those out and
then for my eye brushes
I definitely like using my this is
actually not mine but i really like it
it's a mac 217 brush and then I
definitely use this brush the Sigma
short shader eat when T brush because it
is great for applying like packed makeup
on that does not make sense it's great
for like concentrating your eyeshadow so
I apply that like as a face a lot I just
got this brush or this spoolie just a
Mac 2046 got a ton of gift cards to
nordstrom from a birthday and i also i'm
really excited about this brush this is
a 219 and that's kind of it for the
brushes that i use everyday i think and
i guess i use like these eyelash curlers
every day and that i have these really
pretty carnations that i was given by
someone very nice and then moving on to
the actual products so here are all of
the things that i use basically every
single day so I have my 24-hour Revlon
Colorstay i also have this Maybelline
instant age rewind eraser I really like
this for under eye concealer nowadays
and then I just got this poor sessional
benefit primer kind of thing and I
started using that I don't know I have
been poor so I feel like Albie's not a
lot fake up my benefit Urban Decay long
lasting makeup setting spray and then I
also got the big one of this because I
love this so much that I got to be big
what's up what's up what's it called
what's up what um yeah so then I got the
they're real mascara this is my favorite
mascara like it's a very popular mascara
so you guys probably note that is and
also this is my new favorite mascara
except it's not new it's just really
it's like a really old mascara that I've
had that's recently become my favorite
mascara so the NYC big bold mascara and
then i have my lower lashline mascara
and pressed powder bare minerals
foundation okay little fill um mac pearl
frost highlighter I don't know what the
I haven't used this yet i got this
remember
my Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion
and then Mac shrit max shroom I shadow
which I'm really excited I also just got
this and it works really well for an
inner corner highlight and then I also
just got this NARS blush because you
guys may know that I don't use blush
that often but this is like a really
really really pretty color for me what's
it called oops dulce vida and then I
have my white eyeliner which I use like
in a lot of my videos some prime time
from bare minerals and then a bare
minerals mascara so then moving on to my
palettes I have my naked 2 palette and
also my naked 3 palette and I feel like
I always come back to this palette so I
definitely love this palette and I i use
my Too Faced route and beach hit every
single day as well I have my vanilla
cake philosophy lip gloss and I don't
usually wear lip products to school I'll
usually just wear chopsticks but I also
in this drawer I kind of have put some
lipsticks in here that I want to use
more often and that's like the great
thing about having this vanity is that I
use all of these products all the time
because I can see them so well because
they're usually hidden in storage but
now that they're just out in the open I
use them like every single day and it is
really nice because when I want to start
using more of my products I kind of just
throw them in here to remind myself to
use them every once in a while so that's
what I do and oh my gosh my best friend
Rachel got this like the kit of this for
me for my birthday and my nails super
ugly but I'm obsessed with the smell of
this it smells so yummy to me and I'm
usually not too into like sense but I
absolutely love this and all this it
smells so yummy and yeah so that's
basically it these are not things that I
use as often but things that I'm trying
to use up some more because I don't know
I try to use a lot of my makeup and then
I just have tweezers and scissors like
for eyebrows coming and stuff like that
in this drawer and these are like
samples of primer potion so you know
those are basically all the things that
I
currently on my vanity so I hope you
guys like learned a little bit more
about me and my vanity through this
video and I will see you guys very soon

be showing you guys my hair care routine
