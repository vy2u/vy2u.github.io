with my sister Callie the one I got for
Christmas so today I wanted to film what
I got for Christmas video because it was
requested and I made and I also want a
job Callie in a video um because you
guys like her I guess for Christmas my
mom and sister pretty much planned an
entire trip to Asia I didn't do anything
planning logged it up everything really
I helped her find some flights well I
feel like you had more input than I did
please that's what like the basis of
this haul is first we went to Hawaii I
guess then we went to Tokyo for a day
then we went to Korea for like five days
then we're now wearing Thai light and
then finally we're at helix shape and
Singapore for three days yes
you guys want to watch them I've walked
everything pretty much I wasn't that was
just like we weren't actually supposed
to get any other present yeah but this
is actually cast year of college so my
parents want to spoil her and that
really benefited me as well because if
they buy her one thing they have to buy
me something I feel like christmas is a
time for you know like hanging out with
your family and being grateful and
appreciating your loved ones and
spending time with your loved ones so
while I do not support the
superficiality of these videos it's just
all in good fun oh we can say that after
getting both just christmas presents and
then getting your trip a surprise
present getting a trip is so much better
if like you're just excited to have a
family
and you're doing some really cool and
you're gonna have lasting memories where
it's just like materialistic things yeah
and also sometimes you have no Wi-Fi so
you're literally forces but time with
your mama done watch this so basically
we're gonna show you guys well we got
for Christmas throughout Hawaii Korea
and Tenant
first is lumen I didn't pack anything
for a cold winter weather also my mom is
a fitness instructor so if you like know
any fitness instructors they all get 15%
off baseline at little image but I have
this thing for the holidays where they
give you 25% off and you can buy for
other people because the 15% off thing
it's for yourself but we're the same
size so she gets anyways my pack right
there hello so this is the first thing
that I got it looks ugly right now but
it's actually really cute oh yeah it is
it comes up like kind of high-waisted or
crop top but it's not it's like a bed
between E it's really nice and warm and
it's good material this is like it's
like those neck things you know that
turtle that could like almost a turtle
like breakfast at tiffany's style
they always help unconventional pockets
that's a dead thing we bought a ton of
stuff Lululemon because traveling with
stuff Lululemon is is so smart quality
it's like really just yeah you can wear
them wash things and move in them and
like it'll this stays it's the clinic
where so it's like comfortable too but
also stylish so I got these sweats and
ass I didn't really like care for night
my first but none the lady who's helped
me was wearing them and she had the
q-tip and all and she was like oh put
your head in my pocket really though you
know how you have to wear pants and on
planes because it's so cold but like
these will just keep you warm but also
very comfortable because that lady I was
gonna get either these or that green
color in these and I've had little lemon
pants before but these are so stretchy I
have no idea like Oh
oh really it's just in a different color
oh yeah that's actually why I got these
I was looking for these ones but I got
these ones out see they're gonna get
this color or the green color but that
lady talked me into this one cuz she was
like oh with your skin tone you'll
probably wear these ones because they're
high-waisted and they're just like so
the material it's just amazing they're
unlike other lulo pants yeah Tyrael is
just so comfy okay and the last thing
that I got from Lululemon was this
backpack I got it for hiking but I've
actually used it on this trip so much
like every one of us has it's a perfect
a trip very perfect for traveling it's
really sturdy in the back and it has
like a lot of pockets for all your
different stuff it has a lot of bottle
holder pockets and yeah it's like
waterproof material you know how torso
is wear backpacks when you wearing that
you don't really look like a turret yeah
it's really like nice it looks like
we're going it looked really good on you
yeah it looks good on you too and I got
these shorts because you know yeah these
are really cute these have really cool
like mesh mesh thing yeah the next thing
that we're gonna show you are all from
Korea and they're all like Korean beauty
products yeah cuz whenever we're gonna
create we gosh stock up on those beauty
things apparently to have higher like oh
yeah so be a podcast I listen to from
stuff you should know my hat stuff works
like religiously they had an episode
about how makeup works and the u.s.
allows all chemicals unless they find
something wrong with it then they'll ban
it but Europe and Asia or like kind of
the opposite so they'll like ban it
first and then allowed to go afterwards
so basically the u.s. makeup is like
really inferior to a lot like all that
makeup the goals
yeah lots of chemicals and stuff so
that's why we love Korean makeup because
first of all there's so much R&amp;amp;D that
goes into it because it's such a huge
thing in Korea but also because they're
just using like superior products we
also get a lot of samples literally
throw the samples in there like so the
first place that we went to was Club
Cleo Cleo is literally the best my
favorite brands so the first thing we
got is the
mango autumn avocado body cream there
was a sample of it and it smelled so
good but then I put it on my hand and
then for the rest of the day my hand was
just like beautiful wait you should be
this on my nose and see if they can
actually tell okay so then the next
thing I got was this nose up shading and
they had one for contouring and
highlighting but like highlighting your
nose is so easy the hard part is
contouring it so that's why I just got
the contouring one you kind of click it
and then you kind of like go like oh
there you are
did look okay the next things that we
got were the pro layering palettes I got
the originality this is what it looks
like cool is is called what's this
called I have to hear it out Callie
you're smart girl the same on the back
here are the girls yeah the colors with
this hand crafts oh okay apparently
these are really popular for club Clio
and I this looks like very versatile
colors yeah it has a good mix of matte
and shimmer and this cool brush Oh guys
messing with yours so I got this
eyeliner from Club Clio last year we
went to Korea and I used it every single
day like I use it for a literally a year
and and never ran out
I never dried up it was just it's just
like how it's been finding shine right
it's like a felt pen Athiya brush liner
but it's waterproof it's really easy to
use and it's like what they're known for
I think one of the things are known for
but yeah it's really good I tried
getting Laura Mercier one that's exactly
the same and it stopped working act like
a month for the next place that we
bought stuff from was skin food so I'm
big on like skin related things cuz I
have oily skin
so I was trying to get a face mask that
was a black sugar and then they talked
us into this serum like for a really
really long time so I was like okay I'll
just take it like they're like this is
much better than your face
mouse and then they came with a bunch of
cotton ball pods because apparently
Korea has good cotton they said it would
really help my pores I've big pores so
the next thing that I got was peppermint
fresh scalp shampoo and conditioner
because I got green tea shampoo and
conditioner like three years ago from
skin-food
it smells so good and it works really
well and they never had it again and
their scalp support I know it needs help
okay the next one I went to was nature
of public it's pretty popular say we
only know that because there's like a
huge store in Rome which is like the
makeup place
Emery found this bamboo charcoal because
my brushes her teeth with charcoal paste
that is true and supposed to whiten your
teeth
yeah but charcoal is detoxify which is
why they use it but this is really
similar to origins and now you see
origins origins that's how you say the
word origins origins I think but this is
a lot cheaper and probably more national
TV age yeah that's also why she got
sunscreen because of like the whole
whack of chemical or like less chemicals
emphasize that in the podcast yeah
sunscreen is like really really bad yes
but I also got sunscreen but just from
etude house but this is smells delicious
these are fish so that was etude house
and oh you know you got yours dirty
already while we are waiting a line I
look like mom we're gonna yeah but these
are so you can wash your face without
the water getting into your hair some
reason Avery got this well my lips are
really dry in Korea cuz it was so cold
but now they're kind of fine and then
the last place we went to was Holika
Holika this is a new one for us but I've
seen it on a couple of places online so
we went there so lastly we went to a
lanka Holika we didn't mention that it
was a little bit more expensive unless
you bought like in big packs like big
bulk ish it was still expensive
yeah but like that just made it more
expensive and kind of like Carter to buy
for us yeah especially since we're like
sampling things but we walked into the
store and there's a ton of these little
like cute egg thing this is an egg yeah
but like what the heck you got to show
them in the face how a really cute
packaging like they had like Pig
packaging I'm not sure if that means I
hope that doesn't mean there's like pig
in there you know yeah that's true
the thing that was really cool about
this is like the lady puts nipple on her
hand it literally like peeled off dead
skin like you rubbed it around and then
you can see your dents dead skin
floating around yeah and you can even
use on your face yeah I don't know how
you should double-check that yeah we
didn't this says egg bun pop but it's
like Beauty Blender cuz I have those but
they literally cost $20 so I got a like
$3 yeah I did wasn't $3 fell very last
place that we got stuff from was
Thailand the amazing thing about
Thailand is everything's like really
cheap and delicious so we got a bunch of
like elephant pants elephant Birds these
were like six seven hundred baht for
three which is seven dollars each around
some car seats if you're being
conservative and then the these were
also these are like cropped yeah I saw
them literally everywhere only tourists
wear them but like they're so breezy and
come really nice and like you're just
basically wearing pajama pants
everywhere you go so that is what we got
for our Christmas we are very satisfied
yeah beings we know I mean we recognize
that Christmas is different for everyone
everybody I would ever think if you hear
that our toilet is exploding realize
that everyone's Christmas is different
and that people like sometimes really
can't afford thanks for Christmas so
make sure to be charitable during the
holidays yeah there's actually a proven
study that shows that when you give
stuff away you're just your happiness
increases so one thing that our family
really loves to do is to
either our time or money to charities
and organizations to help the less
privileged and if you don't have any
money to give donate your time
volunteering is always an option and if
you don't have any gifts to give to your
friends you can always just give them
experiences if you guys know of any
really cool organizations to donate to
or charities that you like to give money
to leave them in the comments below and
mean County I think I could go through
and like see what once we would like to
give and then that other people other
people could find some that they like so
yeah everyone's a doughnut yeah yeah
okay so basically that is this video we
just wanted to wish you guys merry
holidays happy holidays and also if you
guys want to follow Cali on social media
she didn't ask me to ask to do this but
she has a real fun Instagram why is that
sarcasm cuz it is really fun she's also
