it goes electric baby when I turn it on
all come my city awesome my home with
lion love no stealing when we in the
zone I've got that hey guys its Emory
and I just wanted to wish everyone a
happy summer during the summer time I
always see the what to do during
summertime there was really really fun
ideas like binge watch your favorite
Netflix show builds a fort go to the
beach I can't think anymore those are
definitely all given things that I am
going to do like I yesterday spent all
my day in bed sometimes like yesterday I
literally didn't do anything for like
three straight hours whenever I do like
nothing productive I kind of feel bad
about myself and I get a little bit
anxious and like restless and everyone's
definition of productive should be
different how does it make this video as
a kind of guide for being productive and
whatever it is that you find productive
or just to be a more productive person
in general before we get into the video
be sure to click the subscribe button
that way you get notified whenever I
post new videos I mean I think that's
something that you guys want so I hope
you guys enjoy so the first tip is
starting off right when you wake up and
get out of bed and that is making your
bed every morning
I actually learned this strategy from
one of my classes it's a really cool
commencement speech so I'll link it
below but basically here's what he says
about making the bed if you make your
bed every morning you will have
accomplished the first task of the day
it will give you a small sense of pride
and it will encourage you to do another
task and by the end of the day that one
task completed
will have turned into mini task
completed so if you want to change the
world start off by making your bed what
he said about accomplishing a bunch of
tasks is true because that's what
dopamine does dopamine is that feeling
of accomplishment that you get after you
check something off your to-do list so
this is what will keep you reaching
towards your bigger goals making your
bed every morning or just starting with
something like that for me reading is
always on my summer to-do list but for
some reason I just really don't get to
reading which really really really
frustrates me because there are so many
amazing books that I never want to miss
out on
but with audiobooks you learn the same
content without actually having to sit
down and read a book and this is perfect
for productivity at least for me because
you can do it while you're doing stuff
that requires little thought like
driving an LA traffic or even during
exercising or lounging around or
basically whatever so some books that I
highly highly recommend are the power of
habit I read this a few years ago but
this book basically talks about habits
and how paying attention to your habits
can have a huge impact on your life and
then lean in by Sheryl Sandberg this
book is so amazing especially for a
woman but also for guys and then the two
books that I'm going to listen to next
are the tipping point how little things
can make a big difference and more the
productivity project because my friend
Katherine recommended it and it is
extremely relevant for this topic I've
talked about audible in multiple
previous videos and they finally hooked
my viewers up with a free 30-day trial
with one free audiobook download so feel
free to use my link to get a free
audiobook and let me know if you're
gonna listen to any of these books in
the comments so we can talk about it and
I'll let you know how I like the next
two books that I'm going to listen to if
you subscribe to a site like audible
they charge you monthly I think just
reminder that audible does charge on a
monthly basis just like any other
subscription website so if you want to
continue you will be charged after that
month just taking you up for you guys
please please let these pants fit
alright so this next one is for you if
you're really trying to get into the
habit of working out or even to do
anything consistently every day so I
took a method from Seinfeld
called Seinfeld's productivity method or
you basically think of something that
you want to do every single day whether
it be exercise it's definitely fit a
while ago or just right for five minutes
which was Seinfeld thing that he wanted
to do it doesn't matter you just have to
make sure it's something attainable that
you can do every day so after you
complete that task you X the day in red
pen on a visible calendar and then after
that just don't break the chain
the next tip is going back to working
out I've definitely noticed that when
I'm working out consistently I'm not
only more happy overall but also much
more productive throughout the day the
most effective workout schedule for me
is a combination of cardio and
weightlifting I think that it's the
quickest way to burn fat and to build
stronger bones and also the fastest way
for me to be able to tell and see a
difference when I am working out and to
stay on track I found a workout buddy
who is also very committed to working
out every day which is super helpful for
those days that I just do not want to
work out at all and that is my boyfriend
Jacob oh as I heard okay I was like some
new dances that you're come out with
thank you sue okay and so far we've been
working out almost pretty much every day
I skipped a few days but if you don't
have a workout buddy then no worries you
can always just use the Seinfeld method
to motivate yourself to work out every
day all right guys this is the end of
video I really hope you guys found at
least one thing that was helpful and
being more productive or inspiring to be
more productive this summer and if you
did please give it a thumb up if you
have any recommendations or like
suggestions on tips on how to be more
productive whether it be like a book an
audiobook a podcast a technique or like
a method that you use please leave them
in the comments below so that I can
check them out
and so that the rest of like this little
community can check those methods out as
well and be sure to like thumbs ups
