what day three of moving for me
hello Michelle here is gonna help me
explain our parking situation cuz I
tried doing it but I was just like
really confused so I didn't know how so
we're just gonna rant about our housing
company mosaic
they're making us pay her for parking
spots yeah I mean we only paid for two
there are two tandem parking spots too
so they're not even like real parking
spots and then also the thing that I was
like super confused about is that on
your guys's thing it said $100 like the
original contract and then they bumped
it up to 195 yeah first person when you
don't even have cars there and you
didn't ask for the parking where are you
under though yeah what the heck so they
bumped up the price for these two extra
parking spots when I asked to reserve
one parking spot like obviously at the
price that they're paying they bumped up
the price and then they said that we got
to ten and parking spots when like I
only reserved one cuz like I knew that I
only had one car why would I get two and
then I'll have two cars they said that I
reserved ones for Zoe or that they
called Zoe and asked her like oh hey
amber you got a parking spot do you want
one and she said yeah like what that
didn't happen yeah why would she do that
she literally does not have a car they
say that there's history at and spots
there but there's literally no room for
a car yeah like it actually if I might
go
I might go show them and then there's
like a little shed type thing it's an
addition to this actual physical house
and then they're saying that they're
gonna build another house during this
school year so there's gonna be
construction noise and concerns like
right behind us the entire year like
right by your room bed
yeah I'm gonna go show you guys what
we're talking about you guys can see
okay thank you for explaining that
Michelle I'm just gonna be honest I
already wore this outfit earlier but
it's because I'm moving and I can't find
my clothes okay this is the garage that
they say they're gonna build an entirely
new house on so this is gonna be a
construction site too supposed to fit
four cars in here and like that's right
now even I wouldn't be able to fit my
car in this spot the moral the story is
that student housing just tries to screw
over college students because they're
like oh these people don't know how to
take care of themselves they're not
really adult yet so why not I just got
back from like this little cafe that I
go to in Koreatown because we don't have
internet right now there's just so many
things that you have to buy that you
don't really think about as a college
student because you're like parents
usually buy them or something we had to
buy Internet we have to pay for
utilities we have to pay for parking
that we don't want I don't know if we
explained it very well but basically
they said that I reserved two spots and
knowing me I just would never do that I
wouldn't want to spots for myself
because I'd have to pay double so I'd
have to pay for two spots each month I
always try hard to save as much money as
possible I'm sharing like a tiny room
that to twin sized beds really can't
even fit in I'm pretty frugal I don't
spend too much money I do spend a lot of
my own money going out to eat and stuff
but for unnecessary things I like really
don't
I like save a lot of money because
that's just like how I was raised
that's why I just get so frustrated when
I have to pay for things that I that are
just like absolutely unnecessary like
the parking situation
Zoey signed the second part of the
tandem parking spot because they had
like an extra spot to sign and they just
kept sending this action needed actually
needed actually needed email and so we
thought that we had to sign that even
though like we didn't so they're trying
to get as much money as possible from
college students because they just know
that they can so I just really strongly
disagree with that I think the strongest
companies are always companies that put
the customer first like Nordstrom
I don't know I just hate companies like
this so I'm just hoping that the rest of
living with mosaic goes a lot smoother
and I know that I do have some USC
viewers so you guys can learn from my
mistakes I don't really know like what
other housing company would be good but
I am hungry now cuz I haven't eaten like
anything all day actually so I'm
actually gonna order some uber eats
yesterday when I was driving back from
work with Katherine she suggested that I
get cruller doughnuts because we were
talking about churros and these are
churros with like some type of cream in
them and like bananas and it just looks
so good so I think I'm gonna get that
and then a veggie burger
oh I actually also bought I forgot this
is the point of why I think I flip this
open
I bought a dresser on the free for sale
page that I showed you guys and it was
$30 I just hope it's in good condition
if it's like a really crappy then I'll
be like kind of angry but Michelle was
likely there cuz he contacted me he was
like yeah I need it kind of gone soon
and I was like oh I just got to this
cafe so she offered to just open the
door basically and then they brought it
into the room so when we get back we
will be able to see it here's the little
dresser actually it's a pretty big
dresser I'm pretty pleased with the size
and I have no idea how to move in
because I know that's always gonna come
with all of her stuff and it's kind of
all just gonna get shifted but for now I
think I'm gonna move this dresser to
that wall and then move that desk to
this wall and then Michelle brought up a
really good point of both of our beds
being in an L like I have to add an
entire twin size bed that way so we're
thinking that it'll probably block off
the entire entrance to the bathroom so
that'll be fun to see what happens there
but you know it's like kind of well
rough around the edges literally but I
think it'll work
yeah I think this looks really good my
Lewbert eats just came and I wash a bed
so it's so good this is what Catherine
recommended and then
is the veggie burger here's what this
looks like but I haven't been eating
cheese so this might kind of I don't
know how I feel about this okay
Catherine is totally right this is
delicious usually when I order twenty
dollars worth of new breed's like I
always split it because it's like
honestly just too much but it was yummy
and then our friend Elliot actually went
over and brought Zoe's mattress that she
bought from someone into the room and
every single person who walks in this
room is like you guys are not gonna be
able to fit but I kind of think we will
so we'll see stressing out a little bit
just cuz I know that we're not gonna
really have that much space so one thing
that I got a little bit annoyed about
during the time when so and I lived
together was that I felt like the space
was shared unequally so I'm kind of
assuming that all have a lot more stuff
this time so I've gone around and tried
to divide everything up evenly so that
if one person has too much stuff it'll
be really obvious and they'll just have
to fit it somewhere because this is a
really small room and there's no storage
so I think that all mitigates conflict
because I'm literally dividing
everything into two even if our
furniture isn't shared it's just like
such a small space that even having
furniture here is like kind of a big
deal so like if I'm choosing to have a
desk I'm going to split it so this will
be her drawer and then I'll put my stuff
in there and then I think we have like a
lot another little storage unit from
last year and then in the bathroom it's
a little confusing so yeah I even did
this for the door this would be my stuff
this will be her little hanging thing I
think I have more of those I kind of
need them for every single door I
literally didn't pay for any of this so
if you know how or where I got it let me
know and which block you saw it in I
also fixed this little thing because
whoever put it together put it on
backwards
then I added this little basket is
literally like a bike basket I think and
I put all the cleaning appliances there
cuz I didn't really want it with all of
our like hair stuff so I thought that
that was a good place for it
that is fine
literally just trying to be creative
with finding space so that two people
can fit in this room which is actually
like it's kind of fun but also just a
pain so now one that she gets here it's
just gonna be like oh okay so I'm
organizing the bathroom oh it's a vlog
so and I are talking and we're
experimenting with the layout of this
room cuz I told her what I thought so
she asked me to push the couches so she
could see via FaceTime so you're gonna
be standing right next to her
I'll show them you and then I'm gonna
come back to me we all know that smell
supports a horrible idea it looks so
gross
it's it's so tacky you're crazy I'm
showing her what I think we should do we
want to try to put like uh bookshelves
or like those cube things with the
shelves and the boxes on this wall and
so we wanted to move this couch so we're
trying to figure out the best way so so
I suggested she's also not here so this
is a horrible idea she can't really be
blamed just cause she can't really see
so she wants these couches to be
touching okay and then that way we'll
have room for the barstools which we
need because there's no other eating
space and then if we decide to put like
a TV over there or just like a monitor
that we can all watch TV from there
and then I'm gonna show you guys what I
want to do here's the layout that I'm
thinking so you have the door the couch
this couch blocking that the barstools
would fit all right there and then the
beautiful thing is we've created storage
and the little chimney thing and then
along in this entire wall like if we put
a bookshelf or like bookshelves along
this wall
it comes out less than the couch so we'd
have more space and okay sweet alright
anyways bye
hey guys okay so it is I think day four
of moving in and today I had work for
the half-day so it was really busy but
our bosses ended up buying US lunch and
we had to take them to go because my
carpool person person I was driving had
a phone interview so we got all the
goodies didn't even eat it cuz I also
got a smoothie and so I'm not even
hungry right now but today when I walked
in the house it just felt so much more
homey and we actually got two packages
on the front steps so I'm gonna see what
they are right now cuz I didn't actually
look yeah this is my bed frame and I
think Zoey's came into summer bring hers
in now this is actually awesome because
these bed frames were supposed to come
in on Friday and it is currently
Thursday so I will be able to have my
entire bed all set up and ready because
this bed frame also came early and just
knowing me I'm probably gonna try to set
up as always bed frame too because then
the whole room will look more together
but I'm just gonna prioritize my stuff
for now and then see five time cuz I I
just don't really have time if I'm gonna
get everything done by Friday so that's
tomorrow so yeah I'm excited I think
we're gonna make some progress today
I'm gonna work on this all night as well
as editing cuz I haven't posted a video
so this is the before I am now going to
try to put together my bed frame ready
we're in a time this it is now
3:20 unboxing probably not the best way
to open a box definitely
okay so I finished the bed frame it's
444 so I mean that's not too bad for
just doing it myself now I have
absolutely no room in this room but I'm
excited because I got my bed done a
whole lot earlier than I thought I would
I thought I was gonna have to like wait
around for this on Friday and but yeah
I'm so excited this looks really good
and it does look like there's a good
amount of storage underneath even is
little thing can fit
I honestly might just put zoe's together
so I can see like exactly how the space
is I don't know yet but I mean I
probably will depending probably okay I
think I just decided that I'm gonna make
that we've been for her so it is now 609
and I finished
Zoey's bed so here's what it looks like
she's actually getting her wisdom teeth
out like a few days before she comes
down so I think she'll still be on like
medication I was like yeah I just
finished making your bed so you have
somewhere to sleep and you don't have to
do it yourself on your meds I think I'm
pretty good roommate but yeah the update
is is that I set up the bed
Swiffer swept the floors but then I
brought a whole another suitcase in here
with like my mirror and some clothes
it's like 9 o'clock my watch is still
dead but I'm at the point where I'm like
a little bit overwhelmed trying to make
this little space livable but also like
really cute and functional I don't know
if that's the right word but Michelle's
parents just installed Wi-Fi so that's a
really good thing it could actually edit
here if I have my clean sheets that
would make my bed but I'm gonna get them
from Jacobs and I'm just gonna go now
tomorrow's Friday and the last day I
have to decorate it so we'll see how
I guess
okay so I'm not gonna show my face cause
I just fell asleep last night without
showering and I need to today but I
thought I'd move some stuff first so
here's the progress of my room this is
pretty much the last day that I have to
kind of move stuff in not really sure I
think I'm just gonna move in as best I
can and then kind of just throw
everything under the better in the hall
I don't know until I get back so let's
see what we can do at least I found my
sheets though so these were here the
whole time I just didn't know myself but
I want to show you guys I'm doing this
video behind the scenes behind the
camera disaster but I love this new
duvet cover from society sex it's so
cute
so I've actually never had a tapestry
before but now that I have one it's just
so clear that it's so easy to decorate
your room by getting a tapestry
I found us the Resco watch a video now
that I got my bed done I'm trying to
find the rest of the art for my bedroom
I just have so many boxes so I'm gonna
try to find it now
got it on the first try isn't miss like
the coolest print it's a canvas print
but me and my roommate are both from
Alaska and so I just really loved this
print it really reminds me of Alaska
I mean clearly but this is like giving
some real Alaskan vibes I don't know I
just really like it okay but this is the
cool thing about society6 is that you
can look up where you're from cuz this
is what I did I literally typed in
Alaska and find some really really cool
stuff
okay today's a little bit stressful
because I have to film this video
actually all today I think I have to
finish it so that's what I'm gonna be
doing it's like five for 52 and I have a
free time when no one's here to film I
don't mind like I would be able to film
it or I'd have to with other people but
it's just nicer it's like five that's
very much nearing the time where the Sun
Goes Down in California so I might not
be vlogging that much but we'll see so
lots of updates in this room but it is
about seven o'clock I literally have not
eaten all day because I was just trying
to film as much as this video as
possible because this is the last day
that I can do it but I need to do this
video by next Thursday so just a sneak
peek but you I don't know I'm really
happy with how it's coming along with a
décor but since I'm filming this video
I'm literally just moving all the stuff
from one area to another when I need to
film in that area so it's kind of
stressful because that means that I'm
not actually like doing much to clean it
up but I think that I actually can do a
lot of cleaning up now that I know like
kind of where I'm putting stuff I think
that this will be like my last little
round before I'm done I put some trash
bags on the window cuz it was ruining my
lighting earlier Jacob was helping me
film and put stuff up which is really
nice with him but I'm waiting for needs
now literally a lifesaver I'm not even
kidding
super excited cuz I'm so hungry food is
here and how many barstools and my stuff
is all over the place
I will show you hungry this is what I
got that's salmon and then it came with
a free burger so I was like okay give
that to Jacob I'm not eating pickles
your night let's cheddar cheese pickles
you don't like pickles right yeah yeah
did you no okay guys I think that this
is pretty much as moved and as I'm going
to get for now and then I'm gonna give
Joey her time to move in and then I will
meet back up with her yeah I feel like I
dragged this on quite a bit but I just
wanted to thank everyone who watched
this vlog because I was actually moving
a lot of the stuff within this room by
myself and it would have been really
really lonely but um this honestly kept
me very entertained just updating you
guys and vlogging so thank you so much
for accompanying me on this moving
journey I hope you guys enjoyed it and I
don't know I had a lot of fun doing this
like more fun than any other vlog I
think I've done it was just very much a
very entertaining vlog so thank you so
much for allowing me to show you guys
around and take you guys along I'm
really liking how it's coming out so far
and I think Zoey liked it too so
hopefully we can each find our space but
to make the process easier for her
moving in she's got her wisdom teeth out
so I don't know how she's gonna be like
feeling or she's gonna move in a lot but
I labeled everything because I really
wanted to split it up evenly I got yours
mine stuff I need to go through and then
shared that's like the only thing that I
really didn't get to shared shared we're
actually going to share my laundry
hamper now because it's like it has a
little divide and we literally just
cannot fit another laundry hamper
anywhere else I move this mirror to the
outside so we can I think I have more of
these but I just can't find them so I
might still have a suitcase at Jacobs
place I think I do
so I'll have to like look for that then
I have the closet is always half that
way I have my clothes and then I have
this is my drawer this is Zoey's and
then this is
we shared storage then for the dresser
Zoe's yours shared shared and that's how
that one looks like even the little
hangers and then actually I might trade
those for the towels
I don't move those 12 still making noise
Zoe's shared mine and hers yeah so I
don't know I think I think this room is
looking really good thank you guys again
