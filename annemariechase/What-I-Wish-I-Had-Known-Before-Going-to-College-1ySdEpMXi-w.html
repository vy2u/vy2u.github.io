very short series of events were so
important in the deciding of whether I
would have to extend my graduation and
take an entire another semester or just
take these online classes everyone
welcome back to my channel my name is
anne-marie if you don't know that by now
then it looks like you should probably
subscribe to this channel so that you
can expect regular videos from me that
was a good one huh
so I've been really excited to film this
video because I haven't filmed or posted
in so long which I will kind of explain
why in this video but most importantly I
will be sharing some really great
insight that I learned that I really
wish I had known to make the best
decision for really just what I want to
get out of my college career I have a
feeling my hair will be changing a lot
in this video so just letting you know I
personally feel like I have done college
really strategically and kind of well
like I mentioned in my why I left
college video which if you haven't seen
it definitely go check it out I said in
that video that I really see college is
kind of a milestone that I need to kind
of reach and attain because I know that
it'll bring me closer to what I want to
do as my future career even if I don't
know what that is right now if you have
the same mindset as me or if you think
you'll ever be in the same situation
then I think that this video will be
really helpful to watch this all started
when I took a leave of absence first
semester basically from that I just knew
that I would have to make up those units
somehow so not only am i missing an
entire semester unplanned but I went to
school in Alaska and I don't know if it
was just me or my friend group but no
one really stressed the importance of
taking the AP test I took 11 AP or IB
classes and I didn't take a single AP
test so I came in to college with zero
units and on top of that I have not been
taking the max amount of units that I
could have been in my last semester that
I was attending USC actually only took
fourteen units that's two away from
being a part-time student I think with
all this and my leave of absence I
actually thought it would be impossible
to graduate on time but I went to my
college academic
vizor honestly a it before this I did
not think that they were helpful but
they are so helpful so get to know your
academic adviser I went to her and I
like kind of told her what was up and
then she kind of explained that I could
graduate on time as scheduled even with
taking the leave of absence only if I
took eight units of elective credit
specifically no other units would
transfer and if I took these classes
before the fall semester at USC started
so first of all before moving on from
that I just had absolutely no idea that
taking summer classes was a possibility
other than like only USC summer classes
which are the exact same cost but it's
also good to know that you could take
classes that transfer at other colleges
even if I hadn't planned on taking a
leave of absence
I could have graduated early like by
taking classes in the summer somewhere
else and that might be obvious on even
though basically after talking to her my
options were to either take summer
classes at USC or to take transferable
courses out of college elsewhere so of
course I chose the latter because I
wrote this down let me just tell you
guys at USC if I were to take a class in
the summer one unit is $1,800 one unit
so yeah I would have needed to take
eight units and that would have been
eight times 1,800 which is fourteen
thousand and four hundred dollars for
eight units in the summer
the next option was to take Community
College classes and in California for an
out-of-state resident basically to take
nine units it would have been around two
thousand and seven hundred dollars that
is a whole lot cheaper so I decided to
go with the Community College option so
before you know choosing a college or
courses I had to keep in mind that I was
still working until mid-june so I
couldn't really be physically in a
classroom and I also had my travels to
Ibiza plans so I opted to take or look
for classes online it seems kind of easy
to just like attend a college or
Community College but enrolling in any
college it's a process and I wrote down
all of the issues that I ran into
because I literally ran into so many
issues first of all out-of-state
residence at least in California have to
prove that their in-state so for one of
the colleges that I wanted that was like
the cheapest and the high
reading it's called Saddleback I'd have
to drive all the way down to Anaheim
where it was and then just literally say
this is me here's my ID this is my
identity that was not possible for me
because I was working full-time and
their hours were during my work hours
another thing is that classes fill up
especially for popular community
colleges like they go so fast and also
you have to make sure that the dates are
within like a good time range my college
required my classes to end before the
fall classes started they're all
different from just like starting to
ending so you have to keep that in mind
usually if you're not a student actually
going there full time they give you last
priority so in order to kind of bump up
your registration date because they fill
up really fast you have to submit a lot
of documents like for one of them I had
to submit like some similar classes that
I've taken as like kind of prerequisites
another thing that I ran into with all
of the colleges that I tried to enroll
in which were three was that they have a
cap on how many units you're allowed to
take so usually it's like one and a half
classes for the summer for some reason
you either have to send in a form of
exception and sometimes you have to
write a letter there like so many things
that you could run into so you thought I
was done but I'm totally not because
this is a process like I said so after
you find a college that you want to
enroll in you have to make sure you know
which classes are transferable so like
for me it was just electives and then
you have to make sure that the classes
that you're picking are approved for
transfer by your university one of my
hometown friends actually went abroad he
spent his first year going to school in
the States and then he wanted to
transfer to a different school he tried
to come back I guess and none of the
classes that he took abroad would
transfer to his old college and so he
would have to do four more years or
three more years in order to get his
degree you really need to talk to your
academic advisor beforehand even if you
do think that you know like sometimes
there are like rules and things that you
just don't really know about or you're
not aware of so that is super super
helpful so all of the stuff was all good
I had finally chosen a college or a
community college to take my online
classes at and it was called Pasadena
City College Pasadena is close a lot
closer to me than
time and I'd be able to go there if I
needed to without taking a ton of time
so I had done everything that I needed
to do I paid tuition I sent in forms to
have a good registration day I made sure
that they were transferrable to my
University and then I also registered
for these classes that I wanted to take
I actually called them three different
times because they didn't require me to
physically go into the office and I was
like is this normal do you think that
I'll have any problems registering
because I'm an out-of-state resident and
literally every single person that I
talk to we're like yeah you're totally
fine to take all their classes no
problem so I was basically all good to
go and then the day before these classes
start which is kind of in later mid-june
I go on to the portal to see if there
are any syllabi or anything that I
should be doing at the moment and
nothing's there and that's kind of weird
because there should at least be like a
syllabus for each class and so I go on
to check my schedule and somehow every
single one of the classes that I had
registered for disappeared and was
dropped from my schedule of course so I
called him up asking them what happened
to these classes absolutely no one knows
what to tell me you're like what
happened they're all just like are you
sure you didn't drop the classes and I
was like why would I do that I already
paid for these classes like I really
need to take them I just disappeared
somehow I was super confused and I was
eventually transferred to the director
of admissions for this Community College
which is literally the highest person
that I could have possibly mocking to
for this issue and guess what she says
I'm so sorry to hear about this honestly
there's nothing we can do for you here
according to the federal law and title
for I don't know why I remember these
things students who are not in state
residents cannot take online classes our
community colleges and we just heard
about the crackdown of this law or rule
yesterday did you not get an email about
it I told some of the sudden and Ito
about it and I was just like no I did
not get an email about it and it would
have been really helpful to know this
because it was mid-june at this point
and a lot of the classes that I had
looking at had already started like
weeks earlier so basically at this point
I'm like I have no idea what I'm going
to do all the classes that I've been
looking at so far have started so long
ago and even if they haven't started all
the spots have been taken so I wouldn't
even be able to register for them
anyways so I was basically like I'm
going to have to you know take another
semester at USC I'm gonna have to find a
place to live I was very very worried I
texted my parents and I was like I'm
screwed I emailed my academic advisor
and told her what happened she very
quickly responded like I love my
academic advisor like she was literally
so helpful in this process she responded
and basically told me that several
colleges offer accelerated courses which
basically means that you know you take
like a semester long course and just
cram it into a few weeks or like five
weeks or so and she said that BYU or she
also recommended CSU classes luckily
that was also an option and I actually
did the entire process for all those
schools to like I found classes that
worked and was pretty much ready to go
I only downside to doing that instead of
a Community College is that it would
cost seven thousand dollars instead of
the twenty seven hundred dollars so that
was kind of stressful for me and very
disappointing the whole situation with
the Community College is just literally
not telling me what had happened and I
actually never even saw an email go out
after that or like an explanation email
so meanwhile while all this was
happening I went back home to Alaska it
was a plan visit a little vacation I
loved going there in the summer
especially is really nice
my mom had suggested looking into the
public college there which is University
of Anchorage Alaska to see if they had
any courses available that I could take
and so I just looked on their schedule
of online classes I was like there's no
way that I'm going to find anything
available and lo and behold they had
their very last session of their
accelerated five-week courses going on
but of course was my luck the classes
had started a week ago and the very last
day to register or not even register to
drop or add classes after you registered
was the next day even after a week of
missing a class that's a semester long a
lot of
professors don't let you join it really
depends on the professor of course in
the class and where they are in their
course so I literally spent two whole
days looking at every single course that
would transfer to USC and then emailing
every single one of the professor's of
that course and basically I sent an
email that was pretty detailed but not
too long snow likes long emails
basically explaining my situation saying
that I wouldn't be able to graduate on
time if I didn't have these classes or
didn't wasn't able to find classes to
take this late and then I also made sure
to say that I knew that it was very late
into the semester or the course but that
I was a really hardworking student and
that I was a really good student and
then I promise to be a really great
addition to their classroom even after
that I still ran into so many problems
was just literally trying to register to
the college and it would have taken like
a it was a three-day process but I was
like no I really need this now three of
the professors that I emailed let me
into their classes one of them did it on
the first day it was super easy she
added me with no problem the next one
did it kind of mid day on the very last
day that I could possibly register but
then the last one he very shortly at
like 3:00 p.m. he said
yikes but he basically said that I could
join his class but that he was on a
flight to Iceland so he couldn't
actually add me to the class so I
literally had to go to the college it
was 4:00 p.m. which is an hour before
they closed and then see if they could
add me and I also had to pay before that
closing time or else I wouldn't be added
but basically everything from that point
on worked out and even though I
literally only need to get a c-plus in
all these classes in order to have them
count towards transfer credit I feel
like I made a promise in my email of
like basically begging them to let me
join their classes that I would be a
good student I have all A's in these
classes that I literally need a c-plus
to graduate with they did me such a huge
favor where even if they don't really
care like I feel the need to do really
well because that's what I promised them
I would do and on top of all this
working out the tuition since I'm an
in-state resident was only $2,100 for
nine units which is better than every
single option that I had previously so
yeah
worked out but yeah basically crammed
like a semester long course into five
weeks and I was a week late so I
literally for like probably a week
straight was sitting down today tonight
just working on these assignments in my
life just like slew by because I was
literally doing this the whole time so
yeah it's been a lot and that is why I
have not been making videos because that
was the fun of the story to tell you
guys why I've been gone but not really
it's just like so crazy to me how this
very short series of events were so
important in the deciding of whether I
would have to extend my graduation and
take an entire another semester or just
take these online classes for four weeks
and then just be done with it
and literally pay like 115 to the cost I
just wanted to make this video because
if you're trying to find ways to save
money or if you just find yourself in
the same position as I was where you
like to semester off or just you know
didn't come in with any unit or think
you don't have miss units to graduate on
time or want to graduate early I think
this is really helpful to know that you
can make those up in ways other than
taking them during the fall and spring
semester and of course I'm sure that
every single college is very different
in their rules
I honestly now that I've filmed that
entire video I have no idea if that is a
helpful video to post on my channel or
if it's literally the most useful video
useless video that I've ever posted give
this video a thumb up if you think it
was helpful or you liked just hearing
the story and I will see you guys in my
next video
