gonna do like a big collective haul from
cyber monday um Christmas kind of and
then my birthday because my birthday was
on January fit um I just wanted to
mention that this is not a bragging
video whatsoever I just have seen that a
lot of people really enjoyed liked what
i got for christmas halls and I didn't
really want to do a Christmas haul
because I got like a gym membership for
Christmas and I didn't think that would
be very exciting so I'm gonna go ahead
and like start I don't know the prices
for a lot of these like I said I kind of
got them for likes most of this stuff I
bought for myself for cyber monday so
it's kind of a long time ago um but I
can like try to tell you like the deals
that they had and stuff like that so I
just got two things from urban
outfitters I feel like I got more I
might be missing some stuff to be honest
but i don't really know except been
wearing them I haven't actually won this
one yet but this is a really pretty
cardigan that I got and I think the deal
there was you like by sixty five dollars
worth of stuff or like 75 or 50 and
you've got fifteen dollars off so this
is just a cardigan and the brand is
kimchi blue I also kind of got this
cardigan for the name and then I got
this ginormous infinity scarf it is so
big like I was really scared of it at
first it's just huge um it also looks
huge on but I've really grown to love
this scarf this is probably my favorite
thing that I've gone for the entire
Black Friday or from my entire Black
Friday purchase it's just basically a
huge scarf so I realized that american
eagle an area where the first place that
i shopped and looked online for because
they had like fifty percent off their
entire um your entire purchase so that
was a really good deal and i got to be
knees from american eagle um yeah these
are from America ankle and I think these
are both around like fifteen dollars or
something um just kidding I have no idea
don't listen to me and then I got this
really
get pretty sweater that sweater or
knitted shirt I guess it's not really a
sweater it basically just has a bunch of
different colors knitted into it kind of
looks purple from far away and I just
really like it I think it's really
pretty and very casual nice and
comfortable from aerie they had the deal
where you got like ten underwears 426
what 95 or whatever it's supposed to be
which was crazy so I got a ton of like
the most expensive ones which is what
this is but then um like seven of those
underwears got back ordered so I just
didn't I didn't end up getting any of
them except for like three of them I
also got this peplum casual gray like
slouchy shirt which I thought was
adorable as well and it has buttons on
the back which I thought was so cute and
I love peplum and I love like long
sleeves and so this shirt basically was
perfect for me and I thought it was
really adorable and I definitely saw
this at aerie it's on sale like fifty
percent off at area right now so if you
guys want to like get that shirt it's
really cute and then i got these socks
from area to like me high socks because
i don't know i just really wanted some
knee high socks so that's what i got
from aerie then i went to nordstrom calm
and they were just basically having a 10
points sale if you have like their
North's from credit card which my mom
does so I think that basically just
gives you ten percent off so from that
sale I got this adorable shirt this is
probably one of my favorite shirts that
I got so the shoulders are lightly
padded um and it's basically just really
sophisticated looking it has a button
down back and um I don't even know how
to explain this it's just really really
pretty and really elegant looking and I
paired it with a statement necklace and
it was really adorable and then I got a
skater skirt black skater skirt from
nordstrom as well because i have been
wearing a lot of skirts with tight
lately cuz i also got types from cyber
monday and I've been
wearing that with these shoes I've been
wearing these shoes so much or these
wedges um you guys could probably tell
these have gotten some wearing out of
them because I got them like two days
after cyber monday cuz nordstrom has
awesome shipping and I've been wearing
them like a lot these shoes are from
soul society and they're like seventy
dollars so i think that was a really
good deal for like wedges cuz these can
get really expensive and they're really
really cute so i love those shoes is
probably my favorite shoes in here and
then from zara zara i got this shirt um
I really just wanted a striped shirt for
a long time and this seemed really cute
and this is like thirteen dollars which
Zara r0 whatever is pretty expensive so
this is what that looks like it has
short sleeves um and then it has a
zipper on the back this also has a faux
leather neckline I feel like I ordered
more stuff off of Toby because I feel
like I wouldn't just order this but I
think some of the things got back
ordered because this is what I got from
Toby and I hardly remember getting this
is kind of a long time ago and it's like
the style that has like the sleeveless
sleeved arms that doesn't make sense but
yeah so I'm not really sure what I'm
gonna wear this probably when it gets
warmer outside but I was kind of just
interested in trying out the these type
of sleeves because i thought those are
kind of cute when other people are
wearing them and actually i think that
is it for my cyber monday stuff i feel
like i got some more but and not true
and then I'm gonna go like move on to
like stuff that my friends and family
have given me for Christmas and my
birthday so the most exciting thing that
I've gotten is this canon powershot
camera like handheld camera because i am
gonna start blocking a lot more because
i'm really interested in blogging i
think they're really fun to watch and I
just I feel like that's something that I
would
like doing I think I'm going to exchange
it for the 110 because I've seen like a
lot of youtubers using like the 110 for
a buck vlogging camera and um I also
have a huge announcement that I probably
should have made at the beginning of
this video I'm going to Europe so that's
kind of also why I wanted to start
blogging to like try to get used to it
because I definitely want to start daily
vlogging in Europe because i also told
my mom that i won so I'm basically just
like prepping for that um so I'm going
to hear up this summer with my sister
Callie and Ellen and like I don't know
probably a bunch of other people or a
bunch of other friends and yeah I'm just
really really excited but I really want
to start blogging because I told my mom
I would and I think it'd be really fun
to capture that so um if you guys know
like what block and cameras are good
other than like the 110 of this version
let me know and I'm gonna get like this
box of stuff that I basically just have
on my floor Oh birthday presents oh ok
so i don't know if i'm going to show you
all of this stuff because it's basically
just kind of random like i got a ton of
fuzzy socks from costco for my mom so
that's pretty awesome I'm just dropping
this stuff on the ground um I got this
candle it's from colonial candle um my
friend Devin who gave me this amazing
pink sweater that I've actually always
wanted I just never liked wanted to buy
it cuz her kind of expensive oh she also
gave me this for xmas from Nordstrom and
that's really cute um and then my friend
Aaron gave me this scar from nordstrom
which is really like very wearable I
feel like I'm going to use this a lot um
my best friend Rachel got me the
sweetest gift ever she saw that I was
looking on her pinterest at like one
particular picture and the girl like was
wearing something like this so she got
me um like one as similar as possible to
what the girl was wearing on pinterest
so she got me this um I don't know what
these are called like they would be
called combat jackets if they were like
green but this is basically just like a
beige one and it's from Francesca's um
so that's adorable and I absolutely love
it and it's
cute on and she also gave me some m
cosmetic makeup which was really nice of
her she got me to eyeliners and then a
lipstick but one thing that I've noticed
about it I'm cosmetics line is that
these little liners I got one in my
empty bag too and they have all broken
like this just comes out even before you
use it so that's really lame but we
emailed them and they basically said
that if I send them a picture then
they'd send me another one so that's
pretty nice um another thing that just
fell off of the chain is this really
really pretty monogrammed necklace um my
sister gave it to me off of etsy I think
and probably have seen this a lot but I
really love it and for some reason she
thinks that don't so if you're watching
this I do actually really love that
necklace okay hope you guys can see this
I Instagram a picture of this on
Instagram but this is a ring with my
name on it and it spins and it's so cute
and i love it so much so I also got that
for my birthday now I'm going to focus
the camera so yeah I got this for my
birthday from family friends and I think
my mom also I don't really know but um
this is like one of my favorite gifts
like I've been wearing it every day
since my birthday which was just like a
few days ago but I absolutely love it
and it says my name on it so if you guys
want to see the picture on Instagram or
whatever um my Instagram is a merry
chase and i'll link it i like it below
every single time so you guys probably
know that Khloe and cali got me this
really nice Mac highlighter and then
they also got me these really beautiful
earrings you guys I don't know you can
probably see from here um from North
term I think yep is it right here um
yeah so I really love these so I got a
lot of really cool like jewelry and
stuff this year which i usually don't
ever and then my friend grace gave me
like the rest of this box I just had it
on my like lap um that's kind of weird
I'm just like showing what I got for my
birthday or actually was not really
planning on doing
us today but whatever um I got she got
me this really adorable cardigan so this
is gonna be really wearable for winter
and it's like cold outside right now
it's very nice and heavy and it's just
really adorable and then she also got me
these matching like this matching
bracelet and um earrings which I thought
were really cute too so hopefully that's
gonna see that she also man she got a
lot of stuff okay so she also got me
this bareMinerals kit which is the all
eyes on you and the powder for this or
the eyeshadow mineral powder is really
really pretty so I really love that not
a lot of people got me make up this year
which is kind of surprising but i really
love like all the gifts that I got so
it's kind of fine and then the last
thing that she got me um was this shirt
so these were all for my like birthday
and Christmas present it kind of sucks i
feel bad for my friends like I never
asked for gifts but like my birthday is
really close to Christmas it all
exchange gifts for Christmas and then
they like get me another gift I'm just
like kind of feel bad so basically
that's pretty much like what I got for
the last like month I've gotten so many
new things it's kind of overwhelming I
don't really know where to put them and
now there's like hauled them i have to
like put them away I hope that didn't
come off as like braggy or anything
that's never liked what I mean to do in
any of my videos I'm really excited
about the things that I got I got a ton
of really thoughtful and super nice
gifts this year and I it's never about
the gifts for me ever but I don't know
my friends this year have just been
amazing and I've been like so happy with
my family and friends and all of my
relationships so it's been a really good
year so far it's like getting better um
yeah so I'm just really thankful for my
friends and family and I hope that they
like the gifts that I got them I got
like five naked palettes this year for
christmas cuz i basically just gave out
makeup for like all my friends and
family basically so that was fun to give
