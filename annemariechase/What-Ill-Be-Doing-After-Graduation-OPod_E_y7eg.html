in this video I am going to be
announcing my post graduation plans I'm
really excited to tell you guys this
story and I'm also really excited to be
partnering with Adobe on this video in
this video I'm actually gonna be showing
you guys the business cards I've created
for myself using Adobe Photoshop and I'm
also gonna be challenging you guys to
make some business cards of your own so
definitely stick around to the end of
this video for that alright so first
what will I be doing after graduation so
this year I've really kind of been
struggling to figure out what I want to
do I've been going to college for four
years and it kind of all culminates to
you know something and this year I've
just kind of been trying to figure out
what that something would be I really
thought that it was to get a full-time
job with a really big company and I was
definitely on the path to do this I got
a call saying that I got the internship
I guess this is like a huge shift in a
potential career if this is something
that I wanted to do for the rest of my
life but something has kind of just been
holding me back these might have been
signs or it just might have been
something in my subconscious like kind
of just telling me that this is
something that I just didn't really want
to do a lot of these signs kind of came
just from the classes that I enrolled in
this semester one of them was actually
creativity workshop class really helped
me to think of creativity not just as
something that you do on the side but
something that can really shape the
course of your life and you can really
integrate it into a full-time career
kind of learning about creative people
and learning about their theories and
like how to better integrate or just
actually practice being creative or
structurally and also for the past year
since my leave of absence I have been
enrolling in a ton of entrepreneurship
upper division elective classes the main
thing that it teaches you is that an
entrepreneurship the biggest hurdle is
just going for it and just starting and
it doesn't have to be something that you
want to do upon retirement after working
for like 40 years
and then oh like someday you can start
your business and what I've learned is
that like I could really do something
like this now I just have to have the
motivation
and the determination and ambition to do
it you guys can probably see where this
is going but another kind of sign that I
saw was a guest speaker who actually had
a very very similar outlook on life as I
do so his name was Adam Sher
he helps like create Siri he advised us
to look at our lives as if your life is
a book that you're co-creating or
co-authoring because there are so many
external factors to everyone's lives
where you can't just write your own book
or else ever want to be like Elon Musk
so you said to look at your life like a
book that you can co-author and I've
actually always had this kind of idea I
look at my life like a story that I want
to tell but he mentioned if you're
writing your book and you don't like how
the outcome is going just flip and
create a new chapter of your life why
would I do something why would I set
myself up why would I start my chapter
with something that I didn't want to do
instead of just starting the chapter
with doing something that I truly want
to be doing I want to say that this
comes from like a privilege point I know
that I have the ability to fail and not
everyone has this ability so I don't
want to come off as like everyone should
be doing this because I know not
everyone can do this but for me
personally this is the best time and
place in my life to kind of just start
my chapter however I want to
so my last sign I was going out with my
roommate Tasha and a new friend called
Shelby Church we were kind of just
talking and I don't even know how we got
on the subject of like startups or
anything but we both shared this idea of
this startup that we both had and it was
literally the exact same idea for me it
was an idea that I had thought of and
tried to like pursue as a class project
in one of my entrepreneurship classes
and for her it was actually a startup
idea that she actually tried pursuing
two years ago and like even hired a
developer to develop this app so it was
just coincidence that we both had this
exact same startup idea and at the
moment we were both like uh we should do
this and so with that after graduation I
will be pursuing this startup idea that
we both had this app so yeah that's
pretty much what I'm gonna be doing and
obviously I will
not make a lot of money from this so
I'll have to be very entrepreneurial and
finding other ways and avenues of
revenue so that will be scary but I'm
gonna try this out as long as I can like
live off of my money that I have saved
up and it's actually funny because I've
been telling my friends and whoever asks
me what I'm gonna be doing that's
actually another piece of advice that
I'm sure you're the same guy I gave is
to just like started announcing like
telling people what you're gonna be
doing and before I was kind of scared to
do this because I feel like everyone
wants to be like a entrepreneur these
days and I was just kind of like no I
don't want people to judge me but I've
been telling my friends and whoever asks
and it was kind of funny because one of
my friends who has been kind of
struggling to get an internship this
summer
started talking to me about how she's
been struggling to find an internship
then she was kind of like Oh like I'm
sorry I shouldn't be talking to you
about this because I know that like
you're not getting a full-time job
as if it's like something that is like a
bad thing I honestly really do not see
it this way I really see it as an
opportunity to create my own story in my
own pathway and just kind of have the
freedom to see like where my potential
could take me I of course I'm very
scared this is very risky but if I like
kind of take a bigger picture look at it
and like zoom out this is the best
possible time for me to do this the
least risky it's time for me to do this
and I've had these types of moments or
decisions to make in my life before and
deciding to go to USC I knew that I
wanted to be in LA but I also really
wanted to go to school like where my
siblings went to school but I knew that
it was kind of like if I wanted to live
in LA it was kind of now our neighbors
and starting a YouTube channel I was
kind of like oh this is always something
that I wanted to start but of course
it's really hard to put yourself out
there especially like when I started it
and no one was really I mean not no one
but like it was a really weird thing to
be doing so all of these decisions that
I've had to make that were really hard
to make that would have been a lot
easier to not have done where moments
where I wasn't really sure but I just
decided to take a bet on myself and on
my youtube channel I really feel like I
tried to preach being independent and
getting hard and to put yourself in the
best position that you can to set
yourself up for success and I just
really feel like if I had this feeling
that I really wanted to do this and
didn't do it I would kind of be cheating
myself in a way speaking of kind of
creating a life for myself I obviously
have a lot of tools that I use in order
to do this especially being in like a
more creative pathway and that's why I'm
very excited to be partnering with Adobe
so Dobby reached out to work on this
video and I've actually been using the
Adobe Creative Suite for the last two
years and I thought that it was so
fitting because what better way to start
off this entire journey then to create
my own business cards so I've created my
own business cards on Adobe Photoshop
which I will walk you guys through the
process right now okay so I got really
camera shy so I had to do a mock-up
before without filming it on camera so
I'm basically repeating this little
mock-up of a business card that I have
for my future business that is unnamed
currently so maybe could have picked a
different business to make a business
card for but we're going with it so
here's kind of me at picking at the
colors I kind of knew which colors I
wanted from a lot of trial and error of
just like testing different colors to
see if they looked good together so I
kind of cheated at this point because I
read found those but I thing that I'm
doing is kind of just creating a little
separator box because I don't really
know what I'm gonna put on my business
card for this business yet so I'm just
making it really nice and simple yeah
here's me figuring out what color but I
kind of already know so
that's me changing it but it's cool each
color has like a specific ID like with
numbers and letters so if you really
like a color you can transfer it sound a
little tip if you didn't know that
welcome okay let's see what are we doing
here oh here's like just a little extra
shape that I added and then transformed
and then flipped come to the side
because it looks a little too plain but
I didn't want to make it striped me so I
just turned this like on its side kind
of I rotated it so yeah I just made this
like a little bit of a darker color so
there's a lot of color contrast in this
business card I always create a new
layer that's what I learned my basic
adobe lessons so now I'm picking a font
this is also very hard to do it takes a
really long time finding good fonts that
look good together so be aware little
trick I'm gonna do a little shadow on
the back so I made the background one
black and then I made it big press down
on shift when you move it so that it
doesn't get all wacky and out of shape
so that's gonna be the shadow part and
now I am making a copy of this layer and
I'm going to make it white and then I'm
gonna put it on top of the black so it
creates like a little shadow it's gonna
be really cool I'm sure there's a way
another way to do this but this is kind
of just how I do this all the time
all right now I am finalizing with my
real name
so the title is just gonna be co-founder
and then we're gonna kind of make that
small and then below that I'm gonna put
my email which is probably gonna be
something like a Marie at the future
businesses name com so that is kind of
what is all gonna be on the business
card and then I kind of just play around
with the positioning of this it's kind
of like the most fun part little subtle
moves can really make things different I
think so that's pretty much walkthrough
of how I made my business card for my
future business that does not currently
have a name or really exists so thanks
