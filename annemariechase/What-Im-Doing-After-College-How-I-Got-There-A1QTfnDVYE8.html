a Marie I feel a little bit weird
filming this video it's a little scary
for me I just feel like I'm entering
this new chapter in my life and I'm just
not sure if I'm ready and that is
finding a job like a full-time job for a
career I won't be a senior this year at
USC I feel like I've said this in every
single one of my videos with that I
always get the questions on my channel
of what do I want to do after I graduate
what career / industry do I want to be
in and where do I see myself in five
years so in this video I kind of wanted
to walk you guys through some of my
advice and tips for landing internships
and then I also wanted to share with you
guys what I will be doing in the coming
semester in order to best prepare me for
hopefully landing my dream job or a
dream job so this video is sponsored by
LinkedIn but as you guys know I only
work with companies whose products and
services I actually use and love and
stand behind and I just feel so blessed
to be working with LinkedIn on this
video because first of all and it's
truly the number one resource that I go
to when I'm in my internship search or
for my career search and then to just
working with LinkedIn they sent me some
cool data from a study that they did
that I think is really helpful and just
acknowledging how powerful LinkedIn is
and they didn't ask me to include any of
the things from this study but I just
truly think it shows how powerful
LinkedIn can be basically working with
LinkedIn has just made this video a lot
better so I'm extremely excited to be
working with them and let's just get
into the video so my first internship
after freshman year was actually in
Shanghai China I worked at the
mercedes-benz arena as a sales and
marketing intern after my sophomore year
I worked at this entertainment company
as a digital marketing intern and then
my recent internship experience was with
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson with Neutrogena and I
worked as a digital marketing and
consumer marketing co-op which basically
just means that I worked there full-time
for six months and then of course I've
been doing youtube for the past like
however many years so that's pretty much
my experience and I just wanted
share that with you guys kind of
honestly to establish some credibility
you want to be taking advice from people
that you see as credible
I'm not saying that my internships are
my experience is like amazing but it is
kind of just a way that I can establish
myself as a credible source and I also
wanted to tell you guys my previous
experiences because everyone wants to
hear you know the tips and tricks or
just steps that successful people have
taken so that you know like we could do
the same thing and hopefully get to
where they are - I just feel like
everyone should do this video because
that would be so helpful the first thing
in my internship search process or my
career search process that I do is
update my LinkedIn profile I'm not
saying this just because I'm working
with LinkedIn on this video this is
something that is just like flat-out
important my business Career Center
tells me this my business professors
tell me this and also this is where that
study comes in handy so basically a
LinkedIn sent me data from a study that
they did in 2015 with 1,400 HR and
career professionals and they found from
this study that 9 out of 10 recruiters
use LinkedIn to find candidates and that
75% of hiring managers look at the
person's LinkedIn profile before making
a hiring decision so I feel like that
data just speaks for itself that this is
a really important thing that you
actually need to do if you are entering
a career or industry that kind of
requires this of you and if you're
trying to be competitive and you don't
have a LinkedIn you're kind of already
just behind the curve so I see my
LinkedIn profile and honestly any social
media profile that I have as a way that
I'm able to communicate in this case
with hiring managers or potential
employers without actually having to
physically and verbally communicate with
them if you think of it that way just
having an updated profile shows that
you're proactive you're organized you're
able to keep on top of your stuff and
that you're really there and prepared
for the next steps
I'm very deliberate about what I'm
putting every single thing that you put
on your profile says something about you
so you want to ask yourself if what
you're putting up is a good
representation of you as a person or of
your abilities to do work so the first
thing that you want
make sure to have updated on your
profile is actually your picture it's
kind of your virtual handshake this is
the first impression because that's the
first thing that you see digitally so
the picture that you choose as your
profile photo should really align with
what industry or career that you're
wanting to go into so this is my profile
picture and then this photo you can see
that I'm smiling my shoulders are back
and I'm also wearing business
professional attire I'm a business
student I might go into a professional
career hence the attire and I also I'm
trying to show with this photo that you
know maybe I'm friendly because I'm
smiling but I'm also put together and
professional so the next thing that is
probably obviously very important is to
put your current position in your
profile so if you're a college student
and you don't have any internship
experience yet I would honestly put like
anything any type of job or volunteer
experience that you have whether it's
working in a cafe or volunteering for an
organization that you consistently
volunteer for by listing any of your
experience it just shows that you're
able and willing to work but I also
don't really recommend just putting
things to list it like oh I'm a dog
walker once a month then it's not really
like showing your abilities it just
shows that you're doing like your
neighbor a favor by walking their dog
just make sure that it's actually
valuable experience that you have
learned something from and if you don't
have any experience then it's not the
end of the world at all just list your
education because everyone has to start
somewhere something that you can also do
in the experience section that I think
makes a huge difference is to add
visuals of your work so whether that be
a picture of you at an event or of you
speaking or a video that you created or
that you're in or a presentation that
you're allowed to share and that you're
really proud of providing these types of
visuals really allows whoever is looking
at your profile to kind of look at your
job description that you've written out
and then look at those visuals and kind
of put together a whole story of you
where employers can maybe envision you
in their company and just get a better
picture of who you are as a person and
what you might be like in their company
someone just came to the door so if my
positioning or like background is a
little bit off that's why so the last
thing that I'm gonna talk about that's
important to keep updated on your
profile
is your location if you have a city that
you're based in you'll stand out and the
search 23 times more and it's also a
good way that former colleagues or
coworkers
can reach you and that's kind of how I
use this function actually when I was
applying to my previous internship I
actually went on to LinkedIn to try to
search if I had any connections or any
mutual connections with anyone who had
previously had the exact same position
that I was applying for I was able to
find the person who had the exact same
position at the exact same office and
the only way that I was able to find
that was through the location because
these positions are all over the nation
and I saw that we had mutual connections
so I reached out to one of our mutual
connections and I asked them if they
thought it would be okay if I reach out
to him and if he would be receptive to
me asking him some questions about the
position and they're like this guy's
super nice he'd be happy to help you and
she was like he not only told me like
interview tips and what they would
probably ask me but he also told me like
the next steps for if you continue with
the company like what your future would
look like at that company it might seem
really awkward at first to reach out to
someone that you don't know but
especially if it's an alumni or someone
that you have a common connection with
chances are they will be happy to help
you out and there's really no harm and
just reaching out it seems really
awkward at first but if they're able to
help you out it can be so helpful so
after I've updated all my LinkedIn
information it's on point the first
thing that you know naturally you would
do is you would start looking for
positions available and that seemed
interesting to you the first place that
I go to is usually my school's job
portal
I usually go here first just because I
think the application process is a
little streamlined like you don't have
to do as many steps but I've also
totally just thought up really cool
companies that I would love to work for
and then just went directly on their
website to look if they have any job
positions open with the application
process just based on my personal
experience I have like two pieces of
advice first of all is sadly to expect
rejection and the second is to even
expect to not hear back at all most of
the positions that I applied for I
literally never heard back from them
it's really really important to not get
too attached to any one position or
even if you read the description and you
think that you are the absolute perfect
fit for that role because you honestly
just never know what companies are
looking for and even if you are the
perfect fit it just might not be what
they're looking for at the moment that
leads just to the general advice of
applying to a lot of positions like
really spread your eggs and a lot of
baskets for that one and just keep your
expectations low for hearing back from
companies so a really important resource
that is very often kind of just shoved
down my throat as a business student is
networking events and career fairs I've
been to both but something that I feel
like I have very unique insight on our
career fairs because I went with my
company as a person from the company but
also as someone who had some influence
and say essentially and putting resumes
in one of two piles one pile was if we
like the candidate and the other pile
was unfortunately just kind of a
recycling pile for resumes so basically
the takeaways that I was able to get
from being on the other side of the
career fair are so valuable to me first
of all it is so so so so crucial to be a
real person a lot of the people that we
talked to you had their pitch down but
after their pitch they were just kind of
a robot and they really didn't know how
to anticipate or answer any of the
questions that we had for them and they
weren't even questions like pressing
them they were really just about having
a conversation because if you think
about it those career fair people are
there for the whole day they're looking
for candidates who you know kind of
stand out in some way and if you're
listening to hundreds of people give
pitches all day they're just kind of
talking at you and it's only at the
moment where you're talking with someone
that you're able to make a judgment on
you know how they are as a person how
they interact with other people how they
might potentially interact in a team
setting so while it is important to have
like your little elevator pitch it is
just as important if not way more
important to be able to actually you
know have that conversation and be a
real person and not a robot like person
this is also the same for the interview
process when you're going into an
in-person interview you know at that
stage you're probably like
a few who they have chosen as the best
of the best they're really narrowing
down their options and at that point
sometimes all it comes down to is how
you are able to interact with other
human beings they're choosing a teammate
that they want to work with for the rest
of their like however long you are that
person is gonna be there so they want to
pick someone who they think that they'll
get along with and like be beneficial to
not only the company but the culture and
the people another thing that I noticed
is that you know I went with a pretty
big company and if you know that a
company is going to be there and you
know that you want to talk to the people
representing that company then
definitely do some basic background
research we talked to a lot of people
who clearly wanted to talk to us as a
company from the name but had no idea
what the company did at all and while I
like didn't really count that against
anyone cuz no one knows what all
companies do if you're wanting to
actually show that you want to work
there then you should definitely have
some basic knowledge about the company
and what they do so definitely be sure
to do your research beforehand on who's
gonna be there who you want to talk to
and just like brush up your knowledge on
those companies if you make it to the
stage where you're able to interview
with the company I have just a few
pieces of advice first of all what I do
beforehand is I kind of look up typical
industry questions for that type of
position so you can do this by literally
like googling the company in the
position googling the industry like
commonly asked questions for like
marketing interviews or whatever I went
through those questions and I made sure
that I knew how to answer every single
one of those questions or at least had
an idea of where I would want to go
generally with those questions just by
this google search for my interview
process I was able to pretty much have
already prepared my answers for three
out of the four questions that they
asked me and then the last thing that I
would definitely recommend before
interviewing is to exercise what I was
interviewing for my last position I had
exercise the morning of anytime that I
had an interview with them and
immediately after like maybe 30 minutes
of cardio like high-intensity cardio I
was much less jittery and also in my
actual interview I truly felt more
mental clarity I really do think that
exercising made a huge difference
and how I was able to respond so those
are all of these steps and advice that I
did and that I will be taking very very
soon in order to hopefully land my dream
job fingers crossed I really look
forward to making vlogs and videos
updating you guys about my job search
process I think that'll be really
interesting and very crazy so definitely
subscribe to this channel and my blog
channel if you guys want to see any of
those types of videos this coming
semester and be sure to give this video
a thumb up if you thought it was helpful
and yeah thank you guys so much for
watching I love you guys so much
and I will talk to you guys in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
