college like dorm room halls on my
channel the first one was from when my
sister Cali went to college and then one
was last year when I went to college and
Cal is actually very kind enough to
include her entire list of everything
that she included I think she even has
like waxing strips and like toothpaste
on that list so if you guys want to see
a haul video on what we brought to
college those two videos are the perfect
videos to watch and I'll link them in
the description box below so based on
those two videos I always get comments
asking what I wish I had brought and
then what I wish I hadn't brought I
decided to do a video on that because
that's a very highly requested video I
didn't actually think that would be very
highly requested but it is I wrote out a
list and I actually had some of my
friends give their input - so like
Caroline Shelley and Jerry all we're
kind of like brainstorming with me over
text while we're all over their
internships so I have some of their
advice as well the first thing that I'm
going to go over are things that you
should bring to college if you were not
considering it obviously these are going
to change depending on where you are
going to college and like where you're
located in where what what we're trying
to say it's going to just depend on
where you live and like what the
weather's like started like pouring rain
for the end of first semester and a lot
of people did not have rain jackets like
I got a school in LA but it's not 100%
sunny all the time especially during the
winter so it's very smart to bring a
rain jacket cuz it pours I would
definitely bring medicine and vitamins
personally I got sick so often so having
medicine like even Tylenol or aspirin
was very helpful
my roommate always needed my band-aids
so that came in handy my mom basically
just packed me a first aid kit full of
like medicine band-aids and like
neosporin like all those things that I
needed um which is very keen of her and
I love her for that but that was really
helpful like I use that I took that out
quite often and then also I would be
sure to pack vitamins how much students
can get really healthy so you want to
maximize your immune system as much as
possible take your daily vitamins
and he'll be good to go so this one is
very important to me let me grab it real
fast one sec my fuzzy blanket I got this
at Nordstrom I use this very very often
like I brought this to college brought
this to China and then I brought it home
again because it's just like one of my
most like used items ever I personally
just really like being very cozy like I
grew up with a big blanket for like most
of my life and you just want something
that's very comforting so for me that
was my fuzzy blanket and my pillow pet
because I like love these things and so
whenever I was like stressed out I
didn't get very home safe but whenever I
was just like wanted some comfort I
would just wrap myself up in my fuzzy
blanket and just like chill you know and
then I have my pillow pet mostly just
because I like find it a genuinely
comfort comfortable pillow honestly if
you have like a stuffed animal that you
sleep with every night and you don't
want to bring it to college because you
think it's like babyish you're like
childish I would consider bringing it
because it just brings you that like
familiarity and my comfort that you
can't really find at college so break
your baby blanket I did another thing
that was extremely handy was our mirror
our full-length mirror um or a vanity
mirror I'd actually recommend bringing
both you're probably gonna want to check
your outfit you know those like bathroom
mirrors just won't do it my vanity
mirror just like my mirror that I put on
my desk basically was very handy for
doing my makeup another thing that may
have ever might sound pretty helpful was
a water heater so like a little tea
kettle for hot tea and like instant
noodles or something if you want I
didn't really use it for that purpose I
just really liked hot tea and coffee
it's really easy to be really busy in
college and then just crave junk food so
having healthy snacks around like
protein bars or nuts is pretty helpful
another thing that I would recommend
bringing is reusable water bottles and
mugs I don't understand why my roommate
did not get a reusable water bottle but
she didn't so she would always just buy
water bottles and first of all they're
expensive like you're literally buying
water which is free something that might
be a little bit more
is is storage bins and like storage
units but I do recommend that you move
in first before you buy them if it's
possible or if it's like easy to just go
out and buy them afterwards and another
that's pretty obvious is to bring your
feminine products if if this applies to
you there's nothing worse than starting
your period and realizing that you don't
have anything and it's honestly kind of
annoying like having to ask you're like
roommates or like suite mates because
they probably brought enough for like
for them so just make sure that you have
your own supply then I think that we
found really helpful for our room was to
have a printer our community printer was
broken for a long time so having a
printer in our room is very handy I
would recommend bringing a quality
backpack I liked it off school all on
this and they're apparently not the most
fashionable thing especially we're going
to be walking around your college campus
with like a ton of books or like your
heavy computer like this thing is
ginormous your bag is going to get
really heavy and your back is going to
suffer so just bring a backpack make the
fashion sacrifice and just carry around
a backpack that's a high quality
backpack this problem on apply to all
students but for business students
sometimes you actually have to dress up
in business casual clothes I needed
business casual and business
professional clothes I didn't bring any
of that like whatsoever and even know
what that was so just make sure that you
like bring a variety of clothing like so
that you could dress up if you need to
especially for like interviews and stuff
this was something that saved me and my
roommate's friendship I think so if
there's a lot of noise what I'm going to
sleep I'll like wake up and I'll stay up
and then it'll take a really long time
to fall back to sleep again when you
come in like I would hear the noise from
the door and then the light would shine
directly onto my bed so it would just
wake me up and then it would be really
hard for me to fall back to sleep again
so I just brought earplugs you know
those little like foam things that you
like roll up and then stick in your ear
and I also run I mask like a sleeping I
mask so I would use those two things
every single night before I fell asleep
and honestly saved my sleeping schedule
and on us to probably say it's like our
friendship because I would have gotten
really like grumpy annoyed
I hadn't found a solution so for those
who have a harder time sleeping I guess
or have a hard time falling asleep with
noise highly highly highly recommend but
if you don't have that problem then you
were very lucky so this next thing is
more for convenience than anything else
but that is to bring two changes of
bedsheets and two towels like two body
towels personally I haven't need
freaking a lot of ways my towels just
had to be clean all the time and like my
bed sheet I had to like wash my sheets
every week some people do not care at
all like they will not wash her sheets
all semester but whenever I was washing
my sheets I would just change them out
so like I'd alternate between two sheets
so that when I was washing I could have
another clean set of sheets on my bed
and if I like drop my towel on the floor
in the bathroom I would just put in my
hamper and then use my other one a
bedside table lamp is very crucial our
light was like across the room so we
both had bedside lamps me my roommate
and that was very very handy for like
reading or just before I went to sleep
sandwich bags would be pretty helpful
especially if you have a cafeteria and
you want to steal some food something
nice to have in your desk is like tape a
stapler what else scissors also I did
not bring this at all
going out close you're going to be in
college with a bunch of college-age
girls who are probably in a dress like
college girls I literally have like one
dress for going out and like I just have
zero do I not clothes I still don't have
any clothes to go out with
I brought my speaker's the second
semester like my nice Bose speakers and
my sister got for me and it just made a
huge difference in our like music
quality so I would highly recommend
bringing speakers if you're very into
music and then I say that you should
consider bringing is a bike or like a
longboard or scooter or like some mode
of transportation if it's common on your
campus for you I see a lot of people
have bikes and personally I biked
everywhere so it was very handy to have
a bike also consider being like an open
the door like hanging rack it works very
well for like purses and like towels and
like scarves and stuff something that my
roommate this summer did to her closet
which she added another bar which I
thought was really really
smart I know that power closet only had
one bar so if I had added like another
bar below I would have been able to use
a lot more closet space but actually put
my shoe back there now I'm going to move
on to things that I would not recommend
bringing to college and you might think
you would want to bring to college looks
a little bit shorter but these are just
things that I personally would not bring
to college if I were I am going back so
these are things that I'm not wearing to
college so this isn't something that you
can really help but I wouldn't recommend
bringing like giant luggages luggage try
to bring luggage that will fit inside of
each other it minimized the space that
it was taking up I would not recommend
bringing storage units until you unpack
and see what storage units you need so
for me after I packed I just bought two
bins and then one smaller make up in but
I know a lot of people brought too much
storage like those little plastic
storage boxes one of the things that I'm
on here is to not bring a juicer slash
blender slash food related things are
not too many food-related things if you
want I would just recommend bringing
like one set of utensils and like a
plate in a bowl and if you do make sure
to bring a sponge and dish detergent I
personally would not recommend bringing
a fridge or like buying a fridge me and
my roommate didn't really use ours and
if you've watched my vlogs it really
just accumulated a bunch of disgusting
we could have done without a fridge for
sure if you're not on a meal plan though
it's probably a different story I would
not recommend bringing too much room
decor sometimes you end up with just
like a bunch of random stuff that you
don't really want to put up anymore
especially like if you meet your
roommate and you like are trying to
coordinate or something I'll probably do
this again but I shouldn't is bring like
my whole library of books I think I
brought five books to college that I
bought online before college that I
wanted to read during the year didn't
read a single one of them so I mean if
you're an avid reader and actually read
then I would probably recommend bringing
those books just be honest with yourself
like are you really gonna pick up
reading during like one of the most busy
like exciting new times of the year I
don't know up to you okay so the last
thing that I have
list is not to bring all of my shoes for
some reason I think I brought like four
pairs of tennis shoes I wore like one of
them consistently and didn't touch like
the others but yeah I just minimized
like how much junk you're bringing to
college because you're kind of probably
not going to have as much space as you
do right now in your dorm as you do like
at home because all your stuff is just
scattered around at home but your dorm
you have it all in like one half of a
room okay so I hope this video was
