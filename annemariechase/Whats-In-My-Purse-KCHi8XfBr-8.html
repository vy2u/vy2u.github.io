what's in my purse video and here is the
purse that I use so if you would like to
see what I keep in my purse please keep
watching I'm not sure how the lighting
is on your end it's not too good right
now because it's really cloudy outside
but I really just wanted to make a video
because I won't be able to make a video
for a little while because the next two
weeks before Thanksgiving break at my
school are gonna be awful I realized
from my supervisor at work who used to
be a teacher or kind of like a I think
she was teacher but anyways she told me
that teachers like to assign all of the
major projects before Thanksgiving like
right before so that they can grade over
thanksgiving weekend and then for winter
break they wouldn't have to do anything
like grading wise except for tests which
don't take that long degrade and that
makes total sense because all of my
teachers are assigning all of our
projects due right before thanksgiving
break so i'll be super busy with
homework so i won't be able to get
another video hub for a little while
until thanksgiving break so i really
just wanted to put this video up because
i've been really wanting to make videos
but i just hadn't had the time so here's
the purse that i am using this is a marc
by marc jacobs purse and this was
actually my sister's purse but um she is
really nice and she kind of like gave it
to me because she also she's kind of
like a person ha like and she just likes
to buy purses like constantly so she's
next door so I mean she can't hear me so
she kind of like gave me this purse um
to use and to have because she has a lot
of other persons and she knows that I
really really like this purse I don't
bring my purse everywhere so I don't
want to have to like take my ID card or
license out of here every single time so
I don't typically have a any type of ID
in here um but I really really really
like this purse because it's really like
as you can tell it's pretty big and it's
also like a side bag and the thing I
really like about this bag is like the
size and I also really like that this
bag is really casual like it can look
it's really like it's really classy
looking but you can wear it as a
casual bag and it just adds so much
color and class to any outfit like the
one I'm wearing today that does not look
very good in this lighting at all I
don't know I also like that it has so
many pockets it has a pocket right here
in the front and then it has this zipper
which the entire back is a pocket so you
can unzip this part and then this entire
thing is a pocket so I'll just start
with the outer pocket that is like right
below where this magnetically closes so
it's kind of more open um not really in
side of the bag just outside of the bag
um anyways the first thing that I keep
in this pocket are these headphones
they're just like the typical headphones
that come with the iphones iphone the
next thing that i have in my this outer
pouch is some gum this is the Mentos up
to you gum and I always have gum in my
bags because i really like gum and i
really don't like smelling like smelly
breath or anything so just in case i
always have some gum now i have these
yellow post-its i use a planner most of
the time but just in case like i have
some really important like reminders i
either read it on my hand or i read it
on a sticky note and then like post it
on my binder or my own planner to make
sure that i like no I have to do this so
darn it ok so yeah I just dropped that
um but I keep that for like major
assignments and major like things like
sometimes I'll have been put my clean
your room on there and then I don't
clean my room is there for like major
reminders that I really want to get done
the next thing that I have in my bag is
um this candy cane crunch dark chocolate
truffle bar um and this is actually my
friend Rachel she gave it to me for
helping her with a chemistry problem
this looks so good because it's like
candy cane and candy cane is like the
holiday season candy of all candies so
I'm really excited to try this
was really nice of her and she's awesome
so moving on into the larger pouch I
have some more things in the purse um so
like i said i have my planner i get
really bored in class or like just
waiting around and writing down like
things to do is usually like like what I
do most in my classes when like there's
lecture and I'm not listening or I just
get really bored or something I need to
do something I don't doodle because I'm
an awful artist so I just write a to-do
list in my planner and I also started to
put like video ideas down on this
recycled piece of paper so on the back
of this paper i have three right now so
that's pretty good um which is really
fun to do also when i'm bored in class
so I like having planners and that is
what is usually in either my backpack or
my bag the next thing that I have in my
pocket I'm not gonna hold it up every
time cuz i just realized it's probably
really annoying so um I have this Clara
and mr. Tiffany book this is actually um
a history book that I'm reading it's not
like for english or anything because my
history teacher is really cool and just
let us read basically any history book
from like the united states so this is
one of them and i basically just looked
up really good like books said i would
be interested in to read because i hate
history books that are just like history
textbooks and just list off baxton and
information and stuff so this is
actually a pretty good book for a
history book i really like it and i have
my favorite bookmark in it which is
awesome oh my gosh i'm going to show you
this is this is for like a celebration
for the hubble space craft and it is so
cool i have two of them the other ones
in like a textbook but i just think
they're so cool like I'm fascinated by
this ok the really nice thing about this
purse is it fits like like any type of
book like it fits my textbooks it's
pretty big I have a ton of skills skills
I'm trying to get rid of them because I
got a ton of skills I have you been more
from halloween because we went to this
one
house and just took a bunch of skittles
like they just gave us a bunch of skills
um because not a lot of people went
trick-or-treating this year I don't know
why but of course i did so i have a ton
of skills and a ton of candy and I don't
need it all I also carry around this
pink sugar hair up your free perfume um
I really like this scent um it's a
really popular sent and the reason why I
don't care around like the actual
perfume is because I'm allergic to it so
I'm not allergic to the hair perfume and
I really liked pink sugar it comes in
handy YouTube because yesterday I went
to the gym and I didn't shower and we
were with like a bunch of boys and even
though I don't like like any of those
boys it was just kind of embarrassing
like if you kind of smell bad you know
so it was really handy it came in a lot
of handy in there like coming dude you
smell so good and I was like yeah I know
okay and then the last thing I have this
in the bottom of the pocket is this hand
cream neutrogena hand cream because my
hands get so dry because i live in like
a super dry place and it's getting
really really cool i also think that i
put this in my whats in my backpack
video but I moved it to my purse so it's
now my purse that is like this main
pocket um and that's all and then
there's a zip pocket right here and then
to like cell phone holder things that I
keep my cell phone in and this Vera
Bradley keychain thing has like my cards
and my gift cards that I use a lot money
and stuff like that so I don't really
carry around my huge wallet because it's
really really big the weird thing about
it is like these aren't my keys to my
car I have my keys like downstairs on
like a little key rack right before the
garage because I will lose my keys but I
could really just put it on this thing
because I have to grab this every single
time I go out to drive because it has my
driver's license and my money and stuff
like that so I don't know why I haven't
like switched this because this is not
my car key so I don't I'm just really
lazy and the next thing that I carry in
this same pocket of my wallet is this
flip video camera I've had this for like
three years and it actually has come in
a lot of handy like I've captured some
pretty weird moments with this camera
apparently these like iphone video
cameras are actually better than
and the flip video cameras but I don't
know I just like having them separate
and then I'll go into this little zipper
pocket not actually sure if this is in
scream these are like more permanent
items that I keep in here the other ones
are kind of changing a lot like I don't
usually carry skills around the rest of
the things in my purse usually just stay
in my purse so I have three chopsticks I
guess um yep three no more yep so I have
these three chopsticks and I used to be
like obsessed with Burt's Bees so i have
a bunch of Burt's Bees chapsticks like i
think i have four i also have this
Lizzie B lip balm and this is actually a
lip balm that my mom's friends make
which is really cool they saw like out
our alaska state fair I just have this
like random mirror thing yeah and then I
also have this old bag and I keep um
just some studs that pretty much will go
with anything and these are my favorite
studs ever they're the Juicy Couture
heart stud my friend Rachel who also
gave me the chocolate and she gave me
this for my 15th or 14th birthday so
I've had them for like two years now and
there's still my favorite uh studs and I
just carry these around in this little
bag so I don't lose them or anything
just in case I forget to wear earrings
and I want to rear airings or it would
go well with my outfit because these go
with pretty much any outfit and then I
also have some hair bands I hope most
forgot what these are called that was
weird and I have this NARS um eyeshadow
pencil because this was the tester that
I got for free if you haven't seen my
last haul video I got it for free um
because it was like some give away gift
and it still says tester on it it's just
in my purse for if I want to like add
some more dramatic color to my eyes and
I didn't have any makeup or something
and I just keeping my purse for those
reasons and then last two things that I
have are a pencil and pen for my planner
and my sticky notes and just
I mean you can always carry around a pen
they always come in handy and now i'm
going to move in to the weird random
cool pocket that is right here so i went
to the gym recently and i have some
underwear in here some pink underwear
and i have some socks and i actually am
gonna leave these in here because you
never know when you will need some
underwear and socks not a lot of purses
have a pouch that is like a part of the
cover flap if that makes sense i'm not
really sure so it you can basically keep
whatever you want in there and and like
no one's gonna see that you have like
underwear and socks in your purse if
you're scared of people judging you I
guess yeah and this little pouch I have
this first aid kit and this is just a
super old first aid kit can guess kind
of like what's in here um I also have
some ibuprofen that I don't really use
ibuprofen and then i have just like some
band-aids and um like a towel it and
stuff like that in there um so that is
in my first aid kit and again i really
like this pocket because I mean it's
pretty it's a pretty secret compartment
so you just basically keep anything in
your first aid kit too and I have a
packet of kleenexes and I make up
neutrogena makeup remover and this is
really adorable so this came from this
box that i just bought at costco and
this was so cute like I was like I don't
think i'm gonna use this but then i was
like i could totally use this in my
purse and its really portable and
adorable compared to the big one that
you just put in your bathroom so i
thought that was adorable so that's like
a new addition to my purse then i'm
going to keep in there and then the last
thing that i have actually in my entire
purse is a phone charger because my mom
and sister updated their phones to the
iphone 5 and the only good thing about
that for me is that i have two more
phone charger
is so I keep one of my car and then one
in my purse and then one in my room so I
basically just have a ton of chargers
like really I don't know it's completely
unnecessary but it's really convenient
for me so that is all that I have in my
purse um and here is what it looks like
empty alright so that is it for my whats
