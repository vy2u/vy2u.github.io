school series video which is what's in
my school bag pack or like what you
should put in your school backpack or
what I put my school backpack kind of
thing so I used my backpack the majority
of the time first of all because i
usually kind of have a lot of things to
carry around and second of all what I
don't usually carry my backpack and
carry like a tote bag if I have a lot of
stuff with me for the day I can really
fill it in my back even with my backpack
sometimes because my backpack it's
pretty heavy I'm saying backpack a lot
so I always use my backpack because I
don't want to have like a bad back when
I get older and I can really feel it if
I don't use a backpack so i usually use
my backpack the only time I don't is
what I have classes where I don't need
to carry around huge textbooks but i
know that this year i will have a bunch
of classes where i will have to carry
around massive text books so i will go
ahead and start and show you what is in
my backpack and just a warning it's not
a cute backpack it's i got it because
it's a really good backpack and I like
it so this is oh I think it's called a
recon the north face recall though on
the outside i'll show you and I'm gonna
put it back and then just pull all the
things out of it and keep in mind that i
am not going to school yet so I
literally just put all the things that
my backpack usually looks like during
this girl school year I had an empty at
first but then I just folded up because
I do have school soon anyway so it was a
good time to just fill up um so the
first thing that I always carry around
is um a water bottle with ice and I
actually broke my glass water bottle
this is my sister's my really good
friend Rachel actually gave me this
except the one that I had which is
broken now but she also gave katidis
because she's a nice person and she's
super giving and she knew that this
would be the perfect president to give
Callie and I and I also bring a mug with
either tea or coffee usually T to school
every single day and so that'll go and
the other compartment or the other cup
holder kind of thing on my backpack
throughout the day and then old gosh
this is heavy um for this little mesh
compartment I usually put like clothes
that I will take
off I mean like jackets and sweaters and
stuff like that or scarves so in a
little tiny compartment in the front I
always carry um this hand lotion and
this is the best hand lotion I have ever
used ever in my life and I've been using
it for like four years now you probably
all know that I live in Alaska it gets
really cold outside and it's not like a
wet cold it's a very dry cold so it's
really dry and cold and hands do not
appreciate that if I forget it or if I
use it at home and take it out and leave
it out on accident I get really upset
and um and then like my hands hurt
because they're like correct and dried
so I pretty much always have this in my
backpack I actually just took my ID card
picture for my school today so I don't
carry that around with my T's um and I
always put this in the front compartment
so it has its easy access and I usually
just it's really easy to just put away
and I don't have to dig through my
entire backpacks so that is it for that
small compartment and then in the next
compartment it looks like this you guys
can already kind of see with it in um
it's the smaller compartment I have my
texas instrument it's a ti-84 plus
silver edition and it's pink because I
am taking I took um what classes did I
need this in it I needed this in like
algebra 2 precalculus and then I'm gonna
do AP calculus so I think it's kind of
required to have one of these even
though our school offers them alone you
can't like take them home at night or
anything so I just bought my own and
then what I carry is hair bands and I
just you know kind of tie them together
so they're not all loose and all over
the place it's a big pain if you don't
have hair bands when you're like running
or just like when you are doing a test
and want to get your hair out of your
face I will notice within the first 20
minutes if I don't have a hair band and
I get really annoyed the next thing that
I carry is gum and I carry this not in
my pencil pouch which I take out in
every single class but I submit kind of
my backpack because um in my school even
if people
don't want gum the last four gum I know
that makes me sound like super selfish
but it's my gum nice thing that I
carrying here are like feminine items
and i'm actually not like super discreet
about it i don't really find it very
embarrassing like if a boy wants to be
really Snoopy and go through all my
stuff which just happens like a number
of times like they're like oh what's in
your backpack and then they'll go and be
like oh like look what I found and like
trying to make really awkward for me it
doesn't really bother me at all I don't
get embarrassed by that because there
are a bunch of other girls that attend
my school so I think they you know can
relate it's not something that I get
really embarrassed by I think everyone
knows that it's a necessity so you know
why be embarrassed I guess I could get
those really cool things that you know
make them really discreet but I feel
like if someone saw that they would be
like oh what's in here is it money and
then they would just see what it
actually was and you would probably get
more bears because you were actually
trying to hide it so I don't really care
it's just in there the last thing that I
have in this little pocket um is this
cute little change thing so what I have
in here is a lips a lip gloss and then
this Bobbi Brown like tiny little kit
that's actually my sister and I think
the colors are really pretty and it has
a tiny little brush I'm comfortable
enough where I don't have to wear makeup
to school I don't feel the need to put
on makeup if I haven't but some days I
feel less confident than other days so I
think it'd be just really nice to have
some eyeshadow i could put on if i
wanted to like during lunch or something
and then some lip gloss because this is
my favorite lip gloss but and then i
always carry change but I also always
bring my keys regardless of whether I
Drive there or not so I mean but you
can't go wrong like with to just some
backups I guess so now moving on to the
biggest compartment of the backpack this
is what it looks like on like a bad day
of the year I started bringing my laptop
to school because i had an online class
and then I just started bringing it to
school like every single day the only
problem with that is that you have to
look after it a lot I didn't feel
comfortable leaving to the bathroom
unless
my friends are in the classroom because
while I trust a lot of the people in my
school there have been a lot of things
that have gotten stolen and I don't know
I just it's not something that like my
laptop is one of my most prized
possessions because i bought it myself
and it's like I have a lot of amazing
memories on it I have pictures and
videos and stuff like that so I don't
lose it so that's one of the biggest
problems is that you know you have the
risk of getting it stolen and then also
another problem is I always feel like
I'm like hurting it a lot and just
breaking it I'll put it on the ground
and then I'll fall over and I just feel
like everything's crushing it so that's
also a bad thing but I'm sure it's kind
of fine and then also a lot of people
always ask to you know use your laptop
and that's totally fine if you don't
make videos I could be editing like a
video and you know people are like hey
like what's this except they're always
just like with this and they like think
it's really amusing and I mean I think
if I saw that like I would just like
discreetly click out of it okay so every
single day I carried my binder I don't
have any school work in it and this I
don't have any paper or anything this is
just the exact binder I use last year
and I emptied it all out so I have one
tab for each of my classes and then a
really cool thing that I thought up
since this is kind of like a binder that
you know I don't know it's not like a
typical three-ring binder I got like a
paper cover one of these called paper
protector and I just cut a little slit
in it and then put a sticker on so it
isn't like cut some more of the little
slip that you made and I just filled it
with paper and it was super it's super
easy to get paper out and I really like
that way so I really like this binder
another thing I really like about these
type of binders is that it's completely
flat you can ride on it or you can go
straight to like the class that you're
working on then right on it so yeah I
usually do that the two things that I'd
carry on every single day are that
binder and then this pencil um case and
this is actually ridiculously old like I
think it might be six years old and
Lowell mesh I keep my chapstick and then
I keep um my two different leads or lead
sizes but
cuz i will show you that i'm pretty
particular about my pencils and then in
this little pocket this is where i
usually hide my phone because i keep
this out of my desk usually and then
this is also where I have my headphones
in this little pocket I keep all of my
pencils and pens and highlighters and i
hope none of you guys think I'm like
crazy for doing this or really weird so
I have three different types of pencils
because when i right it's kind of hard
for me like it really hurts my fingers
after a little while so I like to switch
pencils though I really like having
different led sizes because sometimes
it's easier to write with one and then
sometimes I just feel like running with
another I have two types of mechanical
pencils that I use I use this one and I
think I just have this one because it
was on sale and then I just decided that
I liked these ones and then I have this
one so I usually always have these two
mechanical pencils and this one's point
nine and it's like I really like writing
with this one and then this one is point
seven and I use this one after my hand
gets really tired of this one and then I
also have a third pencil and um because
I'm so particular about my pencils like
when someone asks to borrow a pencil
this is the pencil that I give them
because like I have to have these two
pencils and that sounds super weird when
I actually say it um so that's kind of
weird of me I already know you don't
have to tell me that but yeah that those
are the pencils that I use unless it's
like all my friends know that i carry
like mechanical pencils so if they need
to borrow a pencil I will let them
borrow it for sure next thing that I
carry in my pencil holder thing is are
these type of erasers this is just from
last ride and uses whole one so I'm
going to go into the or easiness one um
these are my favorite erasers because I
I don't know while the racers on the
ends of those pencils are fine they
always get really little and then they
get stuck in there and that really
annoys me so I always use this and this
covers a lot like I mean you can erase a
lot more with this one so I like these
kinds and then I always have these two
pens and this one is actually almost out
because it was from last year so I'll
have to like get another colored pen I
love having this orange
and but i also like I don't mind other
colored pens like I like pink pens and
like blue pants but I always like having
a colored pen and then I just have this
regular um uniball pen because i really
like running with this pen and then I
usually just carry my backpack whatever
else I need to like for this for the
last year I had two specific um class
binders that I had to carry around every
time I had that class so I had to carry
around a binder for English every time I
had english and then chemistry I had a
binder that I had to carry to chemistry
every time I had chemistry I'm not sure
what classes I will need a separate
binder for this year so I just showed
you my last year's ones and these are
pretty heavy like these are full of
stuff um but I only carry those around
on those class days because they they
weigh my by pack down and I really don't
like having my backpack weighed down and
I always start my ear off with like a
clean fresh notebook this is one from
last year and I never end up carrying it
around after like the first quarter like
I always love carrying news around I'm
like oh I feel so cool like reading in
this with like and then turning out the
paper I just find that it's a lot easier
to just you know slide out the paper
from my binder and I have my binder I
carry it around to every single day
sometimes I forget this so if i leave my
homework in it i have to like I'm just
like kind of you know that really sucks
for me um so I think it's just a lot
easier to just keep my paper and my
binder and with my homework and
everything that I carry every single day
so after about a quarter or so I stopped
using these um also after about a
quarter or once i get familiar with the
class i stopped taking really great
notes so that's kind of funny but i'll
probably get one of those this year and
just stop using it quarter of the way
through okay so this is the last and
final thing it's my planner i'm actually
is a lot of YouTube people seem to carry
around planners or agendas which is kind
of funny I don't need to write down my
agenda this is more of a thing to be
honest where when i'm really bored i
like writing down all the homework and
things that I have to do but sometimes
like I'll have weeks where I'm really
dependent on it like I'll write down
everything that I have to do for like
the rest of the month and i'll refer to
it every single day of the month and
get really excited for one of our
activities i have but then there are
some times where I don't even look at it
at all but I still carry it around every
single day because when I'm really born
in a class and you take out your agenda
to write your like assignments or
anything on it um your teachers like
don't really mind like instead of like
doodling or something I just write down
everything like this is an example page
yeah it's not something that I need to
do because I always write down my
homework when i get home on a white
board but it's just something that like
that i think is like nice and fun to do
and it makes me feel really organized
and I like feeling really organized so
it's just something that I like to have
and I bring it every single day it's one
of my essential things that I bring and
it's pink it's pretty so that's cool
yeah I'm actually I actually really like
looking through these because it tells
me how my ear was like like this is a
pretty crazy page that you're was
probably stressful I think I'm gonna try
to find the same planner the same exact
planner maybe like in a different color
I'm not sure so I hope you guys enjoyed
that I don't know you know if you really
learn anything because they're not like
organization tips or anything but I just
really like watching those videos or
probably some of my favorites because
when you know people that are super
involved with beauty bring in school
like it's just like interesting to me so
I like learning about what people will
carry around in their backpack I don't
really have anything super weird or you
know abnormal about what I carry around
my bed in my backpack whoa but um I just
really like watching them so I decided
to make one myself so thank you so much
for watching and I will see you guys in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
