to be filming this video right now
because I really feel like I haven't
filmed by myself in like over a month
and I really don't think I have first of
all the background of this video might
be or like the color of this video might
be changing a little bit because the sky
is being kind of bipolar and you also
made notice that I cut my hair I cut it
a few days ago um just because even
though i really liked my ombre hair it
was getting really unhealthy and I went
to the salon I think my stylist kind of
purposely cut it super short because i
really like longer hair but it was also
getting really unhealthy but i think she
cut it super sore short so that the
messed up hombre parts like you can't
really tell anymore so it kind of
actually looks like an actual ombre hair
and i'm really excited because she thin
it out a lot and so now i can curl my
hair without it taking like an hour in
30 minutes so yeah those are the two
things that you may notice throughout
this video so today i'm going to be
doing a what's in my travel bag video
and this is what i usually take what I'm
traveling most of my vacations or
traveling are just vacations like I
don't do business vacations or any
thinks I'm like 17 so usually what I
bring in terms of makeup is just really
light makeup I don't really like doing a
ton of heavy makeup while I travel
because I usually just seen my friends
and family um so I'm going to get into
that but I also want to tell you guys
like where I'm going and a little bit of
an update and stuff like that before I
get started so if you want to just skip
ahead to what's in my travel bag I'll
live at I'm right here that you can
click on um to let you guys know what
time the travel bag starts so I am
making a once in my travel bag video
because I'm going to be doing kind of a
lot of traveling like a lot more
traveling than I'm used to I'm actually
going to orlando or miami florida and
possibly relate to Florida because you
know my boyfriend as you guys know is
actually there right now because he and
his family are there before they go back
to Finland because he's actually leaving
as some of you may know that he's a
foreign exchange student so he does not
live here he only lived here for the
last year so I'm really bummed about
that of course you probably can't tell
but it's just because I'm gonna see him
um like really soon so i'll be meeting
him in miami and also Chloe's going so
close been in a lot of my videos
and we actually have a video that we
filmed together because she made her own
channel which I will link down below go
subscribe to her guys because she's
really really hilarious and she's also
like my best friend so go to her channel
right now and subscribe to her I don't
know she has any videos up right now but
i'll be putting a video up with her on
my channel very soon and then you guys
can go subscribe to them too if you
didn't right now so Chloe's gonna be
going and then my sister is gonna be
going at stuff and then me and my sister
with our family we're gonna go to Korea
which is the first time I've gone in
like 10 years or something actually
probably more I don't really know but I
don't remember going ever going to Korea
um as some of you may remember in some
of my videos I'm half Korean so um I'm
really excited to go mostly I'm just
excited for the food cuz i love Korean
food so that's basically what I'll be
doing for the next two weeks and you
guys will see us while I'm traveling but
as always I'll still have like access to
internet and stuff like that so I may be
doing some vlogging and stuff which is
like my next point that I want to bring
up um I may start a vlog channel and I
know that a lot of people have log
channels like a lot of people who do
beauty videos have long tails as well
and I was actually gonna wait to make a
vlog channel until I had like more
subscribers and stuff like that because
I was like I'm not really sure that
anyone really wants to see any blogs of
mine but then I kind of realized that I
do like to vlog on my own just for my
sake just like my prom video my prom a
scout video my friends knew that I would
really love to have that on camera just
for me to have um so they did that for
me and then now I have that for my
memory at all times um so I think I'm
just gonna make a vlog channel even
though I'm not really sure that anyone
will subscribe to it just because I mean
I like filming um trips and stuff and
like every day blog type things anyways
and now i just have somewhere to put
them and said we're just putting them on
this channel and stuff like that so i'll
have like a place where i actually can
put them and if you guys want to go
subscribe to it or not it's completely
fine but i think i'm just going to make
one anyways tell me what you guys think
about like a vlog channel and if you
guys would subscribe to it or not and
stuff like
because I think I was gonna make one
anyways and I'm not really sure if i'll
be doing any vlogs on this trip to Miami
but I think I definitely want to make
some blogs in Korea just for my sake and
then i think i'll just post them on my
blog channel so this introduction has
been super long I'm really sorry but I'm
going to go ahead and get into what is
in my travel bag now so I basically just
emptied all of the contents out onto
this dresser and then I'm just going to
show you each of the things I guess um
the first thing is this makeup bag that
I hold all of my travel makeup in all
the time I got this um with my
clarisonic when I ordered it online
about two years ago and I thought it was
really cute and I just actually use it
all the time and if I'm not using this
as a travel bag I'm using it as my
everyday makeup bag so I really like
this bag especially because the the
outside it does not get dirty and if it
does you can just wipe it off really
easily ok so moving on I kind of
organized this a little bit into
different categories first I have my
makeup brushes that I bring along and
I'm actually missing my powder brush
which i think i will bring that along
because i have my powder but these are
the makeup brushes that i usually travel
with mostly because they're the smaller
ones of my makeup brushes i don't try to
bring like really big makeup brushes so
these little things are actually really
nice makeup brushes I got from Target so
I really like these ones and they are
really cheap but there's still good
quality for how she papers so I actually
really like using these and you can see
that i use them in my beach makeup
tutorial that one doesn't do quite as
good of a job as this one with blending
really harsh edges this one kind of just
like spreads it around a little bit so
I'm bringing along this blending brush
and then i have this flat shader brush
i've been using this a lot for winged
eyeliner so i'll put this eyeliner on
and then I'll like wing it out with this
and I've really been liking to do that
lately and I have the lovely Meeks
designed my eyebrow eyebrow pencil kind
of gel thing and I'm
doing this because i usually use the
eyebrow and beak it but that is really
big and very much not really practical
for traveling so I'm just bringing this
along and then I think I'll do as good
of a job as filling in my eyebrows and
stuff like that someone bringing that
and then of course I'm bringing I shadow
primer and then I just basically tried
to find the smallest little palette that
I have I haven't really used this much
since my like last tutorial but I like
the colors in here so I decided to bring
this Maybelline studio in taupe
temptress along and that is super hard
to say if you try saying it's really
hard and then I have this really small
palette from I think it's clinique I
didn't really think ahead for this video
so I decided to just pause the video and
then open these pallets so this is what
this looks like i think i'll be using
these two colors mostly out of this
palette and i really like these two
colors so probably using that as well
and then for like eyelashes and stuff
I'm just bringing my eyelash curler that
I use every day and I got this like from
Sephora with that birthday thing so it's
like a miniature they're real mascara
and this is like my favorite mascara so
I'm bringing this long instead of my
actual version and then I'm just
bringing along some um what's a cold
waterproof mascara and then I have all
of my face items and I'm just bringing
concealer this portable highlighter that
also came with the birthday set from
this and then under eye concealer from
Laura Mercier or not necessarily but I
use it under a concealing getting really
skilled with the one hand thing so
that's what that looks like if you're
wondering and then my powder and I'll
just bring along my powder brush and
then lastly what i have for lips is this
baby lips because if you saw my spring
break beach makeup tutorial I really
like wearing this just whatever I don't
know to the beach because it's just like
chopstick but it gives you some color
which is nice and then I'm bringing my
favorite lip gloss long that I just got
not really recently but kind of you saw
in my last video or my prom video and
it's the marvelous Moxie in ringleader
just in case we go out to dinner or
something and I want to look a little
bit better than just
wearing like chapstick or that so and
then finally I have my absolutely
favorite product ever this jack black
lip balm with 25 SPF this is the best
chopstick ever and my lips are always
trapped so I really like it so I almost
forgot this BB cream which is basically
like the main thing I use so i don't
really know how i forgot it I always
find myself reaching for this product
during this summer not definitely not
during the winter this does not work
very well with my dry skin at least for
me so during the summer i always use
this product though i really love this
BB cream i've used it in like almost all
of my videos that i have been outside
for so i definitely recommend this BB
cream because it's really really
buildable and its really good coverage
um and like I said it's super buildable
so I really like this BB cream so I will
definitely be bringing that along as
well alright guys thanks so much for
