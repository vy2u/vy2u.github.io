hope that my camera will not shut down I
just filmed like two minutes of this and
it froze so yeah let's hope that this
uploads so today I'm gonna be doing a
what's in my purse video I got a few
requests for it I thought it'd be really
fun because this is my obsession of this
month and I love it my purse I also got
like a few questions on the purse itself
so if you're interested in like buying
the purse I got it through Nordstrom
because I don't know I was in North
sturm and then I saw the purse I'll just
link it below in the Nordstrom link and
I'm sure that you can get it on like
Marc Jacobs calm or something too
obvious announcements I'm in my new area
thing so you guys can probably tell that
there's like a vanity behind me and then
I painted the wall blue and also my hair
is black it's all in one color now I
actually did not ask for it to be black
like it's pretty much black it's a
really dark brown so I just got back
from California and I just basically
went on a college tour trip again to LA
but this time my whole family came so
that was really fun I had been wanting
to dye my hair all of one color for
basically since I like a month after I
dyed it um right because you guys can
probably tell that it was really messed
up so we went to this salon in LA and it
was like $80 for a hair dye and I asked
to make it my natural color which you
guys probably know is light brownish and
and she did this so it's dark I usually
don't get really mad at you know these
like mess ups because it's like a new
thing so I can just try out new looks on
accident without like actually wanting
to I don't know it doesn't really make
sense but I don't really mind the black
especially things it's like fall so I
just can say that I dyed it darker for
fall and winter so that's what's going
on in my life
now so I'm gonna go into my what's in my
purse video now this is the purse that I
showed in my last video my haul I think
that was my last video this is a Marc by
Marc Jacobs purse and a lot of sir I did
a what's in my purse video was actually
with my sister's purse who let me borrow
it for like an extended period of time
but it wasn't my purse but the funny
thing is it was the same style as this
so I obviously really liked that purse
because I basically got the same style
except this is like the leather more
expensive version if you watched my last
video you guys know that I have not had
a purse of my own before this purse and
I really don't know what I did because
there are so many things that you need
to carry around with you or you should
be carrying around with you at all times
that I just didn't so yeah I'm gonna get
started I actually do use like the
pockets and stuff um I actually gonna
start with this you guys just thought I
usually don't carry this around all the
time cuz it's heavy and it's big but
this is the Lilly Pulitzer agenda and I
use this really every single day so far
except actually this week because I have
not had that much school well I'm not
been doing I've been carrying it around
recently because I'm super behind in
school work right out last we go into
California and basically I'm behind in
every single class and instead of
actually doing work you know I just
write it all down and then stress over
it cuz that makes sense so that is what
I've been carrying around recently and
then I'm going to kind of show you guys
the layout of the purse I think so it
has a zipper pocket right here and then
it has two open pockets on the other
side right here in here and then this
part of the bag actually unzips and then
it is a bigger zipped pocket in this big
zipped pocket I was told that you should
keep things that you don't want like
stolen or things that you don't want to
fall out really easily I basically just
keep feminine products I also keep away
oil blotting sheets
before I had a purse I actually never
used these because I never just carried
them around in my pocket so now I get to
use these and this was in my Korea Hall
and that's it for that pocket so it just
keeps like feminine products and bigger
makeup related products that I don't
want to like have taking up room in my
actual the actual big part of my purse I
don't know it I don't know what I'm
trying to say I think my only downside
about this purse is that it's kind of
inaccessible but I think that is like
just all of these types of purses
because it has like a wide or it has a
big space where you can put a lot of
things in but just the opening is kind
of restrictive so that's like the only
downside but in this big pocket I have
my wallet and I used to never use this
wallet it's a hobo international wallet
and I was like a hundred dollars on eBay
but I just never used it because I
didn't want to carry this big thing
around so I would just like take out all
my credit cards and just like gift cards
and stuff and put them in a small bear
Bradley keychain and here I guess I can
do like a quick what's in my wallet so
this is actually a huge wallet and the
only bad thing about this wallet is that
this metal makes your hands smell like
metal and it's really annoying because
it doesn't smell very good and I'm
someone for some reason who smells my
hands a lot because they usually smell
good because I have like yummy smelling
lotion so it is actually really annoying
to have this just stink up your hands
and I don't know it's not just me like
am I the only one who just smells my
hands all the time besides that I really
like this wall it's really really really
big and it has a lot of different
compartments so in here I just keep my
receipt like my recent receipts and then
I have my driver's license and then my
cash card and then my
credit card and then in this giant
pocket
I had a big pad up but I still have one
can't even tell if there's like a pad
and stuff I know that was pretty cool so
you're going to basically see how big
this well it is so this is what it looks
like opened up and then you can put
something in this entire basically a
pocket they have it has like an entire
back pocket for this compartment and
then it has two side compartments so you
just open this up and then I have my
gift cards and like my stamp cards for
like restaurants and eyebrow waxing and
stuff and then I have coffee shop gift
cards and then reward point stuff yeah
so just the basics just like the typical
things and then on the other side I
usually keep cash and I have not carried
cash around for quite a while and then
coins in this pocket so I don't have any
cash right now
cuz I am broke and I don't have any
coins so that's nice and then what I
have in this major pocket is this
bracelet this wrap bracelet because I
was shooting video and I wasn't sure if
I wanted to use it so I just put it in
my bag girl fast and there are these two
nail polishes
so this nail polish is my favorite nail
polish as I love the color so I painted
my nails but I absolutely hate this nail
polish it's probably one of the worst
nail polishes that I've used and I keep
using it and I don't know why I just I
just never learned but it's just cuz I
love the color so much so it's really
really thick you need a lot and then it
starts drying right away so you have to
be super super quick and it's really
really easy to mess up and then it takes
like and then it takes like 30 minutes
for one later dry and then you have to
pile on another layer or else you're
like nail will show and so that takes
another 30 minutes to dry so basically I
haven't
my nails since yesterday morning it is
awful and then I painted my toes with
absolutely no problem with like ZOA so
this is Sally Hansen and it sucks like I
hate it but I really really like this
color I I mean this is like a totally
first world problem and its really
frustrating so yeah I do not recommend
this Sally Hansen complete salon
manicure at all
and this isn't almost all men so I don't
know you guys want to get it even though
I just gave a terrible review on it go
for it and then I have my lens cap then
I just have a pen for my planner black
pen and then I'm gonna go into these
pockets so in this pocket
I always carry around chapstick I
usually just have one I don't know how
both of them got in here so this is my
favorite all-time favorite chapstick
it's the ER lip balm it is the Jack
Black intense therapy lip balm and I
only like the mint one they have a bunch
of different ones like grapefruit or yea
grapefruit and I don't even lavender but
I only like them at once and it makes
your lips all tingly so I love it and
then I carry this mini I have no idea
how to say this but I guess this is like
a popular lotion that they happened like
Sephora and I think Nordstrom's but it's
lost too tame that's what it looks like
but I'm sure that's not how you say it
and it's made in France so I don't know
how to say that but its manager and its
really nice to keep in small places like
this and I'm almost out and then I
usually don't actually keep these in
here but when I go places I will put my
keys in that little pocket which is
really convenient because you can just
reach in and not have to dig around and
then take em out real fast and then I
always keep my phone in this pocket and
I really appreciate how they made it
large enough for galaxies because these
galaxies are huge and that usually you
can't fit them and phone related things
but
I can because it's big enough and I also
have my military ID in here because I'm
on Facebook day so that's what I have in
that pocket and then everything's
dropping okay I'm just going through him
on the floor okay so in this little
pocket right here that has a zipper I
actually do not know what this I'm here
I have not looked in here I have my
headphones and then I have my work badge
and then I have the tags for this purse
if you guys are curious this tag or this
purse was 368 dollars so it was quite
expensive but I did buy it myself which
is a disclaimer that I should have put
at the beginning of this video you were
curious and then I have a memory card
case holder some memory cards and a
brandy ring I wear that it's the boat
one that I had in my haul and then for
like lip products I have this marvelous
Moxie in roll breaker and I always carry
around an eyeliner because I feel like
that's really versatile and you can
smear it and it looks kind of like a
shadow so those are the makeup products
that I carry around and then I have two
hair bands which I need two hair bands
because my hair is like super thick so
if I only use one it'll stretch it all
out so I always use two for my hair and
that's actually it for what is in my
purse so I don't really carry anything
else in my purse on a regular basis I
may all throw stuff in there obviously
but other than that that is what is in
my purse
usually alright guys so that is the end
