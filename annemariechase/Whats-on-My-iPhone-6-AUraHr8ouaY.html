be doing a what's on my iPhone video so
much to talk about I don't even know
where to start
okay so first of all if you haven't
noticed I got my hair cut but that
doesn't really matter
second of all I'm going to be going to
China for eight weeks starting today um
you didn't know that you should probably
subscribe to my blog channel because why
not I'll be on an airplane for so long
I'm flying from a coach to Seattle
Seattle Dallas Dallas to Shanghai so I'm
basically going backwards to get over to
Asia and I'm really excited it's
definitely the craziest thing I've
probably ever done in my life like I
have not been to a foreign country for
over a week at a time so I'm getting a
VPN which I guess allows you to like get
past the blockage on the internet but my
hope my help is that I'll be able to
post YouTube videos so if I am able to
I'm definitely gonna be posting every
week on my vlog channel weekly vlogs no
change in that and I'm also going to be
posting weekly videos on this channel so
the first video that I have in mind is
an apartment tour and I'm really excited
to show you guys so hopefully that won't
be an issue I'm really hoping for that
in that YouTube I will be updating my
Instagram and snapchat and Twitter so
follow me on Instagram
amory chase and that I always update my
snapchat like pretty much daily that is
a red dot chase cuz I couldn't get em
ray chase
so moving on with my phone um first of
all I want to show you guys something
really cool that I got so I got a lens
for my iPhone I found this at the Apple
Store and I decided to just get it
because I blog every week anyways it's
the olloclip this is not a sponsored
video whatsoever this is a fisheye lens
and then this is a wide lens and then if
you twist these off they become macro
lenses is that what they're called
okay so this is the fisheye you guys can
tell that my room is hanging disaster
and then this is normal camera and this
is the wide lens yeah so pretty cool huh
so yeah I thought that was pretty
relevant for what's on my iPhone since
that has been on my iPhone for like the
past few days just like chill in there
what's up okay
I am currently behind the camera so if
my voice is really loud very sorry
okay so let's get into it so this is my
home screen lock screen and it says
vlogs on Monday and post a main channel
video every Wednesday but yeah it works
sometimes as you guys can probably see
my phone is organized by color so the
first page it's just all the apps that
like come with the phone moving on to
this page I have the YouTube app the
studio app which is like amazing for
replying to comments so that is honestly
when my most used apps I have Pinterest
that I go on for like inspiration for
like DIY stuff or like room stuff don't
do much with that inspiration but it's
there Netflix
SoundCloud Wunderlist 360 oh this is
weird because I'm not going to show you
this but me and Zoe my roommate took
pictures progress pictures while we were
dieting then they didn't really get
better so yeah maybe one day
snapchat Oh see if this works here let
me focus it okay so you can add my
snapchat by going on your snapchat and
like snapchatting this or just like
focusing your camera on this see if it
works and let me know in the comments
below if you were able to successfully
add me on snapchat so I pretty much
accept everyone who adds me because I
really love snap chatting you guys and I
told you guys to snapchat me if you
wanted to say hi
Oh oh my gosh that's hilarious oh yes oh
thank you all for those who said hi next
I have my Spotify just arriving am I
should I just take this off I just
recently got Spotify Premium coz there's
a discount like half off for students I
might start making like playlists and
stuff mostly I just kind of like search
whatever I feel like listening to right
now or I look on global top fifty cuz
they're just like all the songs a radio
and they are pretty catchy songs I have
my tumblr and I absolutely love tumblr I
don't know if I'd tumblr right but I
don't know if you guys want to follow me
it's a murray chase facebook i really
don't use twitter all this
self-promotion this is my twitter very
very fascinating my Instagram just
posted a picture with my sister I don't
have like a theme or anything cuz I got
time for that
but if you guys want to follow me on
Instagram here's what it looks like and
I'll definitely be updating it a lot
when I go to China okay so in these
folders I basically just organize them
by like what I think they are is is
entertainment and socializing I have all
of my like camera or like editing stuff
I really do not use like basically all
this stuff I do use vsco cam or vsco cam
then I have like money and like venmo if
you don't have been mode definitely get
venmo it is so easy to transfer money
from friend to friend and like it is so
inconvenient when I come home and people
don't have that mo so definitely get
that
if you like ever find yourself having
like money issues and like people owe
you so much money time to get them
though I used to Yelp all the time in LA
to find places to eat it's not very
popular in Anchorage Alaska oh this
Starbucks app is so useful if you go to
Starbucks that all definitely get this
app because you earn like rewards and
you get free drinks like every time you
like reach a certain number and they
also give you like birthday drinks and
also you get free refills on your iced
coffee or coffee or teas in store if you
are a green level and to be a green
level you just need like to get five
drinks so definitely get the app if you
go to Starbucks is eating at USC tipping
was really cool you basically order on
this app and pay for it on this app and
pick it up at like different restaurants
but I think that's for like very
specific college campuses this is my
fitness folder I haven't used this one
or this one sleep cycle but MyFitnessPal
I've started doing that again oh if you
guys want to add me we should all do
this I don't know I have been gaining
weight okay this is my profile you guys
can add me if you want and we can be fit
together and then I have like the period
tracker which is nice and useful for
telling when you're gonna have your
period so this one is like shopping and
stuff or spending money I guess um I use
the lyft and uber app in this all the
time in LA not really much else in this
little folder this is all for like
school related or work-related turbo
scan is like the best scanning app if
you don't have a scanner use this and
you can like change the border and make
it into like a real paper and then you
can like email them to yourself it's
like more useful than a scanner because
it works so well I don't know that's a
random app to be really into but and
then I have like Quizlet that's pretty
much all I use in this folder and then I
have like these random miscellaneous
apps that I do not touch at all these
are all VPNs you can get around the
blocking of certain apps with a VPN so I
got these ones and when I go to China if
I use these I can like get onto
Instagram and like snapped and stuff so
yeah that is it that is what is on my
iPhone alright guys that is the end of
the video I hope you guys enjoyed seeing
what's on my iPhone a little bit weird
very exclusive inside look because no
one really gets to look what's on my
iPhone so for like my sister and stuff
oh yeah so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video and I will talk to you guys
hopefully next week bye guys hey it's
Avery and today's video is in
celebration of me finishing my freshman
year of college I don't know why this is
in celebration of it but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
