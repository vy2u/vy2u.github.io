do with my hair because in person I like
just go like this
every now and then but then if I like do
this and I start off a video that rounds
like so I have to like what do we do
hey guys its Amory welcome back to my
channel at this point I feel like it's
actually clickbait to even title a video
why I left college I have personally
been seeing these everywhere like 18 to
19 year olds dropped out of college to
follow dreams but I actually did leave
college so okay so I wrote some talking
points down just in case I forget so the
video is basically just going to be like
an update video what I've been doing
what I've been up to and why I left
college and if you're already subscribed
to my blog channel you've probably
already seen this video so go over there
and subscribe if you're not already
subscribed but let's just get into the
video grab your cup of tea or a cup of
coffee I feel like this might be a long
one maybe not I don't know I'm currently
a junior not really anymore technically
at the University of Southern California
USC but right now I want to leave of
absence so if you enter my name in the
school system it would say that I
withdrew technically like according to
the school I'm not going I'm not a
student right now so I'm not a student
I'm taking a leave of absence in order
to do a full-time co-op and if you don't
know what a cop is it's basically a
full-time internship the main difference
between a co-op and internship that I've
seen is like s'more to me like you're
integrating yourself into a full-time
position versus like an internship where
you're like doing an internship and like
you could have a potential to work there
they're very similar with the hair my
hair will have many different hair
styles in this video so basically I am
taking a leave of absence which means
that I'm taking zero classes and that
the university does like technically say
I withdrew from school but I'm taking a
leave of absence to work at Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson Neutrogena
the steps that I took in order to get
this position we're kind of just very
random and really crazy so I wanted to
explain that really quickly because it
inspire some of you guys honestly like
pretty inspiring to me to not be like a
lazy little poop just sitting on the
couch it all happens when a lot of the
people that I was surrounded by we're
all interviewing or recruiting so during
your junior year of high school you're
like super busy getting ready to get
into your college so like during my
junior year I like waited till the last
minute to submit my application for
different colleges and then I eventually
chose USC during your junior year of
college you're like scrambling to get an
internship with a company so that you
can get a job after college so like
that's very stressful on its own but
what's even more stressful is if you
don't know what you want to do me and
all the people around you are like
feinting really cool companies to work
at investment banking consulting like
very traditional business pathways right
so here I was like I'm really into
marketing I'm into digital like media
creativity like stuff like that whereas
all my peers were like oh I'm doing
financial investment banking or whatever
mole off and I was really stressed out
because I was like I feel like I'm
really behind even though I don't know
what I want to do and I don't want to
like commit to something that's like
investment banking that I know that I
won't want to do I was taking completely
by chance just because my friend
Catherine asked me to take this PR class
with her because one of her friends had
taken it and he told her that would be
really beneficial for her as a
influencer or like as someone who has a
YouTube channel basically so I was like
okay I'll take this class it's the only
PR class that I've ever taken the only
PR class that I will take in one of the
classes this woman came in to talk about
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson cuz she worked at
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson News Geena and she
basically told us about really cool
campaigns that she was working on how
Neutrogena took on Kerry Washington as
the ambassador and how they added like
three shades on the Fitzpatrick scale
which basically means they added three
colors because the Fitzpatrick scale is
like a range of skin tones so that was
really huge for diversity because
obviously it's very important for people
of every color to be able to find
themselves in media or find their skin
like in the beauty aisle and so I was
already very like very impressed by this
person by this company but I didn't
really think that much of it I just took
a lot of notes because I was like oh
this is really valuable for me to know
because I'm very inspired by this right
so that's like pretty much all that came
from that day and then two months later
or something I'm constantly like looking
at my job portal and like looking at
different companies and like struggling
to find what kind of companies I'd like
literally write lists of really cool
companies that I would love to work for
someday write them down and then I would
like look to see if they had any
internship opportunities I don't think I
actually ended up applying for like any
single thing because this opportunity
just came so fast but I did see
different companies that were coming to
talk called Trojan talks here at USC and
it's basically just wear like recruiters
come to the school to talk about the
positions that are available and one of
the positions was for Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson
and I was like this would be really cool
to go to but if I know some person who's
worked at Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and really
like their experience I signed up for
this Trudgen talk but the day of the
Trojan talks I was sitting outside on
the couch two of my roommates Jacqueline
- Michelle we're both sitting with me
and we were just like lounging I was
super tired for some reason and I was
like kind of just like laying down and I
told them I was like I signed up for
this trojan talks it's at 4:00 or 5:00
or like litter in the afternoon but not
too late and I was like I don't think
I'm going to go I'm really tired right
now and Michelle I'm sure Jacqueline
also said something by just a signature
member Michelle because they're both
very supportive people Michelle's like
you should go like you're actually doing
stuff like I wish I had gone to these
things and I was a junior and that like
really resonated with me because she
said like you should do this because I
wish I had done this when I was like
your age so of course I couldn't just be
like that I'm not going to go and I went
and in this room they're probably like
15 to 20 people I'm really bad at like
counting numbers in my head but there
was like some good amount of people
there and I thought I was in the wrong
place because I saw someone that I knew
and she was a biomedical engineering
major and I'm a business major
interested in marketing and
entrepreneurship and so I was like wow
I'm definitely in the wrong place
because she along with her other
by medical engineering friends we're all
talking about like biomedical
engineering and I was like Johnson and
Johnson is a pharmaceutical company they
sell medical devices like this is
definitely not for me but there's free
food so I sat down anyways and the
entire event ended up being just for
marketing people so first of all they're
like alright so just let you know this
is pretty much just geared towards
marketing majors or marketing business
majors half the people in the room who
are like there ahead of time they're
like oh like we're not supposed to be
here it was like one of those times
where I felt really out of place but
then it ended up being like I was in the
right place and then over the course of
this chargin talk they explained this
position that they were recruiting for
but one of the things that they said was
that this position was heavily based in
data analytics but also 50% creativity
so like a good balance of both and
that's like pretty much exactly what I
am interested in because I really like
YouTube because it's a creative outlet
but it also allows me to kind of like
look at the data analytics that Google
provides me and I can basically see
exactly who watches my videos what age
group from where like all that
information is available to me I can
take that information and then use it to
create a video that I know will cater to
that group and to me that's just like
amazing because it's like you're using
math and like charts and stuff to make
decisions that like you're able to have
creativity with I don't know if that
makes any sense and I explained that so
horribly I said math and charts and
stuff but that was just so appealing to
me so I was like this sounds exactly
like something that I would want to do
they also mentioned that it was for
Neutrogena which is pretty much like if
I were to think of any beauty brands
that I could work for it would
definitely be Neutrogena because I've
used it for so long it's such a solid
company in my head there are tons of
beauty brands that I love but I just
feel like this was such a solid brand to
work for so of course I was like very
very excited to apply and another crazy
factor to me getting this position is
that I used the example that the woman
who came to talk in my PR class used
about like Kerry Washington and just
like different examples of campaigns
that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has done I used
one of
two of those examples that they talked
about and the person interviewing me was
like I was so impressed by those answers
because that really shows that you did
background research and like that was
just something that I remembered because
it was so intriguing and interesting
that someone else gave me that knowledge
and I was able to repeat it because it
was told like a story and I took notes
on it like that's literally the only
reason why I mentioned it because I felt
so inspired by those stories and those
campaigns that I was like yeah this is
why I would want to work for Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson right so that was just like a
really really crazy series of events
that eventually like turned into me
getting a job offer or an internship
offer co-op offer with this huge company
that I would love to work for and then I
am currently working for so that's
pretty much what I'm doing I've been
working there for like a month now so
first it takes a little while to like
kind of acclimate to your job but now
that I'm pretty much used to like where
I sit who's working with me and all that
kind of stuff I'm like getting bigger
projects and it's been a lot of fun so
that's basically why I left college I
left college to pursue this co-op
because it's a full-time 40 hour a week
position and I was lucky enough to be
able to do it and to work it out with my
guidance counselor so that I can still
graduate on time I'm essentially just
taking the semester off with no cost so
I'm saving the whole semesters worth of
money that I would have spent going to
USC the semester I'm also not in my
sorority anymore I froze my status which
is like actually throw these are pretty
costly at USC so I'm saving that money
and then I'm also getting paid for this
co-op very cost-effective I will have to
complete one or two summer classes this
year but I can take them out of
Community College and that is literally
like a fraction of the price of one unit
or one class at USC so that's pretty
much what I am up to this semester huge
updates but I just thought that like
story and itself was kind of crazy
because if literally one of those things
hadn't happened I would not have even
applied or like got in the position so
that kind of just shows you that like
success is like literally kind of just
showing up
but also like you can never tell like
what will happen because I literally
thought that I was going to struggle
with finding a cool internship that I
was actually interested in for the rest
of the year and then this kind of just
stumbled upon me in my path
okay so I did write something down that
I forgot that I wrote down that I do
think is really interesting because I
have been seeing a lot of these types of
videos lately it's literally like
nineteen year old student drops out of
college to pursue their dreams and then
like their dream is to like travel
around the world and live a really
luxurious lifestyle and like this is
what they dropped out of college or
school to do and I just wanted to make a
quick nut on that since I am making this
video and I am titling this video why I
left college because hopefully someone
who clicks on one of their videos will
click on this video and then I can have
like a counter-argument to those
people's you know like why they left
college type argument so that like we
just have some like balance balance in
the world of why I left college the
problem I have with people literally
dropping out of college or of school to
pursue these wild crazy dreams that are
just super luxurious and really
over-the-top following your dreams
doesn't necessarily mean dropping your
safe route and taking on full risk which
in this case for these kids would be
dropping out of college that like maybe
their parents paid for and traveling the
world full-time and living this like
super luxurious expensive lifestyle
that's not what that means to me to me
following your dreams means really
evaluating what it is that you want to
do taking the time and doing
soul-searching to see what it is that
you want to accomplish in life that one
huge goal or like those few huge goals
that you really want to see in your
lifestyle and then taking steps every
single day to work towards those goals
so like revolving every single action
that you have around making that goal
happen and that doesn't have to mean
dropping out of school to try to like
make that happen now it might mean
taking on an extra job or taking on a
side job while you're in school to save
up some extra money so that you can
travel someday if that's your main goal
in life or making sure that you do hit
that milestone or that stepping-stone of
graduating from
College in order to increase your
chances of getting a bigger paycheck in
the long term in order to be able to
afford traveling if that's what you
really want to do it's not about you
know taking that full risk because
that's what it means to like take risks
I don't know but it's about revolving
your everyday actions around that goal I
have no idea if this video made any
sense whatsoever or if it's just like a
rambling video that is really really
catered to like those few people who
like will watch those videos and be like
oh I neither drop out of college now but
hopefully it was like entertaining at
the least so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video
if you guys didn't know what I'm up to
the semester you're pretty much all
updated by this point and be sure to
subscribe to my blog channel because I
have been blogging go subscribe to that
and also follow me on social media
because I update those as well I feel so
weird just leaving this video now after
I have that huge rant but I'm going to
leave now cuz invest it thank you guys
so much for watching this video and I
will see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
