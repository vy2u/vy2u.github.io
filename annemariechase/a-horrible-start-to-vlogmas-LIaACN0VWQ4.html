today okay so I have used that intro for
the last three years but I didn't have
time to do new one and I just had no
idea that it was December 1st already
that came up so fast today is Friday and
it is the first day of the last day of
my classes the first day I don't have
class like so I finished all my classes
for the semester wow that was really
hard to explain
and last night I kind of celebrated a
little bit with my roommate Sydney and
Elliot you guys know who he is I didn't
vlog him sorry but I had a really odd
weird day
it was very drama-filled and just not
not a fun time you know so um I just
didn't really feel like vlogging and I
just wanted to celebrate like I
originally intended to before all that
drama came so we kind of just drank wine
and just talked to each other and I
think it was a really it was a fun time
it was like I always liked those
conversations where you can have really
deep meaningful conversations and then
that was kind of like one of those times
so I was just grateful to like be
hanging out with my roommate and one of
my good old friends so that was the
start of my vlogmas I don't know why I
brought that up in here but um yeah so
last night was a little rough and I just
it was it was an odd day but I'm hoping
that this month will be a lot better
last month was extremely it was such a
it's such a weird month it was probably
the worst month of the whole year but um
I don't know I feel like I'm just in a
much better like mindset about things
and I'm looking at things much more
positively so even though it was kind of
a crappy month I'm just like thankful
that I have a positive mindset because
that's not always the case sometimes
sometimes I get like really upset about
things so maybe this will be like the
theme of my vlogmas is just bettering
myself and like renewing myself because
I just feel like so much stuff happened
last month that I'm just ready to be
over with it and I'm so ready to go on
break
take a vacation and just like hang out
with my family and people that I love so
that's my little update and today it's a
three o'clock I've got a late start to
this log and just kind of a late start
to my day I I didn't really do much I've
been cleaning up a little bit and
editing my weekly vlog because I wanted
to post it today I don't know if I'll be
able to get it done in time but I'm
actually heading tonight with Tasha to
the hashtag best weekend ever do't is
hosting a bunch of youtubers a bunch of
friends and they're all bringing us
together in LA I think it's in Venice to
an Airbnb and we're basically just like
having a sleepover and they're taking us
to dinner they're like setting up dry
bar for us and I think it'll just be so
much fun and it's also a great time to
happen because it's like the start of
vlogmas so i think that if you guys are
like into the youtube community you'll
probably recognize a lot of people there
I'm not positive who's going yet but I
know that like Brooke is going Brooke
Michiyo Gretchen um Tasha
Danielle Carolyn and I honestly don't
really know who else but I know that
there are more people so if you like any
of those youtubers then you will
probably like these next few vlog misses
but otherwise you can probably see some
youtubers who you might not recognize
and like check out their channels or
whatever so tonight I think we're
leaving at 5:30 and it's 3:00 I don't
really know what to pack I'm so bad at
like this kind of stuff like events and
just packing and picking out outfits for
events it's just like something that I
hold off to the very last minute and
then I'm like why did I do this so
last-minute like why didn't I prepare
for this because I could have had like a
better looking outfit or whatever but at
some point it's like I don't care but
then sometimes I do so maybe I should
put in a little bit more effort but it's
too late at this point so I'm just kind
of sitting here editing my video which I
not sure if I'll get done in time before
we leave but hopefully I will be able to
have time to edit it tonight it's a
little bit different because a lot of
the other youtubers are coming from
other places and I am local in LA like
for now cuz I
go to USC and so we're just like within
a Driving's distance away and I'm not
sure if like me and Tasha will be coming
back here often so I just really have no
idea what to pack because I think the
idea was like we probably wouldn't so I
don't think we have a lot of time
budgeted to come back but we could so I
don't know I really don't know how these
next few days are gonna go but I'm very
excited but I also have my finals coming
up I have my hardest final on Wednesday
and then like mmm just like a bunch of
other stuff - on Wednesday of next week
so I might come back early as well to
start studying for them on Sunday just
because I got a lot of stuff to do so
that's pretty much a really good layout
of how this week is gonna go how this
weekend is gonna go and I'm gonna be
trying to upload every single day for
vlogmas like I usually do should be
interesting and I don't know I always
just really really enjoy blog miss so
that's pretty much my really long intro
to vlog miss very jumbled scattered all
over the place what's new
but later on I think me and Tasha want
to open our doped gift day one on camera
together because we were just so curious
if they gave us the same things and we
just think it'd be fun so I'll probably
be doing that and I probably won't have
time to decorate my room but I have a
little Christmas tree that I like to put
up for vlogmas maybe I won't do that
today maybe I'll do that when I get back
on Sunday but yeah that's my update and
I'll probably um vlog more with Tasha
when we open our gifts okay guys so this
is my box
it's my back I don't know people looking
wait

what's your reaction to my stand so you
guys I just showed Tasha this but I was
telling her I got my stand and ever
since I've been so excited because I
like just take it in the bathroom to get
ready because I like to watch youtube
videos sometimes so I'm gonna straighten
my hair and then watch stuff off of my
stand and I was really excited about it
and Tasha was something cool okay so
it's like five or six and we're driving
there now instead of who brings so like
it's probably I don't know
but we have to get my car first and then
come back to get our stuff that's what
we're doing we're ready for our road
trip to Venice yeah so I don't really
know why I keep updating we're not doing
anything later yeah literally but we're
getting ready to go this is a really
horrible footage okay bye
and literally five minutes a door drive
someone crashed into my car yay thank

mindfulness and positivity show I'm
trying not to let this affect me too
