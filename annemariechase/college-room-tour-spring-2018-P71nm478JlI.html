video and the person behind the camera
is actually Zoe who shared this with me
for a whole year and I've been in here
for the last two years and honestly this
is probably my favorite room that I've
ever had I don't know how I haven't done
this already so I'm really excited so in
this video I wanted to in particular
show you guys some kind of storage slash
like organizational tips that I've taken
found myself also stolen from Zoe and
also kind of show you guys my new decor
my new art that I've got in my room this
video is sponsored by society6 and I've
worked as society6 a lot in the past
it's a really cool website essentially
where a bunch of artists can put their
art up onto this website and it takes
form in like throw blankets duvet covers
comforters pillowcases prints and then
even framed art prints prints canvas
prints on the website you can find like
endless art so it's really really cool
and all of my viewers get 10% off with
the code Emery deal and it also gives
you free shipping which is really nice
for things like this that are a lot
bigger and also like floor pillows which
we also have so yeah it's a really good
deal so with that I think I'm just gonna
start on this room tour me and so I just
tried filming this and basically there
are a bunch of like society6 Easter eggs
that are just gonna pop up so you should
expect it so we're just gonna start off
on like this random little corner of my
room so every single one of my door has
like multiple door hooks and it's just a
really nice place to put your like bags
or towels or sweaters or jackets it's
actually it saves a lot more space than
they look like they do actually like
matter really cool off so you could
probably tell and then this little
corner this is like my productivity
goals corner like I run my to-do lists
on here I like to print out these
calendars and this is called the
Seinfeld method
when you're trying to either start a
habit like I help you have it or trying
to break a bad habit it's really nice to
be able to visualize that so you
basically just write a read eggs after
each day that you like successfully do a
habit or don't do a habit so that's been
a really good way for me to keep kind of
on top of making sure that I like
exercise and like don't drink too much
or whatever this is a nice method do you
agree you did it we might agree well
yeah it's really visual of helpful you
never know how much good or bad stuff
you do Michael you write it down cuz
like with computers you can just check
the data but you don't you just like
have no idea I would have you know
visualize it yeah you have like I had no
idea how much I do stuff that I don't
think I do often everyday hard to lie to
yourself data doesn't lie okay um so
anyways next we have just kind of my
shoe rack that's not actually that
interesting we have my yoga mat very
interesting and then we have this little
floor pillow this is actually very
popular for people sitting outside
because we also have run out there so
people genuinely just like sitting on
the floor probably goes to this floor
pillow moving on up to the bed this is a
hundred percent my favorite part of my
entire room um my bed little story time
I bought it from one of my roommates I
was really really sad because it was not
comfortable at all and I was like well
what am I supposed to do now I mean like
can't do anything with this bed but then
I got a mattress topper mine's a
sleepyhead I actually mentioned this
like a really long time ago but I didn't
realize how important or like
life-changing this could be until I legs
got one so highly recommend if you have
an uncomfortable mattress to just get a
mattress topper is your finger are you
later
that's good question really I'm coming
at my life changes
anyways another really life-changing
thing no actually I haven't been liking
this as much because I've been having
back problems cuz I'm a grandma now I
hurt my back and I realized this makes
you slouch a lot but before that I used
to love this thing because it actually
like kind of helps me do work in bed
better which isn't always good but
sometimes it just happens and just like
it's very comfortable for like watching
TV and stuff like that but probably not
for the best habits um but this throw
blanket from society6 is amazing like
just look at that this is probably their
throw blankets are probably my favorite
thing just because I live for a comfy
throw blankets like people actually get
mad at me about how many I have but I'm
use them all so would highly recommend
moving on to my little vanity area this
is actually a desk but I use it as my
vanity because it's a very small desk I
don't know how you would do work on it
um in this drawer I just have like a
bunch of like miscellaneous like kind of
organizational like whenever things and
then in this drawer I have all of my
makeup which is very convenient so it
doesn't take up like a ton of space on
my desk vanity and then I have my
everyday makeup right here a mirror
I always get questions on like where I
got this I think it was Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond but I'm not sure so I'm sorry
probably wasn't up we got some society6
mug like how cute is this is called like
the blob or whatever just no and then I
also have this phone case they actually
made a little collection so if you want
to click the link below like you can see
like my whole collection of things that
I recently got for like the spring I
also have like my books I hae haven't
read these two I was in the middle of
this I've been reading this this entire
semester like I read it probably every
like week at least but it's just like oh
right I forgot I was reading this does
that happen to you know all the time and
then here's another thing that I copied
from Zoey this is a styrofoam shelf and
it is so handy and convenient especially
if you live in dorms or you don't wanna
poke holes in your walls it was super
easy to
up and it's actually pretty sturdy it
just kind of houses all of my remote
controllers and it keeps it very
organized and also I guess we
established probably me and Zoey when I
was living with her that I made a super
light sleeper and so any type of like
flashing lights or like noises wake me
up so ear plugs life-changing actually
life-changing that's the only word to
describe them like if you are a light
sleeper and then I also have melatonin
sometimes I also reach for that a lot of
fun next up is the desk area so first of
all I think this piece is like
absolutely beautiful I just feel like
it's so white and like fresh and it's on
a white wall and this room gets really
really good natural lighting so it kind
of just looks very clean and elegant do
you feel that way I do it looks clean oh
thank you
so I really I'm just looking above with
this but moving on to my desk area a lot
of people have been asking me about
this'll monitor stand as well as this
laptop stand because I showed it in some
vlogs and I was like I'm trying to be
organ homage so I got a standing desk a
laptop okay that was that's actually
really extreme like I got a lot of stuff
to be economic and it does help like
you're not supposed to be looking
downwards at your laptop but out of the
- I would just recommend into getting
this especially like if you don't have a
monitor but I got both of these things
from Amazon and I just love working on
my desk it's like very spacious very
nice here's my closet
not too much interesting in here just
like I guess these little compartments
are helpful having like a little what
are those called
Shelby Shelby organizer organizers are
helpful there are so many organizers on
the organizers well something that is
really handy are these lamps apparently
you can get them at Target right yeah
Target I think they're really nice
especially if you can like
bad and you have a dorm because you can
like plug in your phone and plug in
other stuff and then also turn on the
light moving onwards we have this little
storage unit these drawers from Ikea I
finally got a printer in my room
not as life-changing but still very
handy 3.5 so recently I actually am
taking this creativity workshop class
and I've been reading a ton like one of
our assignments is to start doing
morning pages by Julia Cameron she would
be so proud of your she saw this and
it's basically where you write out like
three pages during your mornings before
you like do anything and make decisions
and it's must be really therapeutic so
after that and after just taking this
class I started in valuing and just
seeing creativity in such a different
way so I've been writing a lot and I
like these I write in this one right
here we're not showing you those and I
just got these two I like these ones
though because they're kind of sassy and
I feel like the sassiness is just kind
of like you can't really I had a laptop
that was kind of like sassy and I just
felt like so weird bringing about every
day like this is meant for home okay and
then it's graduation season so some of
my family members have been sending me
like graduation check shoutout to you
fam you can send more I only got one you
know so these are actually from society6
as well I just thought they're really
pretty but yeah we have my bathroom and
again I have another like hook thing
full of like hats and purses which is a
huge space saver and then alright so the
next place is by bathroom first of all
we have this little door anything again
really handy but that's more handy
things in here I also stole this from
this idea from Zoe like a heated twelve
holder but you actually can't put them
in bother you did you have to wait till
they cool down but it's holding my brush
my hair dryer my straightener
and it's really really nice because
there's not a lot of counter space here
I mean it's doable but every single time
I use it I have to put it back so I'm
lazy so this makes it really really
accessible and it's awesome just like so
convenient and it like keeps the cords
out of the way so it's like real good
good stuff and then over here we have
all of like my go-to facial like things
and so my hairbrush toothbrush different
things I find nothing to be more
embarrassing than if like a guest comes
over and my bathroom is dirty so my
bathrooms like always clean more or less
because I just genuinely don't think
there's anything like I get mortified I
don't know why it's like yeah they're
all my cleaning supplies lots of plating
supplies actually it's a lot of them
yeah I keep kind of like my deep
conditioners here and also more see what
next I'm Lauren also more cleaning
supplies that's obviously a really nice
for a good storage space that's it for
my bathroom
Oh
hair towel and then beach towels ooh
camera how many tells you have six I
love all it sells they also have a
purpose alright guys that is the end of
my room tour I hope you guys enjoyed it
