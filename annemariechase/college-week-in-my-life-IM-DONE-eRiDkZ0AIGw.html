both a giant thing of butter for
scrambled eggs we went to yoga school I
honestly did not think I was gonna work
out some reason I really wanted to work
out at 6:30 but I was just gonna like
lay in my nastiness all day so and now
we're making breakfast - the only shot
you're good as a shot you never regret
working out yeah the only workout you
ever regret is the one you did you come
still applies for shot not true today
now you're happy when I'm happy to win
that I was hot cake whoa that's right
tonight I don't know I feel like I
regret going in the moment but then I'm
like I'm glad I want at least I did
something
yeah
it is a cloudy day what is that what's
that noise me it's just good morning
guys happy Monday it's like around 1:00
I did so much work yesterday have a lot
of stuff to do like I have a mid-term
tomorrow and just a lot of random stuff
like a quiz today and I wanted to catch
up on my vlog since I've so close to
being all caught up it's really really
really nice when I'm all cut up because
then I can like post a vlog and then
start a new one but right now it's like
I'm starting a new one where I haven't
posted my last but it just takes like a
little bit of editing every day and just
getting into that routine I'm just like
doing something every day has been a
change for me I'm just using my time a
lot differently now and it's been
changing like pretty much my life
yesterday I was actually super
productive I stayed home and did a lot
of work but I stayed up until like 4:00
because I was just being so productive
and I have a mid-term tomorrow so I'm
gonna be studying for that and that's
pretty much the overview of my week but
can I say my vlog from last week I asked
you guys like how long I should be
posting my vlogs for actually those two
weeks ago see this is like why I need to
catch up on my blogs so many people
responded and commented saying like what
they prefer and I was kind of just blown
away that shows me that so many of you
guys are ghost viewers I think someone
else use this term which is just like
you watch videos or you regularly watch
my videos but you don't interact with
them or like comment on them and I am
totally that type of viewer to like I
rarely ever comment on videos unless it
like really speaks to me with that I
just encourage you guys to like comment
more whenever I go to a video that I'm
watching I always go straight to the
comments like while I'm listening to the
video I think it's just a lot more fun
to see comments and just see like the
different viewpoints or just what people
point out or notice so if you guys are
silent viewers or ghost viewers
definitely just like leave a comment
every now and then and give this video a
thumbs up
because that really helps me in terms of
like getting my videos out in the
YouTube world I'm just talking way too
much already YouTube right now if you
guys have not noticed is really messing
up for their creators like they're
cutting a lot of like revenues and for
some reason they always flack my videos
so if you guys want to help my channel
out if you guys like this content it's
free it's always gonna be available to
help me out definitely give it a thumb
up or just leave a comment because I
love reading comments like that's the
reason why I make these videos is for
the interaction with you guys so why are
those long intro I'm gonna go to class
now and I will talk to you guys
afterwards it's like five now I got back
and ate some food and then I realized
like I was like oh I'm like doing my
thing and I was like oh I think we have
our personal philosophy do for this
class which should not take more than an
hour one speaker delayed you he like
cancelled last minute so all of our
deadlines got mixed up but it just
really threw me off because we have an
assignment do that I definitely did not
know was due tonight I'll definitely
have enough time for it but I just I'm
so confused cuz usually I'm like at
least pretty on top of like due dates
and I was just like I had no idea that
this time I was due so that'll probably
mess with my study time for my midterm
tomorrow but the class that I've a
midterm tomorrow and I am taking
currently pass/fail cuz I'm enrolled in
20 units this semester which is like
five different classes I think five or
six and it's like a lot of just due
dates to keep track of and I have the
option to switch it back for a grade if
I do well on this midterm but I don't
know I'm like real confused right now
so that'll suck cuz then I have to do
that before studying for my midterm and
hopefully it won't take that long
but I don't know with these two unit
classes there aren't that many
assignments due so I want to do like
well on them so I'd rather do well on
that if I am taking my marketing class
pass/fail it's just like grades are just
like a strategy that you have to come
just play with in situations like these
where I feel like I have a lot of work
to do before like a certain time I think
in the past I used to just kind of skip
my classes I never do that anymore
because I feel like it's always more
beneficial to go to class because stuff
like that he talks about stuff like this
where
he like changes the schedule around
where I wouldn't know that if I just
didn't go to class but I guess that's
not really helping me right now but yeah
I think it's a hundred percent always
better to just go to class anyways
it's literally so cold outside I'm
rushing home Oh
what is the temperature 51 I'm like 90%
done with my assignment but I'm going
home to finish it because I need to pee
and I don't want to use those I don't
have to hello it is now 12 10 ish and
I'm at my home I'm gonna study my mark
for my marketing midterm for like
probably a few hours I have class at 10
this classes at 12 so I'll have to study
up until I won't have time to study
tomorrow is what I'm saying so I'm
probably not studying for like two or
three hours that's the plan goodnight
good morning everyone happy Tuesday it
was pretty funny
this morning I was like trying to wake
up early I was exhausted tried waking up
at like 7:00 just did not happen and I
took my midterm I finished the fastest
I've ever finished a test it is so much
different not caring about a test
because this is my pass/fail class so
like I definitely passed it but I think
I did like pretty well but it's
literally so much easier to take a test
not carrying because then you just don't
like second-guess yourself so I'd be
really curious to see how I did now I'm
in my room zoey is actually taking a
shower in my shower she asked me to take
a shower this weekend and then today
again sir showers been broken for that
long so don't be like Zoey hello
everyone we are done with our midterms
so we're celebrating by going to get
some food
don't know where yet but I do favori
spot we can't literally accosted in it
yeah I don't like that possum place
though I keep my glasses
Alexander Lee yeah I use like watches
videos what I was thinking about
community
when they're called everything on campus
and a limo hole where the line
we're looking for Mango diet coke they
don't have it
we are sitting out in the Sun I never
brought my music out here yet
game changing we've been watching the
mini parallel park right in front of us
should we like she's got it but it took
her she well I like never I was like oh
it should be embarrassing to parallel
park like prepubescent boy just briefly
looking at this you can't really see it
just always outline kids like a single
piece of hair it's so beautiful but I
was like okay that's not really me now
but it's like funny it's not me that's
like a bully gonna say like is it bad
that I come out here every day I mean
like I all like if I don't have to be
working that way yeah well sometimes I
bring my work out here but I just can't
like my work I can't dude
yeah well for me I have read out here
and then I also will time out here
sometime eating is kind of great
actually
I can't edit out here though the worst
yeah it's difficult but not that bad
because like you just wear sunglasses
the phenomenon that is sunglasses I
didn't really have good sunglasses
before so what actually like so and I've
happened that couple times I was like oh
my god yeah it's like you're I like ice
you get headaches when I walked outside

much
same-same and then that also like
creates Pringles and stuff real quickly

wearing I'm doing a giveaway with a

texted me that she wants to hang out and
she's coming back so I gotta find those
candles 22 doing 2 &amp;amp; 2
yeah I made this look absolutely
horrible
you're 22 right that's what I thought
hello guys good morning it is Thursday
yesterday I didn't vlog at all I started
my morning off by going to workout and I
somehow hurt my lower back during the
workout which is not something that has
ever happened to me before latter I feel
like I've heard my body but it's always
just been a bruise or like a little
sprain on my ankles I've never really
hurt anything else so it was really
scary and my exercises I try to have
really really really really good form
first of all because I'm like a
perfectionist and also so that I don't
hurt my body and I don't know what I did
yesterday and core power to that was
different but I injured my lower back I
didn't really feel it at the time I kind
of felt like a little pressure there but
I ended up leaving early just cuz I was
not feeling well then I felt it
afterwards I like took a little shower
and then when I was like walking to
class and in class I like felt a lot of
pain in there to the point where like I
literally feel if I just let lean
forward a little bit or lean backwards
just like not having a great day
yesterday so and I'm gonna like add to
that by just like vlogging and it wasn't
in a bad mood and there were some really
good parts about yesterday that I
totally could have logged that I forgot
but I just think I decided that I just
wasn't gonna vlog so I was like a lot of
stuff going on so today I'm super
excited because tonight I'm meeting back
up with Christy and Ming who are my
entrepreneurship like group members so
we're all going to go to get Mexican
food tonight we're gonna get margaritas
it's gonna be so much fun I'm so excited
and then I can't exercise because I
think I'm just gonna take a break from
exercising which sucks because I feel
like I'm making like a lot of progress
with my workouts right now and I'm just
gonna put that on hold cuz like the
other workout that I would want to do is
like going in the gym and like lifting
weights which is like directly impacting
your lower back so that's my update
right now not the best but it's okay
like I'm gonna blog today I think it'll
be fun and I'm sitting outside which I'm
super excited about so yes I'm gonna go
make some coffee
next your name it's gonna connect by
grunting captain God graduates for
taking this yearbook photo cuz
apparently this is the last day and
literally for Christie because she's
fighting a yearbook

the way I was trying to tell her to do

really good time now it's Friday but
it's a long weekends I need to do a lot
of work and today is like probably the
best day that I have to do it I want to
go sit outside for a little while maybe
like 20 minutes get some Sun and then
just do like some writing it's like such
a beautiful day outside I woke up in a
really good mood so I think it's gonna
be a good day and my back feels a little
bit better so but I don't think I'm
gonna exercise this weekend oh my god
that's gonna be my bag that's what I'm
scared about I made pizza rolls
Elliott's here and I put two forks on
the plate and he was like why did you
put forks on the plate didn't you
literally do this last time I made ramen
you just put it right in your mouth and
you don't realize how hard it is oh
that's why you don't eat pizza rolls
with a fork if it's too hot I literally
just took it out of the toaster oven
yeah wait you just wait for it to cool
down see you don't even use it for show
how to put back beautiful
that's Friday we're not really planning
on doing anything I don't really think
so we're gonna go get food after well we
planned that after I put this in the
toaster oven I can't I can't go out we
do there and off my back
yeah but you do I've been into a pizza
roll that was too hot this just all
came out that's my using napkins
