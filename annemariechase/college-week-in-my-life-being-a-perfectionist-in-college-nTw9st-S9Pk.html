really crazy really hectic I have two
midterms I don't even know what else

everyone's like trying to get everything
finished before the break and then this
week my parents and then my sister come
in to visit it's my dad's birthday on
Friday like we're getting our hair done
it's gonna be a good time today I
literally went to sleep at like 5:00 I
was studying last night didn't go to the
library because my back has been hurting
I don't know I just can't sit for long
periods of time so I was doing that last
night and then I went to get my car
because I had a dentist appointment at
8:30 today for a dental cleaning
I just ate so like I don't have my
retainers on but upon finding my car I
found a note on my car that said hi I
may accidentally hit your car when I
move out so it was nice of this person
to leave a note so I have to call him
but this is about a week ago I think it
was right when I parked my car in the
garage because last time I used it I
think was last weekend sometime oh yeah
poor Cara Wow
so just a lot of the stuff going on but
now it is 10:30 I have class at 2:00 and
I have a midterm in that class it's
worth 25% of my grade so I'm hoping to
do all in it it's kind of an
unstructured midterm like she kind of
just was like we're having a midterm
this is gonna be on it and then she
started lecturing like a few classes ago
so I've just been rewatching those
lectures and I'm like I don't really
know how this is gonna go so that's
never good that's pretty much my update
catching you guys all up until today I'm
so excited for this week like I am today
is gonna be like the sunniest day and
the nicest day that it has been in like
two weeks so while I'm studying at home
I'm going to sit outside it's 11:30 now
and I'm sitting on our porch it's so
nice this is literally my paradise
I have not sat out here for like two
weeks because it's been freezing cold
I'm going to try to study out here my
ear pods connect I was outside for like
an hour and it was really hot I'm like
not stressing about my midterm which is
always nice I'm just gonna like keep
reviewing my notes and then me and Tasha
are gonna take pictures afterwards
Oh God chapstick my lipstick no so are
mine oh I don't I had don't have my bag
with me okay
just got out of my class I went Tasha
we're taking pictures for our thumbnails
I just took my midterm I think I ate it
which is like very fortunate because I
didn't say that much yeah I'm done yeah
let's do it
oh this lighting is so good okay wow
that's amazing
so cool oh I can feel the Sun wow that's
so pretty
the lighting is so good actually it's
pretty bad actually probably come from
Tokyo Japan and I'm here just here I
tell you tell how you learned English I
actually learned English from that
watching Netflix like shows like a
friends the office two years ago like
three years ago dang that's so
impressive love America I love USC thank
you are you gonna are you like a
perspective student are you thinking
about coming here like probably not okay
the guy was like a super interesting guy
he was asking like such great questions
like at the end of our conversation he
was like what is your goal for YouTube
and then he also said like he learned or
he got into u.s. culture through like
American youtuber yeah and I was like
that's so cool like that's why people do
she always does that like who would
think that this girl and then he guessed
our ethnicities right actually I told
him mine but I was like guess what she
is yeah and he gets to tell you that guy
was so cool I loved meeting him dinner
before my next class
sick of us being healthy I'm gonna eat a
Cheney hey guys you're on Explorer
during Explorer ok and
how do you guys like it here wait how
long have you been here for is this like
a que God Trader Joe's haul a lot of
people recommended stuff but we went too
fast so like I don't know I got one
thing so someone recommended this this
is what I like I like this eggplant
hummus pepper basil peas eggs petabytes
yep that's it oh we met some more
subscribers at Trader Joe's they were so
cute they're prospective students thanks
for saying hi Natasha
come on guys it is Tuesday it's like 935
I went to sleep at like 11 p.m.
yesterday and I just woke up and I don't
have enough time to like make breakfast
and stuff but luckily on Tuesdays I only
have two classes and I'm actually
thinking about not going to my marketing
class just because I could film today a
video and I haven't filmed in a really
long time I'm taking this class
pass/fail and I think I'm overachieving
in it it's really hard to take a class
pass/fail like at USC I'm like do an
okay job like I probably have like an a
right now okay so I just got done with
my first class I did indeed decide to
skip my second I kind of wanted to like
talk about that more because like on my
channel I have like a lot of followers
who are like younger than me and I never
want to like promote like skipping
classes or anything so I was talking to
my friend and class are actually after
class we were walking back about this
especially being someone like I'm I'm
taking 20 units which is like two over
the amount that you're like supposed to
take like I'm very much a full-time
student I'm like doing my youtube thing
I'm looking for jobs and so it's about
like maintaining a balance between all
those things and I've realized that I'm
so much happier when I approach my
classes this way and I actually do so
much better where I'm just like I don't
need to take everything so seriously and
learn every single thing there is to
learn about everything because it just
like it doesn't make sense and it
doesn't work out the way that you want
it to like I was thinking about this a
lot my freshman year compared to this
year my freshman year I was taking 18
units and I just wasn't doing that well
in classes because I was such a
perfectionist about how I studied I was
like I need to study every single little
thing like I need to make sure I'm doing
everything so not only like did I
probably focus on the wrong things like
I didn't have time to study for
everything that I wanted to and then
like over the years I've just learned to
like readjust my studying habits and
just not care as much because after a
while if you're like I didn't get
horrible grades I got like one horrible
grade but like I do well like otherwise
I'm a good student I'm like do fine but
at least for me I was so consumed about
like doing well and only my classes and
not really having like
anything else outside of that like
that's all I wanted to do is like do all
my classes and it's just like as soon as
I stopped like prioritizing that I
started doing much better and I mean it
could be because like I'm taking classes
my upper division electives and it's
classes I just naturally enjoy more and
like they're not required classes but I
don't know just not being a
perfectionist and not taking things too
seriously has really just like shifted
everything in a much better way so like
even if I fail or like do badly I don't
take it like that seriously because I
know that I have other things in my life
going on and so it's like not
detrimental I don't know why I'm like
talking about I should like I always try
to fit these like little topics into
these little weekly vlogs and these
weekly vlogs are not that I shouldn't
because they're too long so I don't know
I just thought that was interesting it
is now five I've showered my hair is in
a bun me and Zoey
oh my look at this lighting crazy it's
so nice having someone that you can
study with like who's like pretty much
has the same study habits as you I
usually don't like studying with people
at all because I get like I don't know
other people distract me and I don't
like having to talk to someone if I
don't want to so we're going to head
over to get some kava and then I think
I'm gonna go get some snacks from Target
and maybe some like caffeinated drinks
my lips are really chapped cuz I think
today it's gonna be a long night and I
might kind of tired just got off the
phone with the guy who hit my car he was
like first of all I just want to
apologize so much for hitting your car
I'm a very bad driver I have no idea how
it happened I was backing out and then I
hit it and I just feel like I went crazy
like I have no idea how it happened and
I like I was like oh it's okay like I'm
just really thankful that you reached
out like that was really nice of you he
was so apologetic though he was like I'm
so sorry for adding more bumps in
density or God was like it's okay
it is now 918 we've been here for two
hours I'm hungry again so I'm eating my
snacks it's always right there I had
like three different
damn I've been reading this whole time
and I've only gotten 20 pages down but I
downloaded it look the eBook version so
I could do like the follow along where I
listen and then read my teeth look
straighter
I'm vlogging for my bathroom today
because well first of all happy
Wednesday I usually tell you guys what
date is when I belong have some
organization in structure to these vlogs
it's 10:16 I'm vlogging for my bathroom
right now because one of my roommates
has a guy over and you guys could hear
him if I went to my room and blogged I
also would feel weird if you could hear
me so that's why I'm in the bathroom but
I have a mid-term tomorrow
it's 10:30 or 10:20 this is the only
thing that's keeping me from tomorrow
and then tomorrow my sister's coming in
my mom's coming and then my dad's coming
later so I'm so excited and then my
class is gonna be done it's gonna be
spring break for me
it's not happy but I have this at 10:00
in the morning so that's what I'm gonna
be doing I don't think it should be hard
but I just need to study for it it's
currently 11:00 I just put my bed
together I just washed my sheets it took
me like trauma 30 minutes honestly and I
can already tell this is gonna be a
rough night because I'm getting tired
already
guys it is 1151 now I'm like doing okay
studying but I just got an email but at
5 o'clock today he says hi all just a
note to say that the first quiz is now
available on blackboard
can we take in multiple times prior to
class tomorrow
it will also occur in class the same 30
items which is really confusing and then
he just emailed us again today and said
hi our class March 8th which is tomorrow
is optional I see that many have already
taken the quiz and are likely happy with
the outcome for those who want to take
the class in quiz tomorrow or have
questions about it I'll be in the
classroom wah wah so I think I can
literally take this quiz right now
multiple times and I'm genuinely so
confused because I thought I'd be it I
was like I'm gonna have to be up all
night studying for this and I also was
like scared bottom
pretty sure I can take it right now it
is 1250 I just finished my quiz he'd let
us take as many attempts as we needed so
I got 100 but it took me an embarrassing
amount of times to get 100 at my first
attempts at 80 I think I'm just too
tired that I'm like kind of dumb right
now like I can't think correctly so I
must have missed something but I'm like
concerned about how tired I am so I'm
gonna go to sleep soon probably and I
have like a take-home aspect of it which
I'll probably get up tomorrow to do an
hour class tomorrow is optional so but
that was crazy I would have failed that
if it was midterm that I had to take
without just doing it like basically
with as many tries as I wanted so that's
good to know I should probably study
more for this class great come on I'm
excited for tomorrow that made it so
much better oh my gosh okay guys it is 5
o'clock 5:30 I'm going to drive to LAX
to pick up my sister and then my mom
their flights land in like an hour
I'm gonna be sitting in this car for the
next 3 hours but it's okay I'm being so
hospitable ok goodbye everything for the
next 3 hours while I just drive this car
everywhere I love LA traffic
we wanted doughnuts so we got done it
before I end this vlog I wanted to
include this little tidbit of
information that may or may not be
relevant to your life it's 3:00 in the
morning and I got my nice length on
these look like poop on camera and I
always try to show you guys and it never
looks good but actually this okay so I
was sent these and this but I did work
at Neutrogena this is not related at all
I was just sent these like separately
through this company but I wanted to
tell you guys about this little
promotion before it ends so Rite Aid is
having a promotion where you buy one get
one 50% off you might have seen this in
my story but if you don't follow me then
you wouldn't I actually got this from
working like I've bought it um this is a
really really really good line at the
hydraboost line everyone who works there
is like obsessed with it it's like a
favorite line I like I'm almost
people love it you can see my like hand
motions it is like a little bit more
expensive it's like more of a premium
product I think then the other
Neutrogena products so this is a really
good time to buy them if you're
interested especially like the hydro
boost water gels these are really
popular and then they just came out with
like a mask and I'm excited to try these
because they're actually good colors and
I'm very excited to try this especially
since I needed any waterproof mascara I
was waterproof I just met mascara but I
think I read waterproof so that's what I
wanted to tell you it's available at
Rite Aid until the 31st so definitely
get it if you have been wanting to try
these products okay thank you for
watching this blog bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
