around 10 o'clock and it's actually MLK
Day so we don't have any class but I
still have a ton of work to do today is
actually the last day for an application
that I've been working on and it's a
pretty lengthy application process you
need two letters of recommendation two
essays per place that you're applying to
I've been working on it for a little
while now probably like for real for a
week and then I got my letters of
recommendation like a little while ago
I've done enough work where I can
definitely finish today but I've only
done enough where I knew that I would
have the time pressure to work today so
I cleared my schedule for today and I
will be writing yesterday I stayed in
and I just kind of want like a change of
scenery so I think I'm gonna go to like
Starbucks because our libraries are
closed until 12:00 and I also have to
pick up like text books and stuff from
the Amazon locker should be a really
really really really productive day
because all of my deadline days usually
are so I'm on campus now this is the
current set up until the library opens
in an hour I'm a little worried though
because I kinda feel like I have to pee
and it's a full hour
so maybe I shouldn't drink my Starbucks
but it's so nice and relaxing and it's
like the perfect temperature outside
especially like since I'm sitting in the
shade pretty it's very very quiet on
campus but Starbucks is packed it's now
12:00 12:00 and now I'm pretty cold so I
think I might move I probably a little I
break I have a great set up for the next
hour I've got a giant it's like monitor
is it's huge so I'm just gonna type on
here and write the rest of my essay I
got all three of my three Amazon
packages that I was expecting I got my
textbooks the class that I'm taking this
semester are so cool so this one's for
my consumer behavior marketing class
this one is for my negotiation class
what a cool class to be taking right and
then the last thing are these nurse
Hattie professional-grade ketone test
strips because I am doing a ketogenic
diet experiment so you pee on these and
then they tell you if you're in ketosis
I will be starting the video or this
this week okay guys it is 7:30 8:00 and
I want to go yoga at 8:00 because I ate
so badly yesterday and I just really
want a good workout and so I'm
submitting my application it's not due
for another I guess one hour but I'm
literally going to submit this I'm just
going over it one more time oh my gosh
it's making me redo everything cover
letter
whoa okay so it's 847 42 now I'm going
to hurry to change and go work oh I'm so
excited I get to work out I did not
think I was gonna be able to for a
little watch me never get contacted by
them again I'm back just got back from
yoga sculpts there were very few people
there maybe because it's a holiday it's
like 9:00 9:30
I think about like
good morning it is Tuesday it's 9:30 for
I need to leave here in six minutes I
just got out of bed and kind of woke up
yesterday I had so many plans to sleep
and just do some work but I had already
done a lot of work and I finished like
what I needed to do and so I just hung
out with Elliot and Zoe and I ate like
 so I'm excited to be starting my
diet because that was I didn't eat that
badly but like it was pretty gross okay
so I'm gonna go to class now
I finished class at 2:00 I had two
back-to-back classes I had negotiation
and marketing right now I'm getting
ready to cuz I didn't put makeup on you
to go to my classes I'm getting ready to
go meet with someone that my
entrepreneurship professor set me up to
meet with like this guy wants to meet me
because of my youtube and it's actually
very interesting because I've talked
about I'm gonna go get my concealer so I
can actually get ready so it's
interesting because every time someone
learns that I have a YouTube channel
he's like a professional or has their
own career or is like an entrepreneur
that I've met through this professor
they always come up to me afterwards in
some way and they're like here take my
card reach out to me am i running out of
space and like one time I was after our
pitches that I did with like my group
and he asked our whole group to come
after like and talk to him and then he
ended up just giving me his card and he
was a reach out to me they're not
offering me anything they're not telling
me that I did a good job they're just
like reach out to me to help me with my
business who'd think that if they
actually wanted my help they would get
my email so like I don't have to do the
work of emailing them or they would
offer something to me so that this is
like a mutually beneficial like
relationship but no every single person
it just all asked me to do them favors
and I'm just super curious what this
meeting is gonna be about like I never
approached anyone and I don't care like
that I'm younger and I'm a student it's
still taking the time out of my day it
has to like I have to do extra work
where I could use that time to do so
many other things even work on my
YouTube which I don't have time
or so that's what I'm getting ready for
and that sounded like really hostile but
I'm excited to meet this guy he seems
like he has a really cool business I
have no idea what to expect but that's
what I'm getting ready for so like 10
minutes so I'm basically just gonna go
to my eyebrow place to get my eyebrows
done you guys always ask me where I get
it done
Rufus brow lounge they do such a good
job but it's only like I like I don't
know I don't remember how much it is but
it's luck it's like 1012 dollars
here's what my eyebrows look like
they're a little irritated my skin is
really sensitive it's like 6:30 know I
was gonna rush to go to yoga sculpt but
I think I'm either just gonna go to the
eight o'clock one or I don't know I'll
probably get a clock one
I have an assignment where I have to do
writing every day actually I don't even
know if that was the assignment it was
in our reading that that was like really
important I just wanted to start it's
like a creativity class it seems really
cool Kathryn took it and she suggested
it so I'm taking it and I always want to
sit outside to do my work but I never do
so I took the leap and I'm sitting
outside cuz I live in California and
it's so nice outside most of the time
and I just never really like appreciate
it so that's what I'm doing right now
super relaxing it's really quiet out
I don't have class until 12 so that's
what I'm gonna be doing my morning hello
everyone this is Christy again we're
walking literally just through this oh
it's so pretty
we just got done this class and I had a
lot of class with Christy last year was
it even more than one last her last
semester yeah and so I didn't have any
classes her in my schedule so but she
met I dropped my class and joined her
hit but now we're going to try to joke
we're really hungry
we just finished class sling yeah okay
bye follow her on Instagram
cardio but you don't have to do the
weights
how's life actually I don't
I made the transition to Facebook yeah
that's right that you guys got to be on
Facebook okay nice a new mark in we're
going to sonlife is it called cafe
organics no I haven't tried it cuz it's
really expensive and I haven't wanted to
try it cuz like that I might like it and
want to get it a lot
well it's closed you had a you had a
vision
it's nine-thirty I just woke up and I
have to leave my house pretty much at
9:40 to be on time for class and I have
six hours of class back-to-back so I'm
gonna have to figure out food somewhere
in between then so it was gonna be a
really fun day no I'm gonna get ready
I'm literally so tired still for some
reason I got eight hours of sleep but it
feels like I just took a melatonin to go
to sleep it's super weird but I think
I'll be on time maybe like a minute late
but I have my juice my coffee my water
and then a bar so I forgot my wallet
hello it is probably 4:30 I got done
with classes I hung out wish well not
really we just walked back together but
I waited with him for a while I'm in bed
watching friends and I'm really tired
and I was supposed to go to dinner but
now I'm not so I don't know I don't know
I should I'm still tired as I was six
hours ago
we'll see if I do anything else today
luckily I don't have any more class for
the week that we went by so fast wow
that's insane probably because it was
MLK week I think I might nap it is now
7:50 I took a nap or I fell asleep while
I was watching TV it's like my life song
and everything so you know it's like an
intense nap because I hate like wasting
electricity like that I feel like a
truck hit me I my body is like mmm
just not doing well probably due to some
feminine issues but yeah I do not feel
great and I feel like I should be doing
something like social like I should be
hanging out with people or like talking
to people but I think I'm just gonna try
to edit my video because I think that
would make me feel very accomplished and
happy to do so I'm probably gonna do
that
and maybe drink some wine or something
cuz I'm just not feeling great I'm also
gonna start thinking of some good video
ideas to do I want to do like more
school related videos while I'm still in
school or like senior advice type videos
like giving my advices and upperclassmen
to like people below me or like younger
than me so if you have any requests that
you've had for a really long time
definitely leave them in the comments
below because this is where I'll check
if you guys have like requests and stuff
to decide my next videos but I already
have some like ideas in mind I just need
to like actually write them out now that
I have like that harm to do it I feel
like it's very odd I feel like it's like
a Saturday night and I'm like not and I
haven't done anything for like weeks but
it's just Thursday what are you drinking
kombucha and apple cider
poteete keys in it for drinks Cheers
drink more mate that was not a sip
I fully taste it it's like not the worst
thing I've ever drank yeah it's supposed
to be but the vinegar supposed to be
really like cleansing or whenever ever I
don't really know good for you right
you might vlog I have no content Julie
hammock flurries I don't I think that's
our best bet let's do it let's do it
okay we're ordering a hot fudge sundae
from McDonald's this is quality content
right here I feel like it's like Friday
or Saturday but it's Thursday yeah I
feel like everyone's doing something
yeah that's literally what I said that's
yeah that's what I said I don't know why
do you think it's like what what's
happening I was like I feel like I
haven't talked to Tosh that like a week
because I have it I have it it's all the
way at the bottom sweets in tree
so I'm just sitting here I'm reading the
single morning pages and he comes up and
he's like I watch your videos say you
know I'm lemarcus I'm a my first year
doctoral student in music my gosh and
she's hilarious and I love that video I
was like what I was doing it's like find
some summer housing because I have to
take six hours of summer and I was like
oh I gotta go back I gave money on the
bank and then who do I see on the port
like an episode of the baby-sitters club
bye guys oh and if Katherine out hi
Katherine I I love you too yay I'm
writing my morning pages as I have been
doing for the last just wasn't other day
so I'm staying outside and this guy at
demarcus just like looks at me and he's
like oh my gosh I watch your videos and
he was like so sweet he's like can I
enter your porch and I was like yeah of
course and he literally just made my
entire boarding and he was so cute and
so nice and I know so smart and he gave
me some recommendations on like PR
agencies I should look at for jobs but
thank you so much for coming to say hi
to be literally making my morning he was
so sweet literally the nicest encounter
I've had with like somebody who watches
my videos so yeah thanks for saying hi
that literally made my day
the only problem is sitting out here is
everyone parks in the wrong spot and now
I feel like I need to tell a but they
can't park there
I'm gonna go tell them literally across
the street though
the people I told that they couldn't
park there else they might get a ticket
where a bunch of Koreans so I feel like
I help my people out
a little update the parking people are
now giving a ticket to someone who
parked literally where I told the other
people not to so they both would have
gotten a ticket if I had seen the person
who parked there after I would have said
something but I didn't see them a park
there so the person who ended up parking
there unfortunately is getting a ticket
there are 98 dollars - because I got one
and so that's why I know and they come
around super often and it's really
really really ambiguous it's really hard
to tell but that sucks but I saved those
Korean people like almost $200 so you're
welcome I had a very enjoyable writing
session outside oh I was gonna time
myself my professor told us that just
took her 20 minutes and I was like oh my
hands hurt and stuff I am now going to
just make my oh my god it scared the
crap out of me oh my god I can't go tell
that person that he can't park there -
cuz he's our neighbor I hate like
watching out here it's actually criminal
how they like ticket these people cuz
it's so ambiguous and people always Park
there like all the time so everyone else
thinks it's okay because they're like oh
this person parked there okay I'm just
gonna look like a creeper
I left you guys on it was actually nice
cuz I think the guy recognized me as his
neighbor well I did walk out of the
house so he just waved because he saw
that I was trying to talk to him but
just like walking out to wave to him but
yeah so today I'm just planning on
catching up on some work I feel like I
always say this but I need to edit a
vlog I need to write some emails and
then a cleaner is coming to clean our
house because our floors are disgusting
we just thought it'd be nice for the
beer to have like just a really clean
house or everyone especially since pooja
just moved in and like none of this mess
is really hers I mean it's not terrible
but like oh my god another person is
parking there okay honestly at this
point I will waste my time just looking
so I'm just not gonna look I feel really
bad I really wish I could just like
spray-paint the curb and be like you
cannot Park here cuz it's not red so
that's why it's also very ambiguous well
this person looks like a girl though I
was like I had like a little
speakerphone I just finished eating and
I'm reading my book I don't know if I've
told you guys about this book it's quiet
by Susan Cain one of my Twitter
followers recommended it I think her
name's Jen clearly she like knows my
personality exactly to know that I would
love this book probably no food no mouth
I was telling her she other day I was
like I think that learning the
definition and like the characteristics
of introvert is the most important word
that I've learned because instead of
being like oh like I'm kind of weird
because I like isolating or I don't
really like going out as much or just
like whatever
introverted qualities that I have and
like this book covers all of them pretty
much that was like really the most
important thing that I learned about
myself is that I was like introverted
and I think I mean an extroverted
introvert like I do have extroverted
qualities but I've learned them like I'm
naturally very introverted and so
reading this book in length learning
about introvert ISM just makes me feel
more like okay with who I am because
when I'm on like when I'm inside reading
the book on Friday night I'm not like
wow I'm a loser because I have no
friends I'm like oh I'm doing this
because this is how I recharge and gain
energy so to me it's not really the
labels that I'm concerned about it's
just learning why I am the way I am and
especially as an introvert like this
book talks about this too we live in a
very like pro extroverted world and if
you're an introvert it can be kind of
hard because you just don't really
understand like why you're doing things
against the norm just anything to do
that's like an introverted quality but
this book and just learning about the
personality has really helped me to
understand myself better
such cute girls good for you neighbor so
highly recommend this book if you think
you're introverted or if you have like
just questions on introvert ISM it
explains so much I'll try to link below
you guys want to check it out but yeah I
have really enjoyed this book so thank
you so much to Jen who recommended this
you guys I've been editing but we just
had a cleaner come to our house so we're
gonna check it out
smells so good we're so bougie what
we're so bougie Wow I feel like I get to
sleep on the floors
should we instill a no-shoe policy okay
by Tasha okay basically I ate a bunch of
food less than an hour ago go into yoga
school it's maybe really tough I haven't
been outside all day I'm fully preparing
to die during this class
I'm gonna get cramps but I'm happy to go
home today I have some good music
because that's just what I need right
now
there's Nurik shop okay she's unfazed
we're gonna cheddar joes I'm getting
wine but I absolutely died in there like
had to stop do not eat a ton of rice and
dumplings before you got a yoga sculpt
got the wine so it is Friday night again
and everyone's out and I'm just staying
in and I'm not doing it you think I
finally come up with a playlist that I
am obsessed with I just never put in the
effort even though I always was like
this is something that I need to do like
it was on my to-do list that I never did
and then all of a sudden I just started
like not being so picky with
categorizing the songs and I just made a
chill playlist where I was like I love
these songs when I'm just trying to like
relax which is all the time I'll link it
below
definitely follow it if you love just
like very chill music I love all the
songs so much because if I come across a
song and I just am not in love with it
anymore
I just delete it off like that's how
this playlist is but yeah I'm literally
the only one here kind of by choice I
guess but also cuz I'm a loser
and have nothing to do I'm finishing my
video that I've been meaning to put up
for a little while I'm making popcorn I
clean into the machine I have wine and
I'm looking forward to watching grease
and Frankie while I edit my vlog so
that's my night and I'm going to come up
with a grocery list for tomorrow cuz I
need to start my keto diet or I'm going
to because I've been meaning to for the
Hucky did not love this music it's just
like so like nice what was I saying
I was lucky feeling really sorry for
myself and I was fully planning on like
having a night alone I kind of look
scary right now I'm not gonna lie like
yeah but then I heard some frantic
knocking at my door and ended up being
Elia and he was like come out with us
tonight I know which is like us he's
closed bar and I really was like no
planning on it but then I was like
literally just like five seconds ago I
was like complaining about how I was
basically not doing anything and just
being like a loser
so I'm not saying that if you want to
stay in on a Friday night you're a loser
but I think I didn't want to go out so I
am a little conflicted I had 20 minutes
she already I still have five minutes
remaining so I'm gonna change to
something real basic my hair is gonna be
wet but I'm excited that was really nice
Emily it actually to just like knock
about door especially like I feel like I
had some type of telepathy because we
were not supposed to hang out today cuz
he asked me to go out last night and I
was like no I'm being hit by a truck and
my uterus
so here's my makeup for going on this is
the outfit I think Ellie it's actually
here I think I hear him coughing
good morning we're gonna have a
productive morning today it is 9 o'clock
I'm gonna clean with my headphones so I
don't get distracted and then I'm gonna
edit and then those are my morning plans
and then I'm gonna go grocery shopping
for kedo food and then I'm gonna start
my keto diet in my cute video let's do
this not so good you're doing fine look
at you go you read a marathon yesterday

like 20 missed calls yeah at least go
home though you know I got home is it
complete Wow you look so cute

take another mirror picture yeah wait so
