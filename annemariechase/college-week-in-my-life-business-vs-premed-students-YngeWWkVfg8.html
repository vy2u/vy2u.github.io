now did I start this weekly vlog already
I don't know I've been up since 9:00 I
went to sleep pretty early so I got a
lot of sleep and it felt really good cuz
I was starting to get sick or I was
starting to feel sick I think I was just
really stuffy so I'm glad I got a lot of
sleep I'm uploading my weekly vlog I'm
scheduling a dental cleaning because I
just got my bottom retainer off like to
get my Invisalign in and dr. nikkei
it'll be so happy and proud of me the
real reason why I'm doing it she's like
such a mom it's really sunny out it was
so cold last week it was too cold to sit
out so I might sit out right now cuz I
have an hour and half to spare cuz you
guys know I've been sitting outside it's
been making my life so much better and I
haven't been able to because it's been
too cold but I think it's like 65 right
now so perfect temperature
I think the Sun just went down but it is
one I have class at 2:00 I'm gonna eat
some food and then go to flat
I say that a couple of different
teachers who gave me really drugs like
exercises that I'm going to do each day
and 20 minutes a day for a few years so
much specialty
it is now 2:30 today was a good
productive actually very productive I
was surprised I have a midterm on
Wednesday but I thought I had two
midterms this week but it turns out all
my midterms are pretty much next week so
this week is actually pretty relaxed my
parents and sister are coming to visit
for my dad's birthday but he also is
like a conference and I am so excited
because after that weekend then I start
spring break and I'm going to visit my
sister for spring break
I'm excited so next week's vlog at least
like after Friday will be thrilling but
until then I'll have like a lot of
midterms and stuff
it's 9:30 now I ended up going to sleep
I don't even know probably at like 5:00
I ended up just reading some more and
then I just started editing a video and
eventually I got tired I was so tired
when I woke up like I did not think that
I'd be able to get up sometimes my
roommates are like how do you actually
wake up early cuz I often like plan to
just wake up early you literally just
need to get the first step out of bed
and then I feel I always feel like a
hundred percent better but today is
gonna be rough so after my two classes
luckily on Tuesday I've like the least
amount of class even though I'm really
dreading classes today I think I'm just
gonna nap afterwards okay guys I just
finished class bloomie and I walked over
to Zoe's actually never come to her
please yeah
but on the way and shoot us and then
from class I was listening to my
audiobook it's only because it's Tuesday
a lot of my favorite podcasters don't
come out with their podcasts until like
later in the week which is why I opt for
audiobooks deals in audio really yeah
her old roommate he's studying abroad
it's like do you sit on it a lot like a
couch yeah I like it I haven't seen it
since he rearranged yeah it's like good
spacing that's such a good deal we have
hung out every Tuesday for like the last
two weeks
guys this is the setup we got the Trader
Joe's frozen egg rolls which I provided
you got the Zoey and then we got the
pita crackers and YUM
from the farmers market like we're gonna
eat it is 4:30 now I finally transferred
myself from Zoey's bed to my bed my hair
is still literally still wet I just took
it out of a bun but it's still wet for
my shower at 5:00 in the morning to
almost like 12 hours ago were like 4:00
in the morning 12 hours ago so that's
pretty funny I'm gonna nap and then I'm
gonna probably go to the library it's
953 and I was debating going to the
library after my nap I like I feel like
I've logged this like at least once a
week I was in a really good mood like
all today and then all yesterday like
I've been a really good mood lately
just been very like I productive and
busy and that's good but today after my
nap I just woke up in like a really
annoyed mood
I'm just being like annoying and lazy
and like being it's all putting it all
on myself I was in a bad mood and then I
started watching so Ellis vlogs because
I usually watch Alfie slug so didn't
post today and I started watching her
again I used to watch her like a really
long time ago and I'm like kind of in a
better mood it's kind of weird I feel
like I'm getting like social interaction
and I think that's why people like you
too
and so I
I thought that was funny because I don't
know now it's like almost 10 and I'm
just watching this vlog like that's
pretty much all I'm doing I feel like I
don't usually do that where I'm just
like I'm not gonna do anything but watch
this vlog like I'll do it while I'm
doing something but it's like it's
pretty good time I like this the setup
hello everyone it is currently 507 p.m.
it is this the first time I'm logging
maybe I don't even know it's Wednesday
today has been such an off day for me
like it started yesterday I probably
should have just gone to the library
instead of just staying at home because
I did nothing I just ended up going to
sleep at like 11:00 and yeah I got like
a ton of sleep but I just feel like I'm
so unorganized now like everything that
I would have done like organizationally
yesterday I should have just done like I
should have gone and then stayed for
like a little while and then came back
but I didn't so I've just felt super off
all day and for some reason my back
hurts but it's like my upper back
I don't know today's just like a poopy
it's just like not going well it was
funny because Monday was super
productive Tuesday the opposite of
productive I was like feeling on top of
the world on Monday because I was doing
so much and I was like getting so much
stuff done but I kind of blame just not
being able to sleep on Monday cuz that
really threw me off but I don't know I'm
just someone who clearly needs like
eight hours of sleep a night but luckily
I only have one class left and I can
hang out with rich in it
hello did you see me no I just thought
you after literally right after your
applied get so I asked him I was like
believe me in my blog
he said I'll consider it well guess what
I just got back from my class I look
disgusting I need a shower
but I just got the best package in the
entire world wait Durex check Oh oh my
god okay
vanilla bean oatmeal cookie yeah
birthday cake chocolate oh these are all
really good flavors cookie and cream and
then chocolate chip cookie dough never
been more excited in my life
it is now literally 10:50 and I'm
walking to levy library which is our
library like 24-hour library on campus I
just need to organize my life but a much
better mood
I like hung out with Tasha we went to
Target I ate dinner and then me and
Tasha were talking for a long time and
then I hung out with my other roommate
and I'm in a much better mood so now I'm
gonna go do some work for a while
I had a Red Bull which I'm not proud of
since I don't really drink I read drinks
but I can't drink coffee but I already
brushed my teeth and I'm ready to be
here for at least like three hours and
my other roommate no rickshaws every now
so I can meet her hello I just met a few
what are you doing here oh I work here
in the world looking all majestic with
the moon you can ride your bike I'll
speed walk 155
we're walking back now she has her down
jacket on this she's good
how is your study session mine it was
surprised but also they have been here
for ages so I'm glad I got something
yeah I came pretty late it was a good
time
hello it is 11:30 anybody it may have
skipped my first class it's just like
sometimes I just sit there and I don't
do anything and it's like I wouldn't use
my time better if I was just asleep I'm
being a good influence I'm gonna stop
that I've skipped like three classes
over the last like three weeks like one
class a week and I was really gonna
habit it's it's when you start breaking
habits is when you have problems like
truly but I'm going to my next two
classes and I'm getting ready listening
to David Deborah's podcast and I'm
excited because it's Thursday basically
today is my friday and I'm gonna hang
out with my friends and do nothing
tonight I'll probably do the same
tomorrow but I have a like a lot of
midterms in the next like coming week so
after today and then probably tomorrow
night it's like getting I'm gonna I'm
gonna be a struggle in the library okay
we are on the roof of so is housing
right now we just got finished with
class so we're doing so close what's up
dude they sent me this and I was like
hey what link and I like tell our own
ticket I'm sorry could you and they
stopped replying but this stuff is
really good and they react to my teeth
go what am I supposed to do do you think
could you tell that I had them on yeah
you didn't make fun of me you make fun
of me though there's always a way to
word it
yeah no no okay
are you suck it text out when I was just
going off like the fact that
haha
intriguing right we're building Tasha's
ring light
I'll show you guys after turn off see
this quality oh I feel like is it
orangie do we need the white one yeah
let's try those on
yeah oh oh whoa yeah that one's much
better
alright that's crazy
just try through the brightest yeah do
it
hey guys happy Friday I'm like kind of
greasy and disgusting right now but I
just got back from the chiropractor I
was like going for my back that I've
been telling you guys about and I don't
know I don't really know if I made a
difference I guess I probably can't tell
right now I'm actually gonna go get all
you can eat sushi with Elliot and Zoey
I'm super excited about it I'm so hungry
a rainy day on campus I'm waiting in
Elliot's car because he went to turn in
some like receipts or something but I
think we have a passionate topic to talk
about that I'm excited to talk about if
he agrees he actually was let me
suggested it so I'm sure he will so
we'll see yeah so basically if you're
explain them yeah there's no background
sorry sorry stuff this is such a big
buildup so basically recently like I got
lunch with this girl show like you know
nothing nothing to it just like casual
um but after she just kind of stopped
talking to me look at all the cars u.s.
you recently started doing these really
have crossing guards it's literally the
biggest waste of everything I don't
think anyone cares I'm sorry I'm sorry I
know but basically I went out to lunch
with this girl it wasn't a day it was
casual
I know yeah she stopped talking to me
and so for me I'm just like damn what
did I do like so I've been overthinking
I'm just like you know was it this or
that well for me like one I usually
really care like about people we can
generalize this with like our topics cuz
like girls I think think that guys
always like they shouldn't tell guys
like things that they should know cuz
they're involved you know because they
don't care or they'll like be really
pushy but my theory is you just always
be as honest as possible and like tell
the full story and like what you think
is appropriate because if they don't
care then it doesn't matter but you feel
like morally your conscience is clean
but so many girls like just say like
don't tell them or just like don't say
anything and like girls support like
just honesty with guys I think like a
lot of what I was saying I get it
because
in so many scenarios I get a lot of guys
are really shitty a lot of guys or
exactly like I understand that like you
know sometimes you can make the
assumption that oh this guy like well
hand oh well whatever but for guys
like me where it's like no like I truly
actually care about like you know why
this happening or you know what did I do
and then are you serious
wait I just cannot get over how
inefficient that crossing guard is cuz
she is holding everyone up for 20
minutes late okay for the first 10
minutes I was his fault but then like
for the last like 10 was the crossing
walk like you know how yes he has
crossing guards oh yeah we would have
been I mean he did take a long time but
we would have been also waiting for you
outside to Bradley
I need to introduce this to you know I
was like I'll just jump up my food too
fast you know this is the vibes we got a
bunch of revenue so yeah it's like
really cozy with our service
he was like sometimes I don't like to
pick it out with prevent for my own
babies because obviously they have like
a lot of relevant they literally always
just start telling you things about your
body and I'm like I did it like I'd like
to know but at the same time it's like I
don't want to know because I want to
continue living my life in ignorance
Elliott sure I like having chest pain
and she was like it's from eating too
fast like too much too fast and he was
like yeah but I've been having these
judgments for a while but if you're like
ask you the biology major okay we
appreciate you
many any pre-med students leave it in
