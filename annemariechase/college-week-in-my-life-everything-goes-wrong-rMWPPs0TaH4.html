but this is actually editing amory
coming at you so I have a question for
you guys some of my vlogs
surprise surprise are getting really
long and I think my current vlog is at
like 50 minutes right now with like my
first edits I was wondering if you guys
would prefer a super long blog or if you
just prefer that I split it up into two
vlogs and so that way you get vlogs
faster and they're not as long I feel
like some of you guys will probably want
to just split it up but it kind of like
this is a really stupid reason it just
confuses me or complicates things with
the title because I would like to do
college week in my life because that's
like what it is so what I do like I have
college Week in Milan de Mai I don't
really know so let me know what you guys
prefer to see either a keeping it a
super long just a week long vlog or be
splitting it up maybe like in two half
weeks and then if you see have any
recommendations on just like keeping the
title week in my life of college or like
what let me know that'd be super helpful
just because some of these are getting
really long so okay enjoy the rest of
the blog good morning guys happy Monday
it is 9:40 and I have this assignment
due on my two o'clock class I think I
talked about it last yeah I did so I was
debating whether to do that until my two
o'clock class or just go exercise and I
think I'm just gonna go exercise and try
to figure it out after and I don't know
if this is a productive use of my time
but I won't have time to exercise
tonight and my family is also coming
this week or my parents are so I might
not have time to exercise as much
throughout the week so I'm just gonna go
I've been exercising everyday and it
just makes me feel really good and it
helps my focus never in my life have I
worn so much yoga clothes and actually
go to yoga I am back I am going to go
sit outside because that is legit my new
office every since I told you guys that
I wanted to sit outside and did that one
time I've been sitting out there like
almost every day brightens my mood so
much to sit outside is 11:30 I'm hoping
to call people and catch them before
they go on lunch
and then at 12 all shower and eat myself
and then try again from 1 to 2 I think I
have 2 good leads those are the people
that I called on Friday so we're gonna
do this this is like the worst thing
ever and for our class assignment we're
just supposed to reach out to an
entrepreneur who we admire and I was
just wondering if I could ask him like
one question this is going well I'm
walking to class now my first class of
Monday I the cold call assignment I
think the owner and president of Korean
farms one of the companies that I was
trying to call things I'm harassing his
company now you probably put me out like
a black this but I also just got the
link to this Teen Vogue article online
that Emma who I went to Ibiza with wrote
so definitely check it out I'm really
excited to read the rest of it I was
trying to read as much as I could but
now I have to go to class might be he'll
be on time but super excited about that
she's such a good writer and I was happy
to be a part of it so
definitely go check it out a little bit
in the links below how are your calls
[Laughter]
also horrible yes I do
Campos are the worst actually I'm gonna
I'm thinking about like using the cold
call technique to reach out to like like
a Facebook recruiter isn't that be cool
like I just want to learn how I can
forget Facebook good job bing bang doing
our weekly Trader Joe's after class run
makes for some quality content being
really healthy with her spinach and
salad all right why you get spinach and
salad lunch tomorrow
this is all was that your stomach
growling in class I was like that guy's
cuz I remember you were like do you have
any snacks and I was like though I saw
that yeah
those so funny I just didn't look cuz I
was like what time I was at work and
this guy's bosses stomach growled like
that and he was like whoa don't eat me
look at that self-control Trader Joe's
cashier just called her pretties
I captured your embarrassed face I think
I hope I hope
we were like hey you did not know what
to do I just try not to make eye contact
because I don't really waving it's cute
hello everyone so it is 4:30 I need to
make some dinner I guess I probably
changed I was like kind of busy this
morning that's what I need to do before
6:00 when my next class is oh but the
whole reason why I started vlogging and
this kind of sucks because I'm still a
little behind on my weekly vlog so they
post like a little later but if you guys
follow me on Instagram you probably saw
this already I was in a Teen Vogue
article and I actually blogged I think
when I had the conversation if any of
you remember that let me know because I
just remembered that I vlogged that but
it was an interview with Emma Webster
who is a teen vogue freelance writer and
I met her in Ibiza we all went to the
top deck Ibiza trip together and I just
loved that trip so much because there
are so many really smart people that I
like enjoyed talking to and having great
conversation with and she was one of
them so definitely check out that
article brooke Michiyo is also in it she
interviewed both of us and I think it
gives like a really good insight into
being a college student while also being
a blogger really cool article so
definitely check that out I'll leave it
in the description box if you guys want
to read about it I think it covers like
a really interesting range of topics so
check it out
good morning guys it is Tuesday 9:25 I
was planning on waking up a lot earlier
because I was very tired last night and
instead of going to the library as I had
planned
I went to sleep but it was kind of loud
outside and I just couldn't like I was
hot I couldn't sleep until like a little
past 12 I think so I got like a full 8
hours of sleep but today I'm very
excited it's about because I was editing
last week's vlog and on Tuesday I said I
was really excited because I didn't have
a lot of class today and one of my
classes it's honestly a quite a boring
class good material boring like
professor it's cancelled so I'm pumped
so I only have class from 10:00 to 12:00
I think I'm gonna hit the library like
for a while today because I just need to
like sort through some stuff and just
figure things out and do like
organizational stuff and for me like I
can work at home but it's usually for
like stuff that's due immediately like
short-term stuff where I have like the
urgency and it's easier for me to go to
like a quiet place to sort out all the
like long-term like no deadlines stuff I
think I'm also gonna be going to the gym
later with Tasha but I just made my
coconut oil coffee that my friend grace
recommended I try since I was on keto
it's really good
and I'm gonna get ready for my first
class at 10:00 okay I'm here with Zoe
she actually just got back we're on our
way to a good karma cafe which is like
this vegan place that is like busy
beating yeah that's that's the only
reason why they're called good karma but
anyways do you want happen
I don't know I feel like videotaping
myself right now do you want me to hold
it yeah last Thursday night were like we
should do the high dive because you know
fuck it look at the pool yeah we decided
we to do the high net this be a great
idea
and I've done it once before my friend
house has never done it before and so we
got to the top of the high dive and she
was super scared so me and Alex held her
hands on either side and so we jump off
holding hands but she jumped like
slightly before me we still held hands
Alex let go right away and was
completely fine she jumped slightly
before me and kind of pulled me down and
then my legs kicked up so I landed like
if this is my head like that but like
just cut flat on the water and it's like
an actual high dive it's 50 feet yeah
got the wind knocked out of me and
passed out in the water oh my god and I
like like noticed that I was like dead
man putting in the I would I hope so
yeah and so he pulled me out and I guess
I was like bleeding from my nose if I
don't remember I mean I passed out so I
don't remember that but then the next
thing I remember is talking to like a
DPS security guy and he was like are you
okay do you know what happened and I'm
like what are you talking about like I'm
completely fine like I just did the high
dive I got out we're good and he's like
no you passed out and you're bleeding
from your nose and I'm like no I'm not
I'll he was like yeah you definitely
aren't it was like feeling around I
couldn't even like feel that I was
bleeding oh my gosh and he was like go
to the hospital if you have these
symptoms and I don't actually remember
what the symptoms were because I have
amnesia which is one of the symptoms so
which the next day I was like completely
couldn't stand up without feeling
nauseous I was in the hospital
was there for like seven and a half
hours in the ER they're like yeah you
have a concussion but they rolled out
brain bleeding which was good that's
good like two days later I like still
had a really bad cough in my fever had
gone away oh yeah I also had a fever the
whole week with like a 101 fever but
eventually it went away the cough hadn't
gone away and like one morning like I
like actually saw like what I coughed up
is like no you can see blood so we went
back to the ER and they were like oh we
think it's fine but let's just take
another x-ray and so they took another
x-ray and he was like oh just kidding
you have a whole bunch of fluid in your
lungs oh my god ammonia and they gave me
antibiotics so
concussion and pneumonia that's how her
week is going I don't feel that bad you
know yeah looks good things you're
literally always like like if we're
happy whatever like that she that
happens you very impressive what's there
what's your takeaway for this don't move
hands never hold hands especially but in
general is just a bad idea I like that
it this is my first like fully non keto
meal
it's now 4:30 and I left the library
after like two hours of being there
because I got really tired and so I came
back and made another coconut oil coffee
yeah I don't know why I'm so tired I
think I just had a really like bad sleep
last night so that sucks so I'm gonna do
work until 8:00 and then I'm going to go
to yoga sculpt with my roommate and Rick
shop and then afterwards I promised
Tasha that I would go to the gym with
her it should be fun
hey guys it is actually 148 a.m. right
now and I'm really full of energy and
I've been like being super productive
with my schoolwork wasn't super
productive like today I was doing my
readings and stuff but I was just really
tired so I came home and then I was just
so tired while I was on my computer that
I was like okay I'm gonna have to nap I
was planning on going to exercise with
my roommate like I invited her to
exercise and then one of her friends is
actually staying with us she was
watching Netflix outside and I would
like kind of fall asleep and keep waking
up so I put my noise-canceling
headphones on I ended up sleeping
through my alarm because I just like
barely said it so I would get up right
before exercising and then I woke up 9
minutes till 8:00 which is when the
class started and so like I rushed over
to the studio the person in front of me
got the last spot and I felt kind of bad
because I told my roommate to come but I
think she understood cuz I was like yeah
I put noise-canceling headphones on so I
ended up going to the gym with Tasha I
didn't think that we had a fairly good
workout like we did some ABS and then
some legs but I'm already sore which is
I think a good sign so I'm glad I at
least did that I've been exercising
every day
to the point where like if I don't go
and get a good exercise now it changes
my mood I feel like I was really grumpy
that I miss my exercise but this is what
I'm doing I'm somehow about to am doing
my work but at least I'm not tired I
guess
hello guys okay so I'm feeling really
good I just worked out somehow I managed
to get that into my ten o'clock but then
I had to eat breakfast shower and then
get change this is my outfit my jeans
were just washed so they fit really
nicely well you can see like my pockets
I should be leaving like right now to
make it on time to my next class so a
little jumbled this morning did not
brush my teeth that is not a good
feeling
so yeah that's my update my parents are
coming tonight but I have a lot of class
and according Christy's statement on why
people are losing no like I didn't I I
never believed like things that girls do
but like people really do do that stuff
they really care yeah I mean it helps
take good pictures I am going to class
right now I'm walking over really early
we have a guest speaker and Bovard which
is like our main auditorium at her
school so it might be like a really big
crowd so rich and I decided to get there
40 minutes early this is idea so I'm
gonna walk over now and go to class and
then afterwards I think I'm gonna go to
another yoga class I'll tell you guys
why it's really stupid but I'm gonna do
it fancy room
I only have like 30 seconds of it okay
how was it it's pretty good okay thank
you
random update we have here basically I
told you guys I was gonna go to yoga
class for a reason Oh tell you later I'm
going to tell you the reason it's so
dumb I just ate my food and I just had
an almond from my PowerUp gourmet and
that they actually sent me a ton of bags
but they didn't send to me they sent it
to my home address in Anchorage Alaska
so they sent my parents a ton of nuts
and my mom just sent me like the two
ones that she thought I would like most
really good stuff so if you want to
check it out I will link it in the
description so core power yoga has a
challenge where if you do 20 yoga
classes in the month of January you get
entered into a raffle to win free like
yoga so if you do ten times you get
entered for one month and then if you do
twenty you get for two I was already
going a lot because I was going with my
sister in DC so I was like this just
seems like a fun challenge so I've been
marking every day and what I've been
going well I actually just do this for
exercise in general so it's pretty easy
to see so they keep track of this in the
computer system when they like you swipe
in and so I have gone officially like 20
times
however for like my 17th or so go I was
swiped in and I just didn't pop up on
their system according to their system I
had 19 and no one is keeping track of
this except for me like I wouldn't have
known unless I went on to my account and
saw this but I was like oh my gosh well
I can't just do 19 if I'm so close to 20
leg I have to do 20 so in order for me
to get to 20 I had to go to yoga today
twice so this morning at 10 a.m. I went
to yoga sculpt and then today at 10 8
p.m. I went to like one of their
beginner classes and then tomorrow I'm
gonna go at 7 a.m. whenever I work out
before my classes I focus so much better
because when I'm when I don't work out I
just get so bored like so fast like I
just cannot pay attention no matter what
but when I exercise before everything
works so well and on Thursdays I have
six hours of class starting from 10 and
ending at 4 so I was like I should just
go
work out but the only time that I would
get a really good workout with like the
class and I want to is at 7:00 a.m. so
that's what I'm gonna try to do today
but in the meantime I have to write a
paper like a reflection paper and then I
also have to read like 27 pages from my
consumer behavior class it's like the
most bland looking material I've ever
seen in my life so we're really happy
that I showed you guys that midterm
strategy I use with the Siri and a bold
like dictation so I can follow along
because it's so dense it's like a study
so that's my update that was a really
long story of like this dumb you good
challenge so we'll see if I go but also
not I'm blocking about it and making a
huge deal I can't use any of this unless
I actually go so therefore I should go
okay I'm gonna go shower now Tasha
started eating an Ice Cream Sandwich and
so I got a new breed's McFlurry and if
you order mic flurries they always get
your order wrong so this is not an Oreo
McFlurry
it's just vanilla McFlurry with fudge
but I'm not really complaining but I did
complain I'll leave my uber Eastcote for
you guys below in the description bar
five dollars off that'll buy you a
McClure
I don't remember the last time that I
was out this early
good morning is like 6:55 and I invade
it as long as I make it on time to this
class then I will have made it to the 7
o'clock class so yeah there's the mood
although I can't see it do we see that
so quiet hey guys so it is 819 and
clearly I made it to the 7:00 a.m.
workout it was such a good workout I
feel so good and no one's up still in my
house everyone's gonna hate me right now
cuz I'm gonna mix my like coconut Wow
coffee it with the blender but like it
only takes like two seconds but like our
walls are so thin that I do feel bad
I have also realized that I've gone to
yoga three times in the last 24 hours
because I went at 10 a.m. yesterday 8:30
p.m. and then 7 a.m. today yeah yeah
we're all here are we where at on life
just when I pull out my camera we're
making popcorn Thursday night it is no
11:34 and I'm sitting in bed getting
ready to edit my video
oh also I saw my parents day but I
didn't vlog I kind of like I like easing
people into like seeing me again and
then I'll pull out the blog probably
tomorrow and also exercising before
class did not make classes go easier I
was so tired and the same the whole time
so yeah
disappointing guys I also caved and got
air pods which I am so excited about but
I'm gonna be one of those people now but
I'm still so excited so don't mind that
I guess
and one of those people
good morning guys I've been wearing this
shirt for like five days in a row I
slept in it last night I fell asleep
probably at like 2 or 3 a.m. because I
was editing super late but yeah it's
Friday morning I literally woke up at
7:00 to text my mom that I was too tired
to come get breakfast at her hotel and
then I woke up again when she was
knocking on my windows could she like
over and over but now she's literally
cleaning and cooking for me say I know
my blog but should I get
okay so I woke up pretty late I guess it
ain't really wake up late I had called
you so many times I don't sit with my
phone
wait yeah I did but I thought it was
from my door and I was like I was trying
to wake me up right now
yeah actually now that I think of it I
think it should have rang my phone
because I had a nun Do Not Disturb but
if you put your favorites on and they
called twice I think it's supposed to
call yeah I had a one ear plug in my ear
too
yeah cuz usually people wake up really
early in our house if I'm trying to
sleep in like I have to wear your plug
service so we're on our way back to dr.
McCain's office my mom will meet them
today I didn't tell them you're coming
but I'm sure they'll be happy to see you
I'm new drive yeah bye sugars coming
probably should be a little late again
because there's a slowdown we're going
there today because for Invisalign
sometimes you have to get like
attachments the negative side of these
attachments is that like people usually
pick Invisalign because it's invisible
you can't really see it you can't tell
that you're getting like basically
braces on your teeth so with these you
can see them and dr. Nicki said that I
will probably have to have them in the
front and so she asked me if like I was
okay with that so that's pretty much
what we're reviewing now I'm gonna be
fine with it because whatever it takes
to make my teeth straight like I'm just
gonna do it it's temporary and I also
want to ask your questions about my
wisdom teeth because that's what
originally made all of my teeth crowded
so I'm gonna ask her like her opinions
on like if I should it's probably really
annoying in the background I should like
get them out or like what happens after
like this treatment so those questions I
think I'm going to ask today
get my teeth checked out nice-looking
this is the Chloe of bye Chloe although
I don't think she's there anymore
alright I don't think she owns it that's
so crazy
that's so cool she does have really nice
teeth coffee
the decaf yeah
so we're all here in the office got my
mom here and she's back in my
appointments with me got dr. Nicki
hi Dennis be talking about your claim
check we usually review claim check for
the patients meaning that the movement
of your teeth and the before and after
and with the placement of the
attachments I definitely wanted to
discuss it with you since you're gonna
have a lot of attachments yeah I can see
them
on the front I wanted to make sure you
know it's not a long treatment I wanted
to make sure as a young adult you're
going to be you know okay with the
attachment the attachment can be colored
there are teeth color attachments so we
make them red so you know where they're
placed mm-hmm obviously they're not
going to be as prominent because your
mouth is not this day and we for the
movement
I do need because you do have a little
bit of you conceal yeah right here yeah
I'd like to close that so I'm gonna just
this is like yeah oh cool a minor by
minor movement that's number one number
two that's so cool incremental movement
of the teeth that is your operative that
we are moving
being them grounding your arch also so
this shows the blue shows you before and
the white shows your after so you can
see I'm widening your arches on the
corner and lower bed and also at the
same time aligning your your teeth now
we're going to look at the bottom teeth
the bottom teeth you can see have a lot
more crowding going in with the
alignment
I'm reshaping your arches at the same
time aligning your teeth Wow so you have
the open right here this is the movement
these two are kind of working it and
that is a that is it no difficult
movement to do because I have to push
your root in there at the same time oh
can you explain that yes okay you can
see that you this is the imprint of your
root so because of the way your teeth
shifted the Ruth has moved forward so it
goes torqued to the front that's how he
lost the bone so I am torquing the root
back inside the bone it's not gonna
rebuild the bone but it's not prevented
from getting worse okay and then
eventually you might have to get a
gingival gum graft there if it gets
worse than what it is right now
but this is the before and that's the
after it's going to look pretty good
yeah it's a perfect Smile here you can
see your back teeth are going in yeah at
the end even have a wider arch yeah so
what do you think about the attachments
do people usually don't like them
because you can see them it's all
depends a lot of these people that are
like on the camera they you know they
have no concerns about them but since
it's a very short
yeah hi eh we achieved a lot having
those attachments and I cannot achieve
there is this result without those
attachments yeah
I definitely want to do whatever is best
for my teeth I just wanted to like see
what right do is are there like
alternatives or it just doesn't work as
well if you don't get em no it's not
gonna work yeah it's not gonna work
because I have to bring your teeth down
a little more and they're kind of
shorter you can see you have what is
called a reverse smile yeah your front
teeth are a little shorter Leslie there
are no longer we call this every first
smile we would like to have a good nice
smile mm-hmm shorter yeah them down and
pull them down you know it don't have to
be braces or if you're doing any
Invisalign it has to be with a bit
attachment otherwise it's not possible
pass maybe hey how would my wisdom teeth
are just not getting it out like impact
like my future teeth what they at all
are they just kind of done yes well we
just don't know because they're so pushy
where we don't know if it's it actually
needs to be done or if they just want to
get it done right for that right well I
guess it did shift all my teeth but I
you know we don't believe that there it
actually shaped dignity really yes it's
natural movement of teeth and are them
everything moves forward and if you
don't have a retainer to hold your teeth
in place everything is just shifting so
there has been a lot of research that's
shown that you know a lot of the media
notation that extracted their wisdom
teeth still they got the crowding after
either between the age of 20 and and 30
because the natural you know movement of
teeth is you know it's forward so if you
don't have a retainer to support the
alignment of your teeth that obviously
they get crowded so it's it's a meant
that they say you know the wisdom teeth
make the teeth gravity and your recently
they are fully erupted I just are not
sure about these two back here
you have no space for them and
eventually they can cause some
inflammation mm-hmm and if you clean
them well you can keep them it's not an
urgency to it yeah but back here is not
clear so you can get food impaction by
they are an inflammation okay but I
don't see any urgency doesn't like her
treatment in any way right no no no not
at all I'm not affecting you treatment
you know even though it says this is a
little crowded but I'm not moving back
to because then you get pushed into the
car yeah there is a possibility at some
point that you start getting
inflammation there and then you can look
into extract okay okay okay
thank you you're welcome yogurt place
that Tasha showed me it's so
like hey guys it is Friday night it's
8:50
I didn't bring my vlog camera for some I
thought I'd literally like took the
charger from the wall or the battery
from the wall from the charger and then
