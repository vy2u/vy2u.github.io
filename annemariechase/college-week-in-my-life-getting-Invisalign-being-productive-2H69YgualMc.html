823 and I'm literally just sitting in
traffic right by USC because I have a
orthodontist appointment which I'm very
excited about probably gonna be about 12
minutes late so that's what I'm doing I
hate being late to places so this is
stressful I also have a one page paper
that I need to finish up after this so
hopefully I have time that's due for my
class at 2:00 and it's 824 so I think I
have time I am here in dr. Nick Haines
office this is you wanna introduce
yourself um - sunny Colleen I'm an
orthodontist I practice in the Brentwood
West LA area we have an array here and
they're gonna check out my teeth I
already showed them the pictures of my
nice yes you know he had braces when she
was younger and at this point she has
some relapse and which is looking to get
Invisalign so we're gonna take a look at
her teeth and see if she qualifies for
Invisalign
yay omega best right now had to repack
my car and i'm running back to the
office I feel so bad since I was late
already
was huge traffic a lot of traffic they
were dealing with me very nicely I am
learning a ton about my teeth and like
breathing habits her doctor came I feel
like she was just so smart but I
apologize if you guys aren't watching
this I'm the worst nice place
okay hey guys so I'm here with oh yeah
I love how ever did this office is just
so nice and like willing to be on camera
right now we're doing a scan of my teeth
yeah and 3d scan and that's how you like
determine how to do the midline yeah
with my mouth we're good tell need you
to swallow
I have too much the Moho yeah needs a
full it up okay
all of those is your saliva right there
that's so cool yeah well edit itself
yeah
[Laughter]
well those are my teeth so this side is
more grinding did no good vocabulary
well yeah I learned so much from coming
here the first time no one's ever told
me that either I didn't know that I
grinded my teeth yes some people Brian
please
yeah I might clench like in your sleep
or just normally just more I might do
that too yeah and I was just that's
actually really interesting because
sometimes I get headaches and I it might
be for that or from you grind it huh Wow
what do you guys this way I just got
done with my appointment with dr. Nicki
basically I think I'm getting Invisalign
and I've had braces before but since
then my teeth have shifted and I was
literally looking but I was looking to
do this in the next five years coz as a
vlogger like I just see my teeth all the
time as I'm talking and this is
something that has been bothering me but
just not enough to do it like
immediately and I don't know I was gonna
wait until I had like a full-time job to
do this but dr. Anna Kane one of her
patients actually reached out to me
her patients mom and she basically asked
if I wanted to come in for a
consultation and figure out if this
would be like a good partnership and the
fact that her patients mom reached out
to me for her to try to work together
just shows you the level of dedication I
don't know I'm so excited I went through
her Yelp page
she has insane credentials I think she
went to Columbia I will tell you guys
more information later but I just went
to the office and they were so nice
there that I just know it's gonna be
such a great fit and I just felt very
welcomed and I'm very excited and I'm
just excited to like be able to have
straight teeth again because that was
like one of my favorite things about my
smile is my teeth and then since they've
all shifted like I've just noticed it a
lot and I always like complain about it
I don't always complain about it but
it's just something that bothers me and
I want to get it fixed
so I'm super excited but okay so it is
11:33 now I left like on time but the
traffic was really horrible so next time
I need to leave way earlier the drive
back thank goodness is only 20 minutes
because I have an essay to at two it's a
one-page essay our professors like make
it good I think this person wants my
parking spot so I'm gonna leave now I
will talk to you guys when I am back and
probably working on my essay but I'm so
glad okay I have about probably an hour
and 30 minutes to write this one-page
paper but I think I'm good
I did some last night and I got a little
set up so if no one sees me move their
car my car
we got some good uninterrupted time to
write we're doing this real fast
so I finished my essay with 30 minutes
to spare
now I have to drive my car to campus
because I don't this is not my spot it's
not to drive and then go to class and
then I have a two-hour gap where I need
to eat I eat like a tuna salad because
that's Kido and I just don't think I'm
doing the diet that well or that right
so I need to go shopping probably to
make dinner and then I have another
class at night after two hours of break
and then I'm free for the night but I
want to exercise and I also have some
work to do that needs to be done today
so that's my plan it is 8:20 I just got
out of class and I just got home but I
think I'm gonna go to a yoga class I was
not gonna go because I'm pretty tired
but honestly if you like my like body is
kind of stressed grab something little I
want to get some like stretching in I'm
going to like an easy just plain like
beginners yoga class and that smells
good and so that's what I'm gonna go
this is my 12th time of hitting the mat
for the 20 day yoga challenge where you
do like 20 classes in the month of
January I'm pretty yet proud of myself I
did not think that I would actually get
that far I gotta go now so so I just got
back from yoga it was honestly such a
great experience I'm so glad I went it
was an hour-long class and it was like
one of the basic classes and I just felt
like it went by in like 20 minutes like
I actually don't understand how that was
an hour because it just felt very short
but I feel like much better with my like
back and stuff I don't know why we did a
lot of stretching in that class and yeah
it was a great class I'm so so so so
glad I went
and now I can take a shower and probably
not have time to do what my homework or
editing the instructor did like a little
head massage afterwards and she rubs
like a eucalyptus oil on me and it smelt
so good and actually felt really good
that I think I'm gonna get it she said
they're from doTERRA so I'm gonna look
those up now I'm like a full yogi now
good morning everyone it is Tuesday at
8:30 ish in the morning today I woke up
pretty tired again because I fell asleep
at like maybe 1 or 2 and I was already
tired but I'm super excited today
because I have the least class on
Tuesdays so I'll be done after 10 to 2
and I just feel like I have so much time
to catch up on whatever I need to catch
up on I also woke up to an email from my
professor yesterday you guys were there
with me when I was struggling to write
my page essay and I was a little
concerned because I wrote it and like an
hour and a half she emailed me and she
said great job a plus but I wanted to
say I posted an Instagram story
yesterday about like the orthodontist I
was there and I posted a story it was
this story right here a lot of people
reply like oh my god are you getting
Invisalign or they are applied your
teeth are already straight and I
realized that it looks like I have
straight teeth and I don't even know if
you guys can tell I feel like you can
cuz I can always tell when I'm editing
my videos but I had braces in the 6th
grade and then I grew in wisdom teeth
and all of my teeth shifted and I never
got my wisdom teeth out so I have a lot
of crowding and not it's really not bad
like my teeth were way worse before in
6th grade but it's something that I knew
that I was gonna get done within the
next like 2 to 5 years anyways I was
kind of just waiting to get a full-time
job and be able to pay for it through my
job that I don't have yet so when dr.
Nick Haines office reached out to me and
I actually did the research I was like
oh my gosh this is a perfect opportunity
so I am working with their office to
like show you guys kind of what my
experience is like and how Invisalign
will be for me but please please know
that I only ever work with people
whether it's services or products that I
truly love and that's why I went there
yesterday for a consultation I genuinely
love their staff she seems amazing she's
literally Camila Kibeho
orthodontist she's like a celebrity
orthodontist
like you can go through her Yelp page I
will link it below and like just see how
amazing like her patients outcome is I
know if you guys can tell like they all
look like different sizes cuz they're
all crowded but it's just something that
I knew I was gonna get done so like this
was literally the perfect opportunity
for me and like it could not have gone
better in timing and whatever else so
I'm so excited to be documenting my
Invisalign experience and I think some
of you guys are excited about it too
because like at least that's what I
gathered from my Instagram DMS so that
kind of clears that up yeah I'm super
excited for today I hope I'm gonna get a
lot of stuff done I've been so
productive lately and it's just a great
feeling
I always just vlog for far too long like
this is already far too long for a
weekly vlog
just sitting in bed and our housing
company turns the fire alarm on
luckily I'm already awake but like they
didn't even give us a notice or anything
they said it was a city coming in and
it's like there's it's people from our
housing company he like came in and I
was just sitting here and I was like did
you submit a notice for entry and then
he kind of bantered with me for a little
while and I just looked at him like this
and then he walked out good thing you
came in just hygienic reasons we've got
our flexibility
I have like no problem
when our housing company comes in when
they're supposed to but not when they're
not supposed to and that guy just barged
into my room and he had no reason to
come into my room until the inspector
actually came so I was just like guess
what I'm gonna do okay so we're here in
class and we have this entrepreneur
what's her name
karora debate and I know that I have a
lot of us new viewers and he had let us
sample his granola and it's so good do
you want to tell us like about them
these are the samples they just killed
all these Crone hey so sorry nobody else
can try nani took them all really
healthy my favorite is the vanilla
almond it goes good with syria with
yogurt you can snack on it by itself you
don't really need to add a whole lot to
that flavor so that has been my best one
and then where if you're a USC student
you can find it at the farmers market
yes
farmers market every Wednesday from 9 to
3 or amazeballs a food truck and here's
a car delivered to you personally
if the melon is too much you can order
it online because they make no he was so
cute like a baby
he's so he literally he's like me like I
only get so nervous and I speak yeah he
was so he was like looking on his phone
he was like a really nervous and he's
also he's from the Bay Area he literally
drives six hours every single Wednesday
to sell at the USC farmers market so
ecstatic the granola was actually so
good there's this crisp to it very
different it's very soft but Curtis so
go check it out if you do that I'm
currently on campus by myself sitting in
the middle of this field but it's cuz
I'm taking pictures for Tasha and she
just went to change outfits the guys
Colonel Aldo was so good I am doing a
keto diet and I still tried it anyone
really good so highly recommend Mara
Tasha comes
hello oh my god okay so context for
earlier today when I was super annoyed
at those people they were supposed to
put a sign like a notice on our door and
I was like I didn't I didn't see a
notice and I was like Tasha did you see
a notice and they're like oh we put on
the side of the house and I was like
well that's odd why would you put it on
the side of the house that's like
somewhere no-one can see it and then it
just appeared on the side of our house
it's like in the front side but we
realize I don't know how do you how do
you describe it like it's an ad for the
house sign in front of our house that
it's like an ask people walking by and
they put it on the backside of the sign
so like you would never think to look at
it so it was just super odd just weird
people but that's why we were so annoyed
at them I also looked at that clip again
when I was like can you don't worry
she's in our house and he he's just like
thanks I'll be out here all right so I
have class in an hour I really did not
want to cook anything so I got these
little egg bites from Starbucks I tried
them in New York and they were actually
really good but I was really hungry so
I'm gonna try them again I didn't look
up if they're Quito but like I can't see
why they wouldn't be there just like
eggs and red peppers oh look after I eat
them I guess I'm pretty good honestly I
like him I'm gonna taste in choosing
them they're probably very Aikido
friendly okay so I was walking to class
and I called rich to see where he was
cuz I wanted to sit by him and he was
like don't we not have class today and I
was like I don't know and I was like is
it on the syllabus and then we
remembered that if there's a speaker on
another day for that class and this week
we're having Arianna Huffington we don't
have class on Wednesday
so that was kind of nice that freed up a
lot of time in my schedule I told myself
that I was gonna go to the library after
that class what is my hair doing but um
now that I have time I think I'm gonna
work out at the 6:30 yoga school class
I'm going with my roommate pooja and
then I think I'm gonna come back and
then shower and then workout but like
that's the difference
the difference was showering is a big
factor of like whether I want to leave
the house or not so we'll see
good morning guys I'm on my way out of
my 6 hours of classes look who I ran it
I'm okay like literally editing this
part right here ready ready ready you're
gonna be lucky pants - yeah what is it
of me running out of space what I was
like should I answer I know you I am
standing with Tasha while she films her
videos do nothin where's my invitation
oh my gosh just the right person I also
like told you to look I said he was like
you though
hey guys it's Friday I'm with Christy
again we're here because we have an
assignment for entrepreneurship class
where we have to make two cold calls out
of five they're due on Monday so we
would really have to like get someone to
answer the phone who manages or like
owns a five billion dollar business get
them to talk to us three fifteen minutes
and have us interview them with like
questions on how they made their
business successful we're both trying to
get and we're gonna see how long this
takes us Arianna Huffington talked at
1:30 that 1:30 now it's 11:40 now so I
don't think so
so fancy
