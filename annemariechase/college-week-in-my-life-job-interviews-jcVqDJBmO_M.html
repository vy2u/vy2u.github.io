you never want to do that because you'll
rip them okay I might even tear them you
are set congratulations thank you so
much take the belt yeah I just got done
with my appointment I'm so not used to
this
here's what my teeth look like these
little bumpy things are the attachments
and I feel like I have a lisp now so
hopefully we can get over that and get
used to speaking with these on hopefully
you guys will not get you're tainted by
my Lisp and my teeth and still watch me
and love me and yeah I'm excited
this will be a hard adjustment for all
of us but it's not horrible that's
what's happening I'm excited though I'm
happy that I got them done dr. Nick
Haines as always is amazing and yeah I
just trust her with my mouth and face
and smile so there you go this is gonna
be a big adjustment to get used to on
camera I look like such a do we can't
really see it from far away maybe I'll
just start vlogging like this
yeah I'm gonna go home now
are you doing business give it one
how's guy
walking across the Tundra's like I just
don't have the how's your studying going
if I've given up always the case for
some reason we're all here eating I made
- we all have cheese which I got this
cheese and we did really all got it
after and we're all just eating cheese
in suits yeah like what we're
overlapping and like weird ways oh this
is the creamy Toscano Trader Joe's it is
- 40 now my teeth it's interesting
because I've known people to have
Invisalign before and you actually
cannot see their Invisalign it just
looks like a retainer on top of their
mouths minor quired a lot of attachments
I think it's just like the way that it
best moves your teeth and so my
Invisalign kind of looks like I have
braces on my mouth as you can tell and
to be honest him is gonna make me
extremely self-conscious of like my
teeth because it kind of looks like I
have adult braces on this was something
that I was expecting because she told me
ahead of time so it's not like this is a
surprise but it's just a huge adjustment
so that's how I'm feeling about my teeth
but whatever is best for the growth of
my teeth it's not it's not for that long
but yeah that's I I don't know but
otherwise I am up I do have one
assignment left but I didn't actually
have that many assignments to do I am
mostly up because I've had like a few
things on my to-do list that probably
take an hour
most they're not like you to do things
but the thing is like I always check off
my like smaller things I'll work on my
weekly blog I'll do you like my
immediate assignments and my readings
and I just literally have had these
things I'm going to do list some for
like four months and I'm just like it's
holding me back in like my progress of
like where I want to be so it's just so
frustrating looking at them every single
day and so I tried to pick like a
reasonable amount of things off of that
to-do list to do and just like do it all
in a night what I have late nights
because I'm studying for a midterm or
finishing an assignment like I feel so
productive and it's like well why don't
I just like come back tomorrow or do
this another time and be as productive
but just work on different things like
these long-term things that I need to do
and then I never really do that so
that's kind of what I did today except I
got like kind of hungry
midway through so hence the soup but I
think I'm gonna try as best I can to
like just continue on that list but yeah
I just am very very determined to get
those things off of my freaking to-do
list this week also thinking about my
retainer like she said that with these
attachments it's really easy to stain
them stain your teeth its money because
I don't want these to be on for long so
obviously I'm gonna try as best I can to
like do everything that I can to like
make sure I'm doing whatever I need to
be doing so I can take them off and have
straight teeth so maybe this will be a
lifestyle change I don't really drink
soda that often but I have been recently
cuz me and Tasha will I go to Target and
get a Diet Coke so I don't think I'm
gonna be doing that anymore
I mean I think it's just like a good
excuse to like start healthier habits
but I never sent yeah these are like the
things that I'm looking at every single
time I look in the mirror hopefully I
get a little bit more used to it
my first day out with my adult braces
we'll see how this goes I'm excited to
see how my friends react but not really
cuz I know how they will okay so it's
like four I just got done with my
classes my first two classes I'm another
class in about an hour and a half so I'm
eating really fast first of all so many
of you ghost viewers are commenting it's
making me so happy I just sat in class
and constantly was refreshing my page
because so many of you guys were
commenting and that's never happened
before we're like I could refresh the
page and have like a new comment or two
every single time so that was so crazy
and the comments you guys are leaving
are so nice I I'm like overwhelmed by
how like amazing the responses and
secondly okay so these are my teeth
without my retainer my retainer is
making me so self-conscious it's really
really really bad like my sister texted
me a few weeks ago or like a few a week
ago and she got a really bad haircut and
she was like obsessing over it and she
was like all I can think about is my
hair like whoa and I was like oh my god
you need to calm down like it's not a
big deal no one cares but now that I
have something with me it looks like I
just have adult braces on but what I'm
like talking to my classmates are like
my friends in class who like I interact
with on a regular basis but I just don't
like know them well enough to be like
hey I got a visual on to like explain it
to them
I found myself so embarrassed so I hope
this goes away and I hope I just get
used to like having them on but right
now I am like it's not nearly as
noticeable if you don't have these
attachments but it is something that I'm
very very very like very aware of very
self-conscious of right now so hopefully
they go like hopefully I just get used
to it and I just keep telling myself
like it's really not a big deal I could
take them off well I mean I'm not really
but I don't know so that is like
something that has been like consuming
my thoughts for this day but I also
think it's just because it's the first
time that I've gone to class with them
on so hopefully I just get used to it
but something - no like I'm documenting
my experience so I'm gonna show the like
pros and cons of it I'm sitting and
listening to a podcast and I was
thinking it'd be a really cool video
idea mostly just because I'd be so
curious to see what other people like
consume in terms of media would you guys
be interested in this side
and then if so like I think I'm gonna
try to like start a tag with it but I
want like a real representation like I
don't want people like make stuff up or
like fluff it up but a week in my life
of like all of the media that I consume
like in terms of podcasts YouTube videos
like who I watch like maybe Instagram I
follow on Twitter or like stuff that I
actually care about the sources that I
get my news or information are learning
from or like audiobooks audibles
audibles new books on audible stuff like
that would you guys be interested in
that
because I think that's really cool idea
but like that might just be me and if so
I'd be so curious to see like what other
people do cuz I just like I don't know I
feel like that's so telling of a
person's personality so let me know
hello everyone today hello we're out
here I didn't get any footage but then I
was like oh my god this is actually so
cute look at this background it's
actually quite nice but it's alright
yeah cuz camera picks up light pretty
well actually
good night everybody soon come on just
one promo let's see it
let's see that beautiful face we find
you one use it just look at how cute
this is coming look it's adorable you're
standing Oh
I don't know if you like sunny cooler
you can actually put light on
we're exterior decorating right now
their face what do you think
money shot
good morning it is Thursday it's 8:30
I am so tired me and Rick shot ends up
hanging out with Sam until like 1:00 for
some reason like I just got home from
class and I was like either gonna go to
sleep or just like do some work which
would have been a smart idea because I
forgot so okay so today I have class at
10:00 and then at 2:00 because my middle
class is canceled again and then tonight
I told Tasha like last week sometime
that I would go to this pixie event with
her my teeth my Lisp
like I'm gonna go cuz sometimes I bail
on those pretty easily so yesterday I
was told that I had a job interview on
Friday morning and so I clearly like
need to prep for that at least some
amount
so yesterday I should have prepped
because I won't have that much time in
between tonight and tomorrow morning
since it's like an interview in the
morning but I guess what I'm thinking
it's a little good my 10:00 a.m. I will
not go to my 12:00 a.m. cuz it's
canceled and then I might not go to my
2:00 p.m. because I've never not gone
and then I can prep from 12:00 until the
event which is like all day it's
actually like an interview that I really
want to do well in and that was poor
timing on my poor planning on my part so
yeah so I have an irritation on my lip
happens very often it'll go away pretty
soon interesting is I have not been
working out my back is feeling a lot
better like I can move freely but I can
definitely still feel the tension and I
talked to this girl my roommates friend
I just met yesterday and she told me
that she had a really similar experience
with her back she had like a herniated
disc and it was from a buildup of
working out and I think I know why my
back is like this I think I started
doing my squats differently and I was
putting a lot of pressure on my back but
her story about the whole her back thing
kind of scared me because
it sounded like the very same symptoms
that I had just hers was much worse than
for like a longer buildup of time so I
was gonna like try to work out setting
like this weekend or something I think
I'm gonna take for sure this weekend off
again so I'll have like a full week and
a half I guess of recovery but it like
it does suck because I really like
working out and it makes me a lot
happier in a better mood but something
that is amazing about not working out
like and not thinking about working out
is I can like shower whenever I want to
like I don't have to plan showering or
on my workouts and I also have a lot
more time in my day which is kind of
weird i'ma go to class now I have to
look for a open like study room cuz I
think I'm gonna do my interview there
it's a Skype interview
so oft
I just got back from going to class and
then I went to the library I was trying
to find this book that I've heard is a
really good book first of all but it's
also like very very relevant to the
place that I'm interviewing life was
misplaced at the library so I had to
like request them to find it so if all
goes well if I do well in my interview
tomorrow and I get the second round
interview then it would be really worth
it to read that book but I'm not really
gonna worry about it for now and I'm
just gonna like focus on whatever I can
do for the first round interview I am a
little nervous because I don't have that
much prep time I mean I thought I did
just because I forgot that I was going
to this event so I would have liked like
two days or two nights to prep I think
I'll be fine like I think I prefer to
have it on Friday tomorrow versus like
sometime next week just to get it out of
the way and if it's not meant to be then
it's just not meant to be that's kind of
how I'm looking at things but this is an
important interview I would take this
job if I was offered it I think yeah so
that's like kind of how I am and then I
tried booking a room and like the
business school like for one of the
breakout rooms so like I could have like
a nice professional background and
literally all of them are booked at that
time so I think they're doing like
scholarship interviews on campus it
starts like opening up at 12:00 but I
don't have I can't book a room so I'm
gonna have to do it here which makes me
also kind of nervous just because our
walls are super thin so if you if
someone's like making food in the
kitchen then you can hear it so I'm I've
asked all of my roommates if like they
could avoid that area just for an hour
tomorrow just like a void making food
like maybe make food before after so I'm
just gonna prep for this interview all
day until like I go to the about Matassa
and I'm gonna like try reaching out to
some alumni to like see if they have any
like tips or suggestions of USC line
that are working there in the same
position and hopefully get a response
but I'm not really expecting anything
just because it's like the day before so
wish me luck hello Hey so you should
start a blog that's what a lot of people
say what Serena grab you wall so I
thought I was like I would love to see
Zoey start a blog

that was so fun I'm excited bite me
Tasha okay your blog doesn't care about
me I just got back it's really fun there
were literally so many youtubers like a
lot of surprisingly like a lot of Asian
youtubers that I watch
I was fangirling really hard but I was
particularly fangirling over Jenny cuz I
watched her suffer a long time and I
love her fashion and I don't know I love
her so I got a picture with her so I was
super excited but here is my outfit we
got this the leather jacket and then we
have this justice from Topshop and then
my shoes are actually from don't they
like gave me this when I went to the
do't best weekend ever so that's
you watch my update it was a really fun
night I was like a very good event to be
a plus-one acts that's fun and yeah
tonight I'm just planning on going to
sleep really early I think I'm just
gonna wake up to prep for my interview
tomorrow and just hope for the best you
know
my first day out with my adult braces
good morning everyone
it is 10:20 and I look super extra weird
with my braces looking teeth and this
business formal suit I'm getting small I
think Oh No
um so I'm 40 minutes away from my
interview again I woke up at like 8:00
and I've done some prep work I'm a
little nervous cuz again like I I'm not
gonna say that I wish I had more time
but like yeah kind of but I'm gonna
continue prepping for the next 40
minutes and then I think I'm actually
gonna record my interview may be a bad
idea but I don't know I'm gonna do it
and we'll see how that works and I moved
my desk literally to the middle of my
room my rooms a freaking mess I'll show
you guys after I did this interview and
I'm gonna take my retainer out for this
interview yeah I'm excited I always
enjoy like challenging situations like
these it's like fun to see if you can
connect with people that you don't
really know and it's also fun to do it
in a professional setting it's a
challenge so yeah I'll probably talk to
you guys when I'm in my interview my
shirt is really wrinkly and I was gonna
like iron it look like I'm doing a talk
show
but um you can't tell on on my computer
like the quality is like kind of bad you
know over Skype so
well welcome to my room
I tried booking a study room at the
business school but I think they're
doing interviews so I tried to make it
look nice and probably my height or
junior year of high school or maybe
sophomore summer of high school I
started a YouTube channel and that has
been a very formative I guess decision
and a lot of even my career kind of
guidances so I just found this really
amazing community online that was so it
was kind of like it was fascinating to
me I've never seen anything like it
before
and I really found my place on the
Internet where I didn't really feel in
my physical surroundings I guess but I
also I also saw a business aspect to it
I saw all of these girls like working
with really cool brands that I would
have loved to work with and go into like
New York Fashion Week it's given me a
lot of opportunities to work with a lot
of really cool brands and companies meet
a lot of really amazing people and from
that I got really really interested in
marketing because I feel like with the
YouTube experience I really got to know
consumers and how they react to things
or me and Tasha just got back from
getting our nails done after my
interview I don't actually like this
color that much okay looks like a Barbie
but I can't really tell I like your
color okay let me kill you're like I
just got this is $5 uber eats for some
reason today so this was five dollars
from Cafe Gratitude
that stuff is like $15 originally you're
like 12 so this is like literally a
better deal than getting it in person
five dollars off guys I took a nap for
like two hours of deep sleep because I
just I guess I was exhausted and I
forgot to show you guys the layout of my
bedroom from this morning's interview
because it's pretty funny
I wanted this this was a bad background
I looked and you could like see all the
stuff on my bed and whatever so I
switched it around
and I was like I don't think she heard
me because I think it like broke up at
that point we had a really hard time
connecting at first but I was like I
tried booking a room in the school like
the Marshall School of Business but I
think they're doing scholarship
interviews exactly at this time so I
tried to find like a good background
well but welcome to my room but I don't
think she heard it but I thought it was
like kind of cute yeah now I'm actually
just cleaning my desk before I put it
back but I thought this is kind of funny
cuz all she could see was like a really
white wall like this and then I saw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
