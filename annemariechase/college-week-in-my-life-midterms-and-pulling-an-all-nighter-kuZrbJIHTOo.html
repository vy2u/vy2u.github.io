Monday at 12:30 I have class in an hour
and a half now tonight I have a ton of
work that I need to catch up on are just
like organizational things because I
spent like pretty much my whole weekend
with my parents so I can get away with
doing that I didn't have like any urgent
things due but I will need to like kind
of play catch-up for a little today so
yeah that's that's how I'm doing right
now hi guys
I took Christy to yoga school for the
first time she did really really well
like honestly I think an marine tells
all her - no I haven't cuz I've logged
like most of the time afterwards I would
say you did better than like all of my
friends that I've taken oh thank you it
was super hot and you didn't give up
once you are my inspiration no I like
stopped for a lil how do you feel now do
you feel more energized yeah I feel good
I want to eat fruit today what you said
about the pasta I had made pasta to eat
for dinner
then after at core power yoga with
anne-marie I decided that I just eat
fruit instead once you start exercising
you actually think about what you're
eating
I haven't exercised in so long and I've
been eating so badly like I ate noodles
like top ramen but now I'm gonna eat
some veggies
when there's filming on your campus so
you actually go to Princeton Mall
they're like filming over there by
Bovard
lock stuff my class got out an hour
early so I'm just sitting in Campus
Center but early people all over but
it's so nice out when they're filming a
video over there our movie
everyone's looking hello it is Wednesday
I didn't do I didn't vlog it all really
this week so I thought I'd blog today
what they delicious
Breann day is that sad where you got oh
he's dead okay but yeah okay so today
we're going to the library after I do
this
supposedly hopefully only an hour long
interview not hopeless I don't want to
like do it but after etus comma oh yeah
we tried this place don't say for the
first time I was doing really long my
guide today that's a trend when you and
I get together now we are like those are
just be together
that's all my friends really yeah hey
Elliot could you do that laugh again can
you tell the story over time it's just
that I've taken a full class load every
single semester your schedules always
packed it's always packets I've never
not at a Friday class I've never had a
jump to the dirt to the good part though
oh yeah
so I've taken all these classes and
because I didn't do a summer class you
thought that was gonna be what there was
necessary
I might not graduate and Elliot's taking
one and a half classes one and a half
what's funny
I mean I took a leave of absence but I
was working you mean extremely annoying
no he's trying to like recover cuz he
laughed at you
this routine is unreal so crowded in
here
we're gonna stay here and tell everyone
we use
break it it's okay I'll be here in
spirit just right over
I just finished editing
and then I'm gonna start
and finish
what are you doing it's getting busy
it's 139
stop drinking coffee it's gonna say I
can't really say that name was a lot of
people but I was super productive but
it's because you do the same thing where
you have like a huge chunk of time where
you study we're like other people will
just like stay for like an hour and then
be like okay do you want to be happy it
takes me 30 minutes yeah really there's
no like yeah yeah like my ideal time
until I got like six three hours or
something yeah and I knew you'd stay for
however long I wanted to oh yeah I know
hey guys happy Thursday I literally just
scarfed down my breakfast and I spent
like a good amount of time making
because I for some reason I thought I
had a lot of time
it's 951 I usually leave behind 9:40 to
get to my classes cuz it's like a cross
campus so I'll be like a little late and
I'm walking now but I was just so
bizarre I was like I don't have so much
time then I like to my watch and I was
like wait why am i cooking breakfast
still so getting ready to sit through
six hours of classes as I always
complain on Thursday early just throwing
this powerup this is a new flavor my go
oh my god because I have no time okay
we're going I am so excited because my
last class was cancelled my professor
has the flu I'm not excited about that
but now I don't have six hours of
classes I just have to do one errand
before going home and then I'm gonna
just do nothing
actually I think I'm still gonna do
stuff but we'll see you have no idea how
happy I am to not be sitting in my fifth
and six hours of class like I just dread
it I've already cleaned all the dishes
in my sink sometimes it just happens I'm
like okay well I'm gonna need these cuz
everyone always forgets to do the
utensils so so it's 2:19 I should be 19
minutes into my class but I've already
like come back I dropped off that
thank-you note from when my professors
wrote me a letter of recommendations and
also my boss it's kind of late but I was
thinking better late than ever because I
wanted to express with like a cute or
like a thoughtful gift for that one I
couldn't really think of like anything
too thoughtful I think it's just really
important to like follow up and thank
people I was talking to someone and I
was like yeah I like Nita sunnies thank
you or I need to get thank-you gifts and
they're like I would never think to do
that and I was like just a small gift to
go along with it I feel like just makes
it so much more nice currently eating
leftovers but I texted Elliot and I was
like let's go play outside so he's on
his way I'm super excited oh my god
so wagons to play scratching our front
yard but not you I'm telling you your
dog dogs not about it
this dog is like a dumb-dumb oh no wrong
group of people come here this dog dog
come play on the grass that's why we
took you here to help you get your dog I
see his little tail yeah shout louder
you can't you do that running away trick
Burke that seemed to work
oh they see it's just about volume
that's so cute
I read a boy trick did work
that's cute we came out on this field to
play with the dog and it keeps your
anyway I can't eat he keeps playing with
other people like other groups of people
he's over at that group now up he's gone
a little person he threw a ball for Doge
and Doge didn't even notice ball so
human has to get ball it is 3:45 I'm
usually still in class by this time and
I must say I have made a very productive
amazing peaceful use of my time in those
two hours I have been outside now I'm
reading and I think I'm gonna take a nap
and then wake up and eat and then go go
go and it just sounds like the best day
ever
I got back from yoga I'm wearing my
earbuds I was texting Zoe she was like
hey come be social and I was like not
planning on doing anything because I was
supposed to go to yoga sculpt with
Kristie at a time when at 8 cuz she
wanted to go at 8 so yeah Zoe wanted me
to come over but then after I showered I
literally did my whole face of makeup
cuz I was like if I don't leave ASAP I'm
gonna want to like stay in more if I
always like have people come here and
then I'm down to go out and hang out I
just like the longer i delay it the more
like social anxiety again and I'm just
like no I'd rather stand
is it true introvert speaking I tried to
dry my hair but it was like soaking wet
for my shower and then I ate dinner
I like really didn't need to eat cuz I
was still kind of full from my gonna eat
at 4 so I was like oh I'll be hungry and
then I was like oh well now I'm full so
I'll just like sit in my bed for a
little bit that's what I'm doing I think
I'm literally just gonna force myself to
go wash my face even though I spent a
good like 15 minutes doing this I could
I even did I make up this doesn't happen
often usually I just know myself and I
know that I'm not gonna go out I think
I'm gonna go to bed soon I have a big
day little adventure tomorrow me and my
friend Kristi are planning on maybe
going to the beach and then taking some
photos for her photography class
hello Carnegie's podcast audiobook how
not to worry okay anyway so it is 12 I I
think I've logged yeah I went to sleep
at like 12 I set my alarm for a let 8
because I would have been eight full
hours of sleep so I think it was like
8:30 and then I was like I'll just sleep
more cuz I don't really have anything to
do today today's like my fun day before
I like do a lot of work on Saturday and
Sunday at least that's what I'm trying
to do so I was like I'll just sleep and
so I slept I think 10 and a half hours
or maybe 11
I mean Christy wanted to lay out in the
Sun exercise and then go to Santa Monica
to take pictures for her photography
class today so we're going now to the
Toph third class and then we're gonna go
get back get ready and then leave to
Santa Monica and then take pictures
there it was very tiring today yeah it
was
we got the yoga mat the Trader Joe's
the Starbucks
but Christie in there
look at how productive we've been the
late start
beautiful day we're trying to make it
before oh so pretty but we're trying to
make it before it sets so it's just like
right now
how's this photo coming I'm trying it's
mode okay we're at Santa Monica
how are your photos good
yeah and movies are good find up at two
models are talking there's something
some people thinking like fancy photos
here
it is now 847 I got back from Santa
Monica with Christie it was so much fun
I love Christie I actually was roommates
our suite mates with her during my
freshman year so if you guys watched my
vlogs my vlog channel then you might
have seen her but had a lot of fun
got some cool pictures so today it's
clearly Friday night Zoe texts me she
was like you going to leave you tonight
which is our library and I was like well
I wasn't really planning on it and I
guess I could be down to like get a lot
of work done it's 9:00 but I got 11
hours of sleep today so I thought it'd
be like a perfect opportunity cuz I was
planning on being in a library like all
old tomorrow and then all of Sunday to
like try to get a lot of work done so
that's literally what I'm doing tonight
is gonna sound like the most lame thing
I've ever said in my life but it's kind
of like thrilling to go do work when you
know everyone else isn't like on a
Friday night and it's also like I don't
have to do work right now because like
anything I do is just like extra work
like everyone else
oh my god how long have we been here
every 10 minutes it might be nut butter
No
we are on a diet coke break you know
I've actually gotten so much done
spending time with you over the last two
days role-reversal oh no I'm running out
of space have you tried the new diet
cokes I'm getting an A or Zoey for
Valentine's Day getting it by meeting
one of that meeting that she wants on
who doesn't wanna feel bad about it yeah
they have new diet cokes it's like
they're mango flavor is so good it's so
good just showing their oh they're
looking at me okay yeah yeah yeah
everyone just started looking this way
right when instead of one in the camera
again everyone's coming back for drun
cheese there's a prophecy as dynamic duo
oh really yeah they were like making out
on the counter oh look at this outfit I
roll down my pants like a lot too so I
could keep my ankles warm matching diet
cool because sucks oh yeah look at how
nice and quiet it is this is your last
year oh maybe not for you look at how
peaceful it is we should do this every
night Zoey so beautiful unless there's
like poop on the toilet seat then it
just ruins my night do you want a
picture like this we just had a photo
shoot a photo shoot his girls okay let's
go back to studying hashtag sponsor
