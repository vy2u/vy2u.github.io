this is the first day back at school
it is my second semester of senior year
and I also think that I might be weekly
vlogging every week of my last semester
if you guys want to check out like what
I did for my winter break I actually did
vlog mice on my main channel so you guys
will see it here and I blogged a lot of
my own or break I just didn't end up
posting it because it was just like
random clips so I decided to post all
those in my vlog channel so it's there
if you guys want to check it out some
things that I need to do I need to
readjust my schedule or just decide that
I'm gonna keep it as is my classes look
really really cool this semester because
they're all upper division electives
that I picked I'm really debating
between a few classes which I'll like
show you guys one of the things is I
really have wanted to take Korean it
would make my schedule a lot less
flexible a huge time commitment I'm not
sure but I've always really wanted to
take Korean so I'm like really
conflicted well over there a little Ford
yeah yeah
raining
we're super super super super sweet I
have mine oh oh this is my rain outfit
just cuz when it starts raining in LA
you just have to bring out all your
insane rain gear walk in a class because
someone stole my bike in the rain hey
guys I just got out of class I'm trying
this vlogging on campus thing
it is currently sprinkling so my first
class was like horrible I thought it
would be really interesting cuz the
title of the class is and she
straight-up was like yeah this is the
title of the class I didn't pick it and
I'm like okay I like the intimacy of
that class but I just legitimately don't
think that I could sit and listen to the
lecture which sounds awful but like
usually my first impressions of
professors are pretty good and I loved
my second one it sounds so interesting
I'm so excited and it was the exact
opposite feeling that I had from the
first class so I need to go change my
schedule ASAP to try to find an
interesting class because last semester
I had really interesting classes and I
just loved going to them it makes going
to class much easier and much more fun
and makes learning fun so that's what
I'm trying to do this semester like I
shouldn't be taking any bad classes if I
get to pick them so I need to find a
class it's her place of the first one
hello it is 813 I have an irritation on
my face I'm also feeling kind of sick it
wasn't able to change any of my classes
yet
don't know what to change it too I
really could take Korean now it's every
day it's also during my like prime
exercise time and I just don't know yet
like today I have class at 10:00 and
then at 6:00 to like 9:00 something yeah
it's way too long I just got down with
the class it was a good class I think
I'm gonna stay in it but I went to
Trader Joe's after I actually had a
recommendation to get this mushroom
risotto from Trader Joe's yesterday in
class it was like a really funny
conversation but we had to end with the
recommendation till I got partner and
she suggested that I'll show you guys
what else I got
I love tapenade I don't know how to say
that I'm Domino uncultured
you
tapenade tapenade tapenade one of my
roommates got this last semester and it
was really really good so I'm just
eating it with tortilla chips got some
goat cheese because Kelly raves about
goat cheese and then spinach and
balsamic vinegar olive oil and then pine
nuts so I'm probably just gonna make my
risotto and then my next class is that
like 6:00 p.m. so I'm gonna definitely
do some work because I need to do some
work on my applications so I'm gonna do
that today whoa
hey guys yesterday I got a good start on
my outline but I still not where I want
it to be so I think today is the day
that I'm getting my life together I was
also gonna go to yoga hot yoga last
night and I didn't but today I'm walking
over to my professor my old professors
office hours to talk to him about my
letter of rec so at least I'm getting
something done but then I have two
classes back-to-back that are two hours
and then I have class at 6:00 and my
throat starting to get sore so that's
the update okay I just finished with
talking to my professor and it went
really well I was trying to get up
really early and I've just been so tired
lately I actually I think I've been
getting over eight hours of sleep every
day and I'm still struggling to get up
I'm thinking I might try the keto diet
that Callie was talking about at my
birthday blog because I'm just so
exhausted all the time and it's kind of
getting old I'm gonna walk to my next
class right now and send my perfect
maybe I'll sit over there yeah it really
looks like I'm talking to myself because
I am
I forgot to blog when I was home but I'm
now going to my last class it's at 6:00
and I would kind of what it's an excited
because I'm feeling a little sick but
then I got an email from our professor
that said the founder of class Pass is
coming to speak with us this is my
earphone it's making noise so I'm so
excited I love class class okay guys it
is now 8:50 and I know this does not
make for the best blogs I just got back
from class at like 8:00 really cool
class but now I'm going to hot
candlelight yoga like how amazing does
that sound ever been it's always at 9:00
and it just feels so late to me but now
that I have a later class I guess it
doesn't feel as late right now I'm kind
of worried that no one will be there and
if there is no one and it's just me I'm
not going haha at 9:30 instead of 9:00
definitely did not check the schedule on
that one that's why I think it's so late
cuz it kinda is we're coming back to my
vlog camera instead of the phone cuz I
have like 20 minutes 30 minutes but yeah
I was gonna tell you guys about my class
schedule so far my classes are going
really well most people I think like to
create a schedule like a semester before
when they're supposed to like register
and then stick to that schedule I always
had a late registration date because I
didn't come in with any units cuz I'm
from Anchorage Alaska and no one tells
you that you need to take your AP ib
test seriously so I didn't come in with
any units and so that meant I always had
a little registration date I think every
college is a little bit different but
here that's just what happened I look
kind of naked I feel like I should put
some clothes on because of that I would
always get like stuck when the bad
teachers usually give you required
courses and usually there's like a
favorite teacher and so yeah I would get
stuck with the bad courses or bad
professors and then I also learned in
freshman year that if I didn't like my
professors I would just not go to class
which doesn't make any sense but it's
true like one of my worst classes I did
it because I absolutely hated the
professor having really good professors
is really important to me
so what I've done and like what I've
learned to do which I wish I kind of
knew because everyone else is so set on
getting
the perfect schedule right the first
time is I usually have like a a pretty
good schedule like I hear about classes
that I want to take or I hear about
teachers that I know are great or just
like have my required classes or that I
feel like I'd be interested in but then
I will go to the first class and if I
don't like the professor and I'm someone
who's very good at first impressions
like usually my first judgment on
someone is it's usually right like you
know yourself best but after I like kind
of have my first impression on the
professor I just like either drop or
keep the class I'm either excited by it
or just like I have to sit through how
many hours of this I ended up dropping
two classes both four units that's eight
units that I have to like figure out
some other time to do with but so far
like that has always worked the best for
me that's how I always get my best
schedules and also how I get like the
classes that I am most interested in and
the professors that like I think are the
best and that really works I know that
some classes you can't do that because
they get really full or they're required
but I think that's just like a really
good strategy that I wish I had known
more about most people are very set on
their classes that they pick with the
class that I just went to the founder of
class pass came to speak with us and
then I guess it's like a speaker series
like it's all speakers I think it was
called taking the leap of
entrepreneurship or it's like an
entrepreneurship class and he said that
Pete Carril is gonna come speak with us
apparently Kobe Bryant is gonna come
speak which I know nothing about
basketball but I know that's like one of
the best basketball players the founders
of Riot Games who started League of
Legends because their us CEO um I'm just
like super super cool people so I'm
super excited about that class I feel
like I haven't really blocked that much
because I feel kind of sick this week so
I've just kind of been like taking it
easy everyone else is like party so I'm
going to kind of sit here for 10 more
minutes and then get ready to go to how
to yoga doesn't that sound amazing no
like candle light hot yoga
they finished hot yoga and now
I'm freezing
six back-to-back classes or three
back-to-back classes for a total of six
hours so wish me luck I also lost my
credit card or I misplaced it I can't
find it's not my wallet so I can't
really buy food we'll figure it out
hello I was sitting in my class and I
mean I don't want to like say that
they're rude people sitting around but
like they kind of were like the sup my
name is anyways I was taking this class
no one is talking and I was like wonder
what kind of class this is gonna be and
then this person walks in and I'm like

this is the current state of my face
after mucinex and I'd actually feels
like it got worse but it's Friday and I
was doing some deep cleaning and I'm
very sick as you can probably tell or
just I don't feel bad I feel like I've
just been so tired and sleeping so much
tonight I was gonna go to like Elliot is
throwing like this little back-to-school
like party thing but I just like feel
disgusting I also can't hear that well

breed's and I'm pretty much just gonna
work on my essay and I'm disgusting so
I'm gonna go now hello everyone is or do
you see false alarms hey everyone it is
Friday night literally every single
person in my house is gone they're all
out and that's a pretty rare occurrence
but as you can tell I'm very very good
the course of the week I just started
feeling like little symptoms of sickness
and now we are here
I'm really hoping tomorrow I will be
better because I really have to write a
lot and that I also wanted to exercise
feel like a big that has come out of
this is that I have edited for an hour
and that's probably more than I've had
it in for like the last two weeks for
some reason I just could not bring
myself to do any single thing for longer
than like one minute do you guys ever
have those days actually that's like a
huge plus in my book so I'm pretty happy
that I'm editing it doesn't require that
much energy right now it's kind of just
like watching TV except better I'm
