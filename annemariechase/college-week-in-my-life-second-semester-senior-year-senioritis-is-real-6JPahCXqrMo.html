abroad man traffic is so bad I'm so
excited to see him I'm gonna stop
vlogging so I can drive and not crash I
know it's been two years
wait you came like at the same time two
years ago yes it was very different
circumstance yeah yeah
hey guys happy Monday Jerry a showering

of stuff going around LA whenever we're
together I just feel like we have so
much fun together hello hello hello I'm
good how are you how do you sleep
I've left awesome every super-sweet
we're going to sonlife right now because
we ate a lot yesterday and we're trying
to redeem ourselves oh my god screen up
okay let's go got acai bowls I lost that
12 at Jerry's gonna like hang out in the
village we're probably not gonna do that
much today we're gonna save that for
tomorrow
I just got done with my first class I'm
gonna go to the bathroom
and then change and then go hang out
Jerry grab lunch or something real quick
and then I have another class but I have
to work on a project before then so got
a jam-packed day am I good at dinner at
macaroni which is my favorite off the
place to go to so I want to show him
okay we're crossing Derry this going
around they're being so cute right now
they're sitting in this field I love
this feel I always want to submit I
never have anything to do it so I
appreciate that they're sitting here
what do you guys doing wow that's so
cool Wow Ceyda Nintendo you know no
we've spotted etosha good stuff off
we're just chilling here before my class
trying to finish my part
hello everyone
so right now I'm working actually
featured you already in this look and
I'm with my group and we basically need
your help
so I'm gonna let you explain it because
honestly he's much better at it hey hi
everyone my name's Sam and we just want
to ask you to participate in one of our
research investigations this semester
what I really wanted to understand what
the college roommate selection process
looks like and how it has an impact on
college students performance so if
you're interested in helping us out with
this research if you want to fill out
the link that's below in the description
box register your interest and we'll be
contacting you with more information
thanks guys if you are living with a
roommate in your actual room not just
like a housemate you'd be able to help
us with this is are there any other leg
something do you have any bags hey guys
we can't return this way Adam max let's
let all I have to add okay do we look
convincing it out for people to wanna
help us yeah
yeah okay guys half our group left the
survey is like that we're asking people
to do and we're all trying to like get a
certain amount of people but if like my
viewers would do it that it would
obviously increase the sample size for
this experiment it is kind of a lengthy
process I think oh sorry we're asking
people to fill it out every night and
it's basically just like a survey
discussing your roommate with a meet and
greet with Ann Marie personal email
every one of you - thank you we need a
lot of people to do it and it's a lot
it's kind of a lot of work it requires
like filling out the survey every day so
if you guys would be willing to fill it
out for us we would really appreciate it
very much so yeah we're trying to get a
good grade in this class yeah it's a
two-unit but he actually cares and great
does I currently have 30 minutes to kill
because our negotiation finished 30
minutes early so I'm going to the male
stop because I have my Poshmark orders
with me and I want to send them off ASAP
because apparently you have to send them
within three days and three things are
bought already so I'm literally walking
with my stuff to the mail stop and the
number to go back to class afterwards so
productive
right now Jerry is I think hanging out
with a friend from high school I'm like
glad he has so many friends because like
I always feel bad like when I'm in class
after my two o'clock class or 12 to 2
we're gonna go to Santa Monica and go
shopping and that's always decided
because we both really needed new shoes
and we want new clothes so ok so I
wouldn't need a blog where Oh Jerry cuz
I just have not logged a lot with him
and he's gonna leave soon and that'll be
so sad when I watch this vlog over like
just me explaining what we're doing in
between things so right now we are going
to go to Rupa's brow bar brawl loud to
get our eyebrows done no we're not
because he's a hell natural how did you
like your experience
I liked it except it's still swollen I
look so vain during that we decided to
go try to find and try out these little
bird scooters that they have all over
Santa Monica and like everywhere Jerry
like doesn't drive and stuff like that
oh my god really I thought you were
talking about but I think we found it Oh
No
[Laughter]
so unfortunate a poopy haste there are
two at least if we walk all the way down
yeah success yeah like these are
actually crazy like we keep saying the
people who take our scooters that we're
looking for okay we're gonna go to this
one it may or may not be there all right
P how do we feel about this right now
they're just keep getting stolen
foreigner underneath our Haley sweater
one thing when I see them might actually
scootering along they're happy and so
I'm just like okay later on it's good
time drink okay the next one is like
kind of not close it's not available
because it is low battery
Oh Jerry Jerry should we give up we are
on a quest walking quickly through third
Street
Jerry look where I always started oh
those are so cute
oh my god are they is it you wanted
right yeah it's probably not on that
guy's on
oh okay I think we should give up this
is our leg literal ninth one there
they're supposed to be one so soon one
here and then one day he's on a mission
she was checking behind this area
it was like I wasn't even touching this
idea before the 8th try is our last
chance that were trying we are already
going to a restaurant by here and then
we saw this one is available in a random
place and if this doesn't work it was
not meant to be
moment of truth
oh my god what I was and you're off you
do it you do this looks so easy also be
careful uh-huh after you push off you
like press down on that but like do it a
little bit okay
you got it push off like pretty hard
like like no the momentum will keep you
up but you really can't
yeah like yeah I'm just like so unko do
you want to ride the back of it while I
can does that work with two people I
don't think so okay this is our update
I've logged a lot of us trying to find
those birds how was it oh boy were you
filming me well I was a little no okay
good
why Oh today yes well it was fun to be
with you I'd like the actual like the
third singer how was like not that enjoy
yeah I was impressed by your stamina
with that like you were like determined
but then even where we found it I don't
know how it feels actually be honest
Souter I'm like yeah like I thought I
thought it would be like easy to just
like do it but ride a bike I'm like so
uncle I need help I think you're just
it's like it's really not that hard it's
probably scary cuz you're not used to it
you know me and Joe I just got back from
dinner we're really tired I'm super full
oh my god doughnuts they own beautiful
so I'm gonna blog don't that for you
from Jerry thank you do you know I would
choose this one I'm afraid that we'll go
things I just wanted to jam what are you
doing to me
it is currently 1004 and it's Wednesday
Jay left this morning at like 4:00 or
sometime very early and I'm honestly so
sad we don't see each other that often
we met in Shanghai like three years ago
but when we're together we always have
such a good time we get along so well
and I just feel like we're just meant to
be friends
and I just like I hope that we'll be
able to see each other like much sooner
than we did last time he's just like one
of those friends who I'm like excited to
keep like growing our friendship so if
you're watching this Jerry thank you so
much for coming to visit I miss you like
already and hopefully we can do Taylor
so if didn't have me this morning I
realized last night actually when I was
really tired after dinner that I had an
assignment due in this class that's
coming up at 12:00 and it's like a very
like brief writing assignment it's a
two-unit class it's not a big deal so I
like actually prefer to start these like
us do these assignments really really
quickly before my class it's actually a
strategy that I've learned otherwise I
spend way too much time on things that I
do not need to spending too much time on
and then I also realized that I have
like a very brief writing assignment due
for my 6 to 8 class which I have to do
before six to eight honestly like I'm
not as behind as I like thought I might
be but in order to kind of alleviate
some of the stress cause like I often
when I have like a very limited time to
write I get kind of stressed out so I'm
gonna go sit outside gives me like an
anchor point and realizing that whatever
I'm doing is like just not that
important it's like an assignment so I'm
gonna go sit outside and read this it is
now 11:20 my little paper it's actually
a really good topic I'm taking this
creativity workshop class you guys go to
USC I actually highly recommend it it's
been like such a great class just the
way that it has me thinking about like
creativity and the importance and it
plays in my life I've been like
preaching about life being creative it
actually makes me so much happier that I
have ever realized just like being able
to write or like do creative things
maybe I'll explain this more later but I
don't really have time right now but
sometimes I write things for my classes
and I want other people to see because
at least for this one it's like talking
about a time where I felt oppressed and
then I talked about my sexual assault
experience where I think it'd be really
like just a reflection that I have on
that paper I think it'd be like help
to like read for other people so I'm
considering like posting some of these
things or am i writing I'll make a blog
I'm not a great writer like technically
but I do like writing let me know if you
guys would read that or if you like I
don't know I don't follow any blogs so I
don't really know how popular they are
like who reads them or like anything
about them really so if you guys would
be interested in that let me know I
think it'd be like a fun project for me
they don't have my bong left food are my
socks are wet from you spilling all over
the wait I'm sorry I take a snapshot of
my beautiful very smooth table and I was
sitting on there and I like I was I
don't know how did my knees and I was
gonna put like the swimming bitmoji in
and I was gonna be cool I was like
trying to readjust and I spill it all
over myself and on the card base it's a
bright purple and but I did a pretty
good job but I had to wet the carpet so
herself
for like three night three dances
therefore night zero
you're taller than did you know that
actually yeah your your io8 like come on
look at this I forget that I'm short too
I thought you really tried for about
five and a half
hi guys happy Thursday I went to my
first class which is a good good step
and I am skipping my next two classes to
go to yoga and then to nab the class I'm
skipping I have an A in and it's a
pastel class which is just frustrating
you know and the second one is just a
seminar class where the guy like the
professor speaks in a stream of
consciousness but there was a guy this
made me like this kind of like
solidified my decision this guy was
sitting there I'd never seen him before
but like I was like oh well whatever I
don't pay attention to people that often
at the end of the class he goes up to
Professor and the professors like I
haven't seen you all semester the
semester is like three weeks left like
there's not a lot of time left and he's
like not failing him I think he's just
gonna give everyone an A so I just
decided I'm just gonna do it sometimes

gonna go to yoga now Yoga sculpt I have
no other words I'm excited I'm like just
