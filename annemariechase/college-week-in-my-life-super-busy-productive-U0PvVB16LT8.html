blogged in a really long time and I
haven't even shown you guys my hair so
this is my new hair lots of updates I
just got back from Spring Break
I didn't really vlog I went to visit my
sister and I didn't not plan on vlogging
but it just didn't really happen
so I had like a lot of quality time with
her had a lot of fun but I just didn't
pull up my camera but it's Sunday and my
life is kind of a doubled mess right now
first of all though I am cleaning out my
closet I'm actually doing like this big
wardrobe redo you guys know if you've
been watching my channel for a while you
guys know that I've been meaning to do
this for so long so I'm finally doing it
and right now I'm cleaning out my closet
and I'm also listing all of this stuff
on Poshmark
so if you guys don't know what Poshmark
is it's basically an app where you can
list your clothes to sell and you can
also buy clothes they have every single
sort of brand like Louboutin Nike Adidas
Nordstrom like all pretty much all
brands cuz like you can list anything so
what I'm doing right now and I've
literally been meaning to do this for
months
and possibly years so this is kind of
embarrassing that it took so long but I
am uploading a bunch of my listings to
Poshmark right now I'm actually listing
these pretty much all for under $10 so
if you guys want to check mine out and
if you guys want to download the app I
will have a link where you can download
it below the app is free to download and
I honestly don't know why I have not
done this earlier Tasha always uses
Poshmark and she always talks about it
and like always sells her clothes and I
just have never really thought to do it
myself so I'm glad that I'm finally
doing this but if you guys want to check
my closet out I'll show you guys kind of
what I'm like listing right now but if
you guys want to you should definitely
make your own closet and list stuff in
it link it down below in the comments or
just share your handle so that everyone
like in the comments can like look at
each other's closets and like kind of
see what other people have and also just
shop for new clothes I think that'd be
really fun so here is what I'm listing I
think I'm gonna put more up but I like
I'm just starting with this stuff so
this is like a cute Airy shirt what else
we got here lots of brainy I have I'm
going to list like a bunch of brandy
Melville
stuff VP this one's a brand-new shirt
from misguided I took off the tags but
its brand name it's actually really cute
I just don't like the color on me and
like this peplum shirt from Banana
Republic I'll probably be adding some
more stuff too so definitely check my
Poshmark closet out and I will link it
below I think there's also a code that
you can use for five dollars off your
first purchase if so I will also link
that in the description box below but
that's pretty much what I'm doing today
otherwise yeah this week I honestly
didn't really do that much of her spring
break so this week is gonna be a lot of
catch-up luckily I don't have that many
assignments or any tests this week but I
do have like small things and a lot of
YouTube stuff that I haven't been doing
I just pretty much had a very relaxed
break did not too much so I think the
theme of this vlog is really just gonna
be like getting my life together because
I know that there are gonna be like a
few days where I'm gonna really struggle
the whole reason why I love like doing
these weekly college blogs is because
it's really real and you guys really
just see exactly how my experience in
colleges and most of the time or
sometimes I'm like like other people I'm
not very organized with my time so at
least you guys can see like how I
organize my week so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this vlog happy Sunday I'm so
excited and happy to be back and yeah I
think I'm just pretty much gonna be
cleaning unpacking hanging out with some
friends getting dinner for the rest of
the day um so yeah I'll probably see you
guys tomorrow
on Monday alright see you guys
hello everyone happy Monday so got back
yesterday at 12 and that's like enough
time to kind of organize your life but I
had a book report due today
which I need to like finish up it's
gonna take me like at least like 30
minutes so I really should fit in time
between going to my orthodontist
appointment at 12 I need a drive there
so that'll take a while and then after
that I have like another class I'm a
group project meeting and then more
class and then after that I am going to
like kind of go to the library with Zoe
but right now I'm gonna like leave to go
get my car and go to my orthodontist
appointment I actually lost or left one
of my retainers at Callie's yesterday so
I just went forward to the next one
which I wasn't supposed to change until
Thursday I took my top retainer off
because it's like kind of it's harder to
talk since it's like kind of a bigger
adjustment but I feel like I can really
see the difference in my teeth already I
think I'm on my fourth trays now like I
jumped to the fourth one but it's pretty
crazy like I I think like even if we
stopped here that would be so much
happier with my teeth I think it's a
really big difference so I'm really
happy with how it's looking so far and
it's weird because my teeth look
different from when I first got my
braces so that kind of scares me a
little because it's like you go to an
orthodontist think that you'll have the
same results but definitely not like
picking a good orthodontist is super
super important I'm gonna drive over
like now I'll bring you guys along to my
appointment but for now I'm gonna put my
retainer back in you weren't here which
is number three and then from number
four that's where you're gonna be and
that's number five again number three so
next to you're gonna get more alignment
right yeah I can definitely see the
difference it's pretty crazy bottom
mighty you are here okay yeah big jump
right yeah I'm waiting for that number
six that would be like it good jump
right feet yeah yeah okay I wanted to
see this oh how am i doing on my
progress you're doing great everything
is looking good it'll be honest okay and
you can jump back jump jump to number
four and wear them two weeks and then
you can go to number five I wore two
weeks and then I'll see you okay four
weeks okay sounds good thank you so much
thank you I just got done with my just
checkup appointment and went by it was
like super easy super fast but I am
rushing back to school now cuz I have
class at 2:00 and me and my group member
have to like go over our little book
report like presentation that we're
gonna do it's super super super exciting
news
I think dr. Nick Haines is working on
like some type of promo for my viewers
which is insane I don't think they do
this like ever
I think this might be the first time
that they're doing a promo I cannot tell
you
how much of a difference that I can
already see in my teeth and how great
like they've been to work with and how
much I love their office because I've
had an orthodontist before me my brother
and my sister all had the same
orthodontist and it's just different if
you have an amazing orthodontist if you
guys are looking for an orthodontist and
you guys are in the LA area like you
guys just go on her Yelp page like it's
a testament for itself and to give my
viewers like a discount is huge
especially since they don't do that that
often or ever I don't know if they've
ever done like a discount code for
anyone so I'm really excited about that
and I know that like if any of you guys
are looking for an orthodontist or like
are looking to get Invisalign dr. McCain
is I like recommend 100% I'll definitely
let you guys know more about that like
when I have more information I think
there's trying to work out the details
or like see if this is something that
they really want to do if it's worth
doing definitely let me know if this is
something you'd be interested in because
then I can show that to them and then
they can like gauge whether they want to
offer this or not I'm gonna go back to
school now and finish this book report
and presentation
we'll talk to you guys sometime later
today hey guys it's for now I literally
had like the busiest day up until this
point I just got out of class out of my
tutu before class I'm another class at
6:00 and I have a group project meeting
at 5:30 but I'm sitting and eating
outside it's actually so funny I can
flog here without having people look at
me because when people walk by they just
get really uncomfortable and like don't
look at you anyways that's what it was
from sitting out here people like hating
I or like smiling weird okay guys here's
a situation I got out of my 68 class
Pete Carroll's spoken it it was like a
surprise guest he was so cool not really
into sports so you know don't actually
like he told a lot of like history of
his history with like a lot of different
teams and I was just like I have no idea
what you're talking about but he was
like a really cool person at the least
so that was cool but it's 9:00 now hello
how are you I feel like you never get a
really close up future yeah I feel like
I always get you at like an opportune
time terrible time going in from my
second round of popcorn and romaine
her idea he's a good idea basically I
had a twenty dollar promo code from like
a really long time ago I had it's my
dollar credit and then I got two things
but you I was like this is so this looks
like it's like feeding like five people
because of the pods on like Korean
dishes always come with like sides so
yeah I'm probably saying it wrong but my
mom was just I just try to copy what she
said that's definitely wrong
hello guys it is 944 I should leave for
sure within the next two minutes I just
woke up okay I don't know hey guys it's
244 now and I'm actually driving to meet
up with Shelby I'm not sure if like I'm
gonna explain what we're doing I don't
really know how we feel about this
basically I'll just give you some hints
we're talking about it would involve
like possibly post-grad plant I don't
know it's involving uh I don't really
know I don't know but this is really
descriptive I'm glad I started blogging
but that's what I'm doing right now I
okay green light I'm gonna okay bye
this is my life right now this is how
jumbled my life is just that whole vlog
represented this whole day today okay
okay we're trying what try to I think I
literally was in this car probably in
this outfit yesterday my life not uh not
been organized lately but I did want to
say something well I probably won't
explain like what we're doing unless I
could talk to her about it
I did want to say that I feel like I
always get the comments on my vlogs that
are like oh my god you're so productive
with your weeks like I feel like I do
nothing and I never want to come across
that way because there are plenty of
times where I do nothing just keep in
mind that I'm showing you pretty much
like the highlights not even the
highlights like sometimes I do better
stuff than just what I show and I feel
uncomfortable showing but I'm basically
showing you like the times where I am
doing stuff so it's not like I'm doing
stuff all the time there are so many
times where I'm not doing anything at
all and I think you need like that
balance because I need my like downtime
and my like relaxation time it's like
necessary for me just to be able to
function as a normal effective human
being so yeah I don't ever want to give
off that impression because it's just
not true there are so many times where I
do not think what am I trying to say
right now oh my god wait I need to look
at this dog he has such a setup this dog
is a princess well um yeah I just wanted
to mention that yeah okay tender green
project
that I was like I was trying to explain
earlier I was like I probably won't say
anything about it how would you describe
it you just got a little bubbly I just I
was like it's you to believe in but it's
on a video it's like a show or we have
to be like babe
yeah yeah so we're working on we hum
super excited but that's pretty much it
for update victims I'll talk about it
I'll talk about it later when I'm asking
about
but not really not really like what
we're doing okay really true okay
welcome back to back this is where those
Bloods happened it is a gloomy day let
me and tell me how to productive meeting
I think and I'm like super excited for
what we're working on
it's like a very big if but on even
camera 10 and talk about it as if it's
gonna happen so super excited I'm going
to write a now to see if they have any
purple shampoo because I need to wash my
hair and I don't want to ruin it and
then I'm going to go home shower if I
get the shampoo don't shower actually me
I'm gonna wait to shower and then I'm
going to go to the library with Zoey I
told her that I'd be back at 5:00 it's
5:55 right now but it's okay
just need to get a lot of work done
tonight and then I think I'm going to a
goodbye party for a friend but I just
learned about it like two hours 20
minutes ago
so we'll see it's like a busy week this
week it's a very busy week this week but
I don't know I like being busy so what's
going on
it's 4:20 five in the morning I left the
library I think that's when I lost
logged at eleven but I actually got a
lot done I was super productive tonight
um I don't really know how it's for now
time went by really fast and it was such
a busy day like so incredibly busy but
very productive it's a good day have fun
since I've been having really busy days
and I need to get a lot of different
stuff done I've been doing this method
that I showed you in a really video a
long time ago I'll try to link it if I
can find it but it's basically just like
planning out every hour of the day just
to make sure that I'm not just like
wasting any time in between classes or
anything because I like need to get this
stuff done if I actually do this the
night before then I stick to it and my
whole day works out really well if I
don't do it and wait for the morning up
or something it usually doesn't work out
so I'm glad that I'm doing this I'll try
to link it below yeah that's pretty much
my update I'm gonna be up in like three
three and a half hours and probably talk
to you that
so I set my alarm for 750 turn my alarm
off don't remember it going off and
miraculously woke up at 8 like this
always happens where somehow like I wake
up and I'm like oh my god I slept
through everything but I usually don't
like something in my you know head is
like looking out but yeah I'm gonna go
at 8:38 right now I have no idea how I
got up so good that it is 10:17 I just
got back from my massage therapy
appointment it was like the best thing
I've ever done this guy was awesome
and he was like super nice and I
actually told him my idea that he should
listen to podcasts and like audio books
cuz we were talking about how his job is
really demanding and I was like yeah you
actually have to like be engaged in your
job the whole time you like literally
could not do anything else and he like
thought it was such a good idea so I
felt really good about myself so I'm
gonna email him my free audiobook
download if you guys want it too I'll
link it down below just make sure - I'm
gonna tell him this to you like to
cancel it because if you don't want to
continue it I continue mine but it is a
subscription-based service so it will
charge you continuously just like
Spotify or Netflix so cancel it if you
don't want it but I just feel we really
bonded over audiobooks next on my agenda
of things to do since I'm really busy
today is one of my professors office
hours
it's 3:20 and it's so rainy outside it's
pretty hilarious no one at USC or in LA
really knows what to do when it starts
raining also let me know your honest
opinion of this hair this is a lot
lighter than I asked for wow it looks
really bad right now maybe that's just
what it looks like though so I do want
to like get that fixed if you like the
thing is everyone tells me that they
think it looks really good like my
sister my mom Tasha
like people whose opinion I really trust
but then I look at it sometimes and I
think this looks like kind of bad and
I'm just like I don't really know let me
know your thoughts because I want to get
that fixed but like if everyone's like
oh looks good like I just can't tell or
they're saying that I'm telling you guys
this method and it doesn't work all the
time but if you have a ton of stuff that
you absolutely need to do this method
works so well so today I went to my
massage therapy therapy appointment I
went to my professors office hours and
went to Trader Joe's like I mean to go
to Trader Joe's to get food instead of
just like uber eating foods for like the
last since Sunday it's Wednesday now so
like if you just like schedule
everything down to like kind of the hour
and you have to be really realistic of
how long things are gonna take you and
so next on my agenda is to edit and post
my blog that is kind of late so I'm
excited to be doing that or I need to be
doing that and then I need to do some
like YouTube stuff and then I'm gonna
eat I scheduled my eating time and then
I might even in class but it's like a
really good system if you are just like
you have a bunch of stuff to do like in
a week and kind of like Aaron D stuff
and you just like are not good at
managing your time I think I talked
about this in the video but I can show
you guys I will link it below so before
I end this video I just want to remind
you all to download the Poshmark
app and definitely check out my closet
leave your guys's handles below so we
can all shop each other's closets this
