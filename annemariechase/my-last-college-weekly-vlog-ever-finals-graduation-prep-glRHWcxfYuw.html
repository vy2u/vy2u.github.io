officially my last college weekly vlog
so this week it is finals dead week so
that basically just means we don't have
any classes
none of our professors are supposed to
have made anything do it's just like a
study period before finals start up I
wanted to update you guys quickly and
bring you guys along with like all of my
study periods because I know you guys
really like this so hopefully it comes
like at a good time for you guys
my final schedule is not going to be
that difficult it's gonna be annoying
but I've definitely had worse final
schedules because of that I didn't
really do any studying over the weekend
even though I probably should have done
a little more so I don't even know at
this point like when my finals are or
like what really I need to be doing for
them I have like a little bit of an idea
but I just really need to sit down and
like figure everything out so that's
kind of when I'm going to do today I
also have something do for me and
Shelby's project that we're doing she
just got back from playlist live so
we're gonna have to figure out something
and I also have a final do even though
it wasn't supposed to be nothing
supposed to be due today but he gave us
like a week to do it of course I'm
waiting till the last day I can't
believe this is the last college weekly
blog okay hello Jenny say hi we're all
hanging out working on studying for our
finals and reduce yourselves so I'm Kyle
Kyle learning how to blog awkward I know
it Louise she invited me over for Indian
food after we were working in that group
we did like three hours of like intense
work I have a big headache now so we
just decided to listen to a song before
we leave to go back to the library what
song do we pick
hey do you think Elliott's studying at
all this whole week 57 we went to
maybe you library every single chair was
filled and so we're heading to the
business school to see if anyone's there
okay it usually it's pretty open but the
students don't have that much to study
for just funny because every time we go
to study together half my time is doing
like other stuff like YouTube stuff but
the whole time she's studying so like
that's a lot of time yeah well like
whatever we're pulling like all-nighters
like I've never just study like maybe
like in my freshman and sophomore year
my classes are not that high maintenance
anymore and I'm taking 20 units watched
the business school we found small good
seats we could take these two tables or
tables
we have tables here
it is now 2:00 a.m. I think I did enough
for today I'm pretty much getting tired
but I came home to a really adorable
package from my grandma and grandpa my
grandma made me a little scrapbook and
I'm just gonna flip through the cute
pictures of me there are way less cute
pictures of me but we're not going there
so me and my loving dad okay I get cuter
adorable
I am so cute and that's where we stop it
goes on for a few more years like
adorableness and then it just goes kind
of downhill from from there I have been
very nostalgic this week and very like
emotional so this is gonna really help
that but yeah thank you grandma and
grandpa for watching this
it's Tuesday I was exhausted after
waking up I got a text from pooja being
like do you want to go to core power and
I was like no yeah I did
actually I got back at like 1:00 but it
was yeah I would definitely not have
gone probably definitely probably not I
always like set the goal like yeah yeah
I'm so glad we went okay we're going to
sonlife now I've only been at one close
this time yeah who tried this before
what a bougie Tuesday oh my gosh you're
the cutest dog I've ever seen oh my god
you're so soft - oh it is 3:30 - right
now I was supposed to meet with my group
project team at 3:00 or 4:00 but they
keep pushing it back so I'm gonna meet
with him tomorrow and then I actually
have to go meet up with Shelby later so
I think I'm gonna bring pooja and Tasha
because they both want to go to like a
coffee shop to do their work or their
essays so we're all just gonna go head
to Westwood UCLA side and do some work
today I'm gonna capture a special moment
it's such a great way to do the house
chores right no our house is like very
messy right now it gets like this
probably every week but I've been in
other people's houses it's way worse our
house is like fine I'm going to capture
our group cleaning something that I
recommend to all roommates everyone
always like talks about like passive
aggressiveness with roommates and like
cleaning and stuff but this pretty much
prevents it and it also allows you to
like clean everything because you're all
cleaning at the same time and no one
feels like they're doing like unequal
amounts of work gonna do it without
nourish off for today just because I
feel like she's been cleaning a lot on
her own so we're all good with that
[Laughter]
like it smells like feet so I breathe
alright here's the result I mean we
solve some stuff out but it's like
clearly way cleaner I cleaned out my we
just keep smelling with so the exact
same smell for whatever reason and it's
kind of disgusting and the guac that I
ordered kind of tasted like it a little
bit I thought so the first place that I
got saturated into our BIA it's just
like in our fat cells we're going back
now they joined me at Shelby's and he
was so much 12 I finished that up
tonight okay I was trying to write my
paper and then as I started my professor
emailed me and said they're moving the
deadline back to me oh well yeah I
didn't tell them my hardest final that
was gonna take the most studying it's
gonna be a take home final now set open
note take home just so we're doing well
he it's Wednesday right now I did a
group project today and me and Tosh are
just hanging out she's gonna make
cookies
I was actually gonna make cookies and
then some one of my competitors I was
just buy cookie dough me and then it
made more sense because I don't want to
want to buy all the ingredients I got a
message from Gaurav he's outside I
ordered Bluebird eat hummus plate Thanks
I just bought cucumbers yeah I don't
want to like a bunch of carbs right now
because it's like kind of late well your
body handles comes better this is a from
panini grill so the smallest little
salad I've ever seen yeah what the heck
this look like I'm just dipping it in
like tar or like facemask very
refreshing guys mom five dollars off the
breach very fresh little break use my
promo code eat Simran
eats - everyone should eat cookies
okay so it is Wednesday a Thursday at
finals week you know it's funny Zoey I
thought that dead week was at least like
four days cuz like I wasn't including
the weekend yeah so I was like okay fine
I'll start like Thursday it's indirect
shot came back she's like oh like I just
like something my final and I was like
oh dude finals start today and she was
like yeah there are only two classes
that I was unsure when the finals were
it was one I'm taking past Yelp's oh
yeah luckily I didn't have a final
yesterday I just filmed a video for my
channel and then I came over to Zoey's
all three of my finals are due and I
have a presentation for a final due on
Monday I'm gonna work on my negotiation
final and Zoey is over here painting
before not like much oh wow this is
already really good I can tell what it
is
artsy people yeah it's also very artsy
it just doesn't really translate in my
head what time is it guys yeah 3 or 2
p.m. Elliot just came knocking on my
door after he went out why what's that
let's use like to know what I want to
talk good morning guys
it's Saturday but it's not the morning
it's 150 my god I've got 130 yesterday
it was kind of like a show like
Elliott came over and then we all just
ate a bunch and now I feel absolutely
disgusting because we ate at like 3:00
in the morning but it was fun I was glad
to get like a study break but where's
crunch time so I'm gonna get ready
the wine switching to my retainers
so it is 112 and the only thing I'm
trying to do if I try to do for the last
few hours is create a business card
design on a daily photo shop I have
major what's it called artist block no
yeah I could try that yeah good yeah
thank you
well I can try oh really oh I mean knock
yourself out maybe you'll have fun with
it he'll be your creative outlet go
sleep then alright so the update went to
sleep at 4:00 cuz I couldn't sleep me
and pujan Nurik Shaw were hanging out
until like 3:00 and then I woke up for
my group project our meeting at 11:00 I
got up at 11:00 and then I went to meet
them now I'm meeting with a different
girl to study for a midterm and then I
also have another group project due
tomorrow and our meeting today so I am
kind of struggling I need some more
sleep but I'm being very heavily
caffeinated right now so start with a
cold brew good stuff explodes your
stomach I'm here with Emily we're
working on a study guide I was like
doing the study guide by myself at first
and I was like
so much easier what do you work on it
together
got some good notes okay so to 604 right
now Emily just left we had a really
productive like studying review like
note-taking session I haven't worked out
in like the last three days I think and
we've been eating like late night and so
I need to work out it's funny because
I've had so many group projects that I
kind of keep changing their times or
delaying I told all my group projects or
people who wanted to meet today I was
like my only obligation is from 6:00 to
7:30 any time other than that we can
meet so like my other group project is
meeting after this I met with Emily
before sometimes it's just like
necessary to block a chunk of time out
and just like tell people like no I'm
busy at this time I'm like making it
sound like I was like arguing with
people I just like said I had something
at 6:00 to 7:30 but okay good talk I'm
gonna go down 12 all right it was 12
when we got here we got here at 12
because this one was tough I'm just
kidding
and we met so we here
this is my most prized possession cheese
bowls this little doodad out okay so I
have TMJ
that's its heating pad that's nice so he
has a test in four hours sorry
we're going home pooch is packing her
next thing just when you thought you
were an adult you go back hello so we're
currently finishing up our project
really on time and in advance we
actually got a lot of fewer responses to
shout out to you if you actually did the
surveys it was kind of like a panel but
a little bit so thank you you helped to
do this
Aaron staying hard oh really
you have damn great how's our progress
going hello everyone it is 2 p.m. right
now I just finished my final I only have
one final left here is kind of like the
rest of my situation we have to send an
email to our professor because we just
had a really weird group dynamic our
group ended up being really really good
but just like some it was just a weird
situation so we wanted to like explain
that to her she's like a professor who
would care to know the explanation so I
think I'm sending that email and then I
have a final for my pass/fail class
tomorrow which I'm not concerned about
it all and then tonight my mom's
actually getting in but I'm going to a
covergirl event with Shelby and Tasha
I'm Shelby's plus-one my mom's with my
aunt though but I do feel bad that I'm
not picking her up so right now I am
just trying to get everything done in
time to go tonight and I also want to
get in a workout at 5:00 on a good a
workout class so we're gonna try to see
if I can get everything done by then it
is 3:30 now and it's actually pretty
crazy I thought that stuff would all
take me a really long time and I
finished within like an hour i sat
outside it was really nice and I kinda I
was like this took so little time and I
was gonna nap first and then do it and
then it just like kind of just keeps
delaying itself actually do do that
we're like if I need to send an email I
won't send it even though it's like a
small thing I'll just be like oh it's
like a small thing so I could just do it
real quickly later but then I just never
do it I mean I do do it but I do have
those moments where I don't do it but
that was just so fast so now I'm gonna
nap okay me and rickshaw just got back
from core powers I was very proud of
myself for going and also happy she went
because
I did actually end up falling asleep and
I was like very tired and so I woke up
for my alarm I texted her and I was like
hi and I didn't think she was gonna come
so I wasn't gonna go but then she was
like hi I'm changing so I got up and it
was a good workout so that's now 626 I'm
eating dinner
we don't really have anything to do here
so we kind of stand
I think the
guys it is now 11:55 we got back from
the covergirl event I was Shelby's plus
one it was cool I always liked one of
those events
but I am now heading to the library
because I told pooja I would go to the
library today so I'm going to leave me
right now cables your realization as
people come down the stairs okay I'm
trying to take a selfie for her scent my
snapchat here are the vibes a lot of
people left here like I probably thinks
I'm like trying to film him to be honest
I really didn't do much today I'm too
tired she came here from me yeah I did I
really wanted her
you should stay here all night thank you
did they acknowledge you okay so it's
currently 1250 I just woke up from a nap
my mom's in town so I like woke up at
9:00 to give her and my aunt my car then
I went back home I was gonna nap and
then study a little bit for this pastel
class but I was so tired I just slept in
until just now instead of studying I
like actually really don't think I need
to because I still know like some stuff
in my head but studying I'm trying to
get rid of real fast because Zoey get
old our senior photo session today I
thought it was tomorrow because I have
finals today like I'm just really busy
so I'm trying to make it to the 4:00 to
6:00
this test is supposed to be 2:00 to 4:00
and I also realized that I didn't have a
sash so I'm buying one off a friend and
so I'm trying to like coordinate all
this stuff so that's what I'm doing
everyone's texting me I'm getting
somebody I'm just getting bombarded here
so I'm struggling so we're just gonna
try to get ready and see what happens I
am sweating from running around still
but I just finished my last final of
undergrad I finished in 30 minutes I was
not the first to finish your job kind of
upset about some other people must be

excited for that but I don't know if
I'll be able to go to the airport with
her cuz like everyone's delaying this
picture sesh but I'm excited because
Elliott's coming to take pictures new
rickshaw is gonna be here I did like
didn't think to ask people so like I
didn't ask people until today
Domon don't think ahead and I also got
my sash this will by far be the most
