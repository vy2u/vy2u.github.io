saw four in the morning so this clip was
initially supposed to be the alarm
ringing obnoxiously about 5:00 a.m. and
then I was gonna open up saying like
this is gonna be the five I am challenge
for this week first of all I just
changed new trays and I'm his line trays
my teeth are looking really good I'm
just gonna take them off for now to show
you guys but I'm gonna keep the run for
the rest of the video this is my fifth
out of the 10 trays and I just changed
to like my teeth actually hurt when I
have them off cuz like they're secure
and like warm and safe when they're in
someone recommended this challenge and I
thought it would be a really fun video
to do just because I've actually kind of
been wanting to try this out for a
little while so basically this is gonna
be a challenge for me where I try waking
up every single day at 5:00 a.m. and the
reason why I woke up at 4:00 a.m. today
it's because I was working kind of late
at least till like 12:00 then I was like
okay I'm gonna get up at 5:00 a.m.
tomorrow and then I think I just kept
thinking about it but I kept working
until 2:00 because I had to shower and
stuff an hour to pass and it's for now
that's exactly what happened and now I
can't really go to sleep because I'm
thinking about how I need to go to sleep
and I only have one hour and I'm
probably be really tired some of the
goals that I hope to achieve with this
video is I hope I get a lot more stuff
done I'm in major senioritis mode so I'm
hoping to be more efficient with my time
the second goal is to actually regulate
my sleep schedule a little bit more like
for the past two days I slept like 1012
hours because I was so sleep-deprived
from the past week but today I'm gonna
sleep zero hours and that's just like
kind of not okay I think my body gets
really confused and then a fear that I
have is just being really tired I never
really have troubles waking up and
actually getting up early and I think
that doing a vlog about it actually will
help more because I'm accountable I just
feared like not getting enough sleep
naps are a lot for this so that's pretty
much my intro I hope you guys enjoy this
video I think it'll be fun very
different let's get started I don't I
don't really this might not be there for
any different from my other vlogs okay
so it's 8 o'clock in the morning now all
of my things are going very very as
scheduled but I'm starting to get tired
okay so it's now 9:00 p.m. on Monday
pulling an all-nighter pretty much run
my entire day like I was really tired I
got all of what I wanted to get done
earlier done but it was just it ruined
my entire schedule like of the day so
not a good idea but now it's 9:20 - I
have a mid-term tomorrow and you just
study for it still but I'm gonna be
getting up at 5 a.m. so I think I'm
gonna go to sleep but I think it'll be a
good time because I do need a study and
I think waking up earlier will be better
so 5:20 right now I did not wash my face
before going to sleep last night so so
tired at like 10:30 and I'm currently
just sitting laying and studying for my
midterm
um this is for my pass/fail class I did
a lot yesterday but I still have so much
random stuff to do today so we'll see
but I'm really tired right now I'm like
not gonna fall asleep but I might get up
to make tea or something
it is now 6:40 I still haven't made
coffee which I'm like pretty impressed
by I'm like scared of staining my
attachments even if I drink it with this
draw but I do have to say I really like
getting up at 5 a.m. because I do feel
like I've already gotten like every
thought about so many things that I need
to have thought about today and like
I've done so many things or not
so many just like things that I
definitely wouldn't have done until much
later and then the later it gets from me
like the more I put it off I'm also
studying for my midterm and it's a
pass/fail class I'm not trying that hard
and I studied very little last time and
god good grade so hopefully without
trying continues but I feel like this is
a perfect amount of time like if I got
up at 6 I would feel more stressed out
so 5 was like a really solid time to get
up to study for this because then I'm
going to my class at 10 and have this
test at 12 well yeah I liked this is
like
something who knew
it is 546 I'm in my bathroom because the
lighting is really good in here I went
to all my classes today I midterm and I
watch the gym afterwards because I was
like I'm gonna have time at night cuz I
have a review session at 9:00 I was
planning on napping but I was like well
I have to read a book and I didn't buy
it and it's on reserve at the library
selling you can only check it out for
like two hours at a time and so I went
to the library and even shariat after
the gym and just changed like my clothes
I ended up reading the whole book that I
needed to read at the library and I
don't need to go back there again cuz
the rest of the reading is online
I think this like 5 a.m. thing is
actually working really well if I'm like
conscious that I have to wake up at 5:00
a.m. cuz then I'm like okay well I need
to have enough sleep you know selec I
need to make sure I get to bed at a good
time so that really worked out today I
don't know that was like so productive
I'm very happy with myself
so yeah this is like actually so nice to
like I feel I've gotten so much stuff
done today
hey guys so it's 7 a.m. I got up at 5
and then I stayed up for like 10 minutes
and then I was kind of just like oh I'll
just sit here and I think it's because
usually like I can turn this light on
with my remote control I always have it
here like by my bed and that light is
like usually the fans long so that's on
but it wasn't on because I was really
cold last night and so I think I could
have gotten up very easily and I usually
done a problem but I think in order to
actually like get up I have to make it
like as easy as possible because
so easy to just like go back to sleep so
I pretty much just fell asleep and
snooze to my alarm until 7:00 a.m. so
that is not what I was planning on doing
I think that's fine for like what I what
time I needed to be up because I really
didn't I don't need to be up at 5:00 I'm
not like mad that I didn't get up cuz I
think like I was very tired and I think
I also took my ton and last night so
that probably made it even harder to get
up but yeah I think it's definitely
important to make it as easy as possible
to get up having like your light right
by your bed for me like would have been
nice had to like think about what I had
to do instead of just doing it so that's
pretty much my update I have a midterm
at 12 and that quiz my 2 o'clock class
I'm just gonna be studying for my quiz
or midterm today so taking more pics
everyone's walking by really
embarrassing do you like any of those do
you guys want to say hi are you serious
Tasha watch me walk over there and find
it immediately
roommate from me and Tasha are doing
work outside in the living room this is
a new trend that we have going on we
started setting up that table there's a
lot of noise with the fan and the washer
and the dryer but how are you okay
you know I was like really pumped to
like be working tonight and then I'm
starting to get tired because of my 5
a.m. challenge I think I only have like
an hour left in me make it under 49
seconds please wait how do you think la
can get to a handle bar it's more like a
pass do with your arms like handlebars
go like this right like this which one
did you like this is yeah and even
though there's a curve that we are
I got that on camera yeah I'm trying to
fill me I'm trying to david dobrik this
are you good yeah you like I looked at
me like a little panic
[Laughter]
good morning everyone Oh last night I
went to bed at like 1:00 so I knew that
it'd probably be hard to get up today
I'm kind of excited to be up right now I
have class at 10:00 I have so much class
today it's like not fun I get so
Restless but I have class from 10:00 to
4:00 like back to back so it's a lot of
class but on Thursdays like I usually
just get up for my 10:00 a.m. at like
9:00 or so usually like my whole day
it's just taken by classes and then by
the end of it I'm just like too tired
that I don't really want to do anything
so I think this will be an interesting
adjustment after my classes I'll
probably need to nap Tosh and I were
talking and she was like well I don't
know if it counts if you're getting up
at 5:00 a.m. every day but then have to
nap but I actually have noticed that I
do get a lot of stuff done in the
morning something that was really
helpful for me getting up today was
possible is the name to podcasts like
right now it's just very quiet so like
having someone to break the silence or
like music is very helpful instead of
just like being here alone in my silence
so yeah it is now 733 I have pretty much
finished task one of the day but that
has been something that has been on my
like to-do list for two weeks it's
something that just took so much time to
just sit through and like I knew that I
just needed like a long period of like
two hours to do it I finally did it if
that's all I did today it's like such a
stupid like small task but like if
that's all I did today I would kind of
be fine but I'm going to submit that and
then I am going to do some reading for
my 12 p.m. class but today was such a
productive morning already I'm so glad
that I woke up even just to finish that
cuz I don't know when I would have done
it used by the Emily corporation the
rapid rose company that manufactures and
distributes household and about consists
of a collection of Emily products
bottles at furniture and polish
detergent or shampoo spray containers of
deodorizers insect killer
hey guys it's actually 8 p.m. now I was
gonna mention so for my 10 or my 12
class that I was reading that reading
for the reading was a lot to do
especially like you wouldn't have been
able to do it like
just an hour but I was because I
listened to it on audio like from the
PDF file since I just listened to it and
it's just like basically hearing stories
I like knew all the examples and a lot
of the other people in my group like
didn't know some of the stories that I
was talking about and I told them like
yeah I'd listen to it before class like
I had my computer read it out loud to me
they're like that's a really good idea
because it was like it just would have
taken so long and it was kind of boring
I just think that's such a great tip
like if you have a PDF file just option
escape that but after my class is
cancelled I was super tired cuz I did
wake up at 5 a.m. and I did like stay up
and I know that I was I usually nap on
Thursdays because usually by Thursdays
I'm like most sleep-deprived so I knew
that I was gonna nap but I ended up
sleeping from like 2:30 to 6 or
something it was like crazy I was first
sure in deep sleep and I woke up and I
think I'm gonna clean my room and then
I'm probably gonna hang out with friends
tonight I'm trying to keep this like
centric around 5:00 a.m. wake-up times
so I'm probably not gonna blog that much
but if this vlog is super boring I
apologize
and then tomorrow I'll do kind of like a
wrap-up of like what I've learned cuz I
have actually I feel like I have learned
a lot so definitely let me know if you
actually like this video and if you want
me to do more like experimental videos
like this or if you hate them let me
know that too okay guys so I wanted to
conclude this video and I wanted to kind
of just do some takeaways that I've
gotten from doing this challenge I ended
up doing it successfully for 3 days out
of 5
one day I woke up at 7 a.m. instead of 5
a.m. and then on Friday I just didn't
end up waking up at 5 a.m. at all so
this was kind of the 5 a.m. challenge
for my school week since I don't have
class on Fridays anyways but I do highly
recommend this challenge for other
people based on my experience I wrote
down a few points we're gonna talk about
it I also have this new phone case
society6 also new décor I'll be showing
it in my maybe my next video the first
thing I learned is that these are really
hard hours to attain in college usually
like on a daily basis I'd probably go to
bed around 12 a.m. or 1 a.m. and so do
all of my roommates or later waking up
at 5 a.m. that only gives you 5 or 4
hours of sleep so you have to be really
really conscious
of actually getting enough sleep that
was a big struggle especially since the
first day that I started this challenge
I ended up pulling an all-nighter on
accident just because I couldn't go to
sleep so having a regular sleep schedule
obviously helps with this a lot but it
is really hard to adjust you and to
actually do every single night
especially if like you have like friends
and like roommates and stuff like that
it's like it is a lot harder to actually
get the full night's sleep but
definitely if you plan in advance it's
for sure doable another thing that I
realized is that it's really hard to get
up if you don't need to and this is
actually something that my roommates and
a lot of my friends have a much harder
time with than I do
I've never really been one to struggle
with getting up I never like oversleep
for like important events or anything
like that
the only struggle that I usually have is
like wanting to get up at 5:00 a.m. not
really needing to and then I
subconsciously like know that and so I
don't this happened
in this vlog when I got up my light
wasn't like by my bed so like I couldn't
just immediately turn on my light and so
that adds just like kind of another
barrier for actually getting up my
biggest tip which I'm not sure is very
helpful because I've like told this to
my roommates and they're like well it's
not that easy but the first thing that I
do when my alarm goes off is I turn it
off because it's annoying and then I
just get up and out of bed immediately
because once you take that first step
out of bed and you're like standing up
at least for me I'm fine so I will just
get up walk over to go make coffee and
by that like long walk I'm usually like
alright like I'm not comfortable in bed
and about to go back to sleep I've like
gotten up and I'm like okay I can get up
but with that in mind it is easiest if
you have the least amount of barriers
possible so if you do have a light right
by your bed that could help just getting
light into your eyeballs in the morning
just make it as easy as possible for you
to actually get your feet out of bed and
then the last thing I learned I was so
so productive I honestly got so much
stuff done this week but I couldn't tell
if I was like because I actually had
midterms and quizzes that I desperately
like needed to study for and I ended up
doing really well on my midterm that I
showed you guys like that I'm taking
four pass/fail and my quiz I know that
everyone liked those business articles
are always like wake up at 5 a.m. to get
a head starting you're dangerous like
what but that's honestly how I felt
because I really tackled all of my like
problems our to-do list really early on
when I had pretty much nothing else to
do like I wasn't able to text anyone
really go on social media because no one
was on it if I have something to do and
obviously like I have classes and stuff
going on during the day so getting it
done early ensures that I actually get
it done like I got a ton of stuff done
from my long-term to-do list that I just
had not been doing so for all these
reasons I very very very much enjoyed
this challenge and I actually filmed
this like a few weeks ago and I've woken
up at 5:00 a.m. to 7 a.m. like really
early quite a few times because I just
feel like I was so productive and got so
much stuff done from this week that I
have repeated this at some point in my
life maybe I'll try to like make this so
everyday things so that it's just like a
part of my daily routine but as of right
now it's kind of hard to do so those are
my takeaways I enjoyed this video if you
guys liked it please give it a thumb up
and I will talk to you guys at my next
video bye don't forget to follow me on
