welcome Jays video is going to be a
back-to-school super wearable drugstore
look baby idea back school if that's a
wearable that has Chuckster products I
don't know up to that first part right
side clarify that I create this look
this sex my film is made on the first
time
oh no I like the makeup I would like to
have facetune I didn't really like in
real life and so I was not gonna do it
and the video I realized I didn't plan
on my lip liner that really irked my
nerves I didn't explain it so I flipped
it over I actually like this look over a
lot more and you guys will too it's
super simple honestly I do this look all
the time and for some reason you guys
like it and so I decide to pretty much
recreate the look I always do but with
drugstore products and I usually do this
look with high-end products and I'm
doing high-end video too but I decide to
do it over with drugstore products this
one came up with so if you like see how
I got in the practice I use the Catena
watch this video if you do like it for
whatever reason give it those up and
then please subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next one
alright so first let's start off my
shine control prior my Black Radiance
I love this part because the consistency
of it I hate that word consistency it's
like lotion now I'm top of that I'm
taking my NYX honey do me up I don't
know if this is like a primer I don't
think it is which do I put a problem
before but this does make my skin glow
so that's why I put on top of the primer
I use frond Aish I'm gonna take my dewy
+ smooth Maybelline fit me foundation
I'm gonna blend that out with the Tarte
sponge this would be a really quick
tutorial you guys I'm sure trying to get
straight to the point you know
no I'm saying so yeah I'm gonna split
that out I really love Maybelline fit me
those are my that's not my favorite
drugstore foundation hands-down
I love the matte one the matte one is a
little more full coverage so if you want
full coverage definitely use the matte
one the duty one you could like do two
layers to get full coverage but the
matte what I did notice is more full
coverage which makes sense because it's
matte and so after that I am going to
use this Maybelline
me concealer and I used two shades
because they don't really have my
perfect shade Milan what are you chewing
on sorry you guys I'm a puppy he likes
to chew and eat everything clearly I
don't know what his deal is but anyways
back to the tutorial I'm gonna put on
the concealer I just mixed it too to get
a perfect shade the lighter one on its
own looks way too ashy on me so I have
to make to look more tan one and those
two together kind of gave me a good
color and then to set that I'm using
another Mabley product a promises a
sponsor I Maybelline I just have a lot
of stuff I like a lot of their stuff so
I use it and this is a really great
setting powder it's almost comparable to
the Laura Mercier powder of course it's
a cheaper option so yeah it's pretty
cool I think I paid like well like four
to five dollars for this if my memory
serves me correct now I'm gonna take my
black radiance soft focus powder and I
hit pan I always do I literally buy
these once a month they're like five
dollars they're great I use them all the
time even though I feel like this one's
getting too light for me I feel like
I've got a tan and I don't know it yet
well I know it now editing this video I
should have used the darker one I have I
have all three all three shades I should
use a darker one but can't go back now
so just gotta set my face with that to
contour Muse another soft focus powder
and this is just like this the darker
shade they offer this is in the shade
milk chocolate so there's like golden
almond fitness there's creamy bronze
finish and there's milk chocolate and I
should have used creamy bronze finish to
set my face anyways um this is the milk
chocolate one it's great for contouring
but I put a little too much on so I put
my foundation powder on top of that to
make it look more seamless now I'm
taking my blush from City color this is
called toasted coconut I believe I used
soul time and it's perfect because it
looks light now but one of my second
spray on its gonna show up a lot more
which I didn't even predict that and so
I wish I would have put a little less on
but can't go back
so for highlight take notes on my Milani
and I'm gonna mix that bronzing one with
the light one so it's not too light
although it's like I put too much
highlight on umm I hide my nose a little
too much because I underestimated how
pigmented this highlight was I mean it's
a great drugstore highlight but I put
too much on and so after I semi
that's my blush really came out as you
can see it totally intensified I did not
know that was gonna happen so if you get
this blush just know when you put it on
it appears lighter than what it really
is so if I'm a scam I'm taking my Big
Shot mascara by Maybelline
I had the shade of one I went to the
launch party for that but I had lost I
left the back of my overlooking idiot I
wish you had X looks so good but I mean
I don't know because I'll use this one
and then after this I'm gonna put the
highlight in my like inner tear duct
area I've really regret this Park so I
feel like I put too much on and I didn't
realize it until after the video but I
mean you could totally skip this step
this look totally extra I really regret
putting that at my eyes and so for lips
I'm gonna take my chapstick off so that
the lip liner would stick and I'm gonna
use this eye liner lip liner and this is
by Maybelline as well my mom used to use
on her brows before meet Alyssa put her
on them the benefit brow products now
she refused to go back and she's always
asking us like oh or do you guys have
any extra pencils it's so cute and so
I'm gonna line my lips with that and I'm
gonna try to blend it out as much as I
can so when I put my lip gloss on the
lip liner line isn't too bold I hate
that look to tend my lips I'm use this
pixie it's like a gloss and a tint on
both sides and I'm gonna tint my lips
first when I put my gloss on you want me
to see this too much but it makes a
little difference then for gloss
thickness on my covergirl these are my
favorite drugstore glosses they're
perfect I love them so I have like every
single shade and after my gloss on that
pretty much completes the look I'm gonna
go throw my wig on and this is the final
look if you guys enjoyed this video or
