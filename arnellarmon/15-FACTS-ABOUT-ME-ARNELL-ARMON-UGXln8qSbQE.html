today's video I'm gonna be doing it 15
facts about me and that's why I give you
guys 15 facts some of these facts in
there you know some you may not you
might not know me at all if you don't
the first time to see me I'm arnelle and
if you want to learn more about me to
watch this video
it'll told you to smash my wig up this
afternoon alright so the first fact
about me and if you follow my Instagram
you probably know this because I post
bail all the time and it's not love to
read
so speaking of reading this video is
sponsored by audible you priority for
because literally everything in youtuber
talks about it
animals in Africa Dellinger favorite
books and other audio spoke
entertainment so audible I won't say
they have every single book on the
planet but they have a good amount bring
what you mean think of a book I type any
book that I have right now and it pops
up in fact I own a lot of books and I
dealt with them on audible right now I'm
reading the Ayana
vods on does have a state Vanzant
get over it if I'm not Instagram you saw
avatar seminars so while I was there I
did buy her book and I download
inaudible and what I've been doing is
letting it play out loud while reading
the book so I can like highlight and
make my notes while listening to the
book at the same time I was really cool
because whatever book you choose it's
read back to you and you can choose a
speed and wish the person is reading to
you so they can be very slow they'd be
faster is super cool and haven't hurt to
me people talk about that I think it
makes to where anyone of any age can
enjoy the app because some people like
to hear things right back slowly where's
me I can hear pretty fast I'm a fast
talker so I'm a fast listener as well
it's also cool because you can go you
pretty much skin you can skip ahead if
you miss something you can go to I did
hear back and go chapter by chapter per
book and so you pretty much have all
control of your book is just in the form
of an audio animal is a great way to
answer some activities whether you're
going hiking on the beach if I'm a
minister and you guys know that I like
to say in the parks in recent times so
audible is great for that if you have an
iPhone iPad a tablet all those
compatible with audibles so if you
inaudible go to Ottawa
/ arnelle and you get a 30-day trial for
free and your first audiobook of free as
well my personal book recommendations
are the Ayana let it go book you guys
know i download goes crazy also don't
let anything delay your sparkle owl I
don't know how I pronounce her name but
I'll insert it underneath here those are
really great books are young a lot more
so if you wanna like pretty much to
learn how to let go of things and don't
do Sparkle goes into why we as humans
pretty much have trauma and how to
overcome that I am halfway done with
that book and it's a super duper great
book the power of now is also for the
great book I have a lot of book
recommendations because like I said I
read a lot so if you want to know more
about what I recommend just leave
comments down below and I'll let you
know just tell me what you're trying to
look for and I got a book recommendation
for you and one more thing I think it's
important to mention is that if you do
download a book on audible that you do
not like for whatever reason although if
you don't the books aren't good man
you'll be totally fine but if you don't
the book you can swap it off for a
different book which is cool because
other services like this will require
you have to buy a new book where is this
one if you don't like it you can swap it
for a different one I think that's
pretty cool so yeah thank God with
response to this video and let's get on
to the second fact so fact number two I
am super random and by random I mean
that before I start filming this I'm
just thinking about cuddling and before
that I was thinking about eating and
before is that I was thinking about la
my thoughts are literally like all over
the place I'm so random whatever I have
conversation it's so hard for me to have
them because I love talking about one
thing and then if one thing I've talked
about revisor another thing I start
talking about the other thing I start
talking about something else and then
I'll go back to that first thing and
then jump back to that third thing cuz
my mind I'm kind of scatterbrained if
you guys haven't follow me you guys kind
of know this I don't know if that's good
or bad I feel like he adds to my
personality but I'm very random I do a
lot of run things that you I don't
understand
sometimes it disturbs me sometimes I
feel like maybe I should get checked out
I can't stay focused for too long but um
anywho I am yet
I think I'm pretty cool so back him -
I'm very random fact number three I like
to write poems I like writing period I'm
in high school I really enjoyed writing
essays what do you name but I loved
writing but specifically I love writing
poems because I used to be super emo I'm
still it's in my email unscaled like emo
emo I used to be a move like with like
five O's right now my emo were like two
O's so kind of out of control but
writing poems used to help me with that
when I used to be mad write a poem when
I see sad write a poem when I was just
pissed off write a poem I would write
about everything
my favorite poem that ever rose actually
about the earth during 11th grade I took
an environmental science class which I
feel like I should I feel like
environmental science should be taught
when you're younger because by the time
you learn about all the damage doing to
the planet I don't matter lecture guys
but how do you learn it's like you're
learning at like 17 where you're
essentially kind of set in your ways cuz
everyone's capable of changing but you
kind of been doing things that way for a
while it's really hard to change and you
know it's difficult to break habits and
so I definitely think that it would have
benefited me to learn more about
environmental science and I was younger
first is when I was 17 so anywho and I
did learn about it I was really just
moved by it I was so disturbed by what
we were doing to our planet as human
beings not saying I'm some freaking I
saved the planet I still do things that
aren't the best for our planet but it
made me just I was so just invested into
it so I wrote a poem about it and it was
so cool I don't have any more cuz I gave
it to my teacher because I want her to
have it but is it my favorite poem ever
and I said to say that cooler you write
a poem about anything it's like it's my
thing I like ready folks that's fact
number three
fact number four I like patients exhibit
a there's a train going by and I'm angry
about it it's done now but it did it
early on almost lost my mind I have no
patience you guys I just don't like when
I'm very sense of the sound as well I
don't know if it's another fact but I
just like if it's too much going on it's
too much sound if I'm not in control of
things I
get very uncomfortable I just I'm not a
very patient how to put it it's hard for
me to be settled you know I'm always
just all over the place I feel like I
feel like there's a bigger word for
everything I'm describing right now I'm
just calling patients so that's what I
like I like patient with people as well
it's trip I have patients with myeloma
dog cuz that's my money but what comes
to everything else I just be spasm kind
of and it takes a lot of me to have
self-control at times and I'm working on
it because me being an influence of
social media have to watch my say but to
an extent sometimes I don't want to only
because I feel like as influences we're
supposed to lead by example and the
example I'm trying to leave is to always
stand up for yourself and speak your
mind don't censor yourself um and so
it's kind of hard to do that though
without clowning people and drag people
cuz some of those people need a drag but
actually to say I like patients like
people on social media people coming for
me people don't look like that it takes
everything in me not to respond and not
everything deserves response but I
personally feel like okay like you can
ignore these people and if you keep
users of the people who are like being
negative they're negative towards
everyone they attack everyone and
somebody takes that one time for you to
check them put them in place for not do
it anymore so that's why I come in
that's what sometimes if you see if you
follow me on twitter you'll see any
dragon people because like okay you've
clearly have been doing this you clearly
think it's okay to attack random
strangers online so let me you know I
don't I won't say attack but I
definitely put me one of their places
and I do that because I like patience
cuz I have my patience I would ignore it
and I would just want to respond by the
kind of a hothead to an extent so I'm
wondering though I am 23 years old I'm
still very young just I'm doing YouTube
just kind of platform does not mean that
I got all together excited don't I have
a lot of different emotional issues that
I'm working on that front of fix and
like I said I just I'm working on it
I don't know what to call that fact but
that was number four
that number five I'm five three I'm
actually short every time I meet one of
my supporters in person what are that
first reactions oh my god you're so
small cuz they always expect me to be
target I am but me me I'm actually
really short and I have a pretty small
frame I'm small but I'm smart at the
same time so people are shocked by that
though I don't think I'm like five six
five seven I wish that would be cool
look the tall you are the more you eat
because I've been the food kind of like
when you're short all the food is like
you know you're condensed you know but
when you're tall it kind of spritz out
if I'm making sense at all so wish I was
taller you know if I was tire out eat
way more than I already do but I'm
trying to keep my frame so I can't go
too crazy baby okay so that's back in
five one five three and let's just find
one by the way people always Linda who's
taller I'm Alyssa five one short of me
and I every time I get opportunity to I
take pride mix I like being the taller
would fact number six
I almost didn't graduate high school so
high school is a freaking mess I've
always been very smart it wasn't like
the work but basically owls didn't pass
one because Spanish class and
essentially we were doing at the end of
the year project now I'm gonna group of
people who didn't want to do jack s word
and I like a lot of times when I would
do group work
it was always put on me to do all the
work and so and I always did it anyways
coming to pass but during this project I
like this is not cool so I straight left
our group I did I joined the Lissa's
group with someone else is so funny if
we could find the video of our Spanish
final do you guys would literally die
it's so funny it's so so so so funny
like we did a whole little skit we were
speaking Spanish and stuff and it's the
most funniest thing ever I could
I almost cried thinking about it so
funny but I joined her I was with the
same Spanish class so I joined her group
whatever and I passed that so I was cool
but then I almost failed algebra two and
was gonna keep me from graduating and
long story short I wasn't cool my
teacher he was some people fool ass but
that's the best I can put it here's the
last hole but tourists in the year I
realized okay you just kiss his ass if
you want to pass rhymes wrapper on the
wrapper fact number six joking but I was
like you have to kiss out so I kissed
ass and I passed that class and I
graduated but I almost did it cuz yeah
wait till last minute to kind of get my
stuff together so there's that fact
number six I essentially didn't graduate
eighth grade when I graduated my dick to
walk the stage was just so embarrassing
so listen did and so I think one twins
graduated one did it I wasn't even
allowed in the building where they have
the graduation because I was leave at I
was emo with six O's and I liked a lot
of stuff you guys during like middle
school and I was just so angry and
depressed I wasn't there be feeling like
sixth grade to my senior year had a lot
of emotional issues if I didn't have
that therapy who knows where the hell I
would be but I was it was crazy like I
was I was depressed a lot of self-harm a
lot of that if you guys let me go into
that in another video I will cuz I don't
mind talking about it cuz its best but
basically I kept me in trouble at school
I kept getting in like in-school
detention and twists in the year to come
in graduation I wasn't in class
attention and I got pissed off I don't
know why
Lilly don't know why I don't remember
and I threw this big heavy electric
sharpener and I threw it down the stairs
and when I threw it Simone's walking up
the stairs so I almost hit them and they
were so dramatic
oh my god good kilter but did I know but
basically they were like because of that
you're violent your thread and you can't
come to the graduate
so I didn't want the stage and yeah it
sucked it did but oh whoa
fact number seven I believe I hope about
seven if not it's cool the numbers give
me the screen anyways I dyed my hair
blonde wrong 15 and I understand to say
the best theory is why started we're
weaving extensions it's like dyed hair
blonde everyone my mom warned not to do
that and I was like no you know just
talk to my la blah you know teenager

and so I bleached my hair and at first
it was perfectly fine it was still
healthy still soft I was like cool like
you're wrong mom and then maybe like a
month or so later the belief start to
catch up to my hair and it just started
to fall not fall out not on it was
blowing up and it starts fall out and it
pretty much it pretty much tried to rub
in it was very very stringy and so I
dyed it black and that in help cuz
you're pretty much put a color on
damaged hair already this new diet is
not mean it's gonna fix it it's made
even more damaging so I remember I threw
a tantrum because I wanted this relief
from the Beast my store I don't know
what's called it was one of those like
you know Indian Remy type weaves and
littles the pack hair beautiful I store
if you're from hope and Evan abused my
store and I want that hair really bad is
$200 and that was a lot for me and I
didn't have it obviously because I
didn't have a job at the time and so I
was like mom please buy me the hair she
wouldn't do it I was like I can't
believe you're doing this me right now
which I'm talking about that in fact
memory but I was like I believe you're
doing this marry now and act like
grandma she was saying no so I threw a
whole tantrum I did some stupid stuff
and I got the hair that big and also
speaking on wish they would have bought
it for me because I like discipline
because I was so spoiled but I was
really like you guys my hair's falling
out I'm man brewing it's like the glue
in and that's what got me started cuz
like oh wow like I'm completely out of
here also and I had
hair that I never had before and it was
lit so I started doing wounds that we
had got a longer I'm like let me sew
this in let's see how this works so ends
and then I cut my hair I couldn't be
sones anymore and then I started making
wigs and that's how it happened all cuz
i bleached my hair when I was 15
fact number eight I was very spoiled
growing up and while I was a plus I
really enjoyed getting a lot of things
that I wanted I actually hated that
because now that I'm adult I lack
discipline because of it because I was
never really disciplined
my dad tried discipline me but without
getting too personal he wasn't in my
life to discipline me enough and when he
did try discipline me I'm like okay you
can't pick and choose when you're gonna
father either your duty or not I was
very outspoken us even though I was
younger and I preached my mom for that
time mom was never the type to shut us
up she let us be very vocal and
opinionated and she'd ever she never
belittle our thoughts because our age
you know what I mean and so I'm yeah
well my dad did you trying to simile it
didn't work so I'm just like dude like I
can't take you seriously when you go
ahead and claim your two daughters
sometimes you're wishy-washy didn't work
so long-term sir I wasn't disciplined um
I don't my mom she's fooling us best all
right but she just really wanted she
knew we went through a lot due to other
 whatever so she wants to make sure
that we had everything she just want to
make sure that we had a really great
life so essentially we got a pretty much
everything we wanted and that's why like
I did stuff like throw tantrums when I
wasn't in my way so like that I I'm not
not Tanja's a lot kicking the floor
going crazy all I did was just run some
so burn in the water and wasted his soap
because I thought yeah that's gonna
teach him I wasn't going to like that
I was never respected my mom when she
told us no we just found out a way to
get her to say yes we're very convincing
people which leads me to fact number 9 I
just want to be a lawyer because I
thought I was really grating my words I
was very argumentative but in a very
the type way and I thought hey I'd be
good at this and I was always told
growing up that I'll be a really real or
and I believed that so when I was in
college before I dropped out my major
was criminal justice cuz I didn't want
to go and be a lawyer uh but that's
cancelled so but yeah I want to be a
lawyer and um yeah maybe maybe one day
I'll go back to school to do it I have
no idea I definitely think that I could
do something in law and I think that
I'll be really good at that but then
again going back to me not having
patience I would have to definitely
learn that to be a lawyer because I
would pop up in court if someone says
the wrong thing so that that is that is
good again that doesn't work out but I
think that my stuff comes with growth
and experience although I'm not where I
want to be maturity wise that's the
statement I'm looking for automatics
everywhere I want to be I definitely
can't look back to like even last year
alone and see how much I've grown from
then so I'm cool with that as long as
I'm growing as long as I'm moving
forward not backwards you know even if
I'm not exact I want to be I'm getting
there I'm going there all right fact
number 10 I won high driving toss twenty
years old I got my license at twenty I'm
the best driver out of my sister's yes I
said it because they both felt their
freakin permit I don't know how they
thought the permit test but they felt
them like twice every one that happened
my guys come on let's all drive I don't
know High Pass me the bill um I I think
I almost missed a few I know I missed a
few on my driver's test like my actually
driving test but here's why I'm the best
driver in my family I try better my mom
- I have bars
my mom has bars Qi though but it's
because growing up oh this we fact
number eleven hmm growing up I played an
extensive amount of video games video
games that require me to drive rather
that was grand theft auto san andreas or
was this thing called a Gran Turismo
something I forgot was called but I
played a lot of games
criminy drive and although obviously
speaking of controllers different
steering wheel they have similar
functions and so when I got into the
cars are driving it's like it came
naturally how so used to doing racing
games and just driving games so I just
knew how to do it anything my mom said
that's what how I'm gonna drive because
I play like video games that goes factor
my 11 I grew up playing a lot of video
games I was very very very addictive
video games Hamill on PlayStation I love
video games I still do to this day the
only reason why I don't own place just
announced because I know if I had one I
would not film I would literally spend
my days playing video games I would stay
up until my eyes could literally not
stay opening more playing games like oh
I remember didn't one time I was playing
infamous fire I loved it oh my god the
games I used to play every single game
there was like it just makes me sad that
I can't go back to times why I didn't
have to make money and pay for it and I
can see my days on my ass playing games
and my mom had control of all of that
but I'm gonna do it now so we can't
always get what we want
but I love video game 5 number 12 I talk
a lot okay it is what it is I got to
talk too much not talk at all but this
is why I talk a lot I also listen I
think that when people say you talk a
lot they say in a bad way because 10
people would talk a lot they don't want
to listen I don't listen but awesome I
to talk just much an order listen let's
talk a lot and sometimes I get carried
away we're talking however I don't think
I'm boring so I don't think it's like
it's hard to listen to me talk if you're
interested I'm saying but I'm also very
animated with my talking as well I
simply like to talk it's just I don't
know one time in sixth grade we were out
of attention bad and I remember I kept
talking and they were like please shut
up
like literally and they're like we'll
pay you $11 I remember the lemon dollars
does not talk for 15 minutes
did I make it no I talked to like 10 I
couldn't do it but they're really like
he'll pay you to stop talking that's how
much I talk to you guys it's really bad
but hey it's Who I am so whatever fine
my third
I'm kind of psychic and it's crazy cuz
I'm not spell sidekick I'm a little
piece of paper where I wrote my little
facts I spell a psychic like psy k I
came like I did ask ernesto psychic I
just spelled it how it sounds but I
think I have some type of psychic powers
going on because I learn things in my
dreams you guys like I've learned about
vegan cheese your honor dreams I dream
about it
wake up investigate boom it's there I'm
like yo what's this I have senses and
I'm not just talking about intuition we
all got that I have other senses
that's like yo like somebody happened or
like yo like do this check this you know
the more I talk about the more my okay
maybe we're all psychic to our own
extent I just think that I'm a little
more psyche than others so I feel like
it was necessary to make that fact
because I'm
514 I'm very clumsy I have so many scars
and you would think that I've just been
getting just dragged through the mud no
I it's because me cuz I'll either
sprained my leg of something hit my leg
something bruised myself I'm so clumsy
it's not even funny I just
I've always been clumsy I've always been
I could drunk jump off swings I was a
kid I've always my rebel it's nothing to
me
it is Oaks I don't like scars bruises
but basically I'm hella clumsy I'm hella
reckless and it just is I don't know why
I got this from but it's part of who I
am
fact number 15 I used to love dancing
believe it or not I used to know how to
dance I don't know how to dance now
unless I'm my to shots handsy and even
then I might need another shot to cut I
give you going but I used to love
dancing when I was younger my mom my mom
has an African dance we were in a little
bit shaming that type of dance classes
dance program to everyone I call it I
love dance a lot I'm aware my cousins
paid me for dogs to dance to her for
this song I remember after get the $40 I
went I bought with hair barrettes and
shoe
I remember that it takes me that fiery
love dancing I don't know what made me
stop like dancing um I think I just
couldn't move with trends because I'm
not really a nice shaker I wish I was
because if I could shake my ass a little
bit more I would be going ham but it is
just snotted me just yet like I feel
like I have it in me legs like do you
want to come out right now
and if it does want to come out is it's
not there but it comes out when I drink
so I'm I miss dancing I want to get back
into that I just I don't know I used to
all let me dance there like I can
literally sure we all do this more or
less as certain songs I lived like come
with dance routines to each song like
I'm a hole dancer inside and just
waiting for it to come on the outside
and so um that's 15 bucks this video is
pretty Lindsay but hopefully with my
pretty fast excited got talked too much
if you guys like my videos like this and
let me know to be honest with you guys
cuz you guys know I always in I can't
this a video idea in order to
incorporate my sponsorship in a very
natural way
I love audible actually do use it so it
doesn't really feel sponsor too much
it's besides going over the key talking
points but I wanted to be very natural
and I thought that this will be great
way to do it I almost didn't make it to
toriel but what do I look talking about
a book app in to make tutorial that
doesn't make any sense
so I came with this idea and I had a lot
of fun with it because it's really fun
just telling you guys more about me you
guys need to get to know me more I think
it's cool and so if you guys want my
views like this let me know down below
