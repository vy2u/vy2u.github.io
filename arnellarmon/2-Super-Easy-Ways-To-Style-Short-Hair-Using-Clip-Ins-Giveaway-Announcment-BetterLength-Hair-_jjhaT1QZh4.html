assertive I just want to give away
because I'm looking to like listen until
the other day so I'm just like style
oh I love clipping now on the right in
front of me right here I went a little
bit further on a little towel and um my
hair I pulled from that up like an hour
ago so my head is kind of crazy but it
already have pop in it it just kind of
dry so I have a spray bottle once and
then I go wet my hair we passed in this
cookie here style do you have very very
easy style you go to see I don't know
how I defer I don't know you versus I'm
going to midweek favorite first and
you'll be easier just wait a little get
our your car get it though so the first
time I'm going to do in a simple fun now
I know it may be feeling foolish but
looks really cool because how to make
your butt look bigger did I know I had
very short because I'm going to toss
them thrown it out and buy steal my bun
and so here's the way how to use put
them to make your button looking up fool

up in Menlo Park Carol's Daughter for in

jealous off trove I love together you
guys like perfect combo so I'm going to
dress my hair up you guys can come
around here to the front that's what my
hair is white you guys my name is houses
might as well just friction ball up here
I'm not all of my favorite random really
blocked in a little like Oh started
going bald and I thought mmm believe all
- and I starting is left and my edges
was really popped out and I'm gonna have
evolved into wedges
I'm sure look I'm Alyssa cm I would ball
I would've ended but um I'm not all all
right tell me if this gel just to help
me Jim all right I need one first one
all right I'm afraid she's there juicy
with a little good fresh ginger what
kind of thick not too thin and so I just
like using a bigger scratchy but I'm
forward itself
can you set all right so because the
clip-ins don't touch my hair color
I just hair straight I have two
different one for look black army
doesn't matter if they don't work insane
to me and I'm just going to spray that
in my hair
because I you know my hair using Mexico
club internacional yet to get enhanced a
little bit but interview wipers off
elitism bother me it was so funny - it's
more gel and just you know make a little
more slick bullet drug a backpack curls
that don't once day decide once your gel
arm open enough they'll stay and this is
where our if you are always happy edges
of Elena you just do that in a
toothbrush and I'm going to swoop here
out and I'll just scoop it where simple
now I'm certain be crazier edges I
really just feel have to depends on the
style some styles will go a lot of edges
and so stop those so very dependent
alright so now I have a clip it so I'm
going to get a clip in with five little
click on it and start click the manage
and you can press it around and you can
more clip into add of course the bigger
your coupe will be and so I'm going to
to so I put that is doesn't matter too
loose to where my bus and when I'm good
a four piece one so far yeah I'm a poor
Pete one and then push it in there well
pushin where the other clicks isn't so
if you have to snap it on snap wrap that
around then it is another than with snap
could we wrap it you will get a beating
wings and I just wrapped around just
like that and can make it look a little
messy so it's more real pretty
I can pick it apart
actually I like the more Matthew looks
is better make sure
lick it and one more Joe
Matt and then add another key
just make sure clipping from go anywhere
and you make some more ties and more
secure like that and then I just pick at
it make it look perfect like so and I
push it never self do really easy
because like I don't sleep to follow and
not follow off okay the next morning up
items oh my hair so Louie all I do which
is come with my baby hairs away a little
bit validate I didn't touch this part at
all it's so convenient um if you don't
like doing your hair she'll feel like it
and it's perfect if you're the crops of
growing your hair out and your hair is
just long enough to wrap in a ponytail
and even if on you are ear that come
your hair stick up like I did so keep
this pick up and I mean I pull in and
out and so on from for Joe my Harry now
it doesn't matter stop with you but you
can just didn't spray got a brief space
very little belt and use wrap your hair
ignite and it's fifty it's like molded a
male group at all alright the best time
of the one now it's to number two
because I wanted to be exact for you
alright so then take that out to come
back very easily little fall out on its
own
so that's pretty cool cuz easy to take
out but once it's in there it will stay
trust me and let's let's fighting
there's like so many cool Adele but
you're not you're good now times in my
favorite style which is um my little
which is my little bump now on my last
video I have a bug by the hair down I
actually like it more with just button
and go hair down because Colonel it
looks better
from a part of the middle now my last
video a common thing that part with a
perfect don't even kinda fit a little
Rubik I'm sorry really Disney crap up
party to be honest and not tell me at
all I really don't give a like it
is a very perfect nothing healthy
perfect okay if I had a little to sing
my part I clearly see doubt my own eyes
include a lobotomy um I wanted to clap
my heart if I really want to like a moon
spit over guitar and make sure my first
perfect but I just don't answer the
comes up it's gonna be to me if the
South keeps himself cute and I need
these perfect all the time
I literally don't it doesn't bother me
whatsoever like oh I want to cart all on
one and it really will bother me that
even a mattress part by tricking and
because I mean the thousand exceedingly
instead American that in don't care if
it's not perfect it doesn't bother me so
this combination value I don't really
need room comments like I don't know I
spoke away people I think inside the
comments that bottom easily see it is
rude you know I mean like I have one
comment saying if Keith they said pretty
much like they made a comment like
crooked heart wait what the need your
kind of like pretty much like it wasn't
me what am I trying to ask me what girls
but grow it so brood as you said
infadoos the harder for the self cute
Vancouver alright time to my buns leave
these would make one is pretty dismal
they're finding board all you do is make
a part right in the middle and then you
start breaking one side and if you want
we come here'd our gel it's got really
interfering but if you're having a hard
on it and you're just under the saddle
it will kind of get in this vise when
you run the quick clip out the way or
you don't
rushing here into this little one and so
I'm just going to get grab gel and go
just always really slick and sleek and
I'm just going to just slowly bring that
into a little unli and you control how
higher go with it I print left a little
high I thought it was a little cuter but
as always our preference I mean we do
cube you and I'm doing what I do and so
waiting to go quickly
there's no pairs left cooperative come
back and then for this part that part
excuse me his hotel
all right here host is my job now should
you lay your Brady Haran do you want to
do those now I do a double crunching
this to come in no to the back some of
y'all week the first time I like crunchy
and so also scratchy and I'll brush it
up and I'm up with another one
okay so now I'm going to the property
I'm going to get our store by weight
then you're back to this is an order for
one okay now that I did I wanted to be
kind of big quickly just because the
coaches present that you can make your
little buddies and your baby off them I
think it turns on you because it's like
super big bubble economy so I will be
crazy but like tiny buns won't look at
me from my hips on the bigger side so it
all stays on what she wants and then you
want to look wrap around try to pop the
tree being less gray but anyways on the
right around in this tactical bug
wrecker me and this at the bottom me I
said looks really cute I'm going to cut
with a little bit sort of a potential
more like accidental I feel like it's
like this looks super cute little more
natural oh I forgot my keys
go do I love means that one that in my
hair and don't is it L is that all other
views to do high with me if I still want
to come out like great so cute oh so
real you know like letting me down at
all

so this is where really cute um if you
kids the first time I freaking did it
okay and then I'm going to live my River
through some of the most and then you
have light hair like me spray or Mitaka
x-ray because my hair kind of led now to
the gels will look fine but I'll come
various like one day that I sprayed oh I
thought I did and then blew everything
on my hair is drying out my corner you
met my buzz go I'm not risking at the
truck
this always helps me look less bold if
you hear it fit up what I would you
brush it through my hair so kind of see
