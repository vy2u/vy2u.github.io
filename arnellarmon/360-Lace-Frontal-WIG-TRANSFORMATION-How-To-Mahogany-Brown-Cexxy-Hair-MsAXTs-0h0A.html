you're new welcome today's me just wants
to be on how I customized this way from
sexy hair they sent me this way became
like a very natural like body wave state
it was 1b and I'm psyched to bleach it
dyed this really nice and mahogany brown
color I've never done it before
and typically I never do brown hair
colors if you guys have noticed that my
channel probably ever done like Brown
once however this level look the best
cause ever done I don't know what makes
it so nice I don't know why I like it so
much I think it's because it looks very
natural but different the same time
because I don't see too many people with
this hair color it's a very nice it kind
of doesn't like wood or something I
don't know I can't explain it but I
realized this color and I thought you
guys liked it too and so I feel this way
three guys it's gonna be super duper
simple I show myself bleaching the hair
dye the hair and then I show myself
cutting the hair because this wig I want
to say I was like 20 or 22 inches
however because usually with wigs that
are kind of long they get thinner at the
ends and I feel like that makes it more
Wiggy and so it also contacts within the
body I feel like one hair when you cut
it or at least like clip it ends off it
gives a camera body and so I cut maybe
like 2 or 3 inches from this wig and I
like this much more
I like shorter lengths I think it looks
more natural and so I show myself bleach
dye and cut this hair and so if you like
to see me do that they can see to watch
this video if you find helpful if you
enjoyed give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
so this fella we came to me it was
pretty as it is but um you guys know I
like to swish things up oh man I did
such a good job on this wig too after
editing this video I realized how great
the wig look so now I'm extra excited to
film this voiceover so here I am you
know just kind of playing with the hair
showing you guys you know how it feels I
have a heater on so if you see the one
the hair blowing it's because of that
but um here's a bleach of me using its
ion color brilliance my favorite bleach
you can get it from Sally's and I mix
that with the same developer also from
ion and use 40 valium uqs 30 but at 40
cuz it gets the job done quicker and you
need a bowl and you're gonna mix that
mixture up and then you're just gonna
apply the bleach and I did this kind of
sloppily I'll show myself doing like
half because
everything goes necessary show myself
doing the whole wig because I'm
literally just rubbing the bleach in it
but um yeah I just put the bleach in and
I brush it and I just made sure I
literally covered like every single
strand well I try to come every single
strand I miss like maybe like two little
pieces I didn't realize I had until I
washed it but I need a pretty cool job
so I'm just gonna apply that bleach that
I'll check back in once I rinse it out
so I left the bleach sit rinsed it out
it was pretty oranjee it didn't lift to
a blonde but that totally worked out for
it I was doing anyways and so yeah the
time we use I'm used to smoke a hair dye
by a door I'm also going to use this
rich eggplant by a door and I'll explain
that in a second and then I'm going to
use these as a Beijing this one is I
believe it's meat medium warm brown and
then I have another one that is medium
cherry brown and so I'm gonna put them
on their little bowls and the reason why
I'm adding purple is because because
when I bleached the hair it was a little
orange e I add the purple it's kind of
like help tone the orange enos the
brassiness down and so since purple
tones out you know brassiness i just add
a little bit of purple to each of the
dyes and i mean look it i don't know if
it made a difference or not because I
didn't do this without adding the purple
but I'm just go ahead and say at the
purple because that's what I did and so
if you want the color I got then just
follow those steps and then I supplied
the color like and I really took my time
with this made sure you know I covered
every single strand
I put the lighter color the medium I
think was a medium cherry Brown at the
bottom and then I put the mocha color on
the top so kind of create the Cambria
effect although in the Sun the top looks
lighter than the bottom I don't know I
really don't know but whatever I did
worked and it looked really great so I'm
just gonna ply did I die I'm only gonna
show myself a planner that I just did
this section because right at the
frontal area it took way longer because
I tried to you know make sure I didn't
you know dive in knots or anything and
so I'm gonna show myself do this section
and then I'll be back to style it
and so I let the dice it and I'm gonna
show myself sing down I usually kind of
like cut this part out whenever I like I
just press the record button by one you
guys to see the flow of the hair this
hair is so freaking Mike this colors
nice I like everything was perfect about
this wig now all I'm gonna do is just
cut off the ends because I feel like the
ends it was kind of like weighing the
hair down and I want the hair to have
more body and also like the ends got a
little thinner like I mentioned the
beginning video and so I just want you
know clip those I didn't cut it too
short but I feel like this made the wig
look more natural it's like more like a
believable length on me and so I didn't
do the best cut job to be honest but if
that's besides the point this is not a
cutting hair tutorial so it doesn't
matter but just showing you guys how I
do it and then I kind of like cut a
little bit of a layer type thing going
on in the front just so it just frames
my face better and I bumped that inwards
and that was pretty much all I did for
this wig so this is honestly probably
one of the easiest was ever done like in
regards to color style and all that so
if you want to purchase this wig and do
exactly what in this video the links
