just got done filming a video on how to
style your bub in a couple different
ways you know Bob's a very cute and I
really like them but they can't get
boring if you keep it in one style so I
just showed you guys simple styles that
literally anyone can do um I like to
keep my videos simple so I want openness
hair really fast because I think a lot
of question about it I weren't in my
last video and this clip right here um
and a lot more like oh but hair is that
almost very silky looks very nice this
best same hair I just cut into a bob
because I paint my style look like every
other day this lipstick alia valve me
with depression have read because
lipstick alleys evil for me people and
one of the things they said because
you're just like with us what is our now
almost to do with their lives and then
under my section they go all I know does
is hang out with her boyfriend complain
and change her hair really bad and we
also just me and my freelance ghost oh
yeah she claims to freelance artists she
never gets gigs is like I don't post all
my clients I just don't
I'll have hell of them there's at least
like 30 people that did makeup on that
you have it post excite this one not
even want to be posted in to I just
don't wanna post everybody but it's
hella funny but the whole thing by me
changing my hair still in a week well
it's not accurate I shave my hair of you
half a week thank you very much so yeah
baby weighs about this hair it's from
oMG her hair calm now that sounds
similar to this last coming network with
called oMG Queen here calm this company
rejecting me so many times if I'm
Instagram email I'm not like eldest five
dm's for emails cuz I want to working
really bad but I was trying to stay away
from that because I feel like their name
is so similar to another hair coming I
work with anyone confuse people but then
I was like you know what I'll just give
them a shot but happy digs are here
really nice but in on Sam sorry I
learned that a lot of your companies
their hair is really similar honestly
because honestly because they kind of
get it from the same vendors when I'm
learning and so what I like to pay
attention to is the customer service for
the most part because customer service
is everything I don't care how great a
product is or the
our service sucks I'm not working with
the company I do my research also I also
take note of how they communicate with
me so they take if a company there's
been a lot of companies that's I could
have potentially worked with but if they
took too long to respond to me I'm like
no I'm not gonna work with you because I
need to take too long to respond to me
someone who's gonna help your brand to
help your business what makes you well
women sitting here you're you know
respond hella fast to the customer you
may take long to respond them to and I
don't wanna my fans come to me like hey
you know I brought here for this company
that you refer and naathan every client
to me like no no I just I don't work
companies like that but they responded
back like faster than me which is like a
big deal you know cuz I'm mom and I be
texting away and so okay I work with
them you know test out their hair and I
really like it and you guys me like a -
cuz I got a lot of comments on on in my
last video seen it look really nice and
silky which it is now I did Felicia's
hair twice when I review hair I do like
to bleach it to see the okay like this
 may be nice when you first get it
but you have to bleach and diet to see
that hey can I had this for a long time
is it worth the money and so I believed
here twice I kind of cut off all the
ends that I did bleach it still I
believe the whole thing but it was
lighter at the ends I dyed this part to
a brown to make it like ombre effect
but when I did leech I didn't have to
deep condition it I literally just
bleached it condition shampooed it and
it bounced right back it does not shed
it has a shed at all honestly yeah wait
yeah it has a at all shocked me I
just picked that yeah wow I'm really
just peeping this that it has a shed
usually when you bleach hair um it sheds
and it tangles a lot let you know when
you condition it something about beliefs
just messes up hair so this hair has a
shed or tangled at all it's giving me no
problems so that's my review on it I
really like the hair I think it has
something really nice natural luster to
it I you know you guys see has a lot of
body even before I cut my hair it had a
lot of body which showed him at the
video I just show with you guys so that
is my take on this hair um I'll leave
the company's information below in the
description box if you guys want to
purchase and the next wing I'm gonna
make you guys a fommy and snap you
racing the hair I can't wait to make the
wig so stay tuned for that hope you guys
enjoyed this video on my little quick
SuperDuper eats tiles on Bob's and I'll
see you guys in the next video our
Styles give me the most basic all I'm
doing is taking a flattering and bumping
my hair inwards just to make my hair
look more bob like I only included this
part because a lot of people gave me
comments on this specific bob style and
so I figure maybe they want to see how I
got it it's very simple I just got a
flatter and I just bumped my hair
inwards for this next style I'm taking
the same flatter and I'm just gonna be
just curling random pieces and in no
particular direction I'm trying to get a
wild curl look just very carefree curls
they're not really going in any
particular direction I kind is curled in
different directions curled downwards
curled away from my head just different
curls and just grab them random pieces
you
you
I'm done curly pieces this is style I
get just a very like I like wild
carefree the curls aren't too defined
which I like say I'm pretty simple and
so the lighting did change in this clip
and that's because after I curled my
last style I did take like an hour break
because I don't like curling my hair too
close together because I could burn the
hair if it's too much heat processing
going on so that's what the lighting
change but here I am doing more curls
and the curls I'm making them go
outwards more like a Farrah Fawcett type
of style so that was inspiration for
this style
you
the spice up this style and make it even
more cute I'm gonna add a headband I got
this habit from forever21 a while ago
and I never wear it
but her somebody's gonna click to my
head like I feel like the way that curls
is up in the front it look really cute
the headband so I put the headband on I
thought it'd look very very cute I'm
just adjusting the pieces and you know
determining how much hair I want out in
the back and in the front yeah I really
like this style it's a prime my favorite
cuz I just thought it'd look very cute I
don't know I felt like a gardener okay
so I took a break and strain the hair
and now I'm going to do another style
this hair is very flexible it was very
easy to get it to straighten after I had
already curled it so yeah I was really
pay attention to all that while doing
this video just to add more to my review
because you know everyone wants hair
that's easy to style easy to manage
that's very flexible so that's what I
learned about this hair as I was doing
this tutorial Here I am I'm just taking
a small wand curl you're gonna want to
find the smallest one car you have
because it's too thick the hair at this
length they won't grip around the wand
so anyone that's pretty skinny so that
you're able to curl the full piece of
hair and I'm just making kind of like
messy Beach ways as I was going for and
I actually like this style to you
you
yeah tell me what you guys think about
this bead I made it last night I didn't
really know what I was going for I found
out something pretty chill um I don't
know if I'm an expert I'm making pop
beats just yet but I try to make a beat
that you know I would listen to and I
hope you guys enjoying it it's just very
hard finding YouTube music because
everything's copyrighted you know I
don't it sued so yeah I'm trying to go
back to make my own beats I just hope
that can make these so you guys actually
like and enjoy listen too so let me know
what you think this is the final style I
really like the style have a lot of body
just very fun I like these carefree kind
of styles they're just fun they can be
messy they don't look perfect say if you
