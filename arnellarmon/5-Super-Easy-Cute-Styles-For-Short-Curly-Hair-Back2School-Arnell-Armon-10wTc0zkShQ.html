today video did not go as planned but I
spent like hours filming it's all going
to post anyways now oh my god yet
probably having short curly hair it's
frickin shambles because I pretty much
once do a video what is he doing that I
wanted to do a video pretty much showing
like easy back-to-school hairstyles with
short curly hair but thing is my hair is
a very awkward length it's like at a
length worth like you're almost long
enough to look kind of cool but you're
still a little short to like rock it too
short that it inserts at all and so in
this video I'm just in shooting at the
styles I came up with or try to come up
with some of them are not well I mean to
me they're cute but to me I kind of like
them you may not like them which maybe
cause you dislike this video if you do
at least explain to me why you don't
like the style I mean I do what I could
with my hair my hair I'm growing out on
game longer its longer runs straight of
course you know shrinkage but yeah it's
a awkward length where it's kind of hard
styling it so this Alexa I came up with
this is like what the video and that's
and I like this style um you know I
think it looks pretty cool I could have
did a little more neater I just I didn't
wanna put too much product in my hair
gone for two months jail so I though
pick up
I was just kind of like this brighten it
up I think if I did this style with more
than here I look cuter it's a little
curly Mohawk I think that's kind of
decent however the other styles are very
cute but if you watch this video anyways
you do enjoy it or if you find the style
that you know you may just be to work
with it maybe there's a little longer
leash or give it thumbs up and subscribe
now before I took this video I will say
the process used in my hair I don't have
a bottle with me about answering the
screen it is Carol's Daughter
form1 combing creme i pretty much
prepare my hair before this weekend
my hair happens to all that dry when
it's wet is really doesn't have much
body at all as you can see like it just
gets heavier and a sprocket my hair gets
wake up very easily because my hair is
on the thinner side and so I prep my
hair before I just assume it you guys
may wanna know what I use I'm used the
carousel for my comb and cream and I put
it in right after I got the shower on
like super wet hair guys let the air dry
and that's how I got my curls to be how
they were that began its video but um
yeah sensing that information cuz I know
oh you asked that but I'll let you guys
know watch this video I kind of struggle
but you know it wasn't right here some
of you guys may find this video helpful
and if you do that's all that matters so
I'll let you post the video and I'll see
you guys later
alright so here's my hair pretty much
fully dried after putting the Carol's
Daughter form runkelman cream in it it's
really nice you guys it makes my curls
very defined
I'm learning that my curls dry bare when
I just let him air dry versus using a
diffuser um so yeah anyways here aimed
as part of my hair try figure out the
first I'm gonna do the first time I end
up doing I just did two little space
buns in the front I know that's pretty
basic however I mean I don't got a lot
to work with so I could have to just
figure out something but I didn't learn
when I put my hair in ponytails it kind
of stretches it out more which I thought
was pretty cool I think they'll come in
handy in a future hairstyle and so um I
just put two little pointers on the
front and then I wrapped it around and
put a little band on it and there you
have it you have space buns and then I
like laid my eight then I laid my edges
a little bit sorry you guys on that
sometimes I talk too fast or I stumble
on my words because I'll be thinking of
so much at once it's hard to get it all
out bear with me okay I just get really
excited about things anyways um so yeah
that was a first style just trying to
fluff out my um ends to make my hair
look longer than whatever really is and
here's first I am got that done now time
for a second style which what I do this
time I honestly don't remember you guys
I was literally doing random stuff by
the way I have like little like me
they're not scars I've eczema in my arms
if you're wondering what that is like
you got to see my armpits from here and
there don't worry just eczema oh this is
Todd did I do
twisties going backwards I didn't want
to braid because I'm lazy so I do look
little twisties and I put like a rubber
band and I just kind of like pulled my
hair away from my face I think this
makes me look a little more mature what
I have like curly bangs it makes her
look younger and so um yeah I just twist
them away from my face and that was the
style I was laughing myself cause like
dude like these are you were that cute
but I mean any of this video I feel like
my styles are cuter than what I thought
they were um while I was filming is
because I'm filming this I was like yeah
these really suck but now that I'm
anything I'm okay they don't look too
bad
all right so I took those down my hair
color is so freakin cool I never real
side cool didn't so I'm editing these
videos I'm like oh cool
my hair isn't dyed by the way I chopped
off all the hair that I had that was
diet or processed this all my natural
hair just random colors and sorry about
those little linty things I have in
there for my towel I know it may bother
some people could bother me anyway it's
here I'm trying to figure out what to do
next
and then I decide to wet my hair a
little more because it was kind of
drawing down from touching it so much
and then I was gonna do this thing where
I clipped my hair in the back and let my
bangs be in the front and I did this
style when I was in LA and actually post
on Instagram and I really liked it it's
super simple super easy and it kind of
shows your limb that leaves most your
hair out and it just looks kind of like
super 80s but I like it and I mean
hopefully you like it too so yeah that's
styl numero oh god how do this 3 anyways
number 4 now I decided to kind of we're
not kind of I put it my hair in like a
ponytail because I thought it would
create more body and um yeah I just
decide to do that don't know what
inspired this I just want to see what I
look like and I mean it I think it
looked pretty cool it's very similar to
the last hairstyle I had but with this
one I only had two ponytails and it was
mainly kind of focused towards the top
to corner create like a bigger bun and
in my last style I put 3 ponytails to
kind of create a mohawk effect so that's
the difference between that so here I'm
just putting bobby pins in there and
just trying to like make it kind of more
towards the top and then I'm gonna slick
my edges a little bit to make it look
more neat and um yeah gonna show the
back a little bit so it's more like a
it's like a big ponytail this to make my
bun with bigger
now this last hairstyle it's honestly
kind of the same thing but like I said
it's 3 ponytails step 2 so it makes it
look more like a mohawk type of feel
going on if that makes sense
so at first I was under so in the middle
part and then I was gonna do something
with like a little ponytail in the
middle of my head you guys will see me
do that right now but I thought oh my
god looks terrible dude so I'm yeah end
up changing it up I was just trying
something different like I said that my
hair is like very awkward Lin but I saw
this girl do this hairstyle on Twitter
recently that I'm told to try I went on
I bought this stuff for it and if I
achieve it
I'll fry do a video on it not so much of
a tutorial but just showing how I do it
on shorter hair cuz her hair's longer
I wish I could find her freakin
Instagram before I do the video I have
to find her Instagram to give her credit
but it's super cute yeah anyways I'm
just into the style leave my little
bangs out and I'm just create my little
pony tails
I thought the style of cool actually
wore for the rest of the day and I
thought it looked pretty cool so here
I'm just putting a little bit of the
diva curl ultra defining gel in my hair
because my hair was drying out and I'm
by adding more water to it I feel like I
was diluting the product that I had in
it so I just add a little more product
and I'm yeah I'm good yeah I'm done
talking cuz I cannot explain what I'm
gonna do and so I'll see you guys at the
end of this video
all right so you've reached in this
video you've seen me struggle I think I
love forgot having Harris all I did I
honestly was just trying to try them two
different things
part of the reason why I wear wigs lives
I really do not like dill my natural
hair this smells wood growing on me I
think it's really cute and I don't like
my own hair I've done dealing with it
because the length exact right now is
super awkward so it's hard to style it
so in this video I was just trying to
pin style it really was a plan I was
shocked to think what would look good
but I don't know many styles I hopefully
like maybe I could sit down and really
think about it and come up with styles
and do another video like a review but I
like to stop man think this final style
and it was pretty nice and if you made
this whole video thank you for watching
the whole entire thing if and you made
this entire video and you know at least
like one of the styles comment down
below which one answered in this video a
thumbs up
I've tried to be more natural hair
videos diagnosed you as like bills I
know anyone's not into the whole wake
and weave thing although I do think that
wait don't leave they're amazing I mean
you guys see my hair I haven't touched
it cuz I've been strictly wearing wigs
so yeah my sugar bear vitamins
of course they helped it's like I
haven't touched my hair at all so that
definitely helped but if I didn't have
wigs
I would be touching my hair so
definitely look into try wigs if you
want to grow your hair out or if you
just don't want to like mess with your
hair at all wigs are awesome I think a
lot of good videos I'm gonna be making
more week videos that are more
informative for people who are beginners
at this I would totally recommend them
but I want comes videos short I don't be
too long if you enjoyed it please leave
a thumbs up please subscribe and I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
