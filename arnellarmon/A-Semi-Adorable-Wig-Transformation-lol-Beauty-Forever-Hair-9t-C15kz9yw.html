you're new welcome today's video is
going to just be me essentially
butchering this wig I made now I like
this style I feel like one sec yeah I
new look you ready jacket I like this I
also want a little photo shoot with this
I see how that's with a beanie real
quick I try to figure out how I want to
wear this hair I actually like this
color you know like I like the color and
I like the style believe it or not I'm
sure I figure you know the key way to
wear it anyway some fix my hair um this
videos essentially me just cutting this
wig you know trying to figure out I
don't know just be bit something
different I never do bangs and the
reason to babes I suck I look kind of
awkward with them but I still got a key
right now like I hello like this like I
like my vibe and I will leave the house
like this and that's as lonely as I pose
in this video now this hairs from you
forever hair if you watched my video on
my favorite products last year they
would've come as I mentioned I love what
like this dial actually look kind of
adorable
anyways sorry the reason I'm freaking
out is because I filmed this process of
the video like two days ago and when I
filmed those late nights are gonna have
makeup on and so the wake looks cool by
was like oh like I don't know them alike
or not and so I was telling myself you
know it will probably better once you do
your makeup and I'm so happy it does so
I'm gonna do my makeup you know I got my
earrings on I feel like it looks much
better and more put together cuz I was
kind of like okay like I make his leg I
spent all this time the color love this
color
and so I was like Damon I'm gonna make
this and I probably be to wear cuz I
don't know how to the look but now I
come on makeup on and you look Zoop even
I'm like kind of excited if you guys can
I tell so anyways I'm just here computer
forever here they send me four bundles a
tie front old these Sydney the buttons
like 26 inches is hair it's very long
when I first got it however I don't know
the thing is at this point I don't even
ask for long bundles I'm living until
the companies just send me what
because I get so much hair my eye we
want to pick just hit me surprise me so
they send me super garden bundles and I
end up cutting it because I just felt
like I don't know when I got this wig I
assumed I almost knew I was gonna do
bangs with it oh no when I got this one
who I made the wig I assume doesn't do
bangs with it only because the frontal
it's pretty big but I couldn't cut it so
my cut into a middle part I'll explain
it more in the video and so I have a
feeling I was gonna do Bane's with this
and so that's what I'm doing and I just
I didn't think that the bang look what
super long like 26 inch bundles we will
look cool so that's why you know I'm
gonna cutting it but um this might look
I don't why I'm getting like I I'm
getting a super vibe but I can't
pinpoint which why I'm getting if you
know what I'm talking about let me know
like I look like someone right now
and I can't like pinpoint it and it's
kind of bothering me so let me know what
you do you think I look like and I'll
let you like watch me you know cut this
wig do all that kind of stuff with it
what I used to dye this wig I'll leave
that down below
I just blew any bleach to tone this hair
if you want a tutorial on this color let
me know I just didn't film that process
kind and that's like I already did a
video similar to that however you like
this color I'm just let me know and I'm
yeah it is ammonia so if you like this
video if you find it entertaining if you
like this style and give this video a
thumbs up and please subscribe and I'll
see you guys later
okay so first I'm going to put some got
to PE glue just in my hair kinda like
lay it down
I mean it was already kind of late but I
like using this stuff every time I do my
wigs now so I put some got to be glue
and brushed it back then I'm gonna put a
stun cap on so I did fill myself
bleaching this wig however it's so
simple but I mean if you guys want to
see how I got this color let me know but
I feel like I've done a girl like this
before but like I said I'll totally do
it over I made this wig the color came
out so nice I think I did a really good
color job on this wig however the reason
why I struggled with this wig and I end
up cutting bangs which is something I
never do is because the frontal how I
make the wig I made the wig too big and
so I wanted to do a middle part but if I
wanted a middle part I would've had to
cut off the lace in the front because
the front the wig was so big I would
have to cut remove some
but I remove lace and that the part in
my frontal would be super short and it
wouldn't look natural a lot goes into
this so I I just I didn't know what to
do I was kind of getting frustrating
because I didn't want to do a side part
the middle part was looking kind of
weird so I decided to cut the hair
because I thought it was a little too
long for me and I have so many long wigs
I don't need them so I cut the hair and
I think I liked the shorter style much
more than like the long style
I thought the longer hairstyles it's
just for maintenance and you guys know I
was cutting hair don't get mad at me I
was good comments like whenever I like
cut long hair people get mad but like
don't forget that like I guess until I
have hair so it's totally okay I didn't
do the best cut job but I cut it nicely
enough to where you can't tell that it
looks kind of like uneven in my opinion
so now I'm just bumping the hair
whenever I could hair kind of bump it so
you can't really tell where I messed up
and I mean it looks much better just
kind of like you know perfecting and
whatnot and I was just trying to figure
out what I was gonna do ahead go on in
middle part but like I said the front
tool is just not even the front so I
won't blame the frontal saw the frontal
spot it's how I made the wig I thought I
can't explain it I just I put the front
till too far up if that makes any sense
at all if you make wigs like I moved it
too far up on my dome cap so the wig
looks a little too loose so here I am I
was trying to like straighten the hair
backward so it wasn't falling to my face
my middle part would look right however
that still didn't work you just see one
second it just it wasn't looking how I
wanted to look I've done middle part wig
before and it just it wasn't looking
bright and I was a guinea man I was kind
of rushed you don't wanted this week to
come together faster if I would have
worked on this longer I cleaved it the
middle part however I was like nope so
first when I was told to do a middle
part I tweezed the part a little bit
just to make it look more natural
so after needed that I realize how light
my part was so trap powder to it to make
a darker but I made a little too dark
until I was getting really mad at this
point I was like what the heck's going
on and something my heart was just
telling me to do bangs I don't know why
like I don't know just this whole time I
kind knew I want to bang so I just did
it but here's what went wrong the bangs
looked okay you know but I realized well
I knew this was gonna happen before I
cut it I cut off all the parts that I
had bleached so I have black bangs and
light brownish blonde hair and so I was
like oh my god now I can either wear
this wig like this and look a mess or
you know go and bleach the bank so I
went and bleach my bangs so I made my
bleach mixture just would be WT bleach
like the for a bomb developer and you
know I put that all through the bangs
and then after I bleach that stone it
because I toned the rest of the hair and
I used 0:50 violet by Wella it'll be
down below so I had to tone the bangs
after that it was just really annoying
it was super annoying so bleached tone
the bangs then the wig looks much better
and um this the finished look I actually
like this I know you can't really tell
how nice it looks without makeup Dumbo
makeup done and like you know a little
styling this is gonna be really nice so
this is the video I'm just perfecting
the bangs you know just doing what I do
make it look you know more perfect I
contemplated cutting it shorter like so
it'll be a short bob I didn't wanna cut
this here anymore and then here's the
back I think I did a super nice dye job
that's the least I did and this hair is
so nice so if you enjoyed this video if
you find it helpful please give a thumbs
up please subscribe and I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
