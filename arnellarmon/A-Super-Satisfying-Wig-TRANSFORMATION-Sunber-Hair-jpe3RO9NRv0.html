you're new welcome so today's video is
going to be a super kind of satisfying
way transformation I feel like I'm super
satisfied with the way I made this wave
look
it was awesome very easy it was a plan
today's video I was going to do a how to
lay your wig using only elastic band no
glue no got to be no tape nothing just
an elastic band because I searched
videos like that before I couldn't find
one so I was gonna make one but instead
I ended up doing this I think it's
beautiful I love the stalks and it
complements me and my thanks so well I
love this wig I don't want to give it
away I using a common per diems aspect
which would no get away I'm not going
away to swim like I'm gonna wear it
again
and so this hair some sub bear hair I'm
gonna wrap this up for my camera sign
they send me three bundles on a frontal
now because I made this wood I can't
give a really in-depth review however I
will say pros and cons I notice cons are
that the bundles level of thin towards
the end they had a different smell to
them it wasn't my favorite smell I can't
pinpoint why the vinyl smell like that
but I didn't like it
pros are the buddies are very soft very
silky I might die these as natural hair
colors really nice and the luster on
this hair is really nice and also the
number one Pro is that the frontal I
don't want those pre plucked or what but
I'd have to pluck it at all I do
depletion eyes it looks look beautiful
it it's like it already had baby hairs
on it so I did will swoop those it just
made my life and my job so much easier
because the number one thing I hate
about frontals like from any company and
when they're super dense it has to do a
lot of work so I'm lazy and I don't
wanna do all that so they're frontals a
breeze I totally recommend their front
tool if I recommend that you guys get
anything get the frontal because I front
tool is like one of the best ones I work
with so far and so I'm I think that
that's perfect off to say if you want to
see how I transform this wig just
continue on this video I'm if yours is
coming before you had different
experience or a good experience about
one leave that coming
hello just so if anyone's watching this
video they want to push this hair they
have another opinion up in mind and um
yeah if you enjoyed this video thumbs up
subscribe all that good stuff and I'll
see you guys later
alright so I already made the wig so
first thing I'm gonna do is put it
elastic band on it so that way it fits
on my head really snugly so you measure
elastic band from ear to ear and you put
on one ear then you stretch it super
tight put in the other ear and I like to
do is after I stretch it like as ties it
and go I loosen it a little bit just to
give myself a little more room cuz I
don't like it'd be too tight it's super
uncomfortable that way and so like I
give myself an extra like half or maybe
a whole inch and then I cut it and then
I'm ready to sew so I thread my needle
you know just get a needle and you put
the thread through it I don't know
whenever I don't show this part people
get mad but it's like super easy then
you tie it into the knot you cut the
excess string off and you're ready to
sew sew this all the way it looks like I
want to show you guys because the front
looks so nice you guys I promise you I
didn't customize this at all like uh
this front tool is really nice man I'm
trying to get another one it's so nice
like I'm a hella hype it cuz I really
like it a lot so I like this so my last
advance on my lap so I turned my camera
downward so you have to see what I do
because this is the best and easiest way
to do it you just put on your lap and
then you need to place the elastic band
where it's gonna go and then you just
start to sew I wish I can explain the
way you're supposed to lay the elastic
band because there's there's a certain
way to do it to wear lays really flat on
your head I just can't explain it it's a
trip because back when I first start
making wigs I used to watch these videos
on how to do an elastic band and I never
understood it you don't I mean like no
one could ever really explain how you do
it and doing a video like this kind of
makes me understand why it's kind of
hard like you can't say horizontal but
you can't say vertical because it's like
it's weird the angle you can't really
show that angle of the elastic band but
I do know there's a certain way to do it
because I have sewed it like other ways
before and it is busily flat at all so
um I'm really excited about that I wish
I could explain I guess you could watch
the video and like you know try to
follow exactly what I'm doing but it's
pretty easy I feel could get the hang of
it and even if you like so at the wrong
direction so easy just cut
sorry though I've done that multiple
time so if you do mess up don't get
discouraged you can easily cut it off
and I just resell it
all right so you slowly last a band now
you're ready to go so I was going wig
cap however the wig cap as we title my
head so I decide to take it off and I
still had some gel in my hair so I'm
going to comb out my natural baby hairs
because I want them to be out in this
wig you don't have to do that but that's
I'm doing I'm gonna take my yellow
bottom got to be glue if you see me
chewing it smells eat goldfish cuz how
so hungry man I filmed literally all day
to day I film like four videos in a row
it's trimmed really productive anyways
here I am just you know distributing the
got to be that I'm gonna blow dry it a
little bit to make it tacky and then I'm
gonna brush it out to kind of thin it
out cuz it's very thick and white oh my
god my chewing is so ugly anyways you
don't want to be too thick because they
like go through the lace and so you put
you a con and then you just slowly pull
it forward and lay it on top of where
you put the gotta pee
I say pee got to be now if some parts of
lucid you could always go back and add
more got to be which is what I always do
you don't do it too much though cuz
that's how it ends up looking white and
just like not cool but you can do it
like don't get discouraged if you mess
up or it's not perfect it doesn't matter
and it comes off with water so just take
your time
and so that's what I do and I'm just you
know making sure it's dry you know do my
thing and then I parted I had to go to a
mirror to go close to me apart this so I
didn't show it in camera but I parted
and now I'm concealing the part with
some foundation powder because I felt
like it looked a little whiter ashy man
this frontal is so nice and Here I am
cutting the hair so the incidence hair
like I said they begin in the video
we're kind of thin for my liking and
something about the part made me want to
cut it this way it wasn't because the
ends were thin something about the part
of how the Bang was suiting my face made
me think that this will look really good
what you did because
I'm a genius and so honestly speaking I
am NOT an expert cutting hair so I can't
give any specific tips I just cut it
until it looks good and that's the cool
thing about wigs and we use it's not
your actual hair so you can really go
ham and I know you may be thinking oh
you gets into a lot of hair you know
it's okay for you be reckless and you
know like potentially mess stuff up but
I'll just do this even I was buying hair
that's how I got I guess a little good
it cuz I would just you know like I just
went for it and I'm able to make things
look cool you just gotta keep working on
it and then it's like it's not perfect I
have to do is just bump the ends like
there's just so many different things
you could do to make it look good you
just have to keep going so we get a
scourge and you stop if courts not gonna
look good and I used to do that when I
first started doing wigs so I took this
cheese straight guard only conceals like
a cream and I wanted the hair to lay
flatter because it wasn't lame as flat
as it could based on how I made the back
of the wig it was a little lumpy which I
was able to fix off-camera but it was
irritating and then I got these thinning
shears to cut down the side so my little
sideburn area will look cool I'm really
just finessing this wig I'm doing a lot
of things I've done in previous videos
it just it came out so good in this
video it was nuts and the fact this
frontal had like pre pluck the baby
hairs made my life so much easier
because I'll have to do we just get a
toothbrush to swoop them and use some
like got to be gel the black bottle the
clear one and it was like done like it
was so easy it wasn't saying and like I
did not expect to have such a pleasant
experience with this
one last thing I'm gonna use some hair
foam it doesn't matter which foam you
use as long as it's foam and this helps
the hair lay even flatter and so I put
the foam where I want to lay it flat and
I go over that with my flat I hate
seeing flattered straighten there people
tease how I say area I always forget it
and so then I go you know make it more
flat and I bump my ends a little bit
more you know just to make sure the hair
is lean and flowing nicely and that's
pretty much it like it's just so easy I
don't know this is a trip
I guess I'm freaking out cuz it's
usually kind of hard for me to really
finesse wigs it looks easy on camera but
I'd be struggling but this is the final
look if you enjoyed this video please be
sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe if you recreate this look
which I hope when you guys do be sure to
tag me in it and I'll see you guys in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
