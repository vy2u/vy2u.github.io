welcome sorry I always had so fast big
cups we just singing it this hair that
did the videos about when I posted on
Instagram surprisingly I've got like a
huge response front for it like I posted
this picture on Instagram story and I
got so many replies about if I find them
I look through my men should I get so
many like sometimes they go away I'll
insert them because I got so good plans
on this hair and I was like well I don't
like so much I was kind of confused but
I thought you maybe because it's almost
30 inches long and it's very very extra
or maybe it's the colourbox like I never
do brown um if you think about me I've
ever seen you brown hair probably not I
usually stay away from Brown that's my
natural hair color and I have always
been a fan of brown but when I posted my
self straight my natural hair I got so
many compliments on my natural hair
color I was like oh it's not that bad
Brown isn't that bad or me either so I
tried this brown out now this Brown is
by L'Oreal you guys know how Laurel has
a thing where it's like red dye for dark
hair they came out with two more they
have blonde for dark hair and brows dark
hair and so I saw that Sally's was okay
like let me just try that and it may be
helpful to something we want brown hair
because it's so simple you literally
just mix the cream and developer and
then you get this code you don't do the
whole bleaching and diagnosed go
straight to the brow color so I thought
that was pretty darn cool now a lot of
you guys were asking me on my Instagram
where the hairs from
I didn't respond old because I want to
make sure I like the hair before I
recommend it told you guys where else
from there's hairs from Hadley Annabelle
I'm gonna be looking before um I forget
what hair try from them by no I'm
driving here before now this hair is 28
inches long this in me four bundles up
20 inch Brazilian streets and then I got
a 360 lace frontal which is also
straight if I was 20 inches which is why
it looks like I kind of have bangs but I
don't it's just that's the commercial
flow of the frontal compares to the
bundles so they Kuryakin natural
type of X now I did cut the 360 frontal
back here only because of the little too
big for my head so I had to kind of cut
and adjust it but it's perfectly fine I
mean that part looks pretty darn answer
to me and honestly 360 front holes I
only recommend them with ever more
expensive friend tools of course because
you're getting more lace and more hair I
only recommend them if you plan to put
your hair in a ponytail I never try
weaves in a ponytail because I just feel
like no matter what they don't look the
most natural so I just don't do it so if
you don't plan it but you even if I tell
don't spend extra man 360 frontal and
you're better off just getting a frontal
it just my personal opinion but about
this hair let's turn around so you guys
can see it see its way and without
moving my focus I'm so extra
but um yeah this hair I literally have
nothing bad to say about it whatsoever
when I first procced indited um cut my
boobs
when I first crossed and indicted it did
get a little dry but that's because I
did a test bundle to see if the dye
would work before I died all of the hair
I'm trying to become more patient when
it comes to dyeing hair I just don't
waste my money or time so I did a test
bundle and then when I rinse the bleach
record bleach for the dye out at the dye
does contain bleach I did a condition X
I anything I had to and someone with the
bundle air dried it felt dry the next
morning so what I did was I died on the
button holes and then I let condition of
sit in them overnight I think that's how
I got the hair to be so nice and
luscious it's not tingly it's not
shedding at all like literally I hadn't
had any shedding don't let me add some
under my armpits you guys I'm sorry it's
look girls but whatever um no shiny no
tingling at all and that's great for
this hair being so long because usually
what I have super long but no matter
what there's always like a little bit
lene are a little bit of shaggy it's
totally normal with puddles or past like
26 inches but I have nothing to say it's
so beautiful at least you guys can see
I'm like standing up that's my movie so
much but it goes all the way down to my
veg that's how long it is I am 5 3 for
reference but I want to be watch the
video I assure you that's how I got this
color super simple super easy and then
I'm when I'm done I'll just check back
in with you guys to say goodbye so I'll
let you watch I got is here alright so
here's a hair in its natural state just
want to show you guys that it looks
really nice in that state has a really
nice luster to it it is super soft it's
honestly just the same as it is dyed
which is pretty cool
let me show you off my test button I did
so this is the difference between the
natural hair color and the hair color
you'll get if you do what I do
well what I'm gonna show you and then
I'm gonna show you guys just a quick up
closely the 3 6 latest frontal it does
come with a decibel straps if you're
wondering so yeah now time to die so I'm
using these L'Oreal hair dyes this is
dark brown will Browns for dark hair
only I bought 3 different dyes and I
almost forgot until I started to open
the box and I realized oh snap these are
all different then I remembered that I
bought them because if anyone was
interested in purchasing this dye I want
you guys to have different options as to
like the different colors and how they
work and so I bought 3 of them I bought
h3 which is soft brown I bought h5 which
is soft
Auburn and I bought h2 which is soft
light front um oh cool light brown now
cool light brown a soft brown the R is
similar the only difference I noticed
was in the Auburn the operand did get
the lightest so if you're if you want
like a light brown definitely the author
and the Auburn has like a nice a sort of
like a reddish tint to it so the Auburn
was my favorite out of these three dyes
and so all I'm doing is squeezing each
dye into separate bowls and then I'm at
the developer I add 45 developer to
really get a lift out of these dyes and
I think the 40 volume was cool if you
want to have like less damage to your
hair then just go to 30
but typically when I my bundles I am not
afraid to use a harsh developer and this
developer didn't damage the bundles
whatsoever so I'm yeah I use 40 and I
just put a cup or whatever this little
thing is I bought this at Sally's to be
more professional I just put a cup of
that into each Bowl and then I mix them
up with my whisk if you are dyeing hair
I recommend the whisk it makes your life
much easier than mixing it with like a
fork girl spoon
trust me just by a hair whisk and um
yeah mix that up pretty fast and then
it's on to dye the bundle now this part
might speed it up cuz honestly really
simple to do is just you know prepare
your dyes get your blush you're gonna
have to put some gloves on or else the
developer will burn your fingers here
I'm just spreading out the bundle just
to make sure it's laying flat so that
way the dye or the color of the heck is
called can really penetrate the bundle
and then I am just take I decided to go
from soft brown to soft
Auburn to the light cool Brown cool
light brown because I thought that that
will look the best but you could
honestly you could really just you could
do this color we're just one in the Box
dyes because my tester bundle that was
just one box dye and you guys see it
look nice I don't think I need to have
all three however like I said I want to
just give you guys options and I want to
test them out to see which one worked
the best and the soft Auburn worked the
best and so if I were to die die more
hair brown I would buy this soft Auburn
so here I am I'm just you know kind of
like dyeing it as if I'm doing an ombre
effect but it didn't necessarily give me
an ombre effect but that's just how I
deposited the color and yeah I just get
the brush get the product and I just
brush it in there and then I use my
finger I run my fingers through it just
making sure that it's all really giddy
in the bundle and these three box dies
they die three bundles and the frontal
so you only need through these box ties
in north to make it spread and if you
use a cup of the developer the little
cup thing that I had they'll definitely
make it spread and
yeah I'm stop talking now cuz I feel
like I'm kind of rambling I'm kind of
sleepy so I hope I'm explaining
everything the right way but I'm gonna
show you guys me I'm gonna show me died
this bundle which honestly I did that
pretty fast and then I must show myself
dying the front toll just so you guys
have seen me do this one more time in
case you really need help on how to do
this oh and by the way after you do the
die you just wrap it in foil and this
helps it process faster and sorry if my
camera gets a little shaky
I bought this special table in order to
do my hair dyeing videos on and the
cameras right next to it so if it shakes
it's because I accidentally bumped into
it hopefully it's not too annoying
doesn't happen too often but when it
does I'm sorry so here I am just you
know dyeing the frontal and I'm Larry
doing the same thing I did with the
bundle just on the frontal it's honestly
really simple and the cool thing about
this die is that like I wasn't scared to
get it on the links at the frontal at
all because it's not die it's more like
a it's kind of like a bleach essentially
just like a more controlled bleach wool
that that's what it reminds me of you
know it's not gonna bleach it a lot but
it has bleach in it okay and so I don't
have to worry about this 10 teen or
messing up the lace of the frontal at
all because it has no pigment so um yeah
I'm gonna let you guys watch me do this
and I'll check back in with you guys at
the end of this video
all right so I showed you this half that
this color after I put the diet I like
to let it sit and I rinsed out like I
said I let the conditioner sit in the
hair overnight which is why it's so soft
and then the next morning I just
blow-dried it
I barely had to straighten if it's hair
actually straighten really fast and here
the end you guys I didn't straighten it
I kind of like got my flat iron and ran
through the hair with that because the
hair is naturally straight so once I
blow-dry it kind of went into formation
you know got straight on its own and
that's pretty much it you guys I hope
you guys are in this video hope it was
helpful sorry I can't talk I talk too
fast on the side and I'm so sorry about
that but uh yeah hope you guys found
this helpful if you do try out that dive

to talk to me comment down below if you
enjoyed this video like I always see

video a thumbs up you please subscribe
