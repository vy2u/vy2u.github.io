welcome so if it was going to be or just
how about this blonde hair I thought I
was a video rehearsal on but I thought
that hair is warmer and I did something
different with this one so its eyes are
so many ways now I'm probably the most
happy the insert a clip to talk at the
same time I'm not gonna make it to like
a fool little tutorial because I thought
I'd go oh god a comfort
I bought a GoPro and you guys know those
are two Mazal get it there's a little
camera sorry I have the burpees it's a
little camera and I put it on a global
head strap they me and so I pretty much
try to the best angle why dye my hair
because what I use now is cool but I
want like giving a more personal angles
yes but would be with my movement PSA
I'm doing somebody GoPro for that and so
I feel with that and let me you know
entering the clips me diamond hair and
I'm just watching a you know let me know
what you think or else I wasted like
four dollars but you can let this angle
let me know so this hair and I love you
guys care barn in the back but you guys
always say that you guys don't hear it
so I'm going to taco burger whatever but
if it's too much noise let me know
cool hair some to do like hair I got
four bundles and a rustle right yeah I
got horrible enough frontal and it's
Brazil by the way to be honest resilient
body weight or Brazilian hair period
it's always my favorite because I
thought it takes dye the best these
bundles bleach so well I want to kind of
shot um honestly I always dread iron
hair because you never know what kind of
bundle you have or how it's gonna take
some bubbles animal diets all that's
another video so it's like I never know
so I'm like a hold on have to dye hair
and I just I procrastinate literally it
took me a week to work on this I knew it
I planned
someone holds I really don't want to do
it but why did it actually bleach so
fast you guys Ellen heck just you know
put the bleach in Islands there clips
now as I'm doing it I just have to put
the bleach on the bundle and Rattus boil
let it process and it lifted to life it
looks too like a perfect blonde and then
on to do is tone it out of this colors
so easy to get if you mess up like I
don't fill this would really good
evening individual for the militia I'll
need bleach one bundle because my guy
might why'd you like hair nice video I
feel I kind of died most the bundles
first so I just took a faster process
for me so yeah I wish that bundle and
then I use this well a toner and right
now I'm going to try Angie's video seems
possible but right now well uh the guys
how he says that well is biowing given
free for us a whole month so if you do
plan on like I'm sleeping fine hair
period I recommend getting well of
toners because no matter what color you
are by your hair you have to tone the
hair first and let you want the yellow
brassiness of the bleached hair to kind
of message your color so definitely by
the tone there um I was going free up to
go buy all those boxes I'm pissed
um I did a pair yesterday and today is
today July 18th and I got your bar to go
to Sally's for me and he cuz I ran out a
poner if we buy a toner you know a
little free analysis why don't you get
more people you just tell me okay Gasol
and I do that's what the heck um so yeah
as get more but I'm just letting you
guys in it because I think one bottle
toner is like six dollars and using me
too so in less than seven for free but
on as far as hair goes I thought it
looks a little dry because that it's an
oil in it but it's actually not dry at
all in my opinion it doesn't feel dry
and feel matted um I've had experience
with heroin leash and I'd it and it got
on that aid and dry but is not the case
at Austin where my fingers to it feels
very soft and flowy I just um I pull it
with a flatter and I brushed it out up
on the curl with all you know kind of
breezy imagines literally any oil in it
because I want to show you that the
Pamela
without any product so mean this worth
looking like yeah I really like this wig
now I want to tone it more and I want to
I'll do in a different video
clothing is bond it's cool but I want to
show you that hi people from blonde to
like platinum or maybe even great so I'm
going to do that I'm going to tone it
again I don't want to tone it like twice
in one setting
I don't want damage too much because
there is lessening is over toning this
and I'll give you guys a tip on what I
was turning my bundles I did all four at
once and I bleached them first and then
I least one the bundle to this video I'm
going to tone them all at once I would
recommend that if you're new and miss
because you put the toner one bundle and
that are just props me including we're
going second bundle and you know they're
processing so if I tended to third
bundle the first two bundles the
processing so fat you have three been
ripped it out because if you tone those
two bundles too much it won't look you
don't want pretty much you just don't
over tone
so what I recommend is that when you're
20 or bundles I'm a VA look a lot of
them if you work with two bundles is
fine but three or more I would say to do
one at time so you can really watch a
clip Tony it since a lot of times they
work really good it tones pretty bad so
like you will need to leave him enter
that long at all and so I kind of make
that mistake where I tone two bundles
first and that adds over in the third
when I wrote the two bundles they were
getting almost to a cheese and so that's
why I mean it worked out in the end
because I forgave the hair more
definition it's not all one color and
you know what you guys see is still some
warmth in there that's because I carry
their rinse out the toner because the
first two bundles their proxy weight is
fast than I thought they would then yes
I was talking so much but I really like
my hair like my makeup I like everything
I haven't filmed so long because I got I
brought the two so I had to wait so we
beat my face so now that I did I'm just
really excited about it I'm not sure how
fast Isis videos I'm not sure if the
makeup look will be epic for the
hairless but I did some makeup look and
will be up so don't worry about that
part my errands go I mentioned it in my
makeup video visa croissant star and is
a mighty convenient
well first these earrings okay you know
I'm not going to go on decide right now
just to be able to say you know how much
it cost but I do know that whatever
shows to me
I paid them okay um these aren't cheap
earrings that's one thing I eat and I'll
come a heaven to pick some up some see
when I work for brands I don't really
like to work with brands that I feel
like charge a lot because I like to work
and friends that I feel like us can
afford to not the vicious sister let me
see their earrings each one specifically
they're really cute um but these ones
are what are in the ears these ones are
a hundred and seven dollars so I saw
that I was like ooh do I have one within
yourself but they were so nice that yes
but I got it um you know Kimmel bought I
did notice that two of the little
diamonds in a real diamond so I'll just
call that verse does they have fell out
into the box meaning they aren't
properly glued in there or you're kind
of cheap which I'm assuming so I will
say that if you guys want to cash out my
earrings
go for it however you they may the
neighbors on you and I don't think
that's like cool for the price of film
in that I don't know where home I mean I
have in my favorite mines but whenever I
wear them I will disclose that where I
got them to a little damaged or missing
I will pin back in mostly they're in the
box like something about that locator
piece of cod sheep the carnage attacks
and you wanna be my name is back in his
hair and the hair I'm gonna show you
guys how much I plucked from the front
row because the frontal I got some
pretty natural um as it was brought here
so it looks really weird but I really
took my time on his frontal and this I'm
taking more of my I'm going to start
pretty much spending more time really
custom of night rentals eventually on
the woods and make I didn't want to sell
them so I want them to be nice to begin
with so let me get all I kept the hair
to show you guys with them alright so
this is how much I've looked this up
times this I select this much you guys I
went crazy and obviously looking a lot I
mean it is a lot but you really have to
plug like frizzy to really good night
Caroline I'm learning that so incredible
even already country plus and you know
to plug too much the thumbs that aren't
free clubs you have to pluck a lot in
what happened to take your time I
brought my little mannequin head effects
doing here in the living room and I just
watch TV so I don't realize how much I'm
staying on it because if you're in your
room it's just quiet it just you plug an
affront to your selected taking forever
you're gonna get lazy and you're not
going to do it that's me like almost
every other time before this but why did
I mean I have my little message then and
I put my little satin pen on a tripod so
it's easier to work with
and I'm I just martini on usual on order
and oh some people came a last
night anyway and nice Lex right i watch
my shows with them and i just kind of
plus plus you know and you don't also
too hard because there's been times
where close to heart and make holes in
the leaves don't do that but yeah i only
used three bundles I actually have one
full bundle left and you can see this is
one of the bundles I didn't let the
toner sit in that long because I had to
rip them off that and never see what it
looks like before you tone it so um yeah
I don't think I put on it but I'll
actually want a saying yeah
Elliott owns three the bundles I believe
did I don't think I did but this this
would look like before I really toned it
so when I told it it got me look at a
she blonde and I use like I think the
well at p10 Alice there is no before
this but on this listen before you tone
it so tone is really important on a
question you want to do the other colors
like like green blue and like that you
have to tone or else on this yellow mist
we'll mix that color and you want to
cover to watch so long I've been talking
I'll have more real limit air where I
like Tony even more to get more platinum
color I just want to give it a break but
I'll damn do so much so yeah if you guys
know this video please give it thumbs up
subscribe all the hair info and
everything we got below um you guys will
get at the end the perixx or the
standard another video but so parts of
the bad no complains I mean if it's
pretty good for it being bleached
you know like this parts a little dry
now so I know that what's up a little
oil in it
the condition in which I have it it's
going to be all good Rob no complaints
though thank you guys for watching this
um if you aren't already please
subscribe and I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
