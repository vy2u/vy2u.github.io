you're new welcome so I joined a quick
hair review on the hair I have my head
right now I've been wearing this wig
let's see I would not yesterday award I
don't know if you fought on Instagram I
did the Instagram live I was wearing my
hair there I were going to snap and
people asked more I got the hair from
and from Ally grace hair Navarre do you
do for them before on their curly hair
and so I've come to the conclusion that
ah this is real I'm really trying to
think yeah I I want to say cuz they I
have it they're my favorite hair oh not
a few here
they're my favorite Alex press vendor of
this year now I say this year because I
don't know like I still have other hair
after review so I don't know if I'm
going to end up liking more other hair
more but I've tried their curly hair and
now there's straight hair and both have
been amazing so I could say that I like
their hair most only because I've tried
multiple textures whereas most
Aliexpress companies I've only have
tried one texture there's only one other
al Express Company where I try to
textures and I don't want them and it'll
be a video on that pretty soon it's
gonna be shambles but I'm be honest but
I love this hair um honestly it's like I
don't even know to say about it looks
amazing look at the luster and let you
guys look the lobster a little bit I'm
really not used to doing reviews like
this I'm using styling the hair I just
don't know how to style this because I
actually need this wig and like I make
this way give me about 4 to 5 minutes
and that's because I made it the night
before I suppose to a leg to a
photoshoot for this makeup brand and
they told me to pretty much bring a lot
of hair you know cuz they didn't know
how they wanted me to looking at you see
and so like how like I already had some
wigs that I like put aside to green but
I gots one one more option I want hair
that looks natural and then pretty
simple so I made this wig and AXA didn't
cut this the hairstyles there he cut
this and I just I like this length I
think it looks very very natural and
very lik realistic and I mean yeah I
didn't have too much to this wig I
plucked the little part to not get
custom
as a frontal part that's kind of have
time I made this in 45 minutes and I
just let it be but I did dye his hair
jet black so that's why it's so dark it
was a natural 1b color but I just really
even want a jet black I'd honestly miss
having jet black hair because I just I
don't know I just I loved your book here
guys you can see like the hair itself is
really really really nice it came longer
came I think the longest one was maybe
at 20 I don't cut a lot cause very long
but I said you know do - do you cut it
don't they have sucks that I didn't mind
where this wig I didn't wear another wig
so can I cover the reason but I think it
was meant to happen because I mean I
really like this length I feel like it's
much easier and I feel like I don't know
something about super long leave makes
it more obviously it's a weave if it
makes in the out circle a picture and
I'll actually do this time cut almost a
minute sir stuff and I was forget me
wearing their curly hair and I remember
when I wore this hair everyone's like oh
what hair is that well oh it's beautiful
and that's because it was and I only
bleached it once in this picture altar
like a few because I thought they're
beautiful but I only wish to have once
in that picture and I didn't put any
product in X I want to see how to react
because everyone knows that it's very
hard to find good curly hair in general
especially Aliexpress so when I like
bleach the hairs okay like I want to see
what's going to happen so it will look
like that it was perfect and then I
placed at a time so I was like okay let
you can tell are you being bleached once
well let's see look how strong hairs and
I'll insert a little I don't have a
picture but it's like a little video
clip of the video right onto the link of
the video I'm talking about answer right
here and you see that the curls are
still holding up and actually look at
the wig right now so you can see how it
looks right now
I rap to wig to show you guys because I
want the speech to overall Ali gross
hair review because I really do like
their company so this is the curly hair
that I got from them now it's been
sitting all looks so beautiful I deliver
it again um it's been seeing a basket
just in my little wig basket still has
moisture you guys it I haven't put any
product in it now the front parts a
little frizzy by mean oh let it be in
frame first but I mean I'm not really
worried about that because I know that
once I wet it's gonna go back to looking
perfect
but look it still has moisture you can
search the luster on it it's perfect
like it's like and at least is twice and
there's no profit at all like I kid you
not
now I'm gonna show you another curly wig
now I'm not going to name the name right
now because I think that's just hella
shade but there will be a video on this
trust believe huh this is not a
Chromebook I have now you guys see the
hair it looks okay it feels very dry
looks can i dry look at the frontal ah
you guys see it looks mad it looks like
a matted mess which is why I want to do
my my final review I'm not permanent
 on my head I'm going to talk about
because I'm gonna have to let you guys
know if you really want to know like
let's talk in the comments I just
refused to say exception that's mean or
you know but um I just want to compare
curly hair because this is the quote
this is good quality curly hair the fact
the matter is I didn't even brush his
hair I learned just you know I didn't do
anything to it just made wig on it so
the fact that this curly hair looks much
better you can see the moisture in it
and I bleached it twice versus hair that
I literally didn't touch this shows just
how good quality their curly hair is and
by the way I can't be on this already
and if you're really smart you'll figure
it out but I know people are saying oh
cuz I'm saying that it was shedding I do
not like that this curl here hardly shed
at all which is a very very very good
thing because use curly or peepers
ain't old cuz you cut the tracks but let
me tell you something I cut the tracks
on all of the harrogate I make all my
wigs the same I cut the tracks and do my
I literally make them all the same so
when it comes to using cutting tracks as
a excuses to shedding
I don't go for that because I'm a calm
oh is the same and some hair and
some doesn't at all so I don't you know
I don't really see that excuse so I made
this one the same I made this that wig
and I just loved it I was leaving in my
October favorites like it's one of my
favorite wigs Asian my go-to wig but you
know I have so much hair have to look
console switch it up but this is a wick
I brought this to LA um it's it's really
a really good quality wig and after I
tried their straight hair they reach
back out to me and I said hey we wanna
do another video with you um let's try
them texture like okay let's try
straight hair so I wanted to see the
okay look it's just they're curling that
it's good or is there straight here too
and as you can see there straight hair
is nice now I did actually bleached hair
and dye this hair and I didn't even get
a picture
um I bleached it and I used oh one sec
and use this box I now know is not come
out that color came out like a burgundy
color um by fun I'm trying just lit up I
didn't bleach it and I did put jet black
over this and you can see still healthy
I I've experienced oh
I just rolled I haven't experienced any
shitty like wow yeah okay
no I haven't experienced any shedding
well I'm sure I realized that I hadn't
experienced shedding with this hair
either so yeah overall I really love
their company um
they simply asking for a review they
didn't even know that I was going to
they don't know until they watch this
video that was an image of the curly
hair all my pants are my own and I
always have companies this um I can't
get paid to give you a review all my
reviews are always honest and do like an
eye-tracking mean okay like you're I'm
gonna say here's that I'll try to not be
mean about it but I mean I'm gonna be
honest regardless like there's been
companies that I talked and I'm like I
got their hair and I'm always straight
I'm always like straightforward with
companies because I won't let them know
like hey I'm gonna say this before I say
this just today just let me have a
warning you know so it's not so tough
but I'll tell companies I'm like uh yeah
I don't like this hair and I could say
right now that I'm not gonna have the
best things to say about it like and
some coming okay well you know just with
review and some have even told me well
if you do berry view I'm gonna lose my
job and just like I'm sorry but I have
to be honest so just know that whenever
I'm doing reviews I'll be honest with
you guys but um yeah there's not much
else I have to say about this hair I
really wish I could figure I could have
styled it because I really don't like
doing reviews like this but I mean if
you guys like reviews like this where I
talk to you directly and I just talk
about the hair I mean ah the tracks very
easy very simple I will say that okay
they send me a frontal and three bundles
for the most part all the tracks are
fine I would say that one like in a hat
and OHSAS happens very often a one part
of the track got a little thicker then
went back to thin so maybe that was like
just uh I don't know I don't know what I
would call that but I noticed that
happens quite frequently with different
hair like the tracks will kind of change
in thickness I guess you can say so
that's one thing I didn't notice but it
wasn't to the point where it's like okay
like super thin super thick it was like
thin a little thick enough for me to
notice the difference then it went back
to thin and then I was fine and yeah the
luster is nice super saw Furies
is very easy to deal with and yeah
that's pretty much my review I only want
to mention that curly hair because I
planned on mentioning I plan on doing a
video on my favorite hair and the worst
hair like I've dealt with this year and
so you guys will hear about this company
again I just want to mention it because
of our unity on it but stay tuned for
that video because they'll be up
promptly out the first week of January I
still have a few more companies I need
to work with to determine if they're
going to make the list you know I still
have other hair to try out but I already
have my list for the most part
especially on hair I would not recommend
so hope you guys for this video and I
will see you in my next one which is
going to be a makeup look because I miss
doing those and um yeah I'll see you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
