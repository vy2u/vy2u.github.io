my black radiance true complexion shine
control primer this primer is awesome
and it's also drugstore which makes it
even more awesome
for foundation I'm using NARS sheer glow
in the shade Tahoe and I'm mixing in the
curve X customer enhancer drops in the
shade candlelight I'm going to show you
how to swatch on my hand right now
these just came out they honestly remind
me of the Maki luster drops I believe a
discontinued those like a while ago but
you could pretty much mix them into your
foundation and gives you a nice glow or
you can use as a base for a powder
highlight honestly they're hella awesome
if you found that snap you see in the
swatches I did and they're amazing
to conceal I'm using this color FX CLIC
stic in the shade in 40 now if you guys
know any but the click sticks this thing
is supposed to be looking a little stick
clicker thingy bad I'll use it so I'm
just using it with my finger but to
contour I'm going to use the same little
thingy I don't know what they're called
the little silver thing is I'm using a
shape in one hundred I just love the
consistency of these things I really
don't know what they are I don't know if
it's a concealer foundation I don't know
I just know that I've used it for two
weeks and it's been working
amazingly I mean if you know let me know
but I I just know that they were agree
for my skin but what I will say now this
is just an assumption you know it's not
facts but I think that if you're oily
you might want to stay away from these
because they're super duper duper creamy
so I don't know if they'll work well
with really really oily skin I know
they'll work well with like super dry
skin these will be freakin amazing for
that cuz they're really really creamy
but you know I'm just saying you know
I'm not saying go try it out I'm just
you know if your skin super oily and you
go by visit because my video it does
work out for you don't say I didn't you
know give you a mini somewhat warn me
before you bought it okay just to warn
you guys I'm about to be bleeding for
hella long so if you don't want to see
this then like you can totally skip
ahead because I blend in my life away in
this part and this is like sped up times
twos to imagine how long it took me in
real life
not to set under my eyes on my chin and
my face and all that extra stuff I mix
my banana powder on my color effects
illuminating setting powder in the shade
medium now I mix my color effects powder
in because banana powder could sometimes
be a little too light and a little too
how do I put it a little too light lets
you actually looking so I mixed in my
color effects power to give it a more
tan look it kind of brought out the
yellow in the banana powder so it looked
more natural so yeah taught you guys
some new I've seen people mix powder
before but I've never tried it until now
and it's actually really really awesome
because you can really customize your
powders you know so that they work for
your skin tone
now it's time for the eyes i primed my
lid using lemonade perm by benefit and
I'm going to take my modern renaissance
palette by innocence Beverly Hills which
I stained already even though it's new
and I make it this shade Bert orange and
use that as a base on the place that all
over my lid
now I'm going to take the shade for you
real car a comet-like regular but I mean
I can't see realgar real guard well what
is that I don't know but it's a really
nice soft orange shade I'm gonna place
it into my kana my crease area that
mistake real car makes a love letter
which is a really beautiful pink and
that's like a lot come for me because I
hate pink I'm just I'm not a pink person
but this pink is like the bomb because
it's like a it's a warm pink if that
makes sense I don't know if that makes
sense but yeah that's what I'm using
so next gonna take red ochre and I'm
gonna place that one kind of in place
everywhere I'm gonna focus it in the
crease area cuz that's I'm trying to
build up that color now it's time for
some shimmer because I put a lids I'm
taking eye candy liquid sugar as a base
and we get the shades Primavera
and oh my god Venetian red this palette
is make me realize I don't know how to
read state in college I showed you guys
the shades don't worry about the names
it's not important
the colors are important and those are
the two colors and I'm using okay
and so for my lower lashline I'm just
taking the shade Love Letter and I'm
just gonna put that on my lower lash
line just to finish off my eye look a
bit this eye look is so soft yet it pops
you know that's I like about it now back
to the face I am setting my entire face
as well as dusting off that powder with
my Ruby kisses mineral powder in the
shade mocha yeah that's kind of off to
sea so let me do this and then I'll get
back to you guys to set my contour I'm
using the same powder but in the shade
honey Brown gonna do that real fast now
for blush I'm using this new makeup geek
blush car what's it called I'm grabbing
it right now it's got puppy love oh my
god I love this kind of blushes those
soft pink blushes that look like it may
not show up on your skin tone but when
it does it's like a super soft blush
I'll got the vetoes moving too fast for
me so Hilah I'm using my son dip glow
camp and it's us Beverly Hills and then
I'm gonna put a little guilty honey by
Laura Geller on top of that just to make
it pop a little more
also gonna highlight my brow bone using
Gildan hoodie as well and then for
lashes I'm taking my new bouncing lash
in the style of Russian white and bam I
got lashes on already googles right on
cue for that now it's time for lips I
went in I kind of did my hair a little
bit and I put on a cute little shirt and
I'm using the lip color a BH Ashton it's
so crazy because my sister films a video
too using this palette and she used
Ashton two and I didn't even know it
until she's like she's like dude you
know we both use the moderate sounds pal
and Ashton liquid lipstick and I'm like
twinsies yeah I'm pretty much done I put
my bangs down and put some earrings on
and I'm ready to go

is snitch and I left and I went to the
mall and I spent unnecessary money just
so the world could see my face J cuz
