to prime my skin using this black
reading shine control primer I've used
this like few times before it's honestly
like my favorite drugstore primer and I
like it because the consistency it's
very easy to rub into the skin and
actually does his job now I decided to
let the primer sit into my skin before I
put any foundation on so I think on my
skin I'm gonna move straight to my brows
and I'm using this brow pencil by Ruby
kisses it's quite similar to the brow
definer brand accessibility Hills it has
the same I guess structure pretty much a
dupe and it's like weight cheaper of
course it means we're because all the
products are super cheap and super
affordable now honestly this is like my
favorite drugstore brow pencil I end up
using another one in this video too and
it's by color pop I honestly do not like
those which is why you guys hardly see
me use them because I feel like color
pop everyone knows color pop stuff is
usually creamy but honestly creamy is
not always a good thing especially when
it comes to brows because sometimes you
put too much product on and so you got
to see that later but and the pencil
kept breaking on me and I noticed a
color pops eyeliners and their pencils
do that they break very easily so
anyways to kind of shape my brow I got a
la girl concealer in the shade medium
beige and I'm just like carving off the
brow before I go into the front part and
so this is why I use a color pop pencil
and it kept breaking I don't know if you
guys could tell in the video but it
broke on me twice and I was extremely
annoyed with it um yeah I kind of
wouldn't recommend it yeah I wouldn't
honestly I will just go with the Ruby
kisses pencil
so I finished that bra I did the other
bra off camera and then I will be back
to my foundation all right so now I'm
back and I'm going to take this NYX
thick foundation there's only ten
dollars I think it's a great foundation
for the price it's kind of similar to
the MSS metal stick foundation although
I feel like her stick foundations are
more accurate when it comes to your
shave because this looks decent in the
video but I feel like it's a little more
red than I'd like it to be I feel like
the intercessory stick foundations
they're just more accurate with their
undertones which is what I like but if
you want a dupe and you don't want to
spend too much money on that you can
always go with this one because it's
very easy to blend ten dollars you can't
really go wrong with that and it's super
easy to blend out I don't even have to
go back over this little Beauty Blender
sponge I just blend out with this Fanny
Planet brush which by the way I have a
code 4 on my set of brushes with them
and every single brush I'm using will be
listed below or on the screen I haven't
decided how I'm gonna do that yet just
know that um brush details will be
included so I've left the finish with a
brush and I was super impressed okay
like this is looking kind of good so ii
can see I'm using the LA girl Pro
concealer in the shade medium beige I
love this concealer so much it's one of
the first like concealers I really
started using once to start taking make
it more seriously these concealers could
be a bit tricky though depend on where
you get them because some places sell
them I'm not sure if they're maybe not
like keeping them in the right
temperature but sometimes you get them
and they give you a little bit greenie
I'm pretty sure if you've had these
concealers you've probably experienced
at least one time because I've
experienced it in multiple time so I
know it's not uncommon but I got lucky
and I got a pretty good batch I guess
but you had to be careful where you
order the concealers from because
sometimes you get there are certain
sites and they're greeny each time and
what's their grain it's like it sucks
using them
so the con time taking this nyx contours
last highlight stick I'm using a darker
shade of course as you really like these
I noticed that these are great when you
want to do nose contour because they're
a little more on the liquidy side and
they're on a cream side and I thought
sometimes when you use cream to contour
all that kind of nice if you know what
you're doing it's hard to blend it out
if that makes sense
I have no idea that makes sense I'm not
sure how to explain it I just know that
I like the consistency of this concealer
to contour so decide where I could see
I'm using my airspun powdering if it's
at Walmart now honestly I first got his
powder I was like what the hell was this
baby powder cuz that's what it smells
like but it works good and I use it
whenever I don't wanna smile armor safe
powder so I mean that must mean
something okay so yeah she's got some
place like conceal and I will be back to
do my eye shadow
though did one app camera in this what
came up with I'm going to take this
cream eyeshadow by Absolut in New York
not only the name was my first time
using this I got this in the gin beauty
goodie bag so besides just try it out
I've never worked with cream ice shelves
before so I was a bit confused but it
worked out so apply that to your eye
first then just blend out with them I
was gonna see him I also say sponge is
gonna brush doesn't see a brunch a brush
okay I used like a flat head fluffy
brush guys like that blends out the best
and yeah I just blend that out and kind
of like diffused it so it can look like
Blin dude let me take another color it's
like more like a deeper like kind of a
burgundy color and place on my lid and
I'm going to blend that out as well
so now I'm gonna take this NYX palette
it wouldn't show up that green in my
camera because my lights are really
bright I'm just taking this like
champagne shimmer color and I'm gonna
place it on top of my lid so I felt like
it made it pop a little more and so
that's it for the top part of my eye and
so for my bottom lashline taking this
brown shade in the same palette I
actually put too much on but that's why
you put powder underneath there I why
doing your eyeshadow so if you mess up
it's not like you're screwed and you're
not a raccoon so it was a quick fix we
just got a fluffy brush and blend it out
and I was done with my eyes now I set my
face and using my soft focus powder
black radiance it's like my all-time
favorite drugstore setting powder and if
you follow me and even watch my videos
you already know this by now
so now I'm taking down their Black
Radiance soft focus powder and this
shade milk chocolate this is really nice
I wouldn't even say contour shade
because usually contour shades are cool
tone but this is a really nice bronzing
shade and I mean I enjoy it I really
like how it warms my face and it chooses
my cheeks so just gonna use that to
contour for blush I'm using NYX blush in
the shade Coraline and it's a really
cute peach blush and I use this one
because I didn't want too much color my
cheeks I just wanted something okay this
is part of my routine so I had to do it
but you can't really see too much of it
in the camera but it shows a fully light
and nice in person now to highlight I'm
using this color pop churro it's awesome
it's kind of crazy honestly like it's
pretty intense
but it's worth it and apply that using a
fluffy brush
for mascara muses with my pixie honestly
it sucked like this is my first time
using it was in my Ipsy gin generation
beauty bag so I did not drop coins on
this thank God cuz I would be mad but I
didn't realize it wasn't gonna suck
until afterwards trying to put down
lashes so don't feel bad for me anything
oh my god anyways now it's time for lips
I am taking this brown lip liner my
black radiance
it's literally called brown eye five
figure out the name well that's the
package said so that's all I can say and
I decided to use a concealer for my
lipsticks today because I tried like
three different lipsticks which is why
my lips look red tired because I mean
everything was just lame and so I got
this concealer my black radiance like
this dark brown concealer it was perfect
now it's a little bit hard to put on my
lips cuz I mean it's not lipsticks not
for your lips but felt really
comfortable my lips I felt like a
perfect matte lipstick without feeling
dry um
awesome you should totally try it out
because I liked it and it looks really
good
For Lashes I'm using one my Vegas knee I
had these I've had these for like mad
long I just always neglect things I feel
like they're not perfect but they worked
and I'm gonna put them up off camera
because I'm trash putting them on on
camera but they look really nice you
know I like them now attacking me to put
on a little shirt and do some with my
hair and boom Here I am now almost
forgot
you need setting spray people that's
what drugstore make them you gotta make
it set or you're in shambles after you
set your face you're pretty much done I
really really really enjoy doing this
look it was very easy and very simple
like all my makeup looks are well at
least I try to make them that way and
yeah this is the finished look if you
guys like this please give a thumbs up

hard and I'll see you guys in my next
video I have a lot of cool videos
planned stay tuned for that and hope you
