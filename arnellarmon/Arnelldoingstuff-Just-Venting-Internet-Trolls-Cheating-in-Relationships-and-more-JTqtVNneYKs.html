new welcome so I'm gonna do another
arnelle doing stuff if you're new to my
channel if you haven't watched my
previous are no doing stuff
are no doing stuff simply series on my
channel why just do stuff that's not be
related so that could mean me doing DIYs
me trying out weird toys or need to
simply talking which is longer doing
this video today I debated if I want to
do this video app because Tim do these
kind of videos you know know what kind
of reaction they get and sometimes it's
like when gala to personal people kind
of dig deeper than you want them to dig
and they start kind of probing you which
I don't want from this video I just want
to make this video just kinda just talk
about stuff I just explained to certain
stuff that's been bothering me as of
recently and so I'm gonna relax this
videos gonna be pretty chill laid-back I
was just kind of nervous with these kind
of videos because I just feel like I'm
not use just talking to straight to a
camera but I'm just gonna talk I'm gonna
like talk as if you guys are like you
know one of my friends or something like
that you guys know if you form an
Instagram you know if you watch my lives
I get really personal with you guys just
like you like it not too personal by my
personal enough to where a lot of you
guys know who I am as a person um I said
person a lot but um I do some stuff on
my life all the time I think it's just
different on YouTube because with
YouTube videos the videos like stay up
so hopefully this video isn't too long
I'm just gonna talk about I'll give you
guys like a summary where I'll talk
about this video I'll talk about how to
do internet trolls my previous
relationship I'm gonna kind of gonna go
over a little bit of that not too much
into detail but just to kind of explain
where the internet trolls came from and
just about dealing with hate and like
negativity on social media in general
and like what you could do to I don't
know like avoid it and to get through it
and so let's get started alright so I
made me straight to the point
so what inspired this video something to
happen on Twitter like maybe like three
four days ago I forget it was a couple
days ago but it's starting oh my god
they're my spider I thought I killed yes
my old omou hold on hold on put on I
killed him
my old idiot no no sorry guys yesterday
I saw I knew he wasn't dead yesterday I
saw a spider crawling on my wall and I
was don't do this I sprayed him he fell
I was like where did he go like I was
paranoid all of last time yesterday my
little league the spider lone please
don't touch it and I just saw him and I
stepped on him so I know he's dead don't
you hate him you think you kill the
spider and you just don't know you're
like where is he yet anyways as I sing
this off started on Twitter so in
formats whether you know okay so look I
have three social media platforms I have
Instagram YouTube and Twitter YouTube is
where I am professional I'm so lucky
come on filter but I'm a professional
for the most part because this is like
my brand this is like my job Instagram
I'm also professional on that extra gift
story I will post a little you know
funny kinda crazy stuff but from
Instagram for the most part I keep it
pretty clean because like I said like
this is like my bread and that's my
business
Twitter it's not necessarily part of my
brand I mean like everything I do is a
part of my brand by Twitter I guess my
social media I'm like outlet where I can
be as reckless as I want to be and hey
guys I want to be and I kind of say
whatever and kind of do whatever because
I just feel like it's Twitter's so in
formats whether you know I tweet a lot
about this stuff and yeah it's just a
simple I tweet a lie wreck the stuff I
tweet a lot of stuff that is sarcastic
that is asshole like I will say that I
feel like it's my asshole life let me
just kind of personality for you guys if
you if you're new my personality is I'm
SuperDuper nice goofy um sarcastic and
not not with everyone no because I feel
like neither could handle sarcasm but I
like humor sarcastic with me so I don't
so sometimes I will be sarcastic other
people but only like they're like
friends I'm not like I'm not start
casting in like I'm trying to bury some
away like I was sealing a little stuff
I'm very petty
I don't know if that's a no it's not a
queerest thing I've been told that but
obviously for myself I can give a very
very petty DePiano situation I would say
somebody's super slick something funny
never mean but it is petty and next time
a person I like I'm super nice but I
cost me really paid I have a smart mouth
and I have a temper and I can react to
things a lot and so on Twitter I pretty
much in that way and so a couple of days
ago on Twitter I tweeted something I was
at this concert I was kind of tipsy
actually and I was on Twitter tweeting
random I don't know what inspired
me to do this I literally don't lose
honestly random self and I tweeted about
something inspired this I don't remember
by smite fleet was I said the last time
a guy cried in front of me I had to
force us up the thing sad thoughts in
order to not laugh in his face now when
you first hear that your prior like wow
she's an asshole that sounds really good
to me but this reason why I said that
so this leads to me talking with my
previous relationship in next week I was
referring to one of my previous
relations I won't say which one but it
was one of the previous relations I'll
let you guys figure it out but I'm not
gonna like give to me details or say any
names I don't wanna you know like feel
like I'm dragon eggs I don't care for
them at all but I also don't be
disrespectful either and so and I were
curious relationships I was cheated on
the whole entire time literally like no
he's poop I think we'll like last month
or we were to go for like a year and a
half so I was chill movie and single
monthly relationship and let me tell you
guy the situation
each month why stayed in that um easy
he's answer low self-esteem not know my
were thinking that I could fix him or
change him it is just that simple what I
did that again no but that's why that's
the only reason I could think of
it wasn't like love or wasn't like me I
just felt like I needed I liked having
someone to like be affectionate like you
know I got still some daddy issues
it is what it is so that's why I saying
that and so in a relationship I was like
it was a definition of being dogged the
 out
literally I cannot I won't want to
detail on exactly what he did but when I
tell you that if a Duke dog you outlook
that's what the happened and so
towards interrelationship when I was
finding it over it when I was finally do
like I don't like this I was not
with it at all
like I'm not really in love with you
either I wasn't and I'm just like I'm
not really like I can't do it he did
what a lot of men do and that's when
they tried to cry to manipulate you to
fill me back to give him another chance
and so in that moment when this person
decided to break tonic right in front of
me I would all those tears was genuine
or not all I do know is that in that
moment I would want to laugh now that
sounds mean but if if I were to go to
detail about everything they did you
probably want to laugh in their face too
because I felt insulted I felt insulted
because I'm I okay like all the times I
cried to you many many times like this
times when I would cry so much I might
have my actual chest would literally be
in pain like I felt like genuine pain it
was a trip I don't know if you guys ever
experienced it before but like the worst
feeling ever
but I'm I also never cry to get you to
understand just I heard you're making me
and you continue to do what you do
now I'm filing again the confidence to
time just be cool off the situation now
I wanna cry and make me feel back to
give another chance
yes it's insulting and it's comical I
wanted to laugh and so in that tweet I
was referring to a specific situation
was I saying that
and will like what I laugh every guys
say surprised no I I feel like I've had
an ex Crimean before but it wasn't
leading it to me they were just upset
and I like comforted them when that's -
if I do what people cry but that's the
situation
I want to laughing I don't take that
back like it may sound mean but that's
how I generally feel and felt in that
moment and so what leads little what how
the Twitter trolls came about is that
someone decides to go on Twitter and
search through my Twitter account I
don't know I don't know if this person
has a job I don't know there was my pedi
again Islands what's in this job I don't
know if they have a relationship they
clearly are lacking something their life
which which allows them to have more
time to do stuff like what they did and
they found a little tweet where I
express how I like when men show emotion
and then I feel like it takes maturity
to do so which it does take maturity to
show emotion I feel like for men men are
new to kind of close off with their
emotions and so they compared those
tweets and of course when you're
comparing those two tweets where I'm
saying hey I like women show emotion but
hey this dude cried I want to laugh in
his face it sounds like a she's a
 hypocrite it sounds bad but what
annoyed me is that it's taking out of
context did I say hey when niggas cry
when sorry I don't see the word macho
when dudes cry I'm just laughs no this
is sort of person dog when the out
want to pry manipulate me yeah mola I
want to laugh but that did I know cuz
I'm not that mean I'm not evil and so
seeing that tweak go around a lot of
mainly dudes were between me because I
guess you got them in their feelings
which is okay but a lot of dudes I act
like I'm on Twitter I feel like a lot of
times if men get dragged and it's used
by us women you know retweet Lou
about them so I think when they get a
chance to drag women they hop on that
 and they they just keep it rolling
so that's a very doing and then today it
got on Instagram of course which I
predicted and people come to my page
call me a thot come be a hole coming to
the bitches I have even my own
supporters like my own supporters are
not all of them obviously both
through them were in these pages in the
comment sections like oh my god I was
root for her oh wow like you know I'm
just okay if you were supporter then why
not either ask me directly like where
that came from or why not actually do
research and look into it because when I
see like whatever I see influence
or go to some type of drama and I'm
supporting them before I assume like oh
my god this person's a dick I look into
it before I make an assumption and so
the fact that people who claim to be my
supporters we're in the comments
pretty much dragging me along with these
other grants who don't know me at all I
really disappointed me because I'm super
open with you guys at all times
ally I can't like almost every
day and I'm always open with what I do
like what's going on my life so the fact
that like people could say they support
me but then during those comments I'm
like you're not a supporter like I
honestly don't want to is one if you
could see one tweet automatically assume
that I'm not when you even the
clump will follow me and you know that's
not the case and so that really
disappointed me it was really
frustrating my lord you can't fit up the
couch me more you're too big
you too big yeah sorry he's trying to
get on the couch he's too big anyways oh
that would be disappointing me and Dylan
internet trolls is also really really
frustrating because it's like you want
to explain yourself to everton person
that comments but you can't you
literally can't it's pointless
your best bet and I actually did Nicole
people asking about this your best bet
is to literally ignore like every pay is
I've seen block I mean um see posted
some people are tagged mated and I
really wish they want it like I don't
want to see that it makes me angry
I see if I just walk those pages that
way I don't get any comments and it's
who's gonna go away because every other
day on the internet what like one day
something can be relevant and we could
be talking about you the next day they
find someone new to talk about that's
how it worked and so I mean I doubt this
before where I said something offensive
and I was actually wrong than that
situation and I deal with a lot people
attacked me for what I felt like they
had the
to do so because I mean in that
situation it was much worse than this
and I was super wrong but I was also I'm
gonna say I was like 19 at a time and
I'm super emotional stupid offensive the
minute I got attacked and stabbed taking
a step back and kind of like looking at
what I did and trying to figure out I
was wrong or not I just automatically
started like you know curse people out
just defending myself neither ones that
I shouldn't have been defending myself
because I was completely wrong and so
I've been to the Scott situation before
where like you know you're just game
driver who don't know you and but that
time I had the right to be drag this
time off like I've the right to be Drive
because it's okay there's a bunch of MU
who don't know me literally calling me a
thot which is honestly like in hindsight
it's funny as hell because like I'm the
first thing from that but it's like it's
a bunch it's like when you deal with
trolls it's literally people who don't
know you judging the out of you and
it's like some people are gonna handle
that kind of stuff some who can ignore
it but I myself I'm a pretty sensitive
person and so when I see that it's like
 it's it's a mixture of I want to
explain this to you because I don't want
you to think this of me and you don't
know me so I don't know what you think
of me it's like um it's like a mixture
of Pope Milo stop scratching the couch
sorry it's a mixture of both you know
like I don't want to care about it I
want to I so I so badly wanted just be
like you know then like I don't
care I can't do that because I also do
care about like how perceived as a
person and like I honestly do care what
people think about me I said a lot of
people on social media they try says
they don't but we care that's like you
don't I don't mess you think it's a good
thing I think you should to an extent
you should care home
because you don't people think that
you're crazy or that you know you just
an asshole like I really care about that
kind of stuff and so see all that stuff
from the troll guide that bothered me it
did and so that's I want to make this
video because um it's it's annoying
being on social media because you can't
do but did I think that someone a
grown man as a man was going to go type
in my name type in keywords in the
search engines to find asleep just to
make a tweet for Klout did I think
that's gonna happen
no but it did and not deal with it not
being attacked for it and so I just want
to make this video just talking it a
little bit about why I tweet that
because saw my father's could some of my
supporters could have saw that we felt
here and doesn't did but of course when
you think of something to dig without
knowing why to eat then why I felt that
in that moment but I guess to say I'm an
asshole do that the tweet Nick parents
you as far as me appreciating with men
or a touch in touch with their emotions
I actually do still feel that same way
do I believe in men being emotional when
you're ready to leave them no I think
it's fake I think that if you're with
the woman show that emotion throughout
the relationship you know appreciating
the relationship don't leave I could
leave you two to cue the tears
because you guys think that's gonna make
us stay because we're emotional we
typically fall for the kind of stuff
like that I think that's a manipulation
and I think that's an issue so um yeah I
thought I explained myself I mean in
this basal in 15 minutes
I wanted me to be too super wrong um I
guess you can clue this video I'll say
like a few key things one I don't take
my tweet back I felt that in that moment
I actually texted my ex before i did the
video just give him a heads up because
the first time did video I did a Q&amp;amp;A and
I talked about the relationship but I
obviously sounded kind of mean because I
was super like brutally honest about the
things that happened and I talked about
and he wasn't a fan of me posting that
video and so before I film this video I
want to text and let me know like
just give me a heads-up like I'm gonna
talk about this he's like Oh what are
you gonna disclose I'm Sam I'm just I
talk about this and just explain why I
tweeted this and I don't know why
but he kind of start getting cool I mean
I I understand but he's kind of rude
towards me and just like same things to
just I thought he was trying to say
things to hurt my feelings which it
didn't work because theythey like wait
I'm literally just kidding you ahead so
out of respect for you just letting you
know like cuz I know his friends like
different people in his life watch my
 and sent to him so I'm much why
they tell him ahead of time before I
just sit down make a video talking about
it but that didn't really in the best
because I think Isles oh you know you're
you're lying Beaufort retweets I'm like
no like I'm sorry you just not find this
out that I didn't want to laugh when you
did cry and I text my friends about us
saying like yell with a like those
my genuine feelings and so I went in the
speedo by saying that no one would take
that tweet back do I regret tweeting
that yeah I don't think it was necessary
tweet and next my do tweets something of
that sort which I probably will I will
explain or go more deeper into why I
said it so it doesn't look like I'm a
total asshole what else don't internet
Charles the best thing to do is just
block the accounts block the pages
people literally think about it like
just a couple days ago what was
happening just you just yesterday blac
Chyna is fighting in the park and no
one's really even talking about that
today cuz it's not relevant anymore it's
new news this is fake news when you're
dealing with people in they don't know
they're like trying to attack you take a
character know if they don't know you
know they don't have to know you and
know that they may never take the time
to get to know you all you can do is you
trying to state your piece leave it at
that and if they still want to assume
 they're gonna do so and you can
just let them do so so that's what I'm
doing this video I'm going to stay to my
piece say how I feel is saying what it
is and if people still want to see them
after this video then I'm an asshole and
that's a little just going to be on them
but if not then you're gonna say
subscribe and we're gonna be cool and
I'll do more videos like this if you
guys enjoy this kind of like
sit down to the talk style and I think
it's pretty much about it I want drunk a
satisfied customer to say so if you
enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up
please subscribe like always say I'll
see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
