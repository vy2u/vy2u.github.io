welcomes today's video is going to be a
little different I'm starting a series
on my channel called hashed our mail
doing stuff and you guessed it it's when
I do stuff if I doing stuff I mean stuff
that's not me - related not hair not
makeup just random stuff that can be
DIYs I can be trying a super weird
product in today's video is just simply
lip a series to where I could do things
that are more like me
doping your honor I love beauty but I
like just doing hella weird stuff
outside of beauty and so I'm starting to
see you know my channel so I lose my
mind it's like a half-foot on youtube as
well don't get me wrong I have fun you
know doing the view stuff - like I said
but this is like more my thing and so
I'm dr. I do welcome turnout dude stuff
let's get started this video is going to
be on this Pocket Pal that I have right
here and this is what for something like
this I am or honestly speaking I just
want just chill I did this I don't want
to sit in front of like my super bright
lights and you know from a backdrop I'm
just chillin I don't have no pants on
I'm literally chillin so on my Instagram
max fold as you guys want to see a video
on this weird thing I bought I was on
BuzzFeed and when I was doing but this
came up and it's pretty much like a
patch of skin and you get pimple puffs
which I bought an extra bottle plus
because we never know what college I'll
need and will soon
put the puss into the skin and then
deposit so this works
I've been attached for a week now and so
eat your openness
okay so unwrap pop it pal
I read the instructions so sorry sorry
oh my god freaked out okay okay cuz I
squeeze it two fingers so they already
have kept us in there how do they put it
there they give you this thing that I'm
assuming you okay I'm so grossed out
okay I need napkin like my hands
what do you do it the puzzle is done to
refill and playing in Citrix will place
help us the member for 10 seconds remove
for microwaving Jin the shake use your
puss dropper okay so I'm gonna pop a
pimple this is so gross sorry sir
what's made out of heel
I'm gonna close okay
okay guys so I'm close we'll look at
that quality by the way you guys so this
is because of any new series on my
channel Carmel doing stuff Arnel doing
stuff is me super unfiltered me super
unfiltered is not perfect at all so
don't expect anything perfect or some
impression on this video so it's not
gonna be that way because like I don't
have to be that way and so anyways I'm
just gonna close on my little oh sorry
uh-huh and you just pop yo
oh man you guys I'm so grossed out oh my
god okay oh man let's get a little
closer for the people who want to get
freaked out
this is disgusting I'm disgusting
oh my gosh
what is is honestly speaking oh man okay
so I had to come up close these honestly
speaking I thought my name's I'm gonna
reuse on this pool puss I'm not gonna
just not use it but it's really
moisturizing like this is a super girl
to the lake it feels it feels like it's
L avoid it sniffling you use them on
your cuticles this is really
moisturizing I feel disgusting but like
yeah I actually like them of us I think
that you could reuse it
there's only digest it up or ingested
she's not recommended for people under
three how much more stuff is in there so
how did he do it
okay so right but let actor like
whatsoever it up but I don't know I'm
gonna see how I do it without blowing it
up oh hold on all right so I warmed it
up I warmed up a little too long it's
super liquidy when it says ten seconds
it needs ten seconds but it's cool just
use me as a you know a testimony don't
do it for ten seconds so here's a little
thingy
evil and I'm guessing that's disgusting
oh my god this is really gross me out
and you just refill your your holes I
guess it says to refill them until it
starts overflow like so
you know it's like this is totally
healed but Tony like not you at the same
time if that makes any sense at all oh
you got my shirt okay you know it won't
stick solving Uniqlo that's fine
I live to have fun you must make
sacrifices so I'm assuming you clean up
the surface once you're done why can't
dispense back in here so what it wasn't
kind of closer better wrap these bottles
don't let you put it back in I did it
they want their checks only once you
order more of us it's cool um I'd never
forget your artists take my clothes cuz
or music man it has no scent to
it by the way it drives really fast I'm
gonna see you just relax for my destiny
it's already dry the texture almost
reminds me of shea butter however does
it smell like to butter but it reminded
shea butter which shea butter is kind of
like thick it creamy but then we warmed
up it's not so let's popping a pimple
where are ya see it dries really fast
Wow so you could pop some pimples
warming up resilient here back to pop
pimples 10 seconds later like this
okay you're up close these I'm gonna do
many ways okay focus
oh yeah oh that was good one oh yeah oh
my god that's disgusting
I'm a beauty blogger oh and okay I'm
learning something professional now see
this little thing in the back when you
pop the pimples press on that and that
gives you more of a super duper pimple
popper effect like it like you know
gives it more UNITA focus it gives it
more like strength like boom
see how I'm using my finger back to pop
it well I'm disgusting okay so I mean
I'm not really sure how long just do a
video on the pimple they I would use my
legs this is so moisturizing you guys it
literally is so moisturizing why they
steal but you could just moisturize
yourself with it like okay flick it this
visit exposed how weird I really am but
at the same time if you order this and
you use a big you're gonna see exactly
I'm talking about
nothing is gross about it I'm pretty
sure you want to make this they just use
like oil it says made with all natural
ingredients they're not gonna tell them
that they made it because they want me
to create my own concoction I'm I keep
buying people plus I want clean this toy
but if you get it you still talking
about this is monkey thing and it's
super moist right it seems like you can
see my hands it's a lotion but people
pus so overall I guess I'll have to do
and rate this toy because it's like a
review or ever whatever I commend this
yes
only because I paid $25 for all this for
the thingy the skin it comes with the
pebble puss by itself but I ordered and
the ones I thought I was in go ham I
didn't go as hams if I would go and it
it's just how it looks like in the
BuzzFeed video sometimes I see this kind
of things mean advertise I think it's
pride of the week when you get it I
didn't think that it will look as cool
as it in the video but if you saw on
BuzzFeed it even looks exactly how it
looks in the video so it's definitely
real deal if you like popping stuff
which I do I always like pop pimples but
I never get them so it's like no fair
well oh my god I don't want them but I
like popping up whose pimples now I
don't have to be a weirdo an ass oh come
on girl freaks I would do that to all my
ex-boyfriends I have this now so I can
be single and pop pimples the same time
so whatever feminist
yes I do if you guys want me to let you
review or just talk about it or just
simply just do stuff that's not just
make them in hair
that's what limors wine at this video
because I just don't want to strip you
beauty I want to do stuff that is more
like me so everything cool or you know
something weird like this then you want
me to try it out if you want to spend
your money on it totally tell me I'll
buy it I'm making knowing these videos
where you get C's doing where it's tough
and it's tough with you guys I'll cut
pimples now this is really if you want
it clean I guess you could just like
weight fit a lot fits into here though
oh man I'm gonna start doing this when
I'm either super bored or just super
stressed out I definitely think this is
a stress reliever for sure so if you
like oh that was a big one if you get
stressed out quite often get this and
until then thanks for watching pop
pimples to be a weirdo and like I said
through other things where we try out is
to do a bit you're on let me know and
I'll see you basically there on hashtag
our nail doing stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
