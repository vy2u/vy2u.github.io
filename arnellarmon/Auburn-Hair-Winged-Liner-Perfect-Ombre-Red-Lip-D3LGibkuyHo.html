gonna keep it there
I'm tired skin if you're welcome to know
that's going to play it out okay I'm in
the word I'm making a freaking channel
and animation see me if you watch it
with the channel and hope some of those
jazmyne has one wolf has one along here
to think of you know how to have a
little video to begin the channel I'm
work on that right now I'm going to pee
guys so bear with me right but I've done
some of this look I actually really
loved a lot I don't look slave I've
never done this before I've never done a
wee look on my channels work right so
doing and I turned on the last my word
bright gold red lip but I'm still happy
I did it because I realize I came out
and I think it's like - I'm performative
once in my opinion photographer so
hopefully it helps you a bit but I'm
yeah about this hair because this is
that I make shorts a pair of you but
also the disease can be really short I
got to come a bleaching the hair at an
author and box side and their boss twirl
I filmed it so I posted is very simple
girl Rob I just bleach the hair put in
some oil let process about 10 minutes
took it out didn't even drive in here
completely put the auger guy in two-tone
in to give us way me red tick and I got
these colors let me go look at Oriel I
feel did you let me know and I'll do it
however um I can't say I'm a huge fan of
hair the frontal I wipe the frontal I
didn't have to do engineer the
customizer so it's been giving me like
nothing but like goodness the front
white light but the hair itself it came
a little on the drier side and I'm not
sure what that was about the hair didn't
feel like super process so it was more
on the more version each side in my
opinion like they saw herself those more
the courts dryer side and so when I
bleached it ice like that made a little
more dry although you can't necessarily
tell you can tell a luster the luster
isn't as high as the mustard my hair
normally is and you have to look kind of
you to pay attention car things or
defeated by pizza luster is pretty low
and also I'm because the hair is well on
the dry side is very hard from the flyer
and curl the hair that was the way I
want to curl it because I mean this curl
is
so not being fired off but because the
hair is more on the drier side and maybe
I damaged the commercial I bleach in it
which I really shouldn't have because
usually with hair it shall leave be able
to take one application of bleach which
this one was I'm really not sure wife's
giving me issues but it's not letting me
perlozzo every curly and it's kind of
annoying because I didn't this opposed
to be so much better I mean I like it
I'm new to better my hair with some more
defined curl there's more wavy look but
I can't do it because I and you'll see
in the video it won't curl do I want to
curl so that's happening out of hair I'm
going to be conditioned it and I'll come
back to them to show you guys even made
a difference clay love this color I love
this wig I really definitely much every
mislead which is funny because I
originally made this way for my friend
grows too small for her head so I just
kept it on my thigh okay let's also just
pumping with it and I am loving the
color I'm just kind of annoyed stuff
with cooperating with heat so unless I'm
six fat I may not make a video on my cat
fix dryer hair I'm not sure how I'm
gonna make it work but that smarted your
despair it's beautiful colors nice
console I have a gripping shedding but
it's for the canvas and I don't think
that issues need to stand after one
application with this because I believe
stand where all the hair I gets in in it
it doesn't use it so I'm not sure where
is it wrong but um that's my finish but
um where you know since tutorial I'm
gonna try to stop my hair at the
beginning of it you have to see them to
cancel that I Maggie strictness look
which I love remote and I'm if you like
videos like this be sure you've a thumbs
up so I you notice and be sure to
subscribe and I'll see you guys later
alright committed my hair really fast I
want to go for like a glam me look only
to comes with a red a bold red lips I
just feel like maybe if I want to do
something kind of bold but not like too
bold I don't know if you guys could read
my mind but I just loved this look by
laying straight so I happen to something
to it I just don't know what why for
example I want something that glows with
my bang teeth
looking like this I'll show you
fluttering I don't know this is platform
I don't know if I'm room eaten but in
living in mind to be open things look
how cute Maori though wasn't my to begin
with this will listen when she had hair
and I don't know how it ended up with me
but I mean if I bought it and I knew
where to get it from I totally tell you
guys but I really don't know I'm sorry
but um it's a good pattern so go so very
slowly so this hair it's like I don't
know I think up I doubt I over bleached
it um I think maybe does it take if I
take it just a bleach well I think I mix
in it because it comes right it out at
the same time the hair whether it's
super moisturized to begin with so I
mean that's that because I'm usually
when hair is more silky you can like
flatter the piece and just goes like
smoothly but this one it's like you feel
some friction so I mean I'm not sure
what that's about but it's a little on
the drier side so I'm definitely up some
moisture is in chalk figure out why I
want that curl
this is really hard what I want it to
all go in words like that kind of I
never do that I never flat on in words I
should know that I maintain no longer
discovered I said his hair is a little
drier so it's hard to run the salon
right through it like I have friction
and if you watch my before you know that
it shouldn't be that way if you don't
saying like it's not curling the way I
want to curl hmm
fast-paced all right I'm gonna add a
little curl it off camera just clan
gonna be super stressed about doing on
camera and then I'll come back what I
mean I guess I just asked to review the
harris move on the dry side it I want to
ask all to the Long Parliament I have to
be a month old and I just I don't think
the necessary so my size so something
like similar to this before I thought at
least try a style out camera so you get
to see how it styles and you see kind of
issues because the dry mint um when I
first got a hair what is super dry will
also wasn't super on the silk aside
either so I mean I'm not sure what I
expected but I'm going to stop so that's
my ability of oil and I'll let you guys
know if it makes me difference and I'll
just be Rebecca my hair is done I'm not
going to I mean yes I'll be right back
alright so which is look style it to be
honest it was struggle like honestly
like this is not how I envisioned
looking when I dyed his hair and
bleached in and blow-dry look I didn't
think it would be hard to flatter in it
but I'm learning that it is and I mean I
don't know I mean I guess is fine but I
want how to curls into the outside
father and I'm not flattered by the hair
the curls well you can't
the coat can be tight if they can't
properly roll on the platter not even
trying to wand and this wasn't working
so that's bad I mean what's about to
make up I just yeah it's kind of
annoying but I mean I'm not sure I can
do about it I don't know if it'll make a
difference might be conditioned the hair
I think this is how the hair is I don't
know I'm going to try to finish it once
I realize this hair color on me and I
went this wig
little looks very natural and I'll be
you guys but right now I'm not really
liking the hair like I like the color
the color is beautiful but the hair is a
little too much on the dry side for me
so let's do makeup so first needs this
Tarte Queen great timeless primer and
I'm going to you mammalian soap set in
my nose area because that's where you
have support and whatnot and just like a
sticker primer so it's just you know
make your crease malas I pour to the
anything oh you want to I want to try I
want to try on I can wear where they do
let me use glue s luggage charcoal
powder and then you make a little masked
thing you or try that just to see the
word for me because my nose have been
caught in a hole blush look little tiny
pimples I don't know what they are but
I'm assuming has do my pores so everyone
on top time for my benefit Jerome each
pearl highlighter I use use of a primer
time I haven't used in a while
it's a highlighter bracelet it's Mason's
it primers well on top of another primer
because it just makes your makeup look
very illuminating from underneath more
of a pinky size but I mean it doesn't
really affect the makeup application it
has a change of color anything it just
gives you a nice glow with this some
kind of H I'm taking my next total
control foundation and the shade 14 can
I'm just a neutral total mixing and
blending
I'm use dis Black Beauty Blender sponge
I must pray one more piece I'm sprayed
you should Anthony a little bit kind of
way too lazy to go to the sink
I know what this is not going to work
out let me have your lazy out here back
okay what's this button so should work
much better now
oh yes much more fluffy and still
breaking out co-directed sludge
so I never really gave me the covers on
going forth I've been taking my car
fixed total cream color foundation it's
super thick I'm just going to run my
sponge to it and and go back over please
work like I want one more coverage
because local ish shear on me alright
Mike sir I want to extra Bryce I'm K by
Kevin across and some enhancers and when
I like tap a little bit I'm going for
like a flaw was the I've been watching
videos a lot it's on like the local
YouTube account and I've been watching
like the dragon in Jamaica and they just
do it so good you watch it'll look so
flawless and inspired you to your makeup
so yeah I want my niggas installs like
that so I'm talking something my
benefits shy beam and it is a liquid
highlighter it's pink I like the
brightness and abs so I'm going to put
that top before bloomin concealer out
we have to watch some videos I'm telling
you inspire you to your makeup or like
what the heck and you learn new tricks
to your let go there's a lot of I
learned I didn't know so I like watching
them be you know it's fun it's inspiring
and you learn new stuff so the other
core that I'm just going to wind it up
all right come on deadly atmosphere I'm
going to set underneath my eyes or the
place I considered my airspun powder
I'm not going to cream contour always
because I'm going to do some intense
power contouring so I don't want it to
be too much so I'm since get to clean
contour today the air type powder really
smells like baby powder to me would you
guys want a video of me testing like
baby powder like what other parents make
they can use I think you like cornstarch
for your makeup I want to go to text
like see like maybe like ah excellent
video on that Rachel hands up I don't
get copier in fact I know someone to do
the reason I can't put my finger right
okay yeah I'm gonna look and after I
won't do it I'll just maybe link it but
um maybe I'll try it I want to try like
asleep it works and wait a minute baby
powder cornstarch
this will show fadi powder will repeat
it I should be passing 30 of all time

don't want brush away with this plunge
Michael into my brows I'll Kimberly fast

really want to use because I'm going to
do a winged liner
I hope never do those from Chris
karageorge Amber's whatever I want to do
more new things if you notice I'm using
props I hardly ever use because every
video want to try to add at least
products that I haven't used already
have a lot of products where you know
when you get your key products you
always want to use me love the most
that's what I do but I understand how
that could be annoying because they're
not texting to discover your products
I'm watching me you're kind of watching
me to a face routine so I mean at least
if I do similar to be routine it could
be many products and maybe you like one
time or the other
I don't know but anyways I was ruined
before she used this Tarte liner at all
nothing is bad and never been used
before I'll just going to make it work

so I just get all your brush add too few
set now subscribe my under eye to come
to a little bit me use this Tarte
cosmetics x makeup I Shayla
it's a contour palette I'm going to take
the yellow banana shade first and just
for a little bit of you can I just
brighten it look at a gold pan right I'm
so low on forehead to see everybody's
highlighting the contour and use a
fluffier brush all because this contour
shade is very pigmented I don't want to
be harsh
tell me the smaller body brush to go to
my knowledge I'm going to go back
we're not my fortified room work I
realize I put too much on it's good to
look at your makeup in different angles
correctly noticing that you don't like
sometimes my nose contour rule is great
straight facing forward but if I turn to
a size when you can see different lines
are little too harsh so you kind of want
to look at every English to make sure it
looks good angle and I will see another
to the side to kind of see the cab so
you want to make sure that you know
everything is blended it is looking
different angles
Kylie's Dinoco powder by Mac Daddy and
use the same brush I use to highlight
and ease my eyes and this gonna press it
on I've learned that when you brush this
powder off and relief goes right away
like you know state because it's a loose
powder so you have to press it if you
want in to stick to your skin and you
want to work into you to another layer
Brian little
