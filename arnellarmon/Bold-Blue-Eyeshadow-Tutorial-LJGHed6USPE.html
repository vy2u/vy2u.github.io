first prep my skin I pretty much went to
sleep last night we're in these v2
oxygen I mask and so now I'm taking them
off it's like the most relieving feeling
in the world the masks are like a jelly
sticky texture so they're very
comfortable underneath the eyes and they
don't move anywhere and they also have a
very cooling and hydrating effect to
them it pretty much proven eyebags lines
wrinkles they're also very fun to play
with you see me I just love the sticky
and cooling feeling to them I just been
needing them a lot lately and if you
follow me on snapchat you've seen him on
my snap at least three or four times
because it they're pretty much all I've
been using lately and to moisturize I'm
used to this night cream from h2o I'm
using night cream during the daytime
because whenever it's cold I like to use
night cream because I just keeps my skin
extra hydrated because it's extra thick
so to prime my face I'm used as a lego
primer you could get this at simply
makeup calm if you follow me on snapchat
you see I posted a package I got from
them so I tried to use a lot of the
products they send me in this video so
that if you decide to recreate the look
or you know if you like how the products
came out on me you can go buy them from
the same site so here I'm just color
correcting I also got this concealer
from simply makeup they kind of had
every single la girl product so it's
pretty convenient if you like la girl
they also have these masks lashes but
I'll talk about that soon I have to
explain what I'm doing now taking my
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation I'm
applying it the way J Linda's cuz it
looks really cool if you know Jalen
she's on YouTube too and I'm gonna
pretty much blend that with the artiste
brush the original not the fake ones
that everyone's been trying to make but
they can't make their original cuz
there's a cheap version sorry I just
hate when people totally take a few boos
ideas and they try to sell it for
cheaper that's not nice
but anyways I blend majority of it out
and then I go in with the Beauty Blender
sponge and I'm just gonna blend my life
away until I have to apply my concealer
which is gonna happen in 5 4 3 2 1
concealer time I totally missed using la
girl concealer sorry I'm freaking out
cuz it looks super duper orange but yeah
I'm using this la girl concealer in the
shade medium beige it's a perfect shade
3 because it's like brightening but it's
not too light to where I look like I'm
casket ready
I just using these concealers maybe
realize how much I miss them but the
thing is a lot of places that sell these
concealers I don't know what it is and I
mentioned this in a video before
sometimes the concealers are grainy and
watery and it's the weirdest thing ever
like I ordered I think every single
shade yeah I was like in bulk i order
every single shade of these concealers
from this one so I caught iCade house
and literally half of them had that like
grainy watery crap going on with them
and I'm like what the heck so when I got
this package I was so scared I was like
please let these concealers be normal
luckily they were I got lucky because
like yeah I don't know I really don't
know I wish someone could explain to me
why they do that sometimes I think it
has to do with them you know maybe where
they're stored or the temperature I'm
not quite sure but if you own these
concealers and that's happened to you
let me know and let me know how you
fixed it because I have like half of
these concealers that I can't really use
because we're tripping out on me
after I Frank I don't blame that out I'm
going to contour using this shade I
believe it's clock toast I'll call all
the details in the description box I'm
pretty sure its toes because toast is
the one I've always used a I'm just
gonna contour and I'm gonna oh gosh I
made the mistake of contouring my nose
which I always regret doing in videos it
takes me forever but if you want to skip
ahead just see the eye shadow look you
could totally do that I won't be mad or
maybe you can stay because I just
realized that in this part actually kind
of messed up and put too much you know
of the contour so I mean you can see how
I fixed it and maybe learn something I
don't know it's up to you
did anyone actually watch all that
blending that took forever anyways when
I'm done I just said with my eyes my
Laura Mercier powder and then yeah my do
all that sitting and then we're gonna
get to the eyeshadow part
hi Annalee first I'm getting this peachy
shade from Inglot the number will be in
the description box and I'm using that
as a transition shade I actually didn't
even use primer for this I'll go with
that
the next shot I get is other in cloud
shadow east of my absolute favorite and
I neglected for so long until I filmed
this video now if I want to use older
shadows it's like the best shadow ever
sometimes using these to kind of warm my
eye up and then gain this one blue
eyeliner pencil from la girl I'm not
quite sure of a name but I'll put in
description box I also got some simply
makeup and I'm using as a base for my
blue eye shadow
so after I get to applying them to them
blending out the brush a little bit
before I apply the shadow and the
shadows I'm going to be using are from
the juvies place nubian 2 palette so I'm
taking this blue shade right here at the
shade Cleopatra and I'm gonna Pat that
all over my lid so when I'm gonna plan
that shadow I'm getting this other blue
liner awesome la girl and I'm just
placing on the middle up in my lid and
this is to create dimension in just to
make the look look extra cool and I'm
gonna blend out my finger and I'm also
gonna put some glitter on it I never
used glitter for this exciting the
glitters from megabee cosmetics I can't
remember the exact name but it will be
in the description box below just like
everything else will be Oh BAM wait
random but follow my Twitter I made one
and actually is it check the description
box back to you and tweet me cuz I'll
totally follow you back some nice
non-tech miss orange shade in this
darker burgundy shade I'm just gonna
place on my crease err because I wanted
to look more smokey and more I guess
deep in but don't worry the cool thing
about using like a dark color on the lid
is that you could always go back over it
and you came and tell that you fixed it
now I'm taking those two liners I'm
gonna get the dark blue one else the
lighter blue one I'm gonna place it in
my waterline so when I'm done with that
I'm going to take that orange shade I
used earlier and just go underneath my
waterline just to make a look more
smokey and that is the eye look I did my
brows off-camera I do have part
tutorials both using a cream and a
pencil I'll link those in the
description box you could watch those
I'm deciding my face is in my black
radiance powder as well as this brush
from simply makeup it's by urban studio
I've never heard the brand before I snow
their brushes are super bomb and they
have to be affordable because everything
else Emily makeup is affordable
so I'm probably gonna invest in buying
some more of those brushes probably for
my kid and for myself
so for blush muses when my city color
cocteau stick coconut it looks very soft
like I want some of my skin but it
actually gives my skin the perfect flush
it's a trip I just love blush like these
cuz they're never too much especially
for bold eye looks I like to use blushes
that are subtle but that you could still
tell the other bear now for highlight
I'm using my gilded honey like always
I'm gonna find new one of these they're
three dollars though you know there you
can get a freaking house for three
dollars that's a lot I'm cheap I think
everything's a lot but I mean it's worth
it the other day I gone my living room
wearing my nose highlight like always
good super cute and that first thing my
aunt said was whoa your nose is shiny
and look at her like thank you like I've
been waiting for someone to say that to
me I don't put nose hile on for no
reason I want people to see that it's
there after I'm done blessed in my face
I'm gonna set it with my setting spray
I'm gonna put mascara on off-camera this
is the mascara I used and bam I'm s
scare it up now for my lips I'm using
this one lip liner I don't know what it
is it's so short it's almost gone I have
to I have to go look I have to go
discover my life but the lipstick I'm
using is cap on deed bows and arrows
Oh anta thinking my lips were a little
too light so I end up adding this
colour-pop lipstick and the color grunge
just to make my lips more Brown but not
too Brown I just want the mail you show
up on my face or show up in the pictures
and for my lips on I'm gonna go
gig land up and this is me now looking
all cool with my custom-made choker and
my hair done and some earrings and this
is a complete look I really appreciate
