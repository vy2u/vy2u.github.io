hey guys welcome back to my channel a
new welcome I really want to come up
with a new intro for starters so your
commented they're like girls you can be
better than that I don't like what else
am I supposed to say hey guys my name is
Darnell I should start introducing
myself to you because he may be new and
you may not know my name
I don't know anyways welcome back Kelli
common real well my new intro should be
because I didn't con Tyra saying the
same thing I just don't know where to
say so coming I'm a little bit any ideas
but I did notice on this book I'm really
excited because I've I lied back to
filming again and I wanted to do more
makeup looks quite miss doing my makeup
and I honestly I just do so much hair I
just wanted I forget like hey you like
doing makeup to you and I'm yeah this
look it's like I don't even know how to
describe it I didn't really have a
specific plan I know I want to do
something glowy and I wanted to now look
go this hair color but I end up doing
colors that usually would not do like
this color color usually would not do it
but somehow I've worked out and I really
like it it's so like springy and so
brightens like so cool being a bright
see this video I'm talking my hair a
little bit because I'm in a service
insurance um I don't want to tear since
Coachella cause the first time I work
when I post that video and I'll into
some comments to when I post that video
lodging like the hair color which is
really weird to me because I didn't
really like it to be honest of I thought
now I did fix the hair by dying the
roots dark I thought this hair color
match my skin tone a little too much and
it made me look weird
I don't know like anyone like the name
is kind of like okay like that's a
shocker because I wasn't really a huge
fan of it I just want to work I thought
it looked good with the look of what you
did but um yeah I would like to insult
okay like have to do a video soon
clearly people like this hair so this
hair is from Celie hair i hope i
pronouncing it right i'm an insert their
name right here they're on Aliexpress
they sent me 3 bundles and a frontal so
I made this wig I'll have three bottles
in a frontal actually use a two and a
half bundles because since the hair it
came too short I didn't even cut it
I kind of like some layers in the back
but this is like the base length it's
like I want to say 12 inches or 10 I'll
put all the main detail this with your
marker somewhere on the video but they
said me sure bundle by purposely acts
which are bundled because I want to like
hash your hair I'm at a lot of short
hair stores come up soon to clay
I've been requesting shorter bundles and
companies because I'm like a luxury
looks good on me sometimes I don't know
I just I'm tired of cutting all the long
carry half but it send me these bundles
and to get this color believe it or not
all I did was bleach it one time and
that's it now I did by the roots but the
picture you guys saw this picture all
entering in in order to see my roots
look at our expedite shadow line because
I was tired then look at too light but I
decided diet Brown you know just so I
went to do anymore and now I like the
wig much more but this blonde color it's
literally just from bleach it looks
highlighted listen I put a lot effort to
it
but I didn't like the bundles which so
nicely like when I put the bleach of the
bundles wanna start processing superfast
took like 10 minutes to get this color
but it's like it was perfect I don't
know how I got so blessed but it was
perfect and I think this color it's like
although is it a lot of girl on me I
understand why you guys liked it now
because it's like it just looks really
really cool so yeah now I didn't smell
myself bleaching it because I thought it
would turn out exactly how this other
diet I did turn now I already have a
hundred blocks tutorial but honestly
it's like there's really not much to it
you literally just publish in the hair
and if you guys want me to do tutorial
like on some other Harry have I will but
a probably waste time because it's
literally like just put bleach in hair
let it sit and then you see the color
lifting and just rinse it out and then
you just get this very simple but I mean
he doesn't want a tutorial amino not do
it but yeah about this hair I already
have the opinion on it because I've had
it
I yeah I've had a problem for months now
so I can be able to actual at the review
and it's gonna be really quick because
honestly it's short hair its lo mein and
so it's like I don't have much to say
about it the frontal I have no Shetty
that's when the guide will plan I have
no shedding which is a shocker because
either when you bleach hair you will get
shedding and experience no shedding
I will think the hair is a little bit
dry
a drier side and that's because I
believe without deconditioning it
but I mean the way I wear it and I'm
wearing the same style since I'd you
know started wearing it I just kind of
curl it and I'd to brush the curls out
so it's all fluffy and wavy for the way
I wear it the dryness doesn't really
affect it now probably wear it straight
yes the dryness be more noticeable and
you'll look more stiff but because I'm
wearing a wild like this the dryness it
doesn't really you know you can't really
tell I know that words the condition the
hair really treat it the dryness will go
away but I mean I kind of like let it
see and that's way the only next thing
I'd say that's the only thing is me
believe she made it dry when I haired
came to me it was perfect it was so
silky and so soft but I bleached excite
no I like doing too much but yeah it's
looking to say that it's a little dry my
recipients no shedding no other issues
and them that's my take on that I really
have nothing else to say
I like this wig especially now that died
the roots dirt this week a comfortable
did I hurt my head I just have elastic
bed to keep it
staying on I don't have any glue up here
anything I would want to add a little
bit of baby hair because like the part
looks a little just too street but um
that's all so I know what you guys watch
the rest this video miss mania makes
tutorial I show myself style the hair a
little bit but honestly I'm nothing
about this hair it holds curls really
well because I don't like to close with
maybe twice and I come just let it be I
put it on my head I'll probably curl
like you know one or two pieces just to
make it look more uniform and that's all
I have to do that's whatever well like
for this style but yeah I'm religion
executed watch this video other ones and
should be too long I just want to go
over the hair because a lot of you guys
asked about it and yeah if you enjoyed
this video please give a thumbs up to
subscribe and I'll see you in my next
one
so I've already gelled on my hair my wig
cap on and now flip on the wig honestly
this wig is so convenient in so low
maintenance because since the curls stay
in the hair for a very long time
I hardly ever saddle it I mean I'll have
like curl like a piece or two that got a
plane so for the most part I could just
put this wig on and pretty much go I
really don't have to do much to it and
because I have elastic band sewn on it I
don't have to you know put my little
free spray or glue it down because the
last event keeps it flat on my head so
I'm just show you guys you know me
styling for a little second and then
we're gonna jump into my makeup
so I did my brows off-camera and now to
primer skin I'm using my color FX
mattifying primer I like this perm
because I get pretty oily and I just
like how it feels like it doesn't have a
silicon e-billing to it kind of like a
watery kind of filling - I can't really
describe I really like it I'm take this
NYX illuminating like cream limpieza
bottle right here it's called born to
glow liquid illuminator it's like a rose
gold color I'm just using that to make
my skin and glow underneath my
foundation now I'm going to take my
anastacio stick foundation in the shade
amber and I'm going to use that as my
foundation of course exfoliation and
then after I apply that on my skin I'm
going to take my Tarte sponge like
always and I'm going to blend it out
chickens on taking my tart shape taste
concealer I use to shade sometimes just
to have like a brighter look I feel like
I've been using a lot of same products
lately like I try to switch it up but I
just have some products that I love that
I know for a factor to look good but you
guys have new products or prospect you
guys want me to try in general to test
them out please let me know and I'll
just videos like wear test or you know
just those this really work you know
those kind of videos I want to do more
of those on my channel I feel like it'd
be fun and entertaining and I mean I
could even like volley it I could do a
lot of stuff okay I want to do a lot of
stuff for my channel so if you have
products that you guys want me to try
that I haven't tried yet just comment
down below and I mean I'll buy it I'll
cash out and we'll see how it works if I
don't like it I'm returning to my money
book alright to calm time use another
anti statistics foundation and it's in
the shade I want to say it's walnuts and
I curved the contour upwards to make my
cheekbones pop more than the our review
and so yeah I'm just going to blend that
out with my same Tarte sponge
Matis have a place that can say let me
use my RC ma no color powder mixed my
banana powder although there's powders
like no color powder I feel like a
little white on me sometimes maybe I'm
doing wrong but I mixed my banana power
just add like a little yellow tint to it
and I've spent my entire face I'm use my
black radiance soft focus powder and I'm
just going to you know set around the
powder I put underneath my eyes and I'm
gonna go back a little more powering my
eyes just to catch any fallout from when
I do my eye shadow
so I did one of my eyes off camera I
liked it you know hi I'm trying really
like beat out here you still leave
anyways on to prime my eyelid I mean
he's my lemonade prime by benefit and
I'm just going to them do the kids do
these days on prime eyelids and then for
my eyeshadow I'm using the violet Voss x
low early palette I'm grabbing it that's
what you hear cuz I'm actually made the
colors this time the first color I'm
going to take is this color cod pris pot
wonder what that is
it's my base shade and I'm going to use
out my entire lid that will take this
shade called mama bird and I'm going to
use that to put on top of pressed pot
it's so fun to save actually I showed
names I never actually see them
and then I'm gonna take this shade
called ragamuffin
what's a ragamuffin Laura what is that
I'm gonna google it once I nice
so ragamuffin is a person typically
child in ragged dirty clothes hmm all
right well also next I'm going to take
the shade called Alabama Alabama mix
with a shade called bub
I don't you like these names you're kind
of cute babe I've never actually freakin
read the names but they're kind of cute
we have a mix let's you shades together
I added bubs because I was tired of
using just warm shades sounds like damn
let me just add like a cool shade in
here see you guys cuz like not sad to
the same looks all the time so that's
why I mix it to you and obviously make
it look look much better so um yeah
we're going to blend that and I just
keep going in and in in a new noon until
it gets darker and I just take my time
with it so that it doesn't mess up or
look bad
now I'm gonna take my Mac mixing medium
and I make it this shade called
hissy-fit with a really really pretty
fold group foil gold color super foiled
now my I shall look into messin up
during the day because okay with mixing
medium if you have hooded lids after you
put okay you use a mixing medium first
then you put the shimmer then you have
to seal the shimmer with the mixing
medium that take it's not transfer onto
your lids if you don't do that then it's
going to transfer all on your crease and
so like that yeah so do that if you had
to the lids you have to put them where
it makes a medium on top just to make
sure the shimmer does get on your crease
because in em happen to me later on this
date now to line my eyes I'm going to
use this mica beauty liner it's I mean
it's black pretty simple I really like
it I want about the Inglot one though
Ivan mean the bite I just never go to
stone ridges and that's where they sell
it it's a Dublin was like 20 minutes
away from me I know you guys look at my
life story but that's my excuse but
anyways I'm just going to be like a cute
little line I'm not gonna line my whole
entire lid I'm just going to like a
little wing because that's what part
you're going to see because one for my
lashes on you won't be seen in there
anyways now that this new bound some
lashes and this is the style where's the
bug for deciding oh I'm getting hot
Bristol and if you don't like lashes but
you like lashes get these lash because
they're so natural looking and they're
so lightweight I wore them literally all
day I just took them off before I did
this voiceover they're so comfortable I
forgot I had them on so yeah definitely
get these now for my lower lash line I'm
gonna take this shade mash Lee and I
decided to add this shade because I want
to pop a color I'm trying to avoid doing
basic looks like I keep saying so I
thought it'd look really pretty and I
think this totally brought the entire
list together and I totally did not
regret agnus color if you want you got
any called like blue purple maybe not
purple but Blu Panem yeah best eye look
now time to finish the face so my
desktop my powder for some reason but
this is so satisfying to do I love
you know of my exes powder my powder and
now I'm going to bronze my face using
this Tarte bronzer it's like my new
favorite I'm totally dissing hoola right
now I'll use who in my next video I
select this bronzer that's more warm and
it's more pigmented you know I'm saying
so I really like it a lot for blush I'm
using my Sigma blush it's called quarter
rosa and I mean it's just soft blush
everyday blush to highlight I'm taking
my do or highlighter it's my favorite I
can't stop using it like I try to use
other highlighters but I just love this
one so much like oh it's so good it just
it's so good it's not chunky it's not
glittery I mean it's top of the line
highlight if they're not being in that
 anyways it's lime my lips I'm using
my plum lip liner by Mac see I'm
switching it up use I use my legs NYX
lip liner the same Brown one every video
I'm use my plum with this time though it
was kind of hurting my lip so kind of
sharpen it the right way to like the
wood off my pencil was like hello
straight my lip but you got to what you
guys do now for lips I'm taking this
smolder cosmetics times its mu Ashley
and it's a shade libby you guys very
liquid lipstick formulas so good it's my
first time ever using these and i was so
shocked like I was looking sugar they
didn't feel like anything and now I'm
going to mix the shade peachy-keen off
my Ashley and I just mix the two
together kind of create a custom color
just because but even with putting to
layer this on I swear you guys like I
wanna I want to look on the side to see
we have a good brown shades like oh my
god I look right now
well okay when I'm not there you know go
look but they do I'm ordering it because
the formula is so freaking tonight's
like mark my words like to really try
them and let me know what you think or
if you try them already comment down
below what you think so I'm pretty sure
it's goofy but yeah I'm just um going
back over to line my lips to make sure
that the pink kind of like goes on my
skin too if you know what I'm saying
now all the kind of the cool products
the semi
Faceman is Murphy setting spray and it's
so cool you guys they just came out with
it and it's like I can't explain it
but if I missed it's like it's so weird
I like it because you do with setting
sprays and get your face too wet but
because it's amidst it like evenly coats
your face all the way through if this
makes any sense at all it's really
freaking cool like you guys have to try
it like I really really good look that's
what I'm going to use it all down be sad
but it's like 15 dollars or something
super cheap so I'll definitely buy it
again anyways um now I'm done talking
this is into the look I really hope you
guys enjoy this tutorial
I really enjoyed filming it I think it
looks so cute so cute
and um yeah give me a thumbs up use
those thumbs you got use it for
something and I'm on the god I forgot my
lips yeah I'll see you guys in the next
video which would be it pretty soon
because I'm on a roll here and I'm yeah
I'm done talking I feel like I'm talking
a lot so I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
