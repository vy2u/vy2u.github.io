don't do voiceovers but I like to talk
to you guys so to explain what I'm
wearing I have my checkered board vans
these are super dirty but that's okay
because they're supposed to be dude they
look great when they're dirty they have
character and I paired that with a black
pair of jeans or PacSun along with my
Urban Outfitters do better hat with a
plain white tee from Uniqlo now if you
want to add more to this throw in a pop
of color
throw on a hoodie this yellow hoodies
for H&amp;amp;M I know the cancelled but super
cute I'm still gonna wear it and I'm I
mean it's only what I have so i could
have to wear it and there you go you
have a super effortless swaggy outfit
and that's look number one number two
had everyone shook on instagram i have
on these red adidas i got like four
super cheap these camouflage pants I got
from this shop on Melrose
I don't really name though and I have on
this shirt from Outfitters that came
like pretty long but I cut it
well I stained it if you ever seen a
shirt if it took at the bottom half that
shirt just cut it you got a crop top I
saved you and um I add the shoes the red
because it goes to the red and a shirt
it just complements each other so well
it looks so effortless I love it you got
to sue me wear this up again because I
mean I techie didn't wear it is just for
this video so um that's look number two
we good third look is a super chill
outfit I am wearing this skirt from
boohoo is like five dollars on sell this
broken shirt from PacSun this jean
jacket I got at a thrift store that's
why I get all my jean jackets because
they're always super cool and super
cheap with this hat I got on Venice
Beach along with my dirty van slyke
these vans look really good with these
type of skirt so that's I wore it and I
just paired this together
super chill supervise be super
effortless and I yeah hope you guys like
it
boy look is even more honestly all the
outfits in this freaking video chill so
I'll say that we're a lot I have on my
high-top vans I have two pairs of these
because I love them paired with these
jeans with PacSun that are way to rip
because my thighs are really thick and I
ripped like the top part so they're
super ripped but it's totally cool look
super chill and I paired that with this
diamond spike host shirt that I got from
zoomies just pop of yellow pop of color
makes everything look good all right
boom fifth outfit I have these red shoes
that I ordered online but they have them
in like finish line pair with these
pants I got from Marshalls in the boys
section so they fit pretty tight they're
small but they're in the boy section
they make your butt look nice paired
with this white shirt that I got from
this site I think they're called like
fan New Year it'll be in the description
box along with everything else and so if
you want a pop of color you could throw
in a jacket you could throw in a jean
jacket however I want on this red one
because I thought it popped and I got
this red jacket from Dee Dee's I just
also throw these together
I just beware whatever I want to wear
and I make it look cool so that's a
Alpha number five
alphy number six so um this one's kinda
interesting this I don't see like my
favorite wool my second favorite in this
video because I put two patterns
together I know it seems kind of unusual
but I like putting like patterns that
normally wouldn't go together together
so I have my flannel tied around my
waist with some light wash blue jeans
and some all-white adidas pair with an
Adidas shirt in a camouflage jacket and
I always have my beats headphones on
with me because it just complements any
type of green I'm wearing so it kind of
like makes the Jack and make sense if
that makes any sense at all I know these
patterns like you would never put them
together but I'd have to like that you
don't have to wear the jacket though you
could just wait like the flannel and the
shirt by itself
super chill super cool this part proved
that loser cuz I was trying to be cool
in my arm completely miss the frickin
sleeve but um yeah that's outfit number
six final Alfie my favorite one I have
my gray my New Balances pair with my
black packs on jeans with this
camouflage Huff shirt with an orange
logo which i pair with my orange hat so
it goes so well together it's like ooh
but it looks like super effortless then
I have my headphones I wear them with
everything along with this great jacket
that my mom gave me I don't know where
it's from and this the final outfit so
um yeah
