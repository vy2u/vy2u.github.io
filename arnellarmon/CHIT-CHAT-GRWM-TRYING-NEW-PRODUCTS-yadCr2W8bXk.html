you're new welcome I haven't filmed in
like a week so format kind of weird it's
because I'm not used to filming with you
know YouTube you have to be so
consistent with it because if you go
like a week 26 days to a week without
filming when you start filming again
when I tell you it's so weird it is so
weird
but today's video I'm just gonna get
ready with me just using new products I
have so many more products I've got the
colour-pop collection the one they'll be
in Sephora I think it's aren't Sephora
actually and just a lot of new products
that I want to try that I thought our on
camera now before I see this video I
also have a new way which I know you
guys are probably asking about so I'm
just gonna mention it right now this way
is good I guess I'm looking at the part
it looks beautiful
anyways it's from Jas a Luxury
Collection now this wig is pre plucked
they come to replenish awesome because
if you don't watch my videos you know
that nerve to make a look natural you
have to pluck the hair line or you're
gonna lose a Ken doll I've already doll
pretty much it's gonna be obviously of a
wig please witness come through pluck
we're just awesome for beginners they
also offer different lace colors which
is awesome because if you know how is
you know that you want the lace to match
your scalp the most it looks natural so
when I stopped this wick I actually
didn't wear any weight cap at all to
show you guys how well the lace blends
to my scalp or how well it looks like
scallop but I have no I wanted to show
you guys but I mean you kind of see
under here widen it glue it down I have
no wig cap underneath it's strictly lace
I did Lisa knots to give them more
natural parents that's all you have to
do it just place your knots straighten
the hair style however you want and then
it looks flawless like this so if you're
interesting this wig as well as either
they offer other units like curly hair
shorter hair you don't
the typical wig styles are interesting
that all the links will be down below
and then let's get started about the
makeup all right so I'm so weird let's
tuck this I don't wanna show my lace
okay new primer so I have a new friend I
own all use okay okay so what I'm gonna
use to prime my skin it's technically
not a primer but I see
instagramers YouTube uses a primer
apparently used for everything it this
prasada unicorn essence you guys know
they use it for everything their lips
their lashes everything you can think of
so we're used to prime my skin we put it
on like an instagramer you know the
little Instagram videos with okay so I'm
gonna run into my skin it's not very
good actually
not as a scent to me um a while ago and
I'm just not using this other one said
to me as well but I actually put it in
the back if I'm like piling up to do a
giveaway so I'm not gonna use that one
just gonna use this one
it smells yeah it smells like something
that I kept my finger on it has like a
sweet smell to it um I like the feel of
it
I'm gonna check out these nails yes and
I'm sipping on I never honest I never
leak on my forehead it's pointless and
my bangs would be covering her so I'm
accident clipped my fangs because I know
it'll be annoying to keep pushing them
back and do you ever watch videos of
someone doing the makeup with their hair
down and ever sometime they touched my
face they keep moving their bangs out
and you're just like just I don't want
to be that guy so I'm gonna do it
alright so I want a goalie face now I
don't know everyone I use um let's see I
have this first Ollie jellybean
highlight which I feel like I'm gonna
use but colour-pop also sent this
crystal liquid highlighter
however the texture of this stuff is not
my favorite um I don't know I don't know
what they wanted people to use this for
it says for crystals whose infused glow
use one or two pumps and apply on two
faces and fingers or a brush
mix me with your foundation of
moisturizer for overall radiant look so
I'll try using a moisturize because
based on how it feels I don't think this
would mix well like it feels
I can't explain it but the texture is
not working for me
well I'll try to find someone else to
use it with so I'm I'll just go with his
jelly bean highlighter pie um for Sally
I've actually used this in the previous
video and I used it as like a base for
my highlight and I mentioned that they
work the best for me and they actually
emailed me and told me other ways to use
it so they said I can use it either
mixed in with my foundation or before my
foundation so I'm going to use it before
to like you know just have a glow
because I want to use it you know it
seemed like a pretty nice product well I
just use two for solid products in a row
I promise this isn't sponsored by than
bt-dubs I just I have them somebody use
it
okay all right so I've been looking in
that was pretty nice usually what I use
like illuminators before I look crazy so
it's not as shimmery as I thought it
would be so Foundation
you guys probably like this cuz this is
super affordable I try to do a wear test
on this but it was just in shambles and
so anyways it's fine the ordinary it
didn't focus my guide it is by the
ordinary this is six dollars you guys
six dollars full coverage foundation I
ordered online like I said I want to do
a wear test and it's so nice like I get
compliments on everything and I'm in the
shade 3.0 why make a yellow and it
matched me perfectly and I mean I'm
Siddhant but shopping for their shades
kind of semi-difficult only because the
picture online it didn't look as we
measured so I actually bought two just
in case but this one by itself and
that's me perfectly so it's pretty nice
I just blend that out and stop talking
all right so I went on my foundation it
looks pretty nice how its masky right
here for some reason or maybe it's my
lighting I don't know um or oh it's what
that X my right there I hate when I hit
enter on my jawlines I messed up the
overall finish on my foundation main
ways to conceal I don't have to do the
detailer lay my new but I'm gonna use my
cut off concealers because these have
been my favorite as a late so I mixed
two of them I mix 10:50 and light 20
I'll let this tan it's like it's like
more so my shade and I want I want to
conceal slash highlight which is typical
everyone does and so I just like to mix
a light of color to make my perfect
shade because the light 20 by itself
would be crazy and I don't want it crazy
so I'm also gonna you know said through
my brows are looking pretty close and
related so nice to breathe those guys
alright
I'm using this cute handier I got from
TJ Maxx for $5.00 and a chat still on
there
I hate doing my brow before my
foundation because it makes it so hard
to like blend everything around it and
it's so nerve-racking so let me just use
a brush I think one I like in my
eyebrows that the concealer used to
conceal is like too light so when I do
my eyes I'm gonna fix that because
that's kind of bothering me they don't
look good I almost forgot about some new
powder I'm so happy I remembered I was
watching a gloss I love it I love these
loriel glosses these are kind of gloss I
look good even you don't have makeup on
that makes sense
we'll talk about that later so this
powder I'm gonna try my covergirl and
this is translucent medium still a
little packaging now I bought this
powder before but it was a lighter shade
so I never liked it so they made me look
like a ghost and so when I want that
longer I said you know just try the
darker shade this speed you know if it
looks better so I could be potentially
you know risking ruin my whole entire
face but no kind of spilt in the Box I'm
gonna try it anyways because I bought it
great see it's already open oh no it's
like it's all open
ooh okay I guess some spill in the
corner oh oh a little plastic bent so
there's some coming out of the sides
okay okay so I put the powder on the top
it was very messy but I'm just let you
guys know that's kind of rare because
when I first bought it that it happened
so it's price a mistake and I'm going to
play so I'll use my eyes so I think it's
like the second I don't I bring out my
shades I have the next three or four but
I know this sucker number two I
some red hens - it looks kind of pinky
in here I hope it doesn't look too bad
out of the smell County reminds me in
medicine at the doctor's office it looks
kind pinkish I don't think it looks bad
so I do one layer set and now I'm going
to do the second layer so it's able to
catch my eye shadow I love the smell I
can't explain it you'd have to buy it to
see the smell talking about or if you
have it you know what I'm talking about
smells very medicine mm all right so I
think it looks pretty decent I do so now
time for the eyes I'm gonna be using
more than one palette because I have one
palette and I want to touch them all I'm
gonna man-made I look will be done with
a 39a because these have matte colors
and then I'm going to finish it off with
a color pop palette because the color
palette our shimmer so I'm going to use
this beautiful guy right here and then
I'm going to use I don't know which one
yet but I have these two color palettes
they're all sure I think that's only
thing that kind of sucks they should
have included some mats but I'm gonna
find a way to use at least one of these
palettes so I'm using one I've camera
because I don't know what I want to do
then we do the other eye on camera so
I'll be right back
okay guys sighs you might either have
camera I don't came up with um I hope I
remember how I did it but I think it
looks pretty nice so let's just do this
before I forget okay so how about you
all three things at once all right so as
you see this residue from my concealer
creased in my eyelid so that is what I
use to prime eyelid I do that sometimes
so I'm lazy I don't want to use primer I
just used the leftover concealer I had
and so I'm gonna first go on my thirty
nine eight palette like I
shouldn't be for and I'm going to take
this shade
I'll assuming these shades I don't know
if their face shades or fishing use them
but I'm going to use this one to contour
to bronze but I'm going to use this
right here this light shade as a base so
it's base me on up and I'm using this
Real Techniques from brunch on stay
sponge it's not the best because it's
not for this but I don't like grabbing
the brush and earlier I said I do like
my concealer look it's a light I'm
actually impressed this shadow on top of
the concealer because that will tone it
down you guys see you kind of made a
little bit to me it looks like alright
so now I'm going to who I like it's so
cool how I get that see imperfection
let's fix her other than that it looks
pretty darn cool and until the five
minutes do all right so what I do next
oh so next I'm going to take we share
idea it's the one that stood out to me
the most oh that's why I used it it's
really pretty
it's your pigmented I'm gonna use that
I'm gonna start placing up all over my
lid you see it's super pigmented I want
on Japan wow that's so random I just
thought it that's what I want for dinner
okay wait so I'm gonna keep packing that
color on whatever game i man
their quality is so much better it's so
much better now I got a call about ELISA
has a code I'm observing the screen it's
like global mama or something it's girl
mama right yeah you use that girls code
I know how one alright that's pretty
cool
okay so mad
I'm gonna take it was kind of crazy the
other side I'm gonna take this shade it
mixed with this shade this darker shade
because I mean I always talked down my
eye shadow looks even though they come
out good but I don't think I'm not what
I wanna be yet yet with eyeshadow so
I've never gone with dark shades alone
when I first introduced them to my eyes
I always mix them with the previous
color because I just helps me avoid
mistakes I've learned and it just helps
me blend the best so if you're not like
the best I sort of your knew that
definitely like will help the leg of
your scared use dark shades just mix it
with a lighter shade and so it's not so
crazy when you first put it on
all right so now I'm gonna go back in
the dark shade now that I've mixed it
with a previous sheet before and it's
not too crazy I'm gonna go back in at
dark and how do we use the shape by
itself because now it's totally safe to
do so
so now I'm going to go in with this
color palette it's semi and precious
shadow palette has eight shades looks
like this really pretty and I'm going to
take this shade right here and super
smooth looks like this I'm going to use
that pretty much that's like a base come
and put another shimmer on top but I'm
gonna use that on my lid just press that
on don't worry if you get it in your
crease areas take your brush and put it
away okay Scoob all right so next me
going with this color golden state of
mind palette now this palette is click
math 15 shades five three fifteen shades
they're all shimmer completely all sugar
not sure why they did that
I know Chicago has other matte shadows I
think they should have thrown some mats
in here my notes a lot of brands they've
been doing the extremes shimmer palette
so that's why I'm gonna take this shade
right here it's like a purpley type
shade I'm using a brush it's better pie
with your finger but it's kind of hard
for me to really like get in there
without messing on my the shadow my lids
are so small so not take my Mac mixing
medium and I use that whenever I've
shimmers because I don't want to
transfer because I have clear linens and
I take a little bit of that before I put
it on the dries fast and shake out the
shadow I'm going to use I'm going to use
this Warren G shadow and I really like
what this did so look I was doing
because it kind of is kind of getting
boring I'm gonna place that only in the
corner
I'm trying to use anything to try to
help this so I'm using it's like smudger
brush pack that on and then I'm going to
place more it makes and media on my top
of that because that's going to seal it
so it doesn't transfer looking really
cool now I'm going to get a little more
mixing medium and take that first shimmy
purple shade I use and just place it on
the top so it pops even more I'm at me
to take that really dark purple shade I
used and I'm just going to like really
focusing like pack it on just to make it
look really deep right there but I feel
like that kind of makes it look look
better try to make the eyes identical
you don't want many pet peeves when I
like go to Sephora like going to like a
makeup store and there's other makeup
artists over there people let me see you
shadow close your eyes and they just
want to see my mistakes but you hate
that I'm like not closing my eyes I'm a
little that's me that's what I do okay I
do not take that really pink vibrant
shade vibrant need a word I'm still like
bringing a little bit underneath my eyes
I don't I make this I too dark or maybe
I do but I'm using very little to start
off I want to go too heavy
and I'm only doing this now news I do
this twist in but I'm only doing this
now become noticing fallout so I want to
do it while at the powder so I will
commence later I'm gonna use it I'm
going to use a little bit i dark shade
only because I thought it looks weird
with just that one color I'm going to
I'm going to precisely put it right in
the corner
you happy now looks more like complete
alright oh my I look now I'm going to
set my face and try to hurry up so it's
gonna be too long
notice on my face um use my mac studio
fix powder and this in the shade NC 45
oh wow so now cut up the power skylights
because you guys see it's at my face and
it brushed right off give me no problems
and it doesn't look too ready there
that's and one happier amount of chance
because I originally bought the first
one the lighter one years ago and after
a while this stuff's like any major
flashback it was crazy but it turns out
because it was too light I think at the
time I bodied they weren't offering it
in other shades so I mean it's pretty
cool they offer more shades now because
I actually like it like it's a really
great drugstore powder so try it out I
think I paid like maybe said between 6
to 8 dollars
it's cheaper than Laura Mercier so my
brown also drive me crazy I don't think
they look the best of all fix I'm at the
end all right so the contour are two
bronze because this shade well no this a
cool tone shade so I'm use this one
first to contour know what's really pink
to me around my brush oh my god potato
oh shoot
I not know that was gonna happen
what else great hope you guys look like
you forget this palette cuz hello
pigmented let me use some more a looser
brush so unless product gets picked up
and I'm actually just go I'm gonna mix
these shades
that looks better oh my god
all right so this height is darker
because I added the power with the you
know it didn't serve brunch but I don't
think it's too bad all rights on the
blushing use Mac plum foolery which I
think it'll go really go this I look I
can't believe to hate blush I refuse to
wear it my co-workers at Macy's have to
convince me to wear blush as I did not
like it
that's cause she's never wrong the
shades alright so not my highlights my
favorite part I don't wonder to use all
right promising attire its color pop I'm
talking too fast color pops that mean
these highlighters and they're so nice
it's like I want to use wisp what I've
had was before I want to be shook I'm
gonna use spoon and I'm gonna mix it
over the moon all that running spoon
over the moon some mix six I don't need
for meaning yeah cuz over the moon is
like an iridescent shade you got to see
let's see yeah over the moon it's not
spigots as I thought would be but have
the purple reflux oh and it does me good
that's nice pigmented because you don't
want a lot of purple highlight on you oh
you could see it though
hmm this spoon by the way we're not
spent yet it's a spoon so where's the
perp where's all that purple coming from
I was hoping that spoon was more golden
but it's not ah suck on this up so I'm
gonna just tone it down a little bit
cuz nods golden it's like I mean I guess
as it looks
I'm gonna use a little bit my nose
though like that look pretty on my nose
yes boom I thought it would have more
melanin in it um I'm so stupid
I thought spoon would have more like a
golden finish it doesn't it's more like
kind of white a little mmm
okay I'm gonna go to what I know I'm a
little wisp I want more highlight color
pop wisp was actually the very first
color pop highlighter ever I ever tried
and my friend Kim got for me for
Christmas oh so sweet of her
elack hi Kiki I'm gonna set my face yes
if I don't listen to my face we put some
time looking to myself
and I'm gonna use the doesn't smell good
use a cup setting spray it has a faint
peach smell to it looks like this so a
lot sprays out I want you guys um um be
wet Oh
could be better um it's not like crazy
it smell like oh my god like I'm so but
a lot comes on it once so feels good we
dry it all right so nice thanks Brianna
look the high looks better so for lips
I'm gonna do my mascara eyelash off
camera or else this video will be live
in so long I'm longer cut laughs to meet
all these lippies and they all look
really beautiful I believe they're all
gloss as well yeah there are flaws I
don't know which one I want to go with I
know it looks and I should go with this
one but I'm not a fan of full lips and
bold eyes at the same time I probably
will mix this in oh listen oh this is in
the gloss is like a matte lipstick so I
definitely don't want that because I
want to gloss the rest of these besides
this one
all these are glossy lips so I'm gonna
take berry weeks I feel like that would
look good and I'm going to repaint it it
was pretty no I want this color
I don't I don't I do - I did so take
that off
I want to confer - look it's way too
peachy I don't think it'll be that
peachy so we're gonna try lei Zi oh
that's my oh my gosh pretty well I'm
gonna have to buy it
my lips are big and gloss runs on me
so fast in this sense afore I'm gonna go
buy it I like it all right so I want to
use no more though I'm gonna use other
nude color cart Charlie and I put it in
the middle or mix it in a little better
if I line my lips if I don't think I
need to it's lip gloss I don't think
she'll ever lips I will a little just
tap it maybe I see one did it get just
get my lips more definition so happy I
did that all right
you know medela oh my god now I'm like
oh my lashes mascara on and I'll be back
I'll get my five thoughts on all the new
stuff that I used this is conceptual
right I need to lashes first I'm gonna
fix these brows - all right got to do my
lashes they're looking nice I forgot the
name of the company will be down below
for you I like them they're not too
dramatic you guys I don't look too
dramatic on lashes because my eyes are
already small as it is so I put it's
like it's so hard for me to find lash
the real real life because either
they're not dramatic or bold enough or
they're way to Japan to the point where
you kidding sad eye shadow so kind of
sucks the oldest item I've ever wore
that we're like perfect our New Balance
some Russian white anyways I like
everything I used only thing that I
wasn't a fan of I didn't am using was
the colour-pop liquid highlighter I knew
I wouldn't be a fan when I first watched
it I thought maybe it's something that
you could on your chest I thought they'd
be gone mid chest it doesn't a lotion it
it feels like a silicone in it I guess
like in
yeah like a text sharp edges not the
best I felt like I silicone it it has
type silicon or some sort but everything
else I loved the 3239 it's 3980 the
morphe palette super bomb you need it
because although I used you know the
more purpley tones I love purple I show
you can it's helped it has like a good
writing shape that has some blue I
scratched it has some greens like this
is a really good palette the quality
