vlog today so honest I don't wanna do
vlogmas kind of like video myth so I
just post a video every single day like
it's that cool so I felt myself you know
you do eye makeup for fun let's to music
I just I was in the mood to my makeup
but I want to use my new camera so I was
like you know let's go from being the 10
to 15 but this white stuff Mario comment
that I just had to address cuz I was
like what the 8 in my hair video ever
make a video I made a reference to coke
cuz you know white powder coat anyone
knows coke coke stroke okay I don't do
it okay someone left a comment saying oh
you know why you made that reference you
do it does this look like I mean I know
I don't know who do it they don't
looking to do it I don't do it you guys
I'd be scared too um I would never do it
in my life you couldn't pay me to do it
I just clarify that when I make jokes
like they're jokes I've seen movies I
know what coke is you know you don't do
coke and whores know what it is so
alright so now that we clear up the coke
rumors um let's continue to do this face
so I'm using the 50 Beauty primer rub
that into my skin so my favorite primers
ever they haven't used my NARS sheer
glow this is honestly my favorite
foundation I camera want to play games
with me so I forgot nation actually this
is a new bottle I've bought this
foundation for time so to say that I
love it is an understatement I suppose
of the price like I will buy this
foundation over and over again it's it's
just it's perfect coverage wise color
wise everything about it is my favorite
so I'm yeah I can apply that with this
la girl sponge comes too lazy to wash
matter ones
I'll do my makeup my frontals bother me
so I have to fix that really quick I've
said effect this you guys perfect eyes
talk so fast a perfectionist because I
could just see my little frontal line
and I was really like is very anal for
me so um I fixed that with a little bit
of powder cuz I just didn't want I don't
want to continue to video like that you
know I would have got roasted so for
could see I'm using my Tarte shape tape
and my color pop concealer I didn't
really need much the color pop one I
just used to kinda like bright enough to
conceal a little bit more and then I
went with it out with my morphe sponge
which has become a recent favorite of
mine it's perfect it's so good for
concealer it's so good for concealer
it's like in fact that it's like what
like how would I spend either 3 dollars
or 5 something super cheap Oh Alyssa
texted me I had to show you guys what
she said it was funny she goes am i cute
I swear Alyssa doesn't post stuff
without my approval without like you
know know where I think we were first so
you know I had to let her know that she
was cute you know first half I lied and
said no and I was like no you're cute or
whatever she was a whack little bit of a
concealer by Murphy sponge like I said
this is honestly every site got it I was
in LA at the morphe store it's only
could like sponge I've been use it for
my concealer and you got to see that my
video it's so good it's so good dude
if I knew what have been this good I
woulda bought more so I won't have to
clean it so much
so to contour and bronze my skin I'm
using a Nastasia stick foundation I
believe this the shade
evany um I do not know I think it's
ebony but I contoured my cheeks as well
as my jawline you know it's my double
chin is been a little Meany lately and I
blend that out with a brush
honestly um I probably should have
listened to music while filming because
I just can't stop moving to Dancy but
then again it's like listening to music
really really calms me I like having my
ears all time so this actually made it
really really fun I plan on doing like a
playlist video soon where I show you
guys like my favorite music of the
moment so stay tuned for that to shove
it on mic on so I'm just using the same
sponge that I used to blend out my
concealer without any I didn't add any
extra concealer I choose the XS conceals
all reading a sponge to just sharpen
that a bit so to set play second seal
I'm using my good ol Laura Mercier
powder on my favorite powders just like
top three and I have to make a little
joke I'm joking I'm kidding you guys I
literally don't do that um I think the
fact that someone comment that and
literally thought that I do
it's like low-key hella funny to me
because I'm just like I could just can
you really imagine someone saying
arnelle Armand does coke like he really
like is that a thing
the thought that's hella funny to me
because I'll never do that the thought
it scares me like anyways I sharpen up
my contour a little bit and then I added
a little extra powder in my eye cuz I
didn't know what kind of I shower look I
was doing so I want to make sure that um
no fallout happened before I went to my
eyes I'm gonna set my entire face really
fast it looks I didn't want those the
powder underneath my contour to sit too
long because I want it to be like brush
it away as you can see it sticks to the
skin very very well so I want to get it
ready that before I did my eyes never
left like so my skin is really dry
because it's the winter time so how
piece of skin like sticking by my lip so
I think if tweeze don't pick skin off
I'm not picking my mustache I don't have
one of those it was dry skin eyes
exfoliate
anyways after I said most of my face I'm
going to take this morphe palette it's
like the 15 something 15 si UD see my
Nike / with my mirror and I'm gonna do
like a very simple eye I don't want to
do too much but then again I wants to do
something so I didn't wanna be boring so
I just kinda like one with purple tones
like purpley and orange e tones
those are doesn't make my safe tones I
know those look good each time so
whenever I don't know why when to do my
eyes I use those shades because I mean
it looks good
each time
the next pounder going to is my hoodie
Biddy palette I kind of rolled my eyes
because I didn't want to use this
because I'm still like iffy about her
although she did emailing me expressing
her thoughts on my previous video and
just kind of explained herself which I
did appreciate she emailed me her sister
Moni mugged me as well as their PR
person they all sent very long emails
explaining you know what's really the
deal so um I didn't have a problem use
of how in the video because I got to
talk to her and kind of understand her
perspective and so I use palettes one my
favorite palettes to be honest although
I haven't always been the biggest Haiti
beauty fan and I've expressed that but
palettes really really nice like I can
use it everyday if I had to it is just
it's obviously great because it has like
my warm like tan shades and also has
purples too which is the shades that I
use like which are my safe shaped so I
have to use it
for blush I'm using this really pretty
blush by Mac I bought it up I thought
I'd like a minute ago um but it's really
really nice I kind of put too much on on
accident but I fixed it later but it's a
really really great book blush
I almost said brush I'm so used to here
video and then for highlight I'm using
it on my Mac kind of broke on me that's
why I made that face but everyone's
asking you what her this was and my
recent Instagram live and this is it
it's so so nice I bought this one to you
the loser why I say that cuz I don't
want you guys think I'm only hype in a
product sent to me cuz I am IMAX PR list
but I bought these two products with my
own money so um yeah they're really cool
and I love them and um you should
totally get them so what I look for this
fix my hair fix my hair's more now I do
my brows and I super spread this part up
because I did not want to do them I hate
doing my brows so much I never thought I
can get tired doing my brows my think
when you do them every single day like
it really gets old I dread doing my
brows every single time I do them so
just this price sped up they'll be over
in like two minutes
so I'm done brows I add something that
highlight on my inner eye my little
flappy's you guys know I have to do that
it's like my favorite thing I don't need
my brow bone and then I go over my
entire face with my foundation brush
just to make everything look more
blended and not so like on my face and
not so intense now for a lip liner I end
up picking plum by Mac and night moth by
Mac and I am I blend those together
which you have seen one second
so on top of them taking the spin see
beauty galaxy lip gloss in the shade
spacesuit honestly I am so happy about
this one because it's so pretty I love
it it's like one of my favorite so I put
that on top and then on top of that
which is gonna make this lip look so
intense it's so glittery and like
mesmerizing a person I'm using enjoy a
cosmetics lip topper in the shade rose
gold and this just made it look so much
nicer like these two together are
beautiful set my face I'm gonna use my
morphe setting spray the mist setting
spray is one my favorites and I do this
before I put my mascara on because I
like my scary to bleed so yeah do that
first let that dry and then I'm gonna
put my mascara on I'm using these two
ones by Mac I think this is like in
extreme dimension and bold and bad lash
these are two of my favorites you guys
umm Mac makes some really really good
mascara so God use both
after that I am pretty much done like
telling us fill myself this day which is
yesterday like I thought it looks over I
don't know I just
