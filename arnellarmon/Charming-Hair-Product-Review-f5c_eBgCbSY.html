filming this makeup look which I did
some store afforable
I just said I got so minute and my new
you guys who asked about this hair and
then the video I did tell you that I
will do beyond the Terry's the details
how about the color and I'll let this
stuff go here is I'm trying to make this
too long because owners leave us we just
shorter let's jump into it so this hair
some charming hair
I have represent before their company
that's doing my first build based lace
closures the first one advertise milk
base anything and I will link that video
down below that video was close to a
year ago and so I'll go on to the curly
hair weekend in life but if you guys
want to see the details on that just
click link in the description box
because of me this video is about the
curly hair and drop their bottom with
hair that are having right now now I do
have a bundle left over so this is what
the hair came work originally and this
is what I got it too it was quite
difficult getting to this color and so
I'll get fat like in a second but I came
like originally and just because I guys
- it's really beautiful you guys it took
me I worked on this hair markets like
three days and I'm going to explain it
right now so let's just have myself in
the hair
I'll start positives first and I'll go
into the one con that I have how does
that think the hair has meant love
issuing I haven't experienced any
shedding or tingling
um but almost um experience che when I
was bleaching my hair and I have it a
lot when I wish bundles I'm not sure why
I've never understood that but so I
share my experiences which hair other
than the hair is the first response I
made to ladies on my head I hadn't
experienced me shedding and you know
creating lanes
no pain no I actually I mean I feel a
little kink you know remember my hands
reached a little bit but it's nothing
Korean Edith your name like it's not
looking too
so that meant angle a little bit a
little bit of I'm facing right now but
nothing too creative that's why I'm
trying to see houses like say the hair
it's picky
it took the color well after I worked
very hard on it and I guess this rules
bruising me to move it to the only con
that I have the only comment I have is
that it was very difficult bleaching
this hair I don't know what it was about
I just know that I struggled more than I
typically struggle bleach any other hair
and so I wasn't like on a bad batch of
hair I mean the hair is nice I think it
was free but just certain hair is
different you can let some times when
you'll get bundles where all the hair is
really - versions those very easy bleach
and I think private companies once
started to learn a lot of assuming it as
much when you get bundles that just are
bleaching evenly maybe not all the hair
the hosted version hair and so I just
noticed that when I was bleaching the
front whole one part when it's bleached
I've got a good weird of course and of
finesse in it because like that's what I
do and what I have to finish as a have
to complete this I really want this
color but I did struggle a lot now I
have a 360 lace frontal mean a glowy on
my head I have a solid around here
because I'm low on a middle part I'm
going to keep it in the middle part I
try to type hard thing but I'm not a
huge fan side press anymore only because
my edges are the thinner side it always
have time to customize the whole entire
frontal so I just put a middle part just
much easier for me let Morrissey and
warm side part actually cools that I
just real part of just so easy to do and
they're very easy with natural and so if
you have a spinning edges I would
definitely recommend middle part because
if you haven't fixed any edges in your
doing a side part I still have you to
see all of that you know with your wig
so I expect no part my preference and
what they have a very slow stressful and
I have two bundles in this wig I have a
leftover bundle I cut a piece of this
puzzle because I am to show you that how
I got this hair color
I'm not want to be I want to die
on camera or obviously at all because of
my experience dying to other bottles in
this press hole it was just so difficult
I am losing all day and then what I am
doing what I am letting the color sit in
this hair for like 24 hours of overnight
and that's helped me was to get to be
filled by Brandt but it took me so long
to die these bundles I was like you know
what like you're gonna be mad at me but
as long as she'll have that little piece
that really should help I just
you guys it's so hard we shouldn't air I
did I didn't enjoy it to be honest with
you the handles obviously I'd have met
Buster - I have a nice bounce to it it
is for some reason I just had completion
only nightmare Thanks and so I'll take
that time at the hair I'm an insert a
little clip right here it's not going to
look a full bowl tutorial because I mean
a long Diana piece however you will be
able to learn the props that I use
hopefully through this color gray to do
at home it should be simple for him
however if you do mess up don't get you
know discouraged I messed up during this
process well I have to buy like five of
the box size nor to fix it so they'll
get a centering thing is you're messing
up whatever designing with your hair
just keep trying it's like I mentioned
you look at eye-color because when I was
dying to ourselves cake this is gonna
look terrible
it looks that was doing the process but
you know what to speed
finish it is you know keep working at it
in this work and still I managed animal
print so I pretty much cut a little peek
at this puzzle and then I mixed resin
each mixture are dusting pushes from
Sally's there I online it was my second
or third time using inflation I really
really do like it I like it a little
more than the bw2 in the claro bleach
the ones everyone uses i first like
these more subtly because they work
really good but because the smell it is
not to be sneezed in the immediate ease
it's so pleasant and very easy to work
with and so i made my little mixture and
then i put these two bowls out the hair
on top and then apply the bleach to the
hair and then I wrap the foil around my
hair because that
to help the hair profits you know this
is how the boot process faster so
usually I do it this way no matter what
bundles I'm bleaching and publish I mean
either if I'm rapping I boil it usually
is able to live to like a brassy blonde
but you'll see the blonde with this hair
I let I let the caught I let it process
for a good 25 minutes which is a very
long time and usually only takes like 15
for Miss pross's hair and it's only able
to live to like disney abroad color
round will show you guys and so it was
interesting and the other goes the same
things why i do not want to put this
whole testing because contrast rating
and so after you do that you're going to
want to like drive the hairs you know
enough to where it's a little not dance
which is a little dry you don't dry it
all the way that stuff take you forever
however if you don't start all the way
you're going to be clued the diet
overnight just to make sure we lose
pinterest the hair usually when you try
harris what it does not work the only
time i do it is if i know having time to
leave it overnight because my hair is
dry and the guy really penetrates the
hair salon kind of work so I pretty much
put it on my hair and I left with since
I still have enough oil I wanted to I
could rinse this and I using the color
would take however these ion dyes I just
noticed that order to get the most
vibrant color it is marketing it
overnight and that's with this color but
what all the I and dyes I've tried I
noticed that it's best when you just
leave there just at least first if not
overnight unless you've hours to really
let the color deposit these dyes are
tricky because on the box of Dunamis
peroxide which you going to validate it
II do native peroxide I tried both ways
nope rocks by little conditioner and I
tried with peroxide and I really think
it depends on the color and working with
because we've been times where I make
the peroxide the color is still nice and
at the time I had no proc site at all
and I literally just put the color
strain to the hair it is in not fun
in color at all and so it's tricky I
would recommend you know maybe mixing
little conditioner just to make it
easier to spread because this dye is
super thick so it's harder to spread and
if you don't know what you do it you
have to use multiple boxes so if you
wanted spread it is easier to work with
I would recommend mixing in a little bit
conditioner it you shall not do too much
missionary because you don't let the
lighter the color unless you do then add
a whole bunch conditioner but that's so
much air on this hair I really love the
color on me I was expectin love it as
much as I do now I did my little baby
hair thing that I showed you to have in
one of my previous videos so I was able
to make my part look more natural than
it did at first at first terrible um I
don't put the cancel is quick but you
will see a lot more in this wind I've
been trying to do more brighter fun hair
colors not only to make better meals for
you guys this is not born reviews on
basic ones being colored hair but to
also inspire my makeup look which is why
I have it Calum and Nicholas because I
want to just start just get out of my
comfort zone and doing colors I
typically would work with so that is my
review I overall like the hair I do
think that it has to the fact I don't
think that all of the hair would be hard
to drive
I really after were coming for so long I
think some of issues of that repair I
think that that may be the case of this
hair because I mean yeah perfect
I don't really experience a too often
but I had a terrific before world
cartilage so I would say that if you
want to buy this hair and you want gets
darker color with this it's fine however
if you want to platinum color and you
want to realize blonde I can't say like
a hundred cents certainty that I will
recommend this hair based on my
experience with bleaching it I think
will be a risk I think you may be good
bundles that make bleach really well or
you may get these kind of bundles that
will take you forever to get to the
color that you want if you want a super
light color so it's common one of these
weeks have to decide on your own I
protect the hair I think this car looks
nice however it was hard to get an end
my review so if you enjoyed it please
give it thumbs up please subscribe and
I'll see you guys later I have some
other videos planned I got a new puppy

pricing you're tired because like when
I'm going to collect ten thirty one and

much thinking given puppy all of our
attention I had to have two very
watching while I do my makeup and just I
