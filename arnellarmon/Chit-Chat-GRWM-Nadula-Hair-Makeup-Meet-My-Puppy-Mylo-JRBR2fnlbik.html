were going to welcome so just a quick
intro this is gonna be get ready with me
it's gonna be kind of chitchat E and I'm
also going to introduce my little Milo
he's on my lap but I don't wanna pick
him up he's tired he's he's exhausted
he's a little puppy it's a long day but
you guys will be at it meet him I think
in the video and then um yeah you guys
see how I create this look I really like
this look a lot you guys I love the hair
and the makeup this hair already have a
review video on this hair I'm gonna show
myself style it just a little bit just a
quick check-in all of his hair I still
like it
the color is beautiful this blonde is
poppin I'll link my initial review my
first video bring them below as a quick
updated review sorry for the noise in
the background I really I can't control
anymore
well I never could but yeah it's a quick
update review I start the hair I almost
kind of didn't like it because it was
starting to get a little dry but all I
had to do was just condition it and I
mean it bounced right back
I probably showed a deep condition it
when I believe initially but I
didn't so that probably explains why it
was starting to get around me and I was
also like heat styling in it every
single time I wore it so I think that it
was getting a little burnt out by this
condition it and it is pretty much back
to new so you guys watched me style that
really fast and that part be a little
sped up and then I'll just show you guys
let me create this makeup look it's
really good pretty and then you guys
continue milos so if you turn this video
I'm like I would say give it a thumbs up
please subscribe and I'll see you guys
later alright so this is the hair kind
of blow-dried but kind of straightened I
kind just like ran the Flatiron through
it now I'm gonna just address this sorry
no me get some comments the closure does
not look up great oh wait I'm spraying
the spray it's by kanra
I'll link it below it's the best not
sponsored I paid $20 every single time I
this bottle I would totally recommend if
you're sharing your hair now back to
what I was saying oh and I'm used this
lame Remington flattered it's not lame
but I had bought once like 150 that was
so good I stepped on it I broke it
so I don't even want to think about it
anyways um the closure part on this
front on this wig by the way this hairs
from - doula hair you guys have already
seen this hair before I've done a video
already like I said in the beginning but
the closure is not look that good only
because I look I messed it up I cut off
too much lace I don't know what what I
was doing but after I washed this wig I
was just kind of like messing with the
frontal and I cut off too much lace so I
made the part shorter because I had less
space to work with so I just like the
frontal doesn't look that great and my
hair straighten underneath and so I
can't chill it down like I use a gel it
down and so it's just not the wig isn't
lame how my wigs usually lay but that's
because I didn't want to add any gel to
my real hair because I'm not ready to
you know give up my real hair yet I
still wear it straight and like style it
so the wig is not clear best it's not
reflex with the hair at the hair itself
is nice I love this company I love the
hair I mean everything's good I kind of
explained on the beginning I have no
cons to say it was camel dry but that's
cuz I didn't deep conditioning and I
didn't condition it at all but the wig
itself I kind of messed it up and it
just didn't look the best and that was
Wow saying this video I was like oh my
god they're gonna roast me this makes I
would roast me if I was watching me and
I wasn't me I'd like oh what's wrong
with her closure part but you guys know
I'm always late so I should have like a
past you know not have a super late
closure but you could even see like my
real hair underneath that's because like
it's not slicked and gelled back it's
literally just in a ponytail so like in
this video you'll be to see on the sides
like you'll be to see my hair but that's
because um I don't want to wet it
because once I wet it I don't plan on
strain it for like the least another six
months to a year so I'm just embracing
my straight hair for now but I literally
just did pretty much basic curls I've
done this kind of crows before they're
very simple I just don't want a street
I feel like stay was boring so um I just
did you know these simple flat iron
curls
see in this part you could totally some
a real hair that's because I use it when
I wear my wigs I'll like either use like
the God to be free spray or I'll gellick
down because it makes it stick and stay
in place but like I said I was not
pretty no gel in my hair but here I am I
was trying to figure it out cuz like the
curls it's so tricky to make when you're
doing a style like this one the middle
part it's hard to make the front to curl
look good when you do it on yourself
it's actually kind of annoying because
you have to curl both pieces different
directions because on opposite sides so
I was just trying to figure that out to
make it look kind of like Farrah Fawcett
II Farrah Fawcett vibe so I'll just
trying to figure out my life and I mean
this was kind of waste I'm kind of
reeker Liat later on in this video I
like doing my hair first refer to my
makeup so I do my hair kind of gives me
an idea of the kind of makeup look I
wanted to do because certain makeup
looks look good or bad with certain
hairstyles so you never know but um yeah
I'm almost done with this so we're gonna
get into the makeup a one sec and the
makeup part should be really fun because
I did a pretty different look and I
actually really realized it a lot so
hope you guys enjoy that part more than
you enjoyed this part well if you
enjoyed this part it's cool to you but
I'm not talking okay I'm annoyed
all right so without hair I didn't do
bosom for hair because I don't know I
stood in but time to my face I haven't
on my makeup and I'm gonna really be my
face in like so let's see on my skin I'm
use this natural radiance base prep try
by Mac crime scene II four to beam up
whoa I'm just gonna prime with that how
many users in like a while so you start
doing makeup like how do you do things
every time I do it my most part because
I mean they have a lot makeup and it's
like I play it so caught up on like my
favorite products and forget to use new
stuff so who dis look good putting
primer on that part was nice - it's like
a very moisturizing that's not saucony
or anything so it feels really good
alright so now I'm going to use this
aluminum evil veil by the VESA my ryx
it's just to make my makeup look really
glow underneath I really love her line
of illuminators because a lot of Resnick
illuminators and I mean they're all
pretty nice however I really know sniffs
for this one a lot of times when I use
illuminator and I put my foundation on
top I so much can't even see the mirror
at all oh this one you can literally see
it come for underneath so I like it
and there's a lot of shades this one is
called radiance and it's like a light
gold shade so I like that oh by the way
I took my myself in reading I had out
there anyone's do my hair but I'm gonna
remove it only because I just I don't
know it's like super 2013 I don't want
stuff to bring anymore I just want to
look more serious we weren't
sophisticated well not so it's gone it's
going I probably will get one of those
rings and you can flip inside you can't
see the pictures so the hold of the
clothes but for now I'm kind of over it
like I mean I guess the water reappears
I got was in repair
it doesn't hurt at all so I'll probably
get repairs but I'm over it for now well
I like crazy all right
so foundation taking my makeup for ever
ultra HD foundation I am in the shade
why four four five I'm pretty tan um if
it helps I'm NC forty five and nine so
if your agency pretty fighting back your
pride of this shade but then again a lot
of people are in c-45 in Mac and I
didn't realize that until working there
that people like lutely of all sheets
are all 245 Mac I don't know why it's so
weird if you've worked in Mac before I
work I'm like you know I'm talking about
everyone dancing realize it's weird
anyways um I'm going to apply that using
this Tarte sponge tart blender you guys
know I always use this I'm just gonna
move out this sponge is really damp I
just washed it actually all my sponges
are dirty I have them all right here
they're all dirty
so I had to wash one so girls you guys I
need to wash my brushes too how to wash
my brushes are like pretty here so yeah
I'll get that together
wait no I reason what's my brush is I
did huh hmm any new ones
alright don't want to show my edges now
not lead
all right got my foundation now now to
conceal grandma Diller it means my tarts
shape tape in the shade medium who
should supposed to do my makeup
what dzj picks up the 24th my skin was
breaking out I started breaking out when
I was in LA and it was kind of like
Mexican always breaks out the worst
times and I guess like some people then
I thought no it's not breaking out it's
fine but it's like my form of break out
my for a break out isn't pimples it's
when my skin is very dry and raschi cuz
I have eczema and so some of my face
look it like that and it's like it
happens whatever I'm going to like an
event or you know some of our months
other black bloggers and stuff and it
sucked because it's like they probably
think like damn she's all facetune and
it's like I'm not like it just the
Mexicans break it out let see him break
someone I've stressed a lot too so
that's the problem brick and I was in LA
I was really stressed out maxie going to
LA tomorrow and one of those feelings
I'm having my friend 3 come over to
watch Milo which you gotta meet him at
in this video I would introduce you guys
to him now but he'll get in his hyper
mood right now he's in this crate just
chilling and sleeping so I would
introduce you guys to my lone you got a
rise C on my social media you guys
haven't formally met him so um I think
this video I'll bring my little out
happy to pub news Leary like having a
baby like an actual child well no I want
you to think people have actual babies
but it feels like like have an actual
baby because mild you just so I just
might actually becoming good well
because it's like Riesling mr. Creake he
should cry cry cry
nighttime is great you didn't cry at all
he's becoming a big boy he doesn't cry
at all he said cry so much and it's like
I think he knows he can work me because
I just like he knows I don't like
hearing her crying I get really very sad
so he'll cry and I'll try to ignore it
it looks something like most I might
consider this sleeper I um
ouch be gone I hope so he'll cry and
it's like you do this regular whimpers
but then like hust are really going in
right now I'm taking this Black Radiance
the labels gone but that concealer state
I used to come to her there was no
actual name just numbers at the end I
think this comes like maybe three shades
if I'm wrong I'm so sorry but this is
just like a very like natural contour
but no he has his cry and then he has
his extra dramatic crime and his extra
dramatic cry I just like dude really cuz
I'll be perfectly fine like I even have
a crate set up in my living room
oh by the way this concealer is two
sides they have a stick where it's
creamy then I have this liquid form and
so I'll use a stick to start off and
then I put the other side on top of that
cuz it's slightly darker and so this
just to help it show up more cuz it's
very light actually anyways I have a
crate set up in my living room because I
thought who make maybe he's crying
because he doesn't like family strictly
to the crate it's a little big in one
room because I spoiled him and so I
bought a gate that divides my room cool
my like house from living room
he still Christ like I'll be in there in
the minute I leave the gate Christ like
man you really fine until I go back you
know over the gate to kind of be with
him and he just like I'll sit down you
know like hey you know what do you want
he this grass toy and he sits on Michael
it plays with toys but he just wanting
to be there it's so cute
and have to get him neutered I have to
get neutered I'm into it in three months
come so terrified do it now I have not
no the good doctor sleeping you do to
them I don't know I'm stupid you know I
think I'm gonna cut the balls off when
he's a week I didn't think that through
but I'm scared cuz I don't you put to
sleep I don't know like I'm really
scared
anyways I don't talk about that how it
is I take my learn mercy juices powder
translucent translucent powder just said
I take my eyes I really don't know I'm
going with this um I actually want a
slightly brighter on your eye so I lied
I'm gonna take my chemical on concealer
first just to brighten up my eye my
mirrors right here which is why I keep
looking to the side yeah cuz something
about this on a dull alright can play it
out nicely now I'm gonna set it with my
powder
ah it's like I wanted to I shadow not
really what you know what'd you see
cuz I got these blushes from makeup
forever and when I first saw them I
thought hmm that looks League of my eyes
it's like this reddish color and then I
got this let me open it this round color
and so I like that little cool on the
eyes if I do it the right way so let's
see so I'm not gonna put actual primer
on it so I get a feeling this is a very
pigmented and I don't want to be too
much so I'm gonna like to set my lids
with my foundation powder this is my
Black Radiance you guys know I always
use this just a big fluffy brush for
that ready
now I'm gonna take mmm I hope this looks
good you take this red blush yeah it's
already pick up a lot of pigment
see I knew this would be really
pigmented oh it's beautiful
but that's your really dignity so pretty
okay well right by the way this blush is
called do you have name blush just dug
my fingernail in it
be 500 it'll be done below but it's just
really nice pretty blue and I've used on
my cheeks too okay but I have to add a
different color you know what we're in
for this out I want to try the brown one
out and this shade is s11 eight it's a
contour shape but we're needs on our
eyes
that's pretty I don't I'm going to see
it just darken the red a little bit you
won't really be a see too much of the
ground but it's going to mix the grant
and kind of make like a darker red but
didn't show a little ball great
what can they add to make this look cool
I don't want to do my basic Cornell arm
on ass look let's see
you know what I'm ready for fall so I'm
gonna do something Paulie you know cuz
I'm sorry Lloyd there some take my
jacket and he'll palette by more feet
take this diva Bergen shade right here
let's see what that does for me I just
put all the red lid like so it's pretty
looking like for Christmas you guys I
mean no one did something anything like
so can't wait dude Christmas started to
suck the midnight became an adult
oh I stopped getting a lot of presents
Isaac was going on I realized the kids
get presents the minute and then I
thought I'll like be on Instagram and
I'll see my age getting a lot of gifts
and I was like like my family yes just
weirdos
all right now don't take this purple
shade although I just really never I
don't know it's like then take me good
places we're gonna see you right now
in it taking where I thought it would
take me but tell me somewhere I just
don't want to all red because I thought
I did it look like that recently so got
it absolutely cool in there blend her
out either purple I think when I do my
bottom like I whatever that that seems
fun I could do come together I look
pretty I'm here for this
okay you know what I'm not mad I'm
likely not doing stuff when I used to
that's good that's always good thing now
I need to find another purple to put
underneath here I can't use a shimmer
that won't work so let me look at my pal
a so my choice right here I'm gonna
figure out a palette I want to use my
Sephora Pro palette I broke the entire
thing you guys I still see purple but
how many break I dropped in don't ask
how it was at my hotel room and it was
funny and I when I dropped it
I just laughed kind of wow dude like
you're lucky so bad
I believe we never see you take this
purple right here on the shade that did
not break put it on number oh it's so
baby but it'll just snap putting the
lashline Lots really pigmented that's
really awesome I'll probably buy another
one of these because these palettes are
really really good
darn literally let's see it comes with
one two three four five six seven wait
they count their rate seven times for 28
colors and only have one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve twelve colors aren't broken
that's awesome
I like this it's growing on me I feel
it's kind of weird come on my brows on
by flight once I do it will all come
together um yeah we're gonna keep
rolling with it and you know it I'm
gonna die gravity fast I put a little
look freaking weirdo by my cover filming
that I'm only cuz it'll take forever and
I'll make this video even longer than
it's going to be so how many my brows
really quick and I might put lashes on
off-camera I'm most like a little
because I think tonight 20 minutes to
and I'll be right back
alright so do my brows I was back to my
last shift however I want to use this
pigment that I have which we don't want
to use I have these pigments from
relative boss and I pack them really
cool weeks now and I want to use them
just because I mean I don't know where I
come with crazy with my look already so
might as well use some clear this
misshaped Lily it hasn't some pink tones
to it that's I'm going for it because
I'm gonna have purple and purple goes
with the pink in the open this all right
so to get the blur to stick I'm actually
use this NYX glitter primer I've never
used before
so I don't know if it works or not but I
haven't so gonna use it kind of scared
though except hooded lids so hopefully
it doesn't transfer we're gonna see
this seems pretty legit
I like this glitter
I like this litter a lot actually
because it makes your lids glittery
however it does completely mask the
color of eyeshadow you have you know
sometimes using it when we put glitter
on it kind of like oily so glitter I
used it usually the mask the color that
I have didn't do it all that sounds kind
of cool
oh wow I'm super dumb I could've been
use these dum-dum all right it's a
really great glitter you guys that's
really pretty and this glitter primer
seems to work a lot because I don't
really see any fallout from the glitter
whatsoever so what's a stuff that I it's
low-key on there wow I like this like
this is going alright now type of my
lashes I'm not going to on camera
alright say I'm not the best of this but
I'm using Bristol Biden about some these
last really great if you're not a huge
lash layer because they're very
lightweight you can barely see them
because they're not super dramatic at
all and so they're great if you have
sensitive eyes and you like lashes
they're too heavy these are great
because they gives you like to know I'm
not dramatic it gives you coverage it
gives your lashes more length you know
whatever they I'm trying to say but it's
not too much so recommend these I have a
code I haven't used in like a year I
don't even know the code but all these
youtubers having to balance of codes so
I'll find one that I really really like
and I'll put theirs down below because I
think I don't know how much I think you
say
percent on these so I'm gonna put my
lashes on and then I'll be your back all
right so my focus I can't see right now
um
lashes they take like a myth to just on
my eyes so this looks really weird but
matches online that's on my face I just
new powder to make forever I don't think
it's not new for them that's me for me
and it's just like a mattifying powder
so can you use that see it's really new
I haven't used it yet right I sniff it
weird okay I hope this is my sheep it's
not don't know what to say about that
I'm gonna use anyways oh it's almost
translucent I don't know if you guys saw
that but it almost like you put it on it
kind of disappears to your skin it well
that's cool they simulate three of them
and one of the most looks too dark
but if it disappears to my skin I will
try another one now does it count
oh let's see this one's slightly darker
you might Andy's wow that's very cool
oh great I found something I like
whenever I find someone like on my dam
or know that you have more to shoot to
buy because even when grants in you
stuff I'll still gotta buy it if I
really like it coming why not you know
and it's like it's funny because I have
some friends I might take advantage of
gave me free stuff cuz you can always
like cable brands my cake you send me
this bah blah but um part of its kind
okay well if I were you like the brand I
really don't mind
you know spinning money and the parts I
got too lazy like I don't want to wait
for me to send me a dime n go to Sephora
right now i was buying it so might as
well you know that's what I do
Wow I hold my pictures that come out
sorry I'm wierd oh I love light gaming
things are it contour you use this
powder let's see what you're talking
about
okay you're sculpting Jesus getting so
freakin excited
did you love and your face starts to
come together you're like you're
sculpted whew I just lost my pills yeah
I like this oh god sorry
I hear really excited because I never
really do makeup looks you know so I do
and they have to come out nice I like
them but I get really happy for myself
alright blush time not hard that I blush
would make it forever I almost want to
use this one I'm kind of scared to go to
Hamm this red ones very pigmented but
earlier I said I'll use it so I'm just
gonna do it just blow the brush
so really lightly cuz I don't wanna let
do too much you know I'm not going
anywhere but still the less space to
would I have to do the bigger okay now
for highlight more makeup forever place
it me this I sleek using new stuff now
is my highlight brush with my favorite
brush we use this in this highlighter is
number H 1:06
see what you're talking about
surely I can't advise you to build up I
actually like cards like this though
there's some powers I have that it's
like it's like crazy the second you put
it on and yes although those highlights
are very satisfying when you first put
them on I am a very realistic person and
I don't wear my hair like that crazy in
real life I simply don't if I'm gonna be
amongst other beauty bloggers I'm a you
know a little extra nuts I gotta go
amongst my peoples but I'm not a crazy
highlighter where it's not really like
think for me and when I see a lot of
person with a hard light on my tea
seriously it's a lot you know those
given pictures but not always a person
and I think that it can be misleading
because a lot of people they put a lot
of highlight on and they facetune it to
make it look smooth and you look at it
like damn until a bomb do you see them
in person and you're just a little
it's a lot um sorry I'm getting excited
now the moves are changing I want to put
highlight make my brow bone
I've been liking that lately I think it
makes that look look pretty cool so
that's what we're gonna do
already kind of that stuff me fix that
brush

concept I do say so myself
