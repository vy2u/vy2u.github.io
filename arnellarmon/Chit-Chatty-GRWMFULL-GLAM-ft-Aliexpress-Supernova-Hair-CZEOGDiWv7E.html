you're new welcome today I'm gonna do it
get ready with me it's me super extra
we're gonna do my hair first I have one
piece of hair curled so I want to test
the bare of the wand to make sure I
wasn't that curls that you know I want
it um I don't know how mister doesn't
turn out because I had this microphone
sitting in front of me are you recording
yes you are because I got the plants in
my audio I did a secret Instagram where
asked you guys to give me feedback as in
regards to like you know what you guys
want to see you or I could do did for my
channel and a few things to my audios so
I'm trying to smite and hopefully it
works but um anyways we're trying hair
first because this hair company is
sponsoring this video this hair is from
supernova hair and they sent me five
bundles of 32 inches in a 20 inch
frontal now the reason why the front was
20 inches because that's as long as they
have in frontal links and so um I mean
it's cool dope because I feel like kind
of like gives I guess you can see some
body or some I don't know I like wind or
like a layer type of look I like it when
the the top is a little shorter than the
back I said when they're all like one
length
it looks more like unrealistic however I
have not cut these bundles I posted on
Instagram and everyone was like don't
cut them so I won't just because you
guys asked me to you but why does have
to do is wanna curl it cuz I want some
waves going on now I get to the front
part of here and by the way you can see
the front right here this is not glued
down this is just the wig I don't know
what I did differently but it just came
out perfect and so originally I actually
wanted to film a video on me
constructing this wick however I ran
into some problems and I guess I'll get
into I guess the pros and cons of this
hair because there are some and so uh
before I go into that I'm wild curling
hair because I want to just you know get
more body I'm going for a certain look
so you want to be very extra knee and
what's more extra than a 32-inch curly
hair
anyway um pros and cons so the pros of
his hair will all save one that it's
currently really well I wasn't sure if
this is gonna curl well which is why I
get like a test one the first and so
it's critically well it's very easy to
curl I'm interested to see how
long these curls last however I kind of
want them to fall into waves so I don't
mind if they don't last the longest but
point is this haircut to get Carol may
not look like it but let me do it my arm
these look really really nice back to
pro's and con's another pros that his
hair has really nice luster on its own
and it also could take bleach so this
company intersect I'm sitting here and
the first video that was really going to
do i flopped it because I want it to be
a nice blonde color so I bleached in
hair but I let the bleach in too long
and I completely damage the hair like
long story short I bleached his hair and
I decided while bleach since he'll get
Chinese food which is stupid and when I
came back it was just like yeah it
wasn't gonna work out but I say this is
say that this hair can't take bleach so
I tell you you bleach to like damn near
platinum yeah if you take some bleach
just not too much at once or else it's
butcher which is what I did and so um
they sent me a second set of hair and I
was like you know what I'm not gonna
bleach air dikes I don't wanna risk
messing up again not that I couldn't
have done it differently this time
around vibes didn't want I want to risk
it and so I just kept in its natural
color but it can't bleed you can't take
dye so cons there's like one con that
I've noticed that really really annoyed
me so like I said earlier my ritual plan
was to make a video on how I construct
this wig and so I construct wigs I did
this thing where I am split the tracks
and that makes the wig lay flat now this
one's laying flat but I'll explain how I
did that and so I like to split the
tracks at first I just split the tracks
only at the very top and let's play the
track so you have a track and you just
get a little blade or even a knife you
just cut it because usually tracks
it'll be single lefted but there's like
two pieces to them and I prefer doing
that because like you get more hair in
lace bladder
it just I love doing it and so I've
learned recently I likes playing the
tracks all the way through through
entire way
because I just feel like it looks really
really natural that way and so I try to
split these tracks now these webs I'm
not a fan of how they are constructed
because I feel like they were almost sew
together too tight so that's a plus
because that means you get less shedding
when the the weft is constructive Ruby
tie like that the hair typically won't
shed on you
however it's not a plus when you want to
split them and so the tracks themselves
they were sewn really tight together and
they were pretty for lack of a better
word they're kind of stiff and so I kind
of struggled with trying to work with
them but they're easy to work with but
they were just more of a stiffer side
and so when I got to come on when I got
to the top part of the hair I was able
to finesse it and I was able to split
one of the bundles so I was able to like
pretty much usually when I split tracks
I to run the blade straight through just
through if you're super easy but this
one it took me like a good 20 minutes to
split the whole entire button looks like
to really take my time because I move
too fast it was rigged and break if that
makes any sense at all and so that's the
only con it was kind of frustrating so I
did want to make a video like a thorough
suit I actually start to film it a super
thorough video on how I make my wigs but
the tracks like it just wasn't yeah it
was a nolo I didn't want it to be ya
know the this this is diffic hair was
gonna work with kind of video was gonna
do and so that's the only con I would
say other than Mac the hair currently
fine
the frontal I bleached the knots and
they're beautiful the frontal itself is
like the perfect density it's not too
dense but it's not too thin either I do
not even customize this I mean of course
I made my baby hairs but I didn't have
to pluck it to make it thinner which is
what you didn't get to do at front tools
until the frontal itself I really really
love the front tool I believed it twice
which is why I do most of my friend
tools I bleach it once you know to get
most of the knocks that I'd go back in a
second time to get like the remainder
knocks I didn't bleach and so the
Front's hold onto my favorite out of
this hair but other than that yeah the
like Hana would have is me not really me
struggling to split the wefts yeah
that's fine
so have you tried super and over here
before and you would like to give your
feedback to anyone watching this video
your comments are always appreciated
because I get sent a lot of hair and I'm
because I get sent a lot of hair but
because I like to switch in my hair so
much I'm not able to like always wear
these wigs for a long period of time to
get like a super duper thorough review
and that's my fault
and I'm gonna try to work on that
because I'm gonna stop taking so many
hair deals but until then if you work
with any of the companies or like you
know order hair from any of the
companies that I'm working with if you
could just give your opinion down below
that's always super helpful because I
mean yeah so lemme wanna buy this hair I
may want more than just my opinion so
like I said if you have an opinion on
this comment down below and so I'm
making one curling this hair I'm gonna
speed this part up because I don't wanna
be super long but then again it's
getting ready with me so those are it's
okay for those to be long
um but I'm just gonna hurry up and do
this cuz I want to be forever oh I can't
wait to be done I feel like that's gonna
be really pretty don't do my makeup I'm
gonna force myself to step outside the
box wear makeup look you guys and so I
just I have good feelings about this
look for sure alright so just T to walk
around this hair and then I'll check
back in when I'm done
all right so I'm done curling my hair
the hair looks beautiful like the pre
looks it's so soft and just so just I'm
happy I haven't cut it I'm not going to
I don't wanna be attacked but it's just
so like I feel like a princess I don't
know but time for makeup now let's beat
our faces I need to fix my closure part
well I'm a doesn't look too bad I but I
need to put some like black eyeshadow
over here so if like the wind blows it's
not obvious but who did that later all
right so someone's lawn mowing outside
that's so annoying anyways to primates
can we use this pin tea Beauty primer
focus camera my favorite primers and I'm
going to just rub that all my skin
all right your foundation take my NARS
sheer glow and I'm in the shape Tahoe
the bottle is dirty do not mind that why
is not so great
that's why empty bottles I'd like for
these we can buy full one this one
should have some I know I should
probably thought this is another empty
one oh my god I know I should probably
throw away the empty ones I just I don't
feel comfortable throwing with things
that are NARS because I really value
NARS and other sounds crazy but I just
don't want to throw it away I know I
could do duh just use a stick obviously
we're gonna get our money's worth
all of that genius all right and I'm
gonna blend that out really quickly
using my affinity Beauty sponge
I'm feeling flawless already all right
to conceal I'm taking my NARS creamy or
radiant creamy concealer in the shade of
biscuit and women out using my more Fu
sponge all right looks good
not a contour i'm going to take my Ben
Nye olive ground foundation palette
looks like this and I'm just gonna take
this shade right here I originally
bought this for my kit but you guys know
I'm no longer freelance so I'm actually
using it myself
mommy uses brush from this BH Cosmetics
set looks crazy right now oh my god I
looks nuts
this probability Dark Ritual I don't
really trip my mess up during cream
contouring because I could easily blend
it out and fix it with the same sponge I
used to apply a foundation so I don't
panic so now I'm gonna take my Laura
Mercier translucent powder and I'm going
to get some of that on the cap take this
other morphe sponge just like a finer
tip to it more clumsy and we're gonna
set using that and I'm gonna do one
layer first to set it
like that and then I'm gonna do another
slightly thicker set to catch my powder
time for my powder my eyeshadow when I
do that and I like this bunch because
you guys see how it's so it's kind of
like flimsy and very flexible it's
really great for things like this
because it doesn't apply too much
pressure
alright so now I'm gonna do one off
camera because I have no idea what I'm
doing yet and then I'll be back to the
other eye alright guys I didn't want to
have camera I'm not gonna live kind of
impressed um you guys know I never
really do look like this cut it cuz it
scares me not gonna lie when I was
starting to the bottom typically
speaking what I do do some color up top
I like to see like that up top I'll do
like orange or plait see on the bottom I
I never do it like this at all like ever
but it looks good look and I'm I'm
excited so let's do it
so to prime my eyes first I'm gonna use
this Urban Decay primer potion feels get
in focus there be there go all right so
I'm gonna prime my eyes with that first
this is so expired I got this like a
long time ago but I'm still use it
alright
and we are gonna rub that in with our
fingers so I'm gonna be using two
eyeshadow palettes today
the first one I'm going to be using is
this new one by Urban Decay actually
just came out yesterday I believe and I
love the packaging like it looks like
this has a mirror and then if like it's
like perfect I don't can explain it it
is called the beach I shadow palette and
so that's where you see the blue most of
the colors are in this palette however I
did meet my morphe 15 D palette to
assist me and that's kind you need some
orange shades like you know to blend and
make it look better and some of these
and these two palettes so first I'm
gonna find my brush all right first
things first I'm I set my primer with my
translucent powder I'm just gonna brush
that all over my lid like so alright and
then I'm going to my 15 D ballad I'm
gonna take in the crease acts like a
name right there and I use that first
punch the brush that all over my lid the
reason I don't do super intricate I
shower looks because I haven't like
master my technique but I'm discovering
oh I'm gonna take the shade editor I'm
discovering that the more I do it the
better I get so I'm just gonna force
myself to continue to do these kind of
looks until I just feel comfortable and
I'm better cuz I have a necessary match
to my technique this is my baby morphe
brush of all time to do shadow it's the
more feet in b23 brush I've had at least
like five of these I feel like if you're
a beginner eye shadow this brush is
really really amazing for that I don't
know it just foolproof to me
I don't wanna be messing up but it's
great and so from this Urban Decay
palette I take the shade day break which
is right here I like this palette
however this is the only matte in the
palette I wish there was at least like
you know two more max may make a brown
matte however I do understand they have
you know there
they're naked palettes that have no
shade so it makes sense as to why they
you know swish up a bit it's really
pigmented though that's like a youtubers
favorite word pigmented and so um what I
do next
this is why I need to start doing my eye
on camera because I was forgetting my
steps all right so I'm gonna do things a
little different I did this I different
way but I'm trying to learn from my
mistakes so before I put any the blue I
am gonna add this Brown it's called mob
and I'm gonna add that to outer corner
of this eye just to you know make it a
little darker I did that on this eye
however I did it after the blue and I
feel like mixing the brown on top of the
blue made it look a little muddy
it looks good still but I'm just trying
to find the best and most effective way
to do my eyes all right
so Oh God drop my brush and has come
through I look alright so next I'm gonna
take this pencil I have my Mac it's
Diane Kendall's spring/summer collection
women Edition however it's blue and I
use as a base not my favorite however
because I did on the other eye I feel
like I can't skip this step on this ice
and may affect how it looks
color wise and so I'm just gonna put
that on my eye and blend it out my
finger and you won't be to even see this
blue once I put this shimmer on top it's
kind of just like a base it's not really
the neatest product I've used I'm gonna
take this flat brush by Laura Mercier it
is the cream eye detail now I'm going to
take the shape plunge which is this
darker blue and I'm gonna do a little
sticker on this palette actually still
on let's lift at all and I'm gonna pack
that on top
I use a brush first I'm gonna go my
fingers soon okay then we take this
small morphe brush this is the M fo6 I'm
take the same color and kind of blend it
upwards and kind of use it with the
first few colors I used so with the lime
isn't look harsh if that makes sense
then I go back in with the first morphe
brush I use just the M b23 and just
blend that all together I'm really
working on my blending and then I'm
going to take the shape double dip with
my finger which is like a slightly
lighter blue and I'm just going to pack
that onto my lid like so it's so easy
right and then what I do next I remember
what I did I use so then I took this
Laura Mercier brush this is the smudge
brush and I'm going to take the same
liner that I used as a base over the air
and put some down the brush and then I
put that underneath we'll cut on my
waterline
lower lash line and I brought it all the
way in typically I get scared when it
comes just kind of thing that's like
close on my eye but it looks really good
and blue eye shadow is trending right
now so that kinda inspired the look
especially when I got the Urban Decay
palette I'll take them in to do some
glue this looks so nice and then I'm
going to go back in with this palette
I'm gonna go back in with the morphe m
probably six brush I'm gonna take both
the blue colors I used during the air
and put that on top
like that and then what I should do
first I totally forgot I'm gonna take
daybreak which is the shade the matte
shade I use in this palette and just
dust that underneath so it matches the
top part of my eye and it's not just
just a thick blue looks more smokey like
that when did I say you google when did
I even say anyways alright and that's
from Jeff as I look and I'm gonna put my
lashes and so for lashes I'm using women
war this is their effortless style
favorite lobsters to date well tough
life because nothing beats new bouncing
Bristol and Russian white those are
still my favorites some uses duo lash
glue not my favorite however I cannot
climb I have a lower lash glue which
works really really good so we gotta
stick with duo and why would for the
glue to get tacky I'm gonna take this
milk makeup push mascara supposed to be
infused with the inward I'm not gonna
say because I'm not gonna risk it the
monetised I'm gonna put it coated that
all my lashes I'm gonna go to crazy and
put a little bit on my bottom lashes as
well I feel like okay I just I kind of
disturbed because I'm realizing that
this look is super similar damn your
this name into my wild thoughts look
although like I'm gonna do a complete
different lip color I just realized that
like I used to say backdrop and I have
done a blue look like this before so we
gotta switch it up
yeah bring switch it up I don't I know
how we reach it up I'm put this lash on
first just so whenever I alter this this
other eye it's kind of like beat author
at the same time
but we're gonna switch it up because I'm
not gonna do the same look I don't want
to give roasted although I feel like
this video is gonna be more informative
than my walk boss look I'm stood yeah
you know switch it up these latches are
really great they apply very very easily
I did not cut them I enough measure them
they're literally effortless
they're amazing definitely worth $30 I
definitely put this is my third no this
is my fourth time wearing them actually
so I'm gonna get a lot of use out of
these this is like my fourth time
wearing them
and there's they still feel brand new
you still look good I have had to clean
them I wash them yet so that is a plus
that's pretty alright switch up time
alright some type of item lost pallet
I'm not gonna show it cuz it's warm
assured but when my shades broke and let
me go with this shade right here with
some greener shade let me see what that
does to see if that makes a slight
difference we just need a little
something to make a little different I'm
gonna put that on the inner corner of
that
I like that okay I took this shake hot
pearl it's like it's white iridescent
shade put that in a corner we need to
make it different in this eye look when
I feel like that makes a difference
we're like there's a completely effect I
look like it still heads of aisle I'm
going for it but it's not also something
I've done before that's freaking pretty
got all over my last band I'll fix that
later
yeah that's pretty I like that okay that
works for me all right now time to
finish the rest of my face all right I
want to turn hurry up because I want to
you so take them to entire face I'm so
down set my entire face I'm using this
bloomer citizen powder but this is a
shade like a medium deep I'm gonna take
this morphe egoriy to brush and I'm
going to just dab very roughly a month
II you guys see how I just the powder
wait I'm not even done yet but you see
how it's not it doesn't leave AD doesn't
look cakey because the trick I did
earlier where I did one layer first that
way so I feel like when you set I make
your eye and your Sisley baking when you
start off with one thick layer we just
press it it's sticking to the foundation
versus when you set with a thin layer
first and then you put powder on top of
that the padding on top of that is no
longer sticking to your skin is sticking
to that first layer of powder which
makes it easier test it off which is why
I do what I do
so yeah take this Sigma tapered face f25
brush to really get underneath my eyes
make sure it's odd us to the way
so the bronze I'm going to take my tart
Hotel Aires which is like my go-to
bronzer skin put some on my chin that
right and I'm also going with hoola
bronzer by benefit as well to further
contour this here all of my face
maybe I should put it back that might be
helpful I'm also going to contour my
nose a little bit I'm gonna take this
Laura Mercier brush it's the all of our
eye but I'm used for my nose so I cannot
find my nose contour brush so I'm just
gonna do like a light contour nothing
too heavy just define my nose I'm also
gonna find my Cupid's bow and I'm gonna
take this Sigma large powder brush with
this NYX pink the town blush and blue
shove my cheeks so for highlight I lost
my highlight brush so hmm I'm gonna use
whisper guilt by Mac I just got it it's
brand new and so I'm gonna do
little brush-up highlight first and then
if I want some more after I set my face
I will add more I wish my cheeks early
that sounds weird but I feel like the
highlight sticks so on my nose my nose
has some oil to it versus my cheeks are
dry alright so for lips I'm using
chestnut by Mac but I don't want you to
dark some put it on net bleed out my
loose I'm also gonna take my finger and
put a little pilot right there not too
much but then I just - I'm gonna cake
lipsticks I want to use one of them at
least
so maybe both so this shade is called
heatwave it's a bronzy orange shade
these little bit at and then if she
called town one it doesn't show up too
much rice wash down my hand but a flick
of a slight difference and of course you
know me I need a glass and I mean use
white Russian like a buxom
you see how good this microphone is
I love mixing colors I don't think
there's ever been trying to I just use
one color that looks super nice okay so
now set my face using this Mac setting
spray it's fixed plus pink light has a
nice little shimmer to it yes the while
waste enough to dry I'm gonna use some
my strobe body lotion because why not
I got it I might as well use it so much
hair on my shirt away feather the
napkin at ripping this hair that's in my
way oh that's like very pink whoa I
didn't think that this would be as pivot
is it is definitely underestimated you
definitely showing that all of this
taking up in my camera but it's
definitely showing up so bring my hair
forward let's zoom that came around a
little bit so you can see everything
there we go that's better
am I forgetting anything I like my eyes
like my lips I like everything so that's
it um I don't they became my shirt
because I'm take some photos and I'm
probably just gonna like me showing my
hair if I do change and won't be told
