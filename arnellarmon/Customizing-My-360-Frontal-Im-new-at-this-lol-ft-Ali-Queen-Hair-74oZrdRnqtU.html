video now the last video where this wig
I thought that the top part didn't
looked the most natural I thought it'll
look better in 17 like a lot of people
customize their lace frontals so I want
to try it and I've done it before but it
was terrible which is why I like I kind
of cropped it out in the video I did it
because I didn't think it looked that
great now this time around I did a much
better job it wasn't perfect but end up
looking much better than how it looked
in the beginning so first I part the
second part of the section I'm going to
be customizing which is the front part I
really need to worry too much about the
back part by the way this is a 360 lace
frontal so goes all the way my head I
really love this wig it's something
about oh wait pause I'm just gonna
tweeze now honestly this part is so
annoying because it's very time
consuming it takes forever which is why
feel like next time when I do it if I
really spend more time on it will look
even better I was kind of rushing and I
just didn't want to take forever on it
cuz it takes a very long time so you
just want to pluck just random parts
don't like pluck one specific area at
once just like pluck random parts and it
kind of like lowers a density and just
makes it more natural
that'll stain that's a thesis the lace
front tool and I need like them however
it's like I just I'm a frontal person
however I feel like with this wig I if
it's so snug and it was fitting snug
even before I glue the front or gel the
front and I really just it fits
perfectly but it doesn't give me a
headache like it fits tight but I have
no headache guy I'm really just kind of
reflecting on I've had this wig on since
yesterday and you see house sleep with
like no wig on for the most part because
it hurts my head but this load like I
slept on it on and I like had no
problems while I'm really like kind of
reflected on that it doesn't hurt at all
so yeah I guess it's a benefit of three
six plays Brundle is that it's more
secure in your head and it's less
painful
I haven't wore a 360 frontal with the
elastic band just yet because I haven't
had to and that's pretty convenient
because the elastic band it really gives
me a headache sometimes and I'm really
not a huge fan of it
plucking away parting sections poking
more I pluck more when I go tour to the
front because that's tough that's the
part that needs to look like the
thinnest and honestly like really
speaking my hair is super duper thin so
it should have my much thinner than this
but like I said I'm out of practice and
I just like the second time I've done
this so I guess as time goes on I will
get better but I mean hey I'm just doing
it okay so yeah I just keep plucking and
plucking and check it to the front and
then I'm going to kind of create baby
hairs which I do not like doing on wigs
it's just something about it that's just
like not natural and if you've been
following my channel like since I first
started you guys know I'm not with that
artificial baby hair so it's like
it's just a new thing for me I don't
know man but yeah I'm just I'm gonna do
it because I kind of have to you cuz I
look ageless right now
now it's time to make some veggies
that's a big edges for those who didn't
catch on to that and you're gonna like a
little I bought razor because I mean
that works the best who died you see do
this
Raven Elise I seen her do this I was
like ah that's kind of smart let me try
it now it doesn't make my life like much
easier and you can also do this to like
fix the density of your wigs however if
you're like a beginner which I mean
well I'm beginner but if you're like a
super beginner you probably don't want
to do this because I tweezers are
just more foolproof you know it's easier
to fix mistakes whereas with this it's
like yeah if you mess up it's the wrap
but yeah I'm just doing that to kind of
thin out the hairs more and to cut them
except like wake up with scissors it's
just too choppy oh god I picked up some
scissors but no it wasn't cut it was
just trying to trim off the super long
pieces but when you're making your
fetches you wanna use a razor because
you use scissors it just looks like
totally not good so I took my hair down
if I see like hey where's is going am I
wasting my time and I mean it was
looking pretty cool
it's looking pretty decent I'm gonna go
back in and fix a little more oh yeah
and I got my spit I was trying to get
rid of the crusties I don't wanna have a
crusty frontal have you guys seen those
before like I've saw those seen those oh
my god Alyssa's gonna kill me
she thinks I don't know how is like the
difference between seen and saw which
sometimes I don't and I'll admit that
but um I've seen a few crusty frontals
before and it's just not a look at I
never wanna be loans people so I'm gonna
cover some of my crust with this edge
control and my veggies right now yeah at
first they're a little too long so you
will see me go back and like make them
shorter but the point is I have them
they are now there and I'm not edges
anymore
so if it seems like I taking a really
long time my edges because I am because
I'm very particular with them I just
want them to look pretty real and I felt
like it look like my natural edges if
you've seen those before I mean yeah I
never really have it out but I think
they looked they looked pretty cool in
my opinion
I just I took forever on them cuz I just
they have to swirl the right way they
have to move the right way they gotta
look legit okay so now I'm gonna go back
and I'm going to go and tweeze a little
more excited still let's look too thick
in that front area so yeah that like I
said this is a very long process it's
super annoying which I only did one side
on camera because if I did both sides
this video would have been super long
and although I always have long videos I
mean they can't all be super long
so I'm dump my tweezing now I'm going to
brush the hair just like it see the
difference because like I first located
like is there even a difference but then
I compare both sides and I totally saw a
difference and you guys are gonna see it
too you see at the side customized looks
flatter and it's lame natural and this
side is like what are you even doing
like it's higher up it just totally does
even look cool that's why I customized
it so I'm gonna do the other side
off-camera and then I'll be back and
I'll be poppin but yeah this one looks
much better oh my god like is that mine
and that side looks like shambles it
just looks yeah so yeah yeah so I did
other side it was a super rush job but I
did what I could do to it okay I'll get
back over time and you got to see that
and I just like to just slip the hair
back well like pretty bi my ears and
legs really fast now I get try out a
little styles by coming out because I
didn't get the best feedback
ELISA said the little sigh I did look
weird I did like a little bun in the
middle my head and I want to make it
look better I'll do a tutorial on it but
yeah leave my hair back and I was pretty
much done I'll slowly plus an earring so
I could look very official right now
and this was the finished look I think I
look pretty legit I think it looks much
better than it did yesterday and I also
did clips you could see I totally like
transform this thing and this like this
just beginning you guys I'm told you can
get better
I'm already knowing this and so yeah I
think that's like this video please give
it thumbs up if you don't I'm sorry but
I mean it's already posted so I can't
really do much about it now I know see
you in my next video I'm so goofy right
now I don't know why but I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
