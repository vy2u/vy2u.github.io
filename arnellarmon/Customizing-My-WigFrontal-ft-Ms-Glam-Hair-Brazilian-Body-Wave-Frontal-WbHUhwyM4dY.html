how I laid this wig it is beautiful um
all the hair details and everything will
tin the title but it'll also be down
below and I'm gonna give my little
review during the video I learned that
it's better to do the reviews during the
video versus in the beginning so I'm
just for like a beginning a lot talking
and I know you guys are here for what
the title says and you guys wanna see
what I'm about about that light I really
like this um but um yeah I really hope
that I'm in focus during this whole
video because I have my camera on
autofocus and autofocus is kind of
annoying so if I cut out some parts
because without walls editing it I've
seen it as a little blurry so I'm sorry
um but I'll make sure keep in everything
you need to see and that's about it up
in this advanced video if you do give it
a thumbs up and subscribe and I'll see
you guys in my next one
first we need to braid our hair I look
kind of crazy I just straighten my hair
and yeah I got to braid it because okay
when I usually my wigs at first I was
just yelling down my hair but recently
okay I pulled out some of my hair in the
front if you look very closely I look a
little scab and it's all red because
I've been using lace tape and I've been
removing it the wrong way anyways my
hair's been in shambles okay so I was
like dang I need some castor oil and
stuff tell me grow my hair back but you
can't really put that in your hair when
it's a whole bunch of gel in it so I
pretty much like I've been just braiding
my hair down so I'm able to like put oil
on my scalp and all that good stuff so I
can grow back so yeah that's I'm
braiding it that was a long story just
to let you guys know that I'm braiding
my hair all right and now I'm not the
best braider but the end of the day
you're not gonna even see these braids
well you will if you're watching the
video but you're not gonna see the
butter my wig so it doesn't matter if
they're sloppy okay
as long as your hair is laying flat that
is all you want to do
samms could do one more braid on camera
and then I'm going to the rest
off-camera I just want to show you guys
that I can braid a little bit too yeah
it's pretty simple okay and I really
sped it up so yeah if you don't watch
the spike toy skip it but it's going
pretty fast
so my arms are totally hurting after
braiding which is why I don't do this
cuz I'm Malini but here it is I finished
my braids they look pretty cool I mean
they were gonna do what they need to do
all right so why don't I my hair is my
uncle Coxon I hope I'm using the right
word I just put an old jar I mixed
castor oil argan oil coconut oil sweet
almond oil yeah those four oils and I'm
just gonna be using on my hair try see
if it helps grow it out I mean if it
works it works and I'll let you guys
know because best believe I took some
before pictures but yeah I'm just quick
you guys see where my scalp is red
that's what happens when you remove lace
tape the wrong way anyways now I need to
sew an elastic band onto my wig why just
do is measure it from one ear to the
other and I tightened the elastic band
and then I loosen it just a little bit
so that way the elastic band isn't too
tight and then I just cut it off now I
want to show you guys how I sewed it on
but it was so hard I promise you I
really did try doing the video but I
mean yeah I just yeah I tried all I do
yeah my closure looks crazy actually
that black hair dye on it I'm in
shambles the white stuff on my wig cap
is for my styrofoam head no it's not
lice or anything crazy anyways I just so
the last bag one end of the frontal and
then I sewed it on the other in pretty
simple I'll do D tutorial on that
eventually when I get a better tripod so
please I'm sorry guys just yeah so did
lassic band on then I put that thing on
and it was very very snug like I almost
saw it on clips in the front but I
didn't have to do that because elastic
band was perfect
yeah now I'm just doing some little just
adjust ease and trying to figure out
what to do my life I'm brushing my edges
it it looks like I have none but you
know you guys know that's not true
oh yeah I kind of don't have any but
yeah yeah we're gonna see what I'm so
goofy I'm gonna cry
anyways anyways we're about to try to
figure out how to make this wig look
good
so I'm trying to figure out where will
my part first I'm like mmm middle part
and then I was like you know not here
for it yeah I was like no I was like hmm
side part haha we'll wait this is
totally not even fun because you guys
already know the kind of part I'm gonna
have basically beginning the video but
yeah I figured out what I what I want to
do my part I didn't do it on this side
I'm doing the other side cuz like yeah
that just looks weird looks off so I end
up going to the other side and I was
like yeah I like it so yeah you guys
already know the deal
now you want to get some tweezers
preferably really really good ones
unless this your first time doing this
it's actually okay to used old tweezers
on your first time that way you don't
over plug but if you're feeling
confident get some really good tweezers
and you're just gonna pluck your life
away you're gonna pluck all the knots
where you want your part to be like I'm
doing right now and like Midway you're
going to part to make sure you really
get all the hairs you know just watch
what I'm doing you know you just wanna
keep plucking and plucking and plucking
by the way this closure is really really
easy to deal with the hair is from miss
glam hair as the title let's talk about
a little bit now if you just follow me
on snapchat I got sent here for this
other company which I still have yet to
reveal the name because I was like oh my
god dildo be in shambles um ever since
I've got that freaking hair my like hair
reviewing skills are like mad crazy
because I really really probably pay
attention to everything first thing I
notice about his hair the bundles the
wefts beautiful they were like they
weren't thick they were like single
wefted the Webster they're constructed
very very nicely the last hair I got man
the webs there are like horrible
absolutely horrible paws my review I'm
doing is taking my finger and stick it
underneath the closures like see what
I'm doing alright play review time as I
was saying the last hair got saying I
had a really bad experience of the web
so the first thing I did was look at the
left and I was impressed the wig was
super easy to make the webs since I was
single web did they laid very very flat
onto the wig which I prefer who wants a
bulky wig not me the only thing I did I
messed up while making the wig I laid
the front toe a little too far back on
the dome cap so yeah oh my god Kerry and
I cut off too much lace from the front
tool so if it looks kind of off it's not
the front tools fault or the hair's
fault it's my Fox I messed up on the wig
I had to make it twice but you know what
I made it work so anyways now I'm gonna
take concealer after I'm done plucking
the closure and I place on the closure
now I did a little messily word ever I'm
gonna fix it okay don't do that okay be
patient I was just kind of in a rush
because it was very hot in my room I
want to hear
didn't be done so I turn on my fan it's
like 90 degrees probably exaggerating is
probably 85 but still it was pretty hot
topic concealer on and then I put a
powder on top looks like like I say
looks a little too pale sometime then
I'm a tan fella so I like to put the
powder on top just to kind of like make
it more my color
now you're going to want to get black
shadow or whatever hair color your hair
is and you're in a brush and then you're
going to Cana extend your hairline I
guess you could say I'm putting powder
where I feel like my hair looks kind of
bald and empty you just want to fill in
some spaces okay just watch what I'm
doing it's better to watch it than to
have me explain it because I really
don't know how to explain it but that's
what I'm doing
there's a little trick when you're
putting powder on sometimes it looks
powdery because it's powder so get a
toothbrush kind of brushed out and I
kind of brushed it into your hair it
makes it look less powdery that's how I
learned why doing this video I mean I've
done it before but it made a huge
difference so now I'm in my flat iron
I'm just going to flatten my bangs and
make this look more decent and then I'll
be right back
you
you
and so now I'm laying my edge a little
bit you know try and get these things
intact but you know what I'm not even
done you guys are probably thinking wow
that looks kind of good but I'm not even
finished this is even the half of it it
is the half of it I have like two more
things to do but I need candy
I need something it called me down wait
Kenny doesn't got me down anyways now
you're gonna get a lash glue preferably
one you do not care about because you
don't want like your last lids using
your eyes in your hair I don't know if
something about that just doesn't seem
right to me so I use the glue that I
don't really care about and you put it
on and then you place the closure
frontal lace on that and you get comb
and you press down and you mold that to
your scalp now the reason why lash glue
works is because it's not as strongest
lace glue so it doesn't damage your hair
but it's perfect enough to lay it okay
better do that I just go back over that
place a little more concealer and then
I'm gonna keep getting my comb or
whatever type of thing you have to fit
in between your part I'm using other I
think I use a brush I use a little brush
I'm just laying that flat and pressing
it down as much as I can about hurting
myself to make sure the glue is like
really dry and it's laid on my scalp now
now I'm going to get another little
eyebrow brush angled brush get more
black powder I'm going to kinda like
customize the line so I felt like my
part was a little too wide so what I do
is I get black shadow and I go in there
I kind of make it look look smaller
because I like the smaller part the less
attention it attracts you know you guys
have seen those parts where like dude
I'm just a bigger part you know what I
mean like I don't want that okay so I go
and I make it a little smaller and yeah
so that's what I'm doing
but now I'm gonna take this firm hold
spritz like $1 $49 I'm dollar store the
views play store and I spray over the
clothes and I get my hair serum and I
put that over where my hair is still
it's hair serum I just brush out make
sure it's laying really flat and that
I'm going to take my headscarf and place
that around my head and leave it on for
a few minutes then the big reveal is
going to come
yeah I kept my headscarf on for a few
minutes it made my ears read because
it's way too tight make sure you don't
do that to your little ears
see how red they are but yeah I took it
off now I'm just brushing the hair you
know making sure it looks how I want to
look the crease thing is I think it
looks pretty good
the only thing I'll say is that my part
looks lighter on camera but a person I
promised you I wouldn't lie to you it
looks amazing
so yeah this is this is it this is the
video I hope you guys liked it if you
