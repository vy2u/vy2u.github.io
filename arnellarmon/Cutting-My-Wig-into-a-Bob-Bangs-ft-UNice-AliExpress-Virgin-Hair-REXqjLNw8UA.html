I already have my little star cap on it
looks like a different colors I have eye
shadow in the front of it if you're
wondering so umm yeah I made this wig
out of hair from you nice version here
I'll talk about the hair little in the
video now I did diet I hate this color
and I'm going to diet a brighter green
which you have to see probably my next
video because I mean I love how the wig
came out I even worn la if you follow me
on snapchat you see the wig I'm talking
about but the green the dye use it from
this box by from Walmart and it sucked
and the thing is it was supposed to be
blue I'm just insert a picture of the
Box die right here that's the color
supposed to be and I got this color it's
like booboo green okay like out of a
know the front car is like a lighter
green in the back it just it was totally
a fail but somehow in a blue key Nokia
thin so that's the only reason I'm
posting this video but don't worry I'm
gonna fix the dye I just yeah I did I
film this video pray like four days ago
before I went to LA and when I was in a
layout so camera edit when I get out
there but I got out there like okay I'm
kind of busy so that's why I'm just not
posting it Benny wait I'm just
sectioning off the section where I want
to make bangs that's the only thing I
knew in this video is that I want to do
bangs other than that I had no idea what
kind of style I want to do I just not
want a bang so I'm just sectioning that
off oh I wanted to do wand curls now at
the end of the video I end up straining
the hair however I decided to keep this
part in because I was so impressed by
how easy this hair was to do now here's
why I say that use it when you want curl
hair curl hair for that matter you can't
immediately go back and straighten it or
else I'll burn or it just won't get
straight you guys want I mean have you
ever curled hair then well you're like
okay wait I want it straight and then
when you want to go straighten it was
just wavy when it gets straight I one
curled this hair and then later like
probably 10 minutes later and not even
that I decided straighten it and it
straighten like like it never Duan curl
it was awesome because I usually when I
want curl hair and I hate it I can't do
anything about it have to like deal with
it for like a day - the wand curls have
dropped but I was able to immediately
strain this afterwards so I mean the one
curls look kind of cool but after item
straining my bangs so like that I just
didn't like how they look it looked too
crazy wild and princess ish for me so I
want coat the bang part because at the
time I want to do like
curly hair with curly bangs but I mean
you guys have to watch a video I was so
confused and not know what I wanted to
do I just know that I want to play with
his hair now this hair it's Malaysian
hair and I'm used to getting Brazilian
hair when I first got his hair I didn't
really like only because like Malaysian
hair is a little more silkier and it's
like thinner than Brazilian hair and
I'll dope that I mean imitates my
natural hair texture more I'm so used to
Brazilian hair that the hair felt felt
weird at first until I wore it I styled
it and I really really like because it's
so easy to do it's very easy to manage
super easy to manage like I don't know I
don't know anyways Here I am tweezing my
bangs now here's why I do this I thought
we needed bangs when you're wearing a
weave or wig there bounce look fake it's
just something about bangs on wigs and
weaves it just doesn't look natural but
if you tweeze you know the part where
the bangs are you not only like thin out
that section so the bangs like flatter
but you show more of the scalp
quote-unquote you know what I mean so
it's like I like the more scalp you
could see the more real it looks no you
won't look bald well at least I don't
they look long but it just looks more
realistic to me so I'm just tweezing
that area to just to kind of like lower
the density
by the way the light is gonna change
along this video but it's because I'm
filming by a window now and although
usually it's okay on this particular
date this particular day it was raining
you guys know how it's raining but it
stops raining how like it's like too
dark you know I don't explain it it just
it was really affecting my light I'm
sorry but it shouldn't be too
distracting I'm just trying to explain
why it's doing that
but yeah and this prior to side to
strain my bangs all I guess I just felt
like they look weird curly you see how
easy is straighten it like I was totally
tripping out from that because usually
when you co hair it's really really
really not easy straining afterwards
like try and you'll see you're talking
about it's the most annoying thing ever
so I decided to strain my bangs I liked
it much more you know I almost kept this
style but then I felt like I was like on
my way to my quinceanera and I mean I'm
not 15 so I end up changing it
you
yeah I just like I keep going back and
forth my Bane's I want to be perfect so
you know just go back and forth make
sure they're right but I really enjoyed
working with this hair like I can't wait
to diet a darker green because that's
one way to do I have to dine everything
I'm gonna like it way more because I
mean the only thing I don't like that
this hair is the color and that's the
box dyes fault not mine because I
totally follow the directions but yeah
once I got a darker green I fuck it to
me like one of my go-to wigs so I really
like wigs with bangs only because it's
it's less maintenance because you don't
really have to worry about your part if
that makes sense like usually with a
middle part I party and make sure Linda
gets you all all this stuff but la I
love this wigs I kept just throwing on
kind of make its bangs I have to do
anything and the hair super easy to do I
had to like go over and bump it really
fast and I was good I'll insert a
picture right here so yeah I just the
hair was really easy to manage so in
this part I decided thin out the mains
even more with tweezers
that'll part them into two sections i'ma
just keep thinning them out because I
felt like they look too bingi you know I
feel like my natural hair because this
hair texture is close to my natural hair
my neck she has a little thinner than
this so I thought that if I thin out the
bangs it would just look much more
natural what you did you guys would
totally see that I just yeah my hair is
much more thinner so I'm just tweezing
until I get the did see that I want
I like this style but I thought I look
like a mom and so this one decide to
straighten the hair I was so indecisive
and I was kind of getting mad too
because this is the day I had to drive
to LA at that night and I was like dude
like I have to finish this have to go
pack soon so I was just like all over
the place and I was really annoyed
because I do not like doing that but you
guys see how see how it strains like
immediately I go back over it again
because it's like out of habit I used to
go over here twice so if you see me do
it twice it sucks I need to do it
because like it's habit but you see how
after just one run with the flatter it's
back to being straight like that was
crazy to me because I mean I don't as
just don't know if anyone else has
experienced this but usually when you
curl hair you can not strain it unless
you wait or unless you've wash it and
just refresh it or else it smells really
burnt you know I I mean I've been doing
it for a long time and that's usually
happens but it did smell burnt at all I
know it was just it was a breeze like at
that moment I knew that I was blessed
and I just yeah it looks so nice and
silky and just pretty but all the hair
that was cutting was gay my shirred you
have to see it in the video I'm gonna
take my shirt off and change it cuz I
was going crazy but the hair so
manageable probably the most manageable
hair I've ever dealt with
like up to this point but that dye job
is just it's just killing me but I'm
sorry
so I strain the other side that I only
took like five minutes
honestly in total took like timís
strain the whole entire thing and this
one I want to cut a little bit not first
I just copped the ends because I felt
like after bleaching them I kind of like
damaged them a little bit I mean I
could've dealt with them by 20 cop ins
that is just like to cut off a little
more to make it like just like a I don't
know would you call this like medium
with hair I don't know I want to cut off
a little more but then I thought that
this length looked awkward and I was
like and do you want to keep it KB keep
ponytail and I was like no no no or nail
be difficult so I decided to just chop
it off and make like a little bob so it
was like bangs with bob it was totally
like Rihanna SH and my snapchat liked it
so I was like yeah we bout to do that
and so yeah I'm just gonna show you guys
cut like half of
the hair and then I'll be back when the
other side is done it's pretty easy to
do
oh I finished that side when it cut the
other side this one I'm looking like it
looks so cute i'ma turn around so you
can see the back now part of the back
isn't straight in so it kind of looks
weird but it's super even for the most
part like I did a pretty good job for
not having a mirror behind me so giving
my props but yeah this is the finished
look I really love it I'm just going to
let fix the die and you gotta see it in
my next video hope you guys enjoyed this
video and you enjoy all the hair if it
hasn't been doing so I know you guys
like those a lot I'll be posting
consistently again I just I took a break
cause in a late but I'm back but yeah
anyways I'll see you guys in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
