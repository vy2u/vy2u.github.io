you're gonna need a piece of fabric like
I have right here there need some spray
adhesive don't worry all the links will
be below so first I'm gonna take this
big chunky glitter I kind of zoomed in
so you guys see what it looks like it
kind of just has like a lot of different
color reflex now this makes every
backdrop look pretty well so far from
what I've done it makes every background
look pretty so I use it every single
backdrop I make and I'm just going to
spray the adhesive onto the fabric and
then sprinkle it all over now first I
wasn't sure how I was going to get what
I was doing in the camera so I'm like
pressing the glitter on and I even spray
it on the part that's like laying on the
wall I press it on that way honestly all
you have to do is just you could just
lay it on the ground and sprinkle all
the glitter all at once it just it was
kind of difficult um in this video
because I've never done DIY before so I
really did not know how to angle the
camera or how to do it but I'll get
better with time that's like my first
DIY so just bear with me
so you see how the glitter kind of like
reflex different colors when it hits
certain lights that's why I like this
glitter now all the stuff I got is from
Walmart so I'll link everything below
and the piece of fabric I got sauce from
mom or I think I only paid like 297 for
one yard and so based on the overall
backdrop look you want to go for you
want to get that color fabric this color
is like a light Foresti green because I
want to happen sort of a green theme to
the backdrop so that's why I chose this
one but you could honestly do this on
any color fabric you know all look good
wait I plan on making more backdrops I
mean I just started making my own
backdrop so I'm not an expert at it just
yet but I want to do backdrops where
they have actual designs if you guys
noted me like maybe like cheetah print
with glitter I'm gonna figure out a way
to do it and just believe I will show
you guys but I'm just playing out there
that I'm totally gonna do it so yeah I
just keep sprinkle the glitter on until
I get to you the very edge of the piece
of the fabric and then I switch glitters
which I'll do in one second
I so taking this smaller purple litter
now the reason why I do the big litter
first before the smaller glitters
because because the glitter the big
litter is big it needs more space to
stick onto the fabric so if you put the
big litter first and then the smaller
piece so glitter the smaller pieces of
glitter will have an easier time fitting
into the crevices of the oh my god I'm
making sense oh god I really do not know
explain I'm trying to say just do big
glitter first and smaller glitter second
so I kind of spread this part up I
literally do the same exact thing as I
did with the big litter now I'm going to
take these sequins
well after I strain at the backdrop of
course have to lay flat now time for
sequins I'm taking this foresty green
sequins purple sequins and then the
sequins I have and they look white but
they're pretty much the same color as
the thick glitter I use to begin with
and I put down the bottle of the empty
glitter bottle and then I'm going to
shake it all to mix together that way
when I pour it and I sprinkle it it's
like not so structured it's like a
little bit of every single color if that
makes sense
by the way don't do this one it's super
windy um I don't even know what I was
thinking when it's windy makes it so
annoying and difficult the backdrops
wants to fly everywhere but anyways
after I get done with this I'd pretty
much pick up the backdrop and I shake it
to kind of like get off the excess
sequins and glitter so it's not all over
my house now it's time to see how the
batch op looks with my light oh my god
it's excited my lights are on but I'm
gonna see how it looks when I get in
focus now you guys I was so excited over
this because you literally never know
how the backdrops gonna look until
you're in focus and it's blurred because
that's when you can see all the reflex
of the colors you can see a little bit
of the purple mainly green because
that's the fabric color but it looks so
good I literally cannot wait to make my
next one the fact that all I do is throw
some glitter together like watch when I
really get into it and I start like
doing detail that stuff like you guys
alright ready so you know I danced
around a little bit I kind of zoomed the
lens out to see how cool I even look
zoomed out I was impressed I was ok I
want to play a few products into this
camera to see this is still look cool
still look cool this would be great for
product shots
um but yeah anyways that is the end of
the video I hope you guys found this
easy if you didn't I don't know how
because it's just glitter and fabric but
yeah if you found this video helpful and
you liked it give it a thumbs up please
subscribe and I'll see you guys in my
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
